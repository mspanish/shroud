I am somewhat shocked and dismayed at all the actions and reasons that some folks are going through trying to denigrate God’s gift to us. It was written in pre-Christian era documents what was going to take place, the Lord knew what was ahead of him in his human body when he was praying in the garden and it came to pass.  The Shroud is as a quick but deep reminder that it did in fact take place.\n\n","date":"April 14, 2014 at 3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/14/if-the-shroud-is-a-forgery-where-are-its-precedents-2/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-99269","author":"ekmcmahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"If the shroud is a forgery, where are its precedents?","post":"Artistic context is certainly an important factor, and I would very much like to find some. That is why I occasionally mention the possibiity that the shroud may have started life as an altar cloth or reredos or epitaphios, from Eastern Europe (possibly North-Eastern Europe), rather than a French painting. No success yet, but absence of evidence is not (not yet, I claim) evidence of absence.

Daniel Scavone suggests it may be 14th-15th century which of course post-dates 1355.  However apparently it comes from a Mt Athos monastery, and he suggests that it is therefore of Greek origin “looking back” rather than being influenced by the Lirey showings.  The cloth clearly shows a representation of the herring-bone twill, extensive flagellation marks, and of course crossed hands over the loins. It is evident just from the chest wound that the Shroud is itself a mirror image and so we see it as if the right hand is over the left, rather than the actuality of it being left over right. The epitaphioi that I looked at all seem to show the right hand over the left, so they do seem modeled on the Shroud image.  Wiki says that the oldest known epitaphios is one at Venice which is thought to date from ~1200. Epitaphioi are essentially an Orthodox practice, so that the oldest being at Venice is a little surprising. Perhaps the returning crusaders brought it as a trophy from Constantinople after they’d sacked it in 1204!!?? I wouldn’t bet on Hugh’s chances of finding a north-east European origin for the genre, no matter how much time he takes to search for it.\n\n","date":"April 14, 2014 at 8:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/14/if-the-shroud-is-a-forgery-where-are-its-precedents-2/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-99354","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"If the shroud is a forgery, where are its precedents?","post":"Daveb, Just curious, I know you do a good job researching stuff.

In other words the cloths show pictures of shrouds, rather than acting as the shroud themselves, and on the picture of the shroud is a picture of Christ, which misses the point. I understand that the antimension of the Orthodox priest, and perhaps the strachitsa, are also representations of the shroud, but in these cases the ‘body’ they wrap is not a picture of Christ but the Chalice of the Eucharist. However all the photos of these I’ve seen are again pictures of entombment scenes rather than representations of shrouds themselves. Although this is context of a sort, it does not immediately make me think that our Shroud is an obvious development of this artistic style.\n\n","date":"April 15, 2014 at 2:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/14/if-the-shroud-is-a-forgery-where-are-its-precedents-2/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-99489","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"If the shroud is a forgery, where are its precedents?","post":"Give it time Hugh, and with any amount of luck and God’s grace it might dawn on you that perhaps the Shroud is not derivative, but a unique original.
