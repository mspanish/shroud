One switches on electrical power to heat the element, and at the same time applies suction to the collecting flask. The aim is to suck off any liquid exudate as soon as it is formed which will then pass through the pores of the sintered disc, while solids remain on top.\nThe desired outcome? To be able to draw off a pale yellow(?) liquid – probably  containing some of the vegetable oil – but one which will darken on reheating, to a greater extent than a vegetable oil control). \nNow if that effect can be produced (?) then the next step is to characterize the thermochemical species in the initial filtrate/aspirate that contain additional substances from Maillard reactions between protein and carbohydrates, possibly the veg, oil too.

Tests on the Shroud itself are clearly discounted, unless one were able to suggest a critical one that could be done non-invasively (and even then, one does not expect the Turin custodians to lay out a welcome mat).\nNope, what’s needed in the first instance is a refinement of the model system that reveals exactly what one is dealing with – physically and chemically – in the high temperature Maillard reaction proposed.\nAn essential first step is to ELIMINATE LINEN from the experimental system, since the hypothesis makes no claim for an involvement of linen components – the spotlight being on what happens to the flour/oil imprinting medium when heated, with the suggestion that the crucial first step is production of a liquid exudate that can then seep into linen fibres. In chemical terms, linen is being seen as a passive bystander, serving merely to act as a ‘blotting paper’ for a yellow or brown LIQUIFIED thermal cocktail.\nThe difficulty is that the proposed exudate contains the precursors of high molecular weight Maillard condensation products (“melanoidins”).  Once those high molecular resin-like products form they are then difficult if not impossible to analyse and characterize. Might it be possible to draw off the thermal cocktail at the instant of formation, maybe cooling and arresting the process of condensation (that’s chemical condensation, akin to polymerization), allowing the latter to be studied at leisure under lab conditions, maybe by re-applying heat?

I’ll post a photograph in a day or two. For now, a stop press summary will have to suffice. If one blocks the linear channels between the fibres of linen with a water-insoluble material, one can still get the initial bold imprint of roasted flour/oil in a hot oven, but one no longer gets the resistant ghost image that remains after washing (see this site’s banner).That supports my contention that the ghost image is the result of a LIQUID exudate from the thermal reaction.\nOne small modification of technique was required. Initially I thought I could simply soak the linen in sodium silicate (water glass) solution instead of plain water before imprinting, and rely on the heat in the oven turning the silicate solution to solid glass before the browning of the flour/oil imprint. That didn’t work – the sodium silicate as supplied is highly alkaline, which makes the entire linen quickly go dark brown (probably due to facilitation of Maillard reactions at  strongly alkaline pH).\nAn alternative ploy was used: The linen was first soaked in sodium silicate solution, then dilute sulphuric acid dripped in to neutralise the alkali. As the mixture approaches neutrality (pH7) one sees a flocculent precipitate of hydrated silica gel, aka silicic acid. The latter presumably forms in situ between the narrow channels of the fibres, effectively clogging them up, so the same end result is achieved, albeit by a different mechanism, chemical rather than thermal.\nThis latest finding does not prove conclusively that the final ghost imprint is the result of liquid migration, but offers in my view strong experimental support, especially as the outcome of the experiment was the fulfilment of a prediction based on my unique ‘capillary liquid migration’ model.\n","date":"November 20, 2016 at 5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-8082","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)","post":"Double glazing is a con.

Maybe, but I expect you’ve heard of medieval castles being defended against beseigers with a nasty addition called a “murder hole”.\nFrom wiki (my bolding):\nA murder hole or meurtrière is a hole in the ceiling of a gateway or passageway in a fortification through which the defenders could fire, throw or pour harmful substances or objects, such as rocks, arrows, scalding water, hot sand, quicklime, tar, or boiling oil, down on attackers.\nSo they were no strangers to hot oil. But what about the logistics? You can’t get the oil up to temperature in minutes, but would not want to keep it either at boiling point purely on the offchance that the enemy suddenly arrives on the doorstep with battering rams etc. So one compromises. right – one keeps the oil hot, needing just a few extra minutes to get it up to boiling point. But how do you know when it’s hot enough, mercury thermometers not having been invented?\nHow about a crude ‘thermometer’ made by imprinting flour paste onto linen, and leaving to dry? One then heats up one’s oil from cold as soon as an enemy presence is detected, testing at intervals  with flour-imprinted strips of the linen. When the imprint turns a golden-brown quickly, one knows the oil is up to temperature, but not boiling.\nOK, so it’s a long shot, but might this primitive thermometer technology have implanted the idea of imprinting an image onto linen with flour (paste, powder, oil/powder etc) and then developing the image with hot oil?\nI’m turning my thought right now  to the tests needed in a STURP Mk2 to confirm the presence (or absence) of a flour/oil derived ghost image.

Colour development (off white  flour to yellow or brown imprint ) was obtained by thermal means, i.e. gentle closely-observed roasting of the imprinted linen in an oven or similar, with a final washing step with soap and water to remove all encrusted material, leaving only a faint discoloration as ‘contact imprint’.\nThe unexpected feature of the model is the attribution of the image to a hot LIQUID exudate from the roasting flour/oil imprint into the fabric’s most superficial fibres. It is the capillary uptake of that exudate by linen fibres that accounts for the peculiar microscopic properties, notably the so-called half-tone effect and the discontinuities.\n It may well be that the aim was to simulate an ancient sweat imprint of an entire body – front, back but not sides –  and to do so by a means that makes heated flour “sweat” a thermal cocktail of yellow or brown sugar-protein Maillard compounds and other resinous , water-insoluble high molecular weight reaction -products into the superficial fibres of the fabric. The artisans may or may not have realized that the imprinting agent was a liquid at oven temperatures. All that mattered was the final faint imprint, one that would appear to have been accidentally, indeed, fortuitously acquired by the linen, or at any rate the most superficial fibres thereof. No, not a painting, which would have been instantly recognizable as such, but a faint IMPRINT (a negative, tone-reversed image that is eerily comparable to a modern photographic negative, but which is NOT a photograph, being an image formed by physical contact only (no imaging across air gaps, no matter how small) with no role for radiant energy.  \nSummary\nThose artisans wanted to create an image that could be mistaken for an ancient sweat imprint onto an enveloping up-and-over sheet of linen – essentially a rival attraction to the face-only Veil of Veronica imprint, and one moreover with biblical authority (Joseph of Arimathea narrative). They succeeded, beyond their wildest dreams. How? By first taking an imprint of a body or effigy thereof onto moistened linen using white flour and a light smear of vegetable oil, and then developing that imprint in a hot oven at temperatures that caused the imprint to ‘sweat’ a yellowish-brown liquid into the superficial fibres of the cloth.\nIn other words, a cold sweat from the crucified Jesus was simulated by generating a hot ‘sweat’ from an imprint of a then ‘modern man’, obtained using two staple food  items from a medieval kitchen. No fancy or anachronistic technology was needed – merely a knowledge of what happens when bread-making and other flour doughs etc are roasted and/or fried at high temperature (though not so high as to materially change the linen fibres per se, the latter being chemically more resistant to browning than the carbohydrates and proteins of white flour).\nColin Berry MSc, PhD\nBiomedical scientist (retired)\nHerts, UK.\n5th November 2016\n","date":"November 5, 2016 at 11:02 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-8042","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)","post":"Am still trying to improve estimates of the number of fibres in a typical linen thread – a modern one, needless to say-   and with a new ‘electrostatic sticky tape’ procedure (see new addition to end of this posting) am willing to concede there may be as many as 200 or more per thread, as claimed for the TS.\nSo the science proceeds in its own plodding though I hope  methodical and scientific manner (as scientific as possible without access, say, to an electron microscope etc that would simplify the task of counting fibres!).\nAs for the politics and media, my thoughts have sadly crystallized there. One can quickly dispense with the second – my researches and the manner in which they are reported are not directed to the mass media, except for  my generally jaundiced views of media reporting of this or that latest alleged ‘breakthrough’ in Shroud so-called science.They are directed to the world of ideas, for which the internet might be considered ideally-suited (though that’s sadly not proved to be the case – even when Dan Porter’s now extinct shroudstory blog site was providing updates on a daily and occasionally even hourly basis!).\nI shan’t mince my words. “Sindonology”, even when reported in peer-reviewed journals, is for the most part fake scholarship. In genuine scholarship, one seeks out all new ideas, not just those  that have appeared in print, but ones that may have been voiced at workshops, symposia etc and dare one say even the internet. One addresses them fairly and squarely, one gives sources in one’s bibliography wherever possible. What one doesn’t do is attenmpt to quickly diss them, as happened with monotonous frequency to this blogger’s initial forays into thermal imaging technology in early 2012 (the “scorch hypothesis”) with one sindonological big beast after another appearing on the Porter site to sneer, deride, dismiss, insult… That idea evolved gradually from being a one-step imaging using hot metal bas relief to two-step imaging using the flour/oil/hot oven imprinting method. Some of the criticism levelled against the first was taken seriously, but the model not immediately abandoned, given the valuable insights it provided into the properties of contact imprints, 3D responses in the appriopriate modern software especially. But as soon as it evolved into the two-step methodology using real human flesh as template, dispensing with hot metal, all reported in real time on the Porter site, the shutters came down. Sindonology did not want to know (Thibault Heimburger and David Goulet excepted, although the first of those has now also gone strangely silent). I cannot recall seeing a single reference to the flour/oil model anywhere in the sindonological literature the 15 months or more since it was first unveiled. Seek (Google) and ye shall not find!\nA failure to acknowledge new thinking, a freezing out, is as I say not genuine scholarship. It is a characteristic of propaganda, of fake scholarship. One sees it in its most flagrant form on the Stephen E.Jones site, a crass example if ever there was of religious bigotry.(He pops up from time to time to announce that I am still “permanently banned” from his site. It’s always “me” that is referred to, never the ideas…\nHere’s a word of adbvice to sindonology. Take another look at the grounds on which you have rejected contact imprinting. Note the manner in which you have begged the question by referring to what is or is not expected if a sheet of linen is or were to be draped loosely over a corpse, the latter recumbent on a 1st century shelf in a rock tomb. Think instead of a medieval scenario, one where there is purposeful imprinting off a LIVE and COOPERATIVE human subject, with complete control by the imprinting team over what anatomical features are or are not to be captured in the final (thermal) imprint. Until you make that switch from your biased model to one that is open-minded and objective, I shall continue henceforth to accuse you of FAKE SCHOLARHIP, of attempting to blind and deceive your audience and/or readers with PSEUDOSCIENCE.  You are, to put it more colourfully, charlatans, dispensers of snake-oil  medicine. You have earned my disdain, and in some instances personal contempt – not that either is likely to bother you in the slightest – given the manner in which you have so assiduously cultivated the media to bypass me and genuine plodding mainstream science.\n","date":"November 4, 2016 at 8:01 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-8035","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)","post":"How about: “British scientist accuses believers in miraculous Shroud image of having the Resurrection confused with the Ascension”?\n","date":"November 3, 2016 at 9:26 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-8032","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)","post":"I suppose you need to be more sensationalistic in your headlines. i.e. “British scientist argues that the Shroud of Turin never wrapped the body of Jesus Christ.” Something like that, you have to get Jesus’ name in there to draw the Google eyeball.

Ouch. Propaganda, the crudest of crude pseudo-scientific propaganda… \nHave they never heard of contact imprints that mimic (after a fashion) photographic negatives?  Contact imprints (brass rubbings etc) were known and being  made CENTURIES before photographic negatives.

Yes, there you will see the shameless reinvention of a professional documenting PHOTOGRAPHER attached to the 1978 34-strong STURP team (largely self-selected) as a “scientist”. That’s the same “scientist” who jumped on me in early 2012, chiding me for not being aware that “all scorches fluoresce under uv light”. No, they don’t, and I doubt whether the photographer in question  has eever bothered to test experimental scorches as I have done, being content as he was to wheel out someone else’s observation that the charred edges of the 1532 BURN HOLES on the Shroud fluoresce red or orange under uv light (reminder – a full depth burn hole with charred edges is not a typical superficial scorch as might produce a faint image).\nKeep cranking that pro-authenticity handle, all you Shroudie propagandists, aided and abetted by the pliable Google search engine.

He’s simply asking whether anyone in the modern era (starting early 20th century) ever bothered to check!  Or has sindonology been content to accept without question the notion handed down through centuries that the TS is linen?  If so, that’s hardly scientific, is it? Scientists are not supposed to accept anything without question, “commonsense assumptions” etc included… But then, there’s an awful lot of shortcutting in sindonology that regrettably distinguishes it from methodical, objective unblinkered science….\nI’ve already given one reference that shows the acute difficulty of distinguishing between flax fibres in linen and those in hemp fabric (both being stem bast  fibres with those ‘dislocations’ that distinguish from cotton).\nSo I tried googling (shroud of turin hemp), and was truly amazed by what I found, right at the top of the list of returns. It was a paper delivered to a Shroud workshop in 2010 by one L.G. Thygesen (a Dane).

However, these two fibre types have similar dimensions and properties,  which in the author’s opinion justify the comparison. In a  recent publication, it was pointed out that the two species may not be separated from each other using light microscopy (ref).”\nAnd this one from the Conclusions no less:\n    “Analysis  of  the  dislocations in 20  flax  fibre segments from the Turin Shroud  indicated  that the dislocations in Turin Shroud flax fibres appear to be similar in amount, sizes and distances to dislocations in modern hemp fibres. Regarding dislocations there is thus no  indication that these fibres are different from other bast  fibres.”\nI resisted the temptation to insert sic after each of those mentions of Shroud “flax” fibres!\n","date":"October 31, 2016 at 10:47 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-8017","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)","post":"Wiener et al (Czech group) June 2003\nAbstract \nDifferentiating  flax  and  hemp  is  a  long-time analytical  problem,  which  is  becoming  more  and  more  relevant  with  the  wider  loading  of  bast  fibres.

The linen fibre still preserves the outermost layer of the supportive stem fibres of the phloem bundles, namely the primary cell wall (PCW). While it’s a bit difficult getting a precise figure for PCW thickness, it’s just one cell thick, and is reckoned to be considerably  thinner than the 400nm your contact cites. I’ve seen figures of approx a quarter that thickness. \nNow the PCW also has a distinctive chemical composition, having larger amounts of the more chemically reactive hemicelluloses with 5-membered rings (xylose, arabinose especially). So if one assumes that it’s the most superficial hemicelluloses of the linen fibre per se that become chemically modified and coloured,  all that’s needed to answer your contact is that image-formation specifically involves the PCW and not the chemically less reactive underlying layers (multi-layer secondary cell wall.\nBut who’s to say that it’s the linen fibre per se that is chemically modified? I expect you’re aware of the Rogers’ hypothesis, namely that the image was formed on a starch coating that in his pro-authenticity model was added at the stage of 1st century linen manufacture.\nI have a non-authenticity model  (14th century) that features white flour/vegetable oil as imprinting agent. The image appears when the the imprint is roasted in the oven, and is initially thick and crust-like. But on final washing with soap and water all that’s left is a faint, scarcely visible and presumably highly-superficial ghost image which I reckon is due to seepage of highly-coloured oily LIQUID from the coating into the fibres.

Attempts have been made to this day to exclude thermal processes, especially relevant in context of ‘appropriate’ medieval technology. How?  By reference to uv fluorescence. But they are not based on modern experimental data. They are based on the uv fluoresence of the charred edges of the 1532 burn holes, with claim that “all scorches fluorescence under uv”. Taking as one’s sole reference a centuries-old event involving fire, exceedingly high combustion or carbonization temperatures –  ones creating full thickness burns, not mere scorches – is pseudoscience.  Scorches incidentally are just one type of thermal  change.\nDetails  to come -watch this space.\n4. Rogers’ starch-coating theory:  good inasmuch as it considered the possibility of the image being an added coating, highly superficial,  instead of on the linen per se. But why did he stop at purified starch, and proceed to develop a theory as if starch were equivalent to – or easily transformable to – a reducing sugar? Answer: he cited Pliny, 1st century linen technology, betraying (intentionally or otherwise) a pro-authenticity bias that hitherto had been well-concealed. He should have considered a wider range of coatings, including those that could have been deployed in a medieval context.\nDetails to come. Watch this space.\n5.  The TS body image responds to computer software programs that map image density as height, ie. creating an imaginary z (vertical) dimension. So what? All imprints and indeed diagrams with no 3D history respond the same – it being a function of the software and the way it re-processes image density – NOT a tool for investigating supposed “encoded 3D information”.  Yup, starry-eyed  hyping – up of the so-called 3D properties of the TS, as if specific for the TS, with inappropriate refs to conventional photographs performing poorly – distortions etc – only to be expected due to lateral lighting, shadowing etc. (focus should be on imprints!).\nDetails to come.  Watch this space.\n6. The blood story. First on scene was the pathologist Robert Bucklin MD, publishing and proselytizing his pro-authenticity views way back in the 60s, long before STURP, using the terms “bloodstain” and “wound” interchangeably. NO! There is no evidence on the body image for wounds as distinct from blood, despite explicit claims to the contrary. It is entirely unscientific to describe a bloodstain as a “wound”, if there is no independent evidence in the body image for speared, flayed or punctured skin. Even the scourge marks are blood imprints ONLY!\nDetails to come.  Watch this space.\n7. Failure of STURP to provide convincing evidence for the existence of blood-derived porphyrins – an essential criteria for identifying the stains as derived from blood.  Atypical porphyrin spectra, coupled with claims the blood was “too red” were  attributed to presence of  ‘extraordinary levels of bilirubin’ with no hard evidence for the presence of ANY  bilirubin (which is photochemically unstable and unlikely to survive for months, far less centuries).  As with Rogers. the ‘bilirubin trauma’ hypothesis betrayed a pro-authenticity leaning, unbecoming surely of hands-on researchers willing to investigate (and exclude ) the painting hypothesis while failing to display appropriate scepticism elsewhere.\n“Blood-before-image’ claim, based on enzymic micro-spotting test was interesting,  possibly true, but questionable in the light of other data, notably the so-called half-tone effect which means that blood-coated fibres sampled with sticky-tape from’ image areas’ cannot be assumed to have been image-bearing fibres, as appears to have been the case. Yup, blind-spot territory …\nDetails to come. Watch this space.\n8. Returning to the body image (it being the basis of the “enigmatic” tag): there has been indecent haste to exclude contact-imprinting, based on image-intensity data that assumes linen draped loosely over a body, making limited contact.  We are quickly asked to consider imaging across air-gaps,  of “cloth-body” distance being critical, albeit with peculiar qualfications (max distance of separation not to exceed approx 4 cm for example). That model ‘begs the question’ i.e. assumes the very thing that is being tested, making for a circular argument. What if the cloth had NOT been draped loosely, as in a 1st century tomb, but pressed firmly against some body features and not others, with conscious control over which parts to imprint, what not.  (Consider selective application of imprinting medium also).\nDetails to come. Watch this space.\n9. The assumption that image formation occurred across air gaps, with exclusion of contact imprinting as the sole mechanism, has led to those “radiation” models, associated at least initially by STURP team leader John Jackson. with resort to biblical “resurrection” scenarios that permit a body and /or linen to merge in space (“collapsing cloth” theory”). That has no place in a scientific context, being impossible to put to an experimental test., being merely a highly-coloured interpretation, wishful-thinking some might think.\nDetails to come.  Watch this space.\n10. X-ray or gamma-ray imaging? Based on claims that the fingers are ‘too boney” or teeth are imaged, with failure to consider, far less to model experimentally, contact-imaging that might well produce such effects through providing something more resistant under the linen than soft tissue.\nDetails to come. Watch this space.\n11. Assumption that the TS represents a “burial shroud”, when the biblical record suggests otherwise (namely that Joseph of Arimathea’s’s linen was intended solely for dignified TRANSPORT of a bloodied, naked or near-naked man from cross to tomb, NOT as final burial shroud.\n See my late 2014 posting from this site for more details, including artistic representation, e.g:\n(Graphic) Here’s Joseph of Arimathea’s ‘clean linen’ being used as an improvised means of transport from cross to tomb, with no biblical evidence it was ever used, or intended to be used as final burial shroud. (Di Ciseri, 1883).\nSee also this posting from my specialist Shroud site with more artwork showing the Shroud being deployed in ‘transport mode’.\n(Graphic)\nResurrection scenarios for image formation are excluded in the transport-only model if J of A’s linen was replaced with ‘winding strips’ as suggested by the Gospel according to John. Instead, the focus should be on the possibility that the TS was an attempt to recreate what a sweat/blood imprint onto a transport shroud might look like 13 centuries later.\nDetails to come. Watch this space.\n12.Failure to give due consideration or even acknowledge that the TS body  image may have been an attempt to simulate a sweat imprint, with bloodstains alone used to implicate a  particular  and highly revered crucified body , i.e. that of Jesus of Nazareth, with crown of thorns (missing), lance wound, nails wounds etc. (See previous ref to blood that serves as proxy for “wounds” that are otherwise absent from body image).\nDetails to come. Watch this space.\n13. Failure to acknowledge the resources at the disposal of Geoffroi de Charny (France’s King John the Good’s favourite, both when younger as fellow 100 Year’s War combatants and later at the Royal Court ), the king having financially assisted his knight/comrade-in-arms  in founding and staffing a so-called private chapel (5 -6 staff!). Those hired clerics may well have been the initiators, possibly even artisans, who originated the idea/project to recreate J of A’s transport linen with a simulated sweat/blood imprint. Sindonology rarely considers the crucial  and arguably historical role of G de C and his wife, later widow, despite both their individual coats-of-arms appearing on that Lirey pilgrim’s souvenir badge (Cluny Museum)  indicating a determined effort to attract pilgrims from far and wide ,the latter paying handsomely no doubt for the indulgences etc to be had at the oh-so-fashionable “Shroud”  shrine, a rival and closer attraction than the then extant ‘Veil of Veronica’.\nDetails to come.  Watch this space.\n14. Italy’s Govt. supported ENEA research institute (team-leader Paolo Di Lazzaro): uv laser modelling. No image – mere superficial coloration only. No detailed consideration of likely chromophore – merely refs to cellulose as the target, despite that carbohydrate  consisting entirely of stable C- C, C-O  and O-H single bonds – i.ie no C=C or other double bonds as is usually the case for molecules that are susceptible to chemical change resulting from absorption of energetic uv radiation.\nSure, the coloration may be superficial, but it’s wrong to assume that supernatural radiation is the only means of producing a superfical image, with laser pulses offered optimistically as a weak modern-day proxy  (the nearest man-made equivalent you understand).\nLet’s not mince our words – it was deplorable pseudoscience to make that suggestion, especially when accompanied by refs to philosophy, theology etc and being described as “scientists” in newspaper headlines when in fact the investigators were laser-technologists, said to be working after hours with their Govt-supplied hardware  to promote and proselytize their preferred take on scripture.\nSummary: \nThe major failure in this list, 14 points so far?  I would nominate that failure to consider the TS as a sweat imprint, whether as I believe simulated (14th century) or even ‘authentic’ of 1st century origin, there being a clear ambition to link the TS image with supernatural flash of radiation at the instant of biblical resurrection. See banner on Stephen E. Jones ‘blog’  (manifesto?) for the continuing attempt to make that link, based not on science but PSEUDOSCIENCE.\nSo where does one go to find the non-derailed still-on-track science, steadily chuffing along, making progress, month after month, year after year?

My reply: the project was newsworthy in a different respect, namely having been set up as possibly, indeed probably, the first time a research project has been pursued from start to finish via live reporting on the internet (some 350 postings to date since Dec 2011). The model has already been ‘peer-reviewed’ notably  here (e.g. Thibault Heimburger) and on my  sciencebuzz site, and on the now discontinued Dan Porter shroudstory blog.

It’s often struck me that there is little in the Gospels about the Shroud – if the image was as pronounced as it is today — or perhaps even more vivid. The burial linens might still have been kept as precious relics (the blood alone would make them very special). It’s not until later in the ‘historic’ record that we here more about an image not made with human hands. There are different theories about fires and poker holes – might the Shroud have been baked unintentionally at some later point – which led to the Maillard reaction image to become pronounced. Obviously, flour is not the material that cooked in this scenario, but perhaps other oils or substances used in the burial process. As you noted at some point, there’s almost no way currently to find evidence of a flour-base so I assume this would be the same with other similar substances.\nIf you don’t wish to entertain this 1st-century line of thinking, I understand. You’re ‘all in’ (to use a poker term) on this medieval model (for good reason) but it did strike me that aspects of it are transferable to the 1st century hypothesis.

Watch this space (yes, I’m allowed to add, subtract and otherwise edit my own comments!).\nBack again. What was the purpose of the first experiment? Answer: I wanted to know if it was really necesaary to heat to 200 degrees C or thereabouts to get a bold flour/oil image. Might a lower temperature, maybe for a longer time, suffice, with less risk of excessive yellowing or browning of the background linen. So I made a flour imprint of my hand, and placed in cold oven, heating to 150 degress C and holding the temperature there for 15 mins. The linen was removed, photographed, and thumb (labelled sample 1) cut off, and imprint returned to oven. The temperarure was then raised to 160 degrees, again for 15 mins, and the inspection/digit removal repeated. The final temperature (190 degrees C, 15 mins) ended with removal of the final digit (sample 5, small finger).\nResult: there was slight visible yellowing at 150C, and progressive intensification of colour at each 10 degrees rise in temp. But it was clear that the major factor determining final colour after 15 mins heating was the TEMPERATURE. One cannot expect to get a “190C colour” by heating at lower temperatures, even for prolonged periods. The colour at each temparature stabilizes, then remaining approximately the same. That fits with the idea, discussed in previous postings, that the colour is the result of Maillard reactions which are not only under kinetic but thermodynamic control as well (temperature being needed to make certain reactions “go”, over and above mere increases in rates of chemical reaction).\nBut if colour stabilizes at each chosen temperature, that has an important consequence. One might not need to have the linen suspended as a sheet in the oven to ensure even colour development. Maybe one could fold or roll it up. OK, the outer layers would heat up first and the flour/oil imprint acquire colour before the inner parts.  But if the colour then stabilized on the outer parts, it gives time for the inner parts to ‘catch up’ so to speak. So that was the reasoning that led to doing the second experiment, result shown on the right, one where the linen was folded and then rolled/scrolled up. Details to come. Watch this space.\nHere’s a photo of the scrolled linen in the oven – a neat and compact package.\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dsc01515.jpg?w=640&h=480\nFirst it was heated to 150C, and that temperature held for 15mins. It was then removed from the oven, unfolded, photographed, then returned for further heatings steps, each 10 degrees higher than the one before. Yes, the colour intensity increased stepwise as expected. The photo on the right is the appearance at the end of the sequence (190C max temperature). And very satisfactory it was too, indeed one of the best images ever obtained for my hand-imprinting, with no sign whatsoever of uneven colour distribution that might have been expected from being folded/rolled up.\nSo our medieval artisans could have used a modest size oven – or even open charcoal fire – for the ‘roasting’ procedure. They could have heated the linen package gradually, removing at intervals to open out the package, checking on progress, and continuing until they had the desired degree of colour development, assured of EVEN colour intensity, provided the heating was done gradually to ensure that all parts were exposed to the same temperature for an extended time period to allow for heat to penetrate to the interior.\n","date":"September 28, 2016 at 9:46 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-7864","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)","post":"Forgive me if I prime the Comments on this my most recent posting. There’s an issue that I wish to flag up, say what’s in my mind, then try to put it out of said mind altogether. It’s to do with that so-called ” Shroud International Conference” planned for next July in Pasco, Washington State, USA.\nHere’s a cut-and-paste from the prospectus:\n“We are pleased to announce that an international conference on the Shroud of Turin will be held in the United States from Wednesday, July 19th through Saturday, July 22nd, 2017. The conference will be held in the Tri-Cities in the state of Washington. The Tri-Cities consists of the communities of Richland, Kennewick and Pasco, is located in the southeastern part of the State of Washington, and has a population of about 260,000. The Tri-Cities was selected for the conference because Richland is one of the premier research centers in the United States. Holding the conference in the Tri-Cities will assist in locating additional personnel for research on the Shroud, since Richland has one of the highest ratios of PhDs per capita of anywhere in the country, due to the many research laboratories in the area.”\nWhere are most contributors to an “international” conference likely to come from, not counting the USA (or the splendid but relative few in Australia and New Zealand) ? Answer – from Europe naturally. So why stage a conference on the western seaboard of the USA, effectively doubling the journey time, airfares, to say nothing of jet lag for European attendees? And why choose as one’s venue a God-forsaken giant parking lot with conference centre that looks for all the world like a corrugated iron aircraft hangar?\nAs for that section on hoping to attract new blood into sindonology, based on PhDs per head of population, all from the local Washington State hinterland,  words fail me. Can one expect to see a recruiting office set up, with long lines of bright-eyed newish PhDs stretching off to the far horizon? \nJust who do the organizers think they are kidding with that kind of piously intoned, intelligence-insulting drivel?  Come on, tell us the REAL reason why you chose that back-of-beyond blight on the landscape for your conference (which this PhD shroudologist has no intention of attending needless to say, cue huge sigh of collective relief from the organizers).\n","date":"September 21, 2016 at 7:13 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-7831","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)","post":"The truth of it all.People are afraid of the truth that they are sinners just like God told them.There minds are marked just like God told them they would be but yet they refuse him.Noah had his hands full when building the ark.Think of all the non believers back then.Its no different now.I will say this as how brave you are to know what’s coming for your soul.You will cry but no tears will fall.You will plead but you will here no answer.How many times will you turn your back on God just as they did in Noah’s days.Remember what Jesus told his Disciples,be in constant prayer for you know not the day nor the hour.Even Jesus knew they would go on sinning.Be sure you hold Jesus close to your heart.\n","date":"January 9, 2018 at 4:11 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-10486","author":"Steve","site":"colinberry"}]
