(ed.at this precise moment in time). I’m providing a considered explanation as to why there is that curious addition of the face, presumably that of Jesus, to the Machy mould, above the word SUAIRE, and suggestive of a graft of the Veil of Veronica, an image reputedly formed from sweat, and named accordingly. \nIf the artist had wished to make clear he was referring to the shroud, not a grafted-on face cloth, added for dubious motives, e.g. to borrow on the reputation of the Veil, he could (and surely SHOULD) have used the term “linceul”, contrary to what you state. The evidence is there on that same etymology site. Enter the term “linceul” and you will find the following:\n2. 2emoitié xiiies. [ms. xives.] « drap servant à envelopper un cadavre pour l’ensevelir \nThat says that the term “linceul” was in use to mean a burial shroud well before the Lirey exhibition (some 100 years), i.e. the second half of the 13th century.\nPS: I am assuming that the inset image added to the Machy Mould above “SUAIRE” is that of the Veil of Veronica. You may or may not agree, but see the comparison I have just added to the top of the posting, with more than a hint, methinks, of the give away ‘triple point’ beard  between hair. So in that sense, it becomes irrelevant whether the artist should or could have used “linceul” instead of “suaire” if, as I believe, the intention was to label an image of the Veil – not that of the Shroud itself higher up (albeit with the intention of creating ambiguity, indeed confusion, in the viewers’ minds).\n","date":"February 16, 2014 at 8:48 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","id":"comment-3023","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain.","post":"There is no doubt that suaire comes from sueur which itself comes from sudarium.\nBut what is the question?\nYour question, if I understand well was: why do we see the term suaire and not the term linceul on the Lirey badge?\nBecause in old French suaire was the only word that could point to the linen sheet that was used\nFor Jesus burial (in the context of the Lirey shroud)\nThey did not use the term linceul because at the time, the term linceul referred to every kind of sheet\nwww/cnrtl.fr/etymologie/linceul\n","date":"February 16, 2014 at 8:22 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","id":"comment-3022","author":"HEIMBURGER","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain.","post":"The etymology link you cite would at first sight appear to discount my thesis. But let’s not be over-hasty. Etymology (admittedly not my forte) can throw up some other interesting possibilities re morphing of one term into another if one is prepared to think out of the box.\nExample: the term “le suaire” (burial shroud, from Latin “sudarium”)  is quite similar to “la sueur” (perspiration, sweat from the Latin “sudorem”).\nhttp://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/sueur\nSo we need to be absolutely certain that we are tracing “le suaire” back to the correct Latin root. I suspect that we are not, and that early references to face cloths in a biblical context, used to absorb and imprint sweat (Veil of Veronica etc) or even blood, were originally based on the Latin “sudorem”, not “sudarium” and that maybe  early French “sueur” became confused with “suaire”, given that the Latin roots are so similar.\nI’ll continue to read around, but for now I’d say the plot thickens.\nPS. If one googles (sudarium etymology) one gets back a totally unexpected answer, with no mention of shroud, but a clear link with sweat AND napkin (face cloth) viz: \nSudarium etymology\nLatin sudor (sweat) to sudarium (napkin) to sudarium (early 17th century)\nEarly 17th century from latin, literally napkin, from sudor (sweat)\nThis gets more interesting by the minute. Initially I thought it was just the French that had been manipulated to serve an agenda. Now it looks as though the Latin was manipulated too in order to legitimise the morphing of one French word into another. I’m not usually given to embracing, far less initiating conspiracy theories, but there’s an increasingly bad smell about the way the Machy mould and the badge it would have produced (assuming it did successfully produce Machy/Mark 2? Lirey badges) came to acquire that label “suaire” immediately under the ‘inset’ image of what would appear to be a face-cloth, e.g Veil of Veronica, NOT Shroud.\n","date":"February 16, 2014 at 3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","id":"comment-3021","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain.","post":"http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/suaire\nAs early as 1175 or 1273 (in an epic poem: “le sac de Rome”), the term “suaire” has been used as equivalent to shroud.

I just wanted to stress that the changes I have introduced to the article will make it different from your copy.  This is probably due to the fact that I am not a native English speaker/writter.  Conversely I did not feel any offense in what you have written.\nThis being said I doubt that the embrace of Shroud authenticity was the overpowering force might have the reason why the French langage does not really make a difference in suaire/linceul.  I have however not evidence to show it or to show the contrary.  \nAs to the reason why de Charny came into possession of the shroud I would like to stress that during the Middle Ages relics fabrication (or forgery) has been an industry.\nIn his Treatise on Relics John Calvin lists at least half a dozen shrouds of Jesus, af course all given as the authentic one by their holders.  \nFurthermore it seems that the shroud has neve been mentioned as being the ownership of Geoffroi de Charny but only as being owned by his widow Jeanne de Vergy.  The tradition (what does this mean?) reports she said to have received it from her ancestors.  I must however acknowlege that one cannot exclude that she could have said this because she did not want to openly make a link with Jacques de Morlay of Geoffroy de Charnay (assuming the later was indeed the uncle of his dead husband – which I am still not convinced).  \nBeside I have also found this story ( http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A462458 ), but maybe you have already seen it.\n","date":"February 15, 2014 at 9:21 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","id":"comment-3010","author":"Robert","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain.","post":"Thanks for getting back so soon.

Do you not consider it extraordinary that this semantic confusion was allowed to take root and persist to this very day? One is entitled to seek causes, and attempt to link with or relate to any other anomalies that one encounters in which the term “suaire” makes an early appearance in the context of the Shroud. The Machy mould is precisely the kind of thing I have in mind, and it was its present owner, a Frenchman, who was quick to flag up the semantic anomaly, not me. I’m just saying: here’s a likely explanation as to why a shroud came to be wrongly labelled as a facecloth.\n","date":"February 16, 2014 at 8:16 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","id":"comment-3015","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain.","post":"Thanks for the thoughtful reply (even if puzzled by the second sentence beginning “I will not look anymore etc…”). Have I said something to offend – you personally or the French nation?  Does that mean no return visits? If so, that’s a pity, since it’s good to get a French/Belgian perspective on this hypothesis, which is admittedly somewhat daring. (But one has to ask why so conservative a language as French has permitted unconstructive change, so maybe the embrace of Shroud authenticity was the overpowering force that met the otherwise immovable object. Something had to give  –  so the suaire/linceul ambiguity survives as a linguistic anomaly, dare one say time capsule?\nDe Charney/De Charny? It was our genealogist Noel Currer-Briggs, sadly no longer with us,  who claimed that they were uncle and nephew respectively. However, for my hypothesis, it would not matter if they were not related by blood. One is still left to wonder why a particular knight (with hints there of a knightly code of values, to say nothing of a liking for clubbishness, given his membership of  that short-lived Star order in Paris that Ian Wilson mentions) should be the one to have come into possession of the Shroud, and why it took so long for its ‘authenticity’ to be recognized and acclaimed.\nHopefully you’ll be back, and I can respond to some of your other points, once I’ve had time to deliberate.\nAu revoir.\n","date":"February 15, 2014 at 8:34 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","id":"comment-3009","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain.","post":"Well, having seen your comment relating to the “Suaire d’Oviedo” article in French wikipedia (to which I am a regular contributor) I have undertaken some changes to the structure of this article: https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suaire_d%27Oviedo&diff=101285115&oldid=96397135 \nIt will definitely not look anymore as what you have shown in your blog.\nNow with respect to the reasons why in French the words “linceul” and “suaire” are both used for designating the shroud of Turin, it is difficult to provide a logical explanation.  It is clear that they had different signification and have once meant different objects which is not really the case anymore.  \nAs I am a French speaking Belgian (who lives in Geneva) please do not ask me to answer the question “So how do the famously logical and rational French defend this uncharacteristic lapse into ambiguity?”.  As a matter of fact a language changes over the centuries and French is no exception.  It is therefore difficult to know whether this confusion between “suaire” and “linceul” is due to the shroud of Turin (which is indeed usually – but improperly – named “suaire de Turin” and not “linceul de Turin”) or to other reasons.  One would need to get the help of a linguist to have more information on this topic.\nI seize this opportunity to tell you that I appreciate your blog even if I do not necessarily share all your theories.  For instance if I agree that the shroud is an artifact from the 14th century I do not think that the men of the shrould could be Jacques de Molay or his fellow Geoffroy de Charnay.  First of all because to the best of my knowledge all know relations of de Molay et de Charny death say they were burned at the stake.  I have never read that they could have been roasted on a grill like Saint Lawrence.  \nBeside one can also question the existence of any link between Geoffroi de Charny – named according to the French city of Charny (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charny,_C%C3%B4te-d%27Or ) and Geoffroy de Charnay (there are several cities names Charnay in France).  I am not aware of any records that would make a familial link between these two men.\nI hope my comment was not too long.\n","date":"February 15, 2014 at 8:12 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","id":"comment-3007","author":"Robert","site":"colinberry"}]
