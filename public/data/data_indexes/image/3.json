[{"title":"Catholic Mom: 75,000 People Using HAL9000 Images","post":"Dan, poor post title. Maybe 75000 people downloaded the app after it was written about in the news. Of that, I bet only a few paid $4 for access to the HD file. Of that, I bet only a few have ever used it after the first use. Frankly, it is a big disappointment.\n\n","date":"July 11, 2013 at 4:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/10/catholic-mom-75000-people-using-hal9000-images/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-38883","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catholic Mom: 75,000 People Using HAL9000 Images","post":"Is there a reason why the HD images are not free on the internet?\n\n","date":"July 11, 2013 at 9:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/10/catholic-mom-75000-people-using-hal9000-images/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-38910","author":"archaeon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catholic Mom: 75,000 People Using HAL9000 Images","post":"I am little concerned about the commercialization of the Shroud (says he who is working on a manuscript). But if you accept that the Shroud is authentic (spoiler alert: I do) than selling an Apple app becomes problematical in my opinion. It limits access to those who can pay for app and then, as I understand it, Apple charges for downloading???? \nDoes “simony” still mean something.\n\n","date":"July 12, 2013 at 2:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/10/catholic-mom-75000-people-using-hal9000-images/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-38941","author":"JOHN kLOTZ","site":"shroudstory"}]
