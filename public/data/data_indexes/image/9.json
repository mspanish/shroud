[{"title":"Does an imprint of my unquestionably human hand onto fabric possess UNIQUE 3D properties (like, er, that supposedly ‘supernatural’ Turin Shroud) ?","post":"Here’s a copy/paste of the abstract of the 1984 paper in Applied Optics that arguably launched the bizarre notion of imaging via resurrectional incandescence. It could be cited as a prime exhibit in showing how  pseudoscience and tunnel vision combine to make an insidiously-destructive partnership, shutting out facts and the truth, as distinct from opening up fruitful lines of enquiry.\nJackson, Jumper and Ercoline\nAbstract\nThe frontal image on the Shroud of Turin is shown to be consistent with a body shape covered with a naturally draping cloth  in the sense that image shading can be derived from a single global mapping function of distance between these two surfaces. The visible image on the Shroud does not appear to be the work of an artist in an eye/brain/hand coordination sense nor does it appear to be the result of direct contact only, diffusion, radiation from a body shape or engraving, dabbing powder on a bas-relief, or electrostatic imaging. The visible image on the Shroud is probably not the result of a hot bas-relief impressed into cloth, but such a mechanism seems capable of accounting for the Shroud image’s distance correlation, resolution, and similar chemical structure. It does not simultaneously account for (1) the 3-D image residing on one side of the Shroud, (2) observed lateral image distortions (consistent with a draping cloth over a body shape), or (3) expected thermal perturbations associated with physically thick superimposed blood images. A complex mechanism involving more than one process may account for some of the Shroud image’s characteristics, but potential inconsistencies in shading continuity, cloth contact, lateral distortions, and pressure independence may exist.\n© 1984 Optical Society of America\nI have bolded up two particular phrases that do stick in this retired scientist’s craw. Why? Because it’s not the aim and purpose of science to show that one of numerous possible/improbable  blue-sky models just happens to be “consistent”  with one’s preconceptions, airily dismissing the rest of the field. Pseudoscience does not get much worse than this… In fact what we see here is downright arrogance –  with more than a hint of attempted mind control via preemptive strike… But then John Jackson’s doctorate was acquired from a military academy…  God bless America!\n\nPS Note too that the abstract refers only to the frontal image, leaving the reader to conclude that the dorsal image must have entirely different properties, given the impossibility of “loosely draped linen” on the underside. That might make the same reader susceptible to the claim made in Feb this year by true-believer Stephen E.Jones on his dogma-ridden blogsite that it’s only the frontal side body image (plus 1532 scorch marks!) that displays a 3D response with appropriate software, the dorsal side being as he puts it “contact only”. I have news for Stephen E.Jones – the frontal and dorsal sides BOTH display a 3D response to ImageJ, with nothing to distinguish between them. \n\n(Click to enlarge)\nThe problem is to get either to display a good response, at least when uploading the virtually contrast-less images from Shroud Scope. Solution: give the Scope images additional contrast, and the 3D-response then becomes visible, though still not as good as some of my imprints from Model 2 and 10.\n","date":"August 18, 2017 at 6:51 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/does-an-imprint-of-my-unquestionably-human-hand-onto-fabric-possess-unique-3d-properties-like-er-that-supposedly-supernatural-turin-shroud/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-9887","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Does an imprint of my unquestionably human hand onto fabric possess UNIQUE 3D properties (like, er, that supposedly ‘supernatural’ Turin Shroud) ?","post":"I’m starting to think about my next posting, with this as provisional title::\nIt’s time that body-imaging via ‘resurrectional incandescence’ is seen for what it is – fanciful agenda-pushing pseudoscience!\n\nYes, this one will be no-holds barred!\nBut what to substitute for what Dan Porter amusingly referred to a while ago as “snap, crackle and pop” sindonology?\nWhy, simple contact imprinting of course!\nBut before I start composing can anyone please give me one good reason for dismissing imprinting by simple physical contact, with no imprinting whatsoever across air gaps, whether by radiation or other means?\n","date":"August 17, 2017 at 11:01 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/does-an-imprint-of-my-unquestionably-human-hand-onto-fabric-possess-unique-3d-properties-like-er-that-supposedly-supernatural-turin-shroud/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-9883","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Does an imprint of my unquestionably human hand onto fabric possess UNIQUE 3D properties (like, er, that supposedly ‘supernatural’ Turin Shroud) ?","post":"Radiochemistry is totally indifferent to chemical consequences. A newly born carbon atom has to find new partners to meet its increased valency requirements (4H, 2O etc).If that substitution of C for N took place within a protein then one could expect some loss of function depending on how critical the constituent amino acid residue was to the integrity and/or specific role of the protein, whether structural, enzymatic etc.(though unlikely to be of importance in dead linen as distinct from living flax plant).\nBut please don’t quote me – not being an authority on the resurrectional incandescence that is now obligatory thinking for any participant at a Shroudie conference organized by Bob Rucker or Mark Antonacci!\n","date":"August 17, 2017 at 2:28 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/does-an-imprint-of-my-unquestionably-human-hand-onto-fabric-possess-unique-3d-properties-like-er-that-supposedly-supernatural-turin-shroud/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-9882","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Does an imprint of my unquestionably human hand onto fabric possess UNIQUE 3D properties (like, er, that supposedly ‘supernatural’ Turin Shroud) ?","post":"But what would happen to a protein if its nitrogen was converted to carbon?\n","date":"August 16, 2017 at 10:30 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/does-an-imprint-of-my-unquestionably-human-hand-onto-fabric-possess-unique-3d-properties-like-er-that-supposedly-supernatural-turin-shroud/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-9881","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Does an imprint of my unquestionably human hand onto fabric possess UNIQUE 3D properties (like, er, that supposedly ‘supernatural’ Turin Shroud) ?","post":"You’re generously accommodating, Hugh, to Bob Rucker and others who espouse “resurrectional incandescence”.
