[{"title":"Ten questions for anyone claiming that ‚Äúa miraculous flash of light‚Äù was needed to create the Man on the¬†Shroud","post":"3. (My question) ‚ÄúWhy did that MFOL produce two separate images ‚Äì front and rear ‚Äì with no sides? Isn‚Äôt a shroud supposed to be wrapped around a corpse? So why no imaging of the sides?‚Äù\nANSWER: ‚ÄúThat is the benefit of collimated light. It‚Äôs a good thing because otherwise the image would have been really strange looking‚Äù. \nWell, I‚Äôve seen references before now to collimation in connection with the Shroud image, which is another way of saying that it would be impossible without a lens, mirror or pinhole camera to get a sharp image, unless there was collimation, i.e. each point on a luminous object sent light exclusively to an unique image point on the linen, and all those unique image points corresponded exactly to the geometry of the subject.\nBut collimation requires a collimator, and there‚Äôs one tiny drawback: there‚Äôs no conceivable collimator inside a 1st century AD tomb. \nEven if there were, a collimated image would be a pixellated one. Think about it. To get collimation,  you would need a series of pinholes in a thick-walled membrane made of opaque light-absorbing material, such that the only rays that emerge on the far side are strictly normal to the corresponding light-emitting points on the subject. In other words, collimation depends on both holes and surrounding opaque tunnel wall that absorbs all but normal rays. But you can‚Äôt have holes where you have tunnel walls. Ipso facto, you have to be content with a kind of thick-walled colander as collimator, which in turn would result in a matrix of separate image spots, i.e.a pixellated image, and one moreover which is is ‚Äúpointillist‚Äù, i.e. with blank spaces around each of the image spots.\nCollimation is easy to say, but represents an attempt to regiment light rays without any means of regimenting. Collimation, in the context of the Shroud, is what is known technically in the trade as ‚ÄúMickey Mouse science‚Äù.  üòâ\n","date":"March 22, 2012 at 7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/ten-questions-for-anyone-claiming-that-a-miraculous-flash-of-light-was-needed-to-create-the-man-on-the-shroud/","cat":"medieval_hoax","id":"comment-68","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Ten questions for anyone claiming that ‚Äúa miraculous flash of light‚Äù was needed to create the Man on the¬†Shroud","post":"From ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù on the Other Site:\nMarch 22, 2012 at 9:12 am | #1\nThere are still those who believe that the earth is flat‚Ä¶I think of them everytime Colin Berry has a comment.And irregardless of what the experts in their own fields have factually concluded or regardless of any new revelations or discoveries,as far as he is concerned‚Ä¶the world is FLAT‚Ä¶metaphorically speaking.To continue reading his comments any further,to me,would be an exercise in futility.\n   My reply (which has still to appear) \n   March 22, 2012 at 11:45 am | #2\n    Your comment is awaiting moderation.\n    I‚Äôve only ever encountered one Flat-Earther ‚Äì and that was at University more years ago than I care to remember. I can‚Äôt recall if we accepted his unsolicited offer to address the student body or not. But I do know one thing. Flat- Earthers are far more keen to field questions than they are to pose them, because that‚Äôs what they revel in ‚Äì showing they have an answer to each and every question you throw at them. There is a perverseness in their nature ‚Äì they delight in denying and confounding‚Ä¶\n    OK, now for a brief defence of my position, which I do not propose to labour.\n    My first post on the Shroud was at the tail end of last year.\n    http://colinb-sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2011/12/turin-shroud-could-it-have-been.html\n    It‚Äôs working hypothesis was that radiation at a distance HAD produced the image, but if it has been radiant heat and white light, then an opaque absorbing pigment was needed, for which I considered pencilled and/or painted-on charcoal, and did in fact succeed in trapping enough radiation to produce a scorch on linen. But it was a positive, not negative image, which prompted further experimentation. Along the way I tried seeing if I could image the infrared rays from a hot metallic object (a metal pencil sharpener) onto cloth using a concave mirror, and almost idly, as an afterthought, stamped the linen directly with the hot template to produce a ‚Äúbrand‚Äù with a startling resemblance to the original, but for light/dark reversal, i.e. a pseudo-NEGATIVE, just like the Shroud is a pseudo-negative.\n    My first thought was ‚Äì surely not? ‚Äì too obvious! Some two dozen posts later I am now wholly convinced that the Shroud image WAS produced by scorching, with a few remaining details to be resolved, like was it treated or untreated linen?\n    Given the trial-and-error manner in which that current conclusion was arrived at, with no preconceived notions, and indeed an assumption initially that radiant energy was somehow involved, then I hope you will appreciate why your comparison between my approach ‚Äì that of a retired science bod with an experimental bent- and that of a Flat-Earther could not be further from the truth. But I suspect you will have a ready answer to my plaintive protest. Indeed, I suspect it is you who will have a ready answer to anything I say in defence of my position, requiring little time and effort on your part, unlike the many weeks I have spent on this problem. So who may I ask is the real Flat-Earther? You or me? I would suggest that the facts as outlined provide a ready answer‚Ä¶\n    Colin Berry MSc, PhD\n","date":"March 22, 2012 at 5:54 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/ten-questions-for-anyone-claiming-that-a-miraculous-flash-of-light-was-needed-to-create-the-man-on-the-shroud/","cat":"medieval_hoax","id":"comment-66","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Ten questions for anyone claiming that ‚Äúa miraculous flash of light‚Äù was needed to create the Man on the¬†Shroud","post":"This post was in fact intended for my new, more polemical Shroud site:\nhttp://strawshredder.wordpress.com/\nIt‚Äôs here because of WordPress‚Äôs default settings which it omits to flag up at draft stage.
