They surely rival the Archives for the History of Quantum Physics (AHQP) project headed by Thomas Kuhn, which is itself now largely online.

But, where AHQP has formed much of the basis for the truly intensive historiography of the quantum revolution, Weiner’s interviews remain lamentably unexploited by comparison.

Plant-synthesized cellulose forms elementary fibrils that are micrometers in length and 3-5 nm in dimensions. Cellulose is a dynamic structure, and its size and property vary in different cellulose-containing materials. Atomic force microscopy offers the capability of imaging surface structure at the subnanometer resolution and under nearly physiological conditions, therefore providing an ideal tool for cellulose characterization.\nLink:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22843386\n\n","date":"April 2, 2015 at 8:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/01/cargo-cult-image-formation-science/","cat":"science","id":"comment-195185","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cargo Cult Image Formation Science","post":"The Kardashev scale was developed as a way of measuring\na civilization’s technological advancement based upon how much\nusable energy it has at its disposal.\nLink:\nhttp://www.fromquarkstoquasars.com/the-kardashev-scale-type-i-ii-iii-iv-v-civilization/\n>The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization’s level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to utilize.
