If the shroud wrapped a crucified man at the time of Jesus, it is astronomically certain to have been Jesus himself.  And if so, then it means that God arranged for this photographic miracle to document Jesus’ resurrection.  If God did it, then he can do whatever he wants, including suspending the ordinary laws of nature.  In this sense, the Shroud of Turin is like the Tilma of Guadaloupe, a 500-year-old image of the Blessed Virgin Mary on a flimsy cactus fiber cloak that should have disintegrated centuries ago.  No one has been able to explain how that image was formed either, or what sustains the material upon which it appears.  \nOn the other hand, if the shroud is a medieval forgery, then it is incumbent upon those asserting such a position to demonstrate how this image with all its biological fluids was created at a time when photography was unknown, much less the properties of a photographic negative.

I suspect that there may well be good reasons why radon gas might be the source of some X-ray-like features of the Shroud image.  Radon is far more prevalent than is generally realised, and there is quite a good Wiki article on radon.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon#Scientific  \nMost web-pages on radon seem to concentrate on the health issues, and it can be difficult to find some useful scientific info.  222Rn is a decay product of radium with a half-life of 3.8 days.  While 222Rn itself is an inert gas, some of its very many daughter decay products (other Rn isotypes) are solid, typically adhering to dust particles in the air, but have very short half-lifes, most of them less than 1 hour.  \nThe dominant radiation from 222Rn is alpha, helium nucleii, which travel only a short distance and are not penetrating.  There is some beta (free electrons) which may travel a few feet.  However there is also some gamma radiation, which could result in X-ray-like imagery.  The low energy of the gamma, may explain why the TS X-ray-like imagery is limited to a few areas only, notably the teeth and finger phalanges.  The gamma emission of 222Rn is sufficient to have been used for treatment of cancer cells.  \nExtract from Wiki article:\n“Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily used to treat cancers. The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and beta radiations, while allowing the gamma rays to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200 MBq). The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short-lived elements of its decay chain (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, 214Po).” \nMost radon seems to originate from within igneous and metamorphic rocks, but also to a lesser extent in sedimentary, including limestones and shales.  It has also been associated with caves and springs.  Note that aragonite limestone as occurs in Jerusalem, is commonly associated with caves and springs.  \nIf radon has been a factor in forming the TS image, is it conceivable that the heavier, short-distance alpha particles might have had some kind of collimating effect in whatever particulates produced the TS image, and might even account for the orthogonality of the image?  \nI am wondering if there may be much more in the significance of Matthew’s reporting of an earthquake (which releases radon) at the time of the crucifixion, than others have seem prepared to acknowledge.  It does not require a catastrophic earthquake, but only a moderate one of about R.5.0 .  We have a few of these every year in New Zealand, a little disturbing at the time, but we get used to it.\n\n","date":"May 20, 2015 at 5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-199656","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?","post":"You know that I love the analytical field and often I distrust critically the claims about radiation …\n— —\nWhat is your idea about the possible use\nof Terahertz nondestructive evaluation?\nLink:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_nondestructive_evaluation\nSee also:\nTerahertz Non-Destructive Evaluation of Textile Ropes and Slings\nScott Schecklman,  Gabriel Kniffin,  Lisa Zurk\nPortland State University\nLink: https://depts.washington.edu/isot2014/program-details/\n— —\n>Terahertz radiation falls in between infrared radiation and\nmicrowave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, and\nit shares some properties with each of these.\n>Like infrared and microwave radiation, terahertz radiation travels\nin a line of sight and is non-ionizing.\n>Like microwave radiation, terahertz radiation can penetrate\na wide variety of non-conducting materials.\n>Terahertz radiation can pass through clothing, paper,\ncardboard, wood, masonry, plastic and ceramics.\n>The penetration depth is typically less than that of\nmicrowave radiation.\n>Terahertz radiation has limited penetration through fog\nand clouds and cannot penetrate liquid water or metal. …\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation\n— — —\nTerahertz time-domain spectroscopy for textile identification\nby\nM.

Earthquakes release radon gas, which has a half-life of 3.8 days, with very many daughter products.  Most of the gamma radiation comes from the decay product 214-Bi.  It would not be a great amount. \nAny X-ray-like properties of the image are only slight, and seem to be limited to the teeth and the phalanges, perhaps there are a few others.

I find it difficult to obtain detailed technical information on the process, most of the radon web-pages only being focused on health issues.

The major one that produces penetrating gamma radiation that can escape from the body is a radioactive isotope of potassium, called potassium-40. This radionuclide has been around since the birth of the earth and is present as a tiny fraction of all the potassium in nature.\n>Potassium-40 (40K) is the primary source of radiation from the human body for two reasons. First, the 40K concentration in the body is fairly high. Potassium is ingested in many foods that we eat and is a critically important element for proper functioning of the human body; it is present in pretty much all the tissues of the body. The amount of the radioactive isotope 40K in a 70-kg person is about 5,000 Bq, which represents 5,000 atoms undergoing radioactive decay each second. \n>Second, 40K emits gamma rays in a little over 10 percent of its decays and most of these gamma rays escape the body. A gamma ray is emitted in about one out of every 10 disintegrations of 40K, implying that about 500 gamma rays are produced each second. These will be moving in all directions, some will be attenuated in the body, and the dose rate from these gamma rays outside of the individual’s body will represent a very small fraction of the normal background dose rate from all natural sources outside the body. \n>If a person is above average in weight, the dose rate outside of this person’s body will expectedly be higher than the dose outside the body of a lower-weight individual. In both cases, however, the dose rate will be extremely small compared to the normal background dose rate. The heavier person will receive a greater internal dose because the decay of the 40K produces other low-penetrating radiation (beta radiation) that deposits its energy within the body. However, the dose to the heavier individual will not be significantly different from that to the lower-weight individual because the energy deposited per unit body mass is the dose-determining factor, and this will be about the same for both individuals.\n>There are many other radionuclides in the human body, but these either are present at lower levels than 40K (for example, 238U, 232Th, and their decay products) or they do not emit gamma rays that can escape the body (for example, 14C and 87Rb). Radon (and its decay products) is not a significant source of radiation from humans because it is present at very low levels in the body. \n>There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. …\nLink:\nhttp://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/faqradbods.html\n— — —\nSo, our body (with the normal levels of radiation)\ncan not produce an Image like that of the Shroud\nThen …\nDo you think at “enhanced radioactive emissions” as\n“possible solution” of the problem?\nBut… where is the certified evidence for this particular hypothesis?\nIn any case we need the adequate analyses and\nI have (previously) indicated (in a rough manner… Sorry)\nwhat we can do.\nI repeat: I prefer to use the AFM techniques in order to properly\ninvestigate linen fibrils involved in B.I.F.

I think it may be this radon from an earthquake that might account for some of the X-ray attributes of the Shroud image.  You will be familiar with work of Giovanna de Liso, who investigated seismic effects in Piedmont and produced a few images on cloth.  She only obtained images under very specific circumstances, and this included only when radon was released.  \nYou also write: “There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. …” \nI also note that in posting above Giles Carter says: “My hypothesis for that is that higher energy x-rays which are more penetrating emanated from the bones of this individual and passed through the skin and at the surface of the skin interacted with elements such as sodium and chlorine from salts and chloride on the surface or from sulfur or phosphorous in the skin. And these elements then, like sodium and chlorine, gave off secondary x-rays which are very low in energy and not penetrating at all. And it’s these x-rays that actually caused most of the image, or all of the image, of the Shroud.”  \nI do not believe it is necessary for high energy X-rays to emanate from the bones of the person, which requires a miracle.  But I wonder if it is possible that the radon emissions from within the earth might have reacted with the body salts to produce the same effect.\n\n","date":"May 21, 2015 at 2:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-199786","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?","post":"Daveb -I do not believe it is necessary for high energy X-rays to emanate from the bones of the person, which requires a miracle\nYes resurrection is a miracle.

Alternatively the rays may have stimulated a secondary radiation on the body salts.

According to experts who analyzed the Shroud image tells that the person who was wrapped in that Turin shroud was dead and also they did not find any signs that the body was decayed or decaying.\nPrior to Jesus death he told that resurrected bodies are similar to the Angels. According to Gospels we can read that Angels have bodies similar to humans. But Angels are quite different to humans. They can appear and also they can disappear. Angels also can sing, talk and carry things.\nJesus never told that his resurrected body is same as the body he had prior to his death. Furthermore after the resurrection Jesus appeared and disappeared like Angels.\nEven Mary Magdalene and another two disciples couldn’t recognize resurrected Jesus. Mary recognized him from his voice but the other two disciples couldn’t recognize Jesus even hearing the voice of resurrected Jesus. Furthermore Jesus asked Mary not to touch his resurrected body as he has no being to the Father. \nMost probably, after being to the Father, resurrected Jesus ate. Jesus also has wounded scour marks on his resurrected body (Jesus asked Thomas to touch those) similar to the image on the TS. But resurrected body of Jesus is quite different to the body Jesus had prior to his death.\nAs I mentioned previously no one knows about the resurrection process. If we assume Jesus resurrected bodily then we have to consider external energy sources (ie. earth quakes) to form the body image on the shroud. If assume Jesus resurrected like an angel then we can consider internally generated energy sources (ie. Radiation, X-Ray) to form the body image on the TS. As Gospel accounts supports both the bodily resurrection and resurrection with a body like Angels then we can consider both external (to body) and internal (from the body) energy sources to form the image. But based on the properties/aspects of the image on TS most probably an internal energy source is the reason to form an image on the TS.\n\n","date":"May 20, 2015 at 9:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-199741","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?","post":"Sorry, but your words are similar to tautologies.\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)\nAm I wrong in my remark?\n— — —\nI think we have to remain anchored to the reality\nof what we observe (or we can observe using appropriate tools!).\nIndeed …\nWhere are the real connections between the observations and\ninteresting theological speculations (… that, at the time,\ndid not seem yet to have secure foundations in scientific reality)?\nI think the fact that we can see is the one that counts for the purposes\nof scientific discourse.

The general consensus seems to be that the coloration is due to an oxidation process.  During medieval times, the processing method changed.

Rogers & Anna Arnoldi, 2003, This article originally appeared in Melanoidins vol. 4, Ames J.M. ed., Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 2003, pp.106-113.\n“Observations of weave density and lignin content of the shroud fibres (Rogers, 2001) indicate a very mild bleaching technique in agreement with the methods described by Pliny the Elder (77). The same technology was in use, with some minor differences, until after the last crusade in 1291 (Hochberg, 1980). Linen was spun by hand on a spindle whorl. When the spindle was full, the spinner made a hank of thread. Each hank of thread was bleached separately, and each was a little different. Different parts of the same thread in the shroud’s weave show slightly different colours, like a variegated yarn. The warp thread was protected with starch during the weaving process, making the cloth stiff. The final cloth was washed in a solution made from Saponaria officinalis. Saponaria produces four glycosidic saponins, and all hydrolyse to produce sugar chains. (Ya Chirva et al., 1969) The following carbohydrates were identified in those chains: galactose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, fucose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid.” \n“The presence of starch, in particular amilose, on the shroud was confirmed by the fact that during testing for sulfoproteins in blood areas with an iodine-azide reagent (which bubbles vigorously when sulfur is present), a reddish background was formed. Image colour does not appear under the bloodstains when they are removed with a proteolytic enzyme.  Whatever process produced the image, colour must have occurred after the blood flowed onto (or was painted onto) the cloth, and the image-producing process did not destroy the blood (Heller and Adler, 1981).”  \nNote that the authors are asserting that several carbohydrates, including some sugars, were identified, and also amilose, which I take to be a starch.  Authors also cite Heller & Adler regarding blood-stains.  Searching on “starch” on shroud.com web-site results in several other papers.\n\n","date":"May 22, 2015 at 9:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-199908","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
