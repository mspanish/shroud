Jackson believes he has. I am not convinced although I am not opposed either. Unlike others on this blog, I just don’t know, Although, it seems evident to me that the image itself and therefore possibly its formation mechanism, are consistent with a resurrection event.\nPS: Charles, spare us your blather about painting.

However, ask anyone where they are most likely to encounter a scorch and it’s probably from ironing clothes, where it’s direct physical contact between hot metal and fabric that is a prerequisite.  There are other types of contact scorch too,  like leaving a lighted cigarette on furniture or fabric. Some might mention radiation scorches, like attempting to dry wet clothes too quickly or too closely to an electric fire.\nHowever, one can introduce a little science by considering the chemical nature of the discoloration that we call a scorch. It’s due to chemical reactions at the surface fibres of the fabrics caused by excessively high temperatures that cause chemical bonds to break and then reform in new configurations that absorb light of higher frequencies (the blue end of the visible spectrum) such that reflected light has a yellow tinge (remove blue and the residual mix tends to look yellow).\nGenerally in the instances described the discoloration is somewhat superficial and while unsightly does not materially affect the strength of the fabric. \nDo these very faint and superficial scorches fluoresce under uv light? I personally don’t know, not having a scientific-grade uv lamp. (Yes, I could buy a cheapo version on eBay, but would not trust results if there were no indication of what kind of uv frequencies were being emitted, quite apart from the risk of damaging one’s eyes in home experiments without safeguards, mine having already been over-exposed to uv from a photochemical project early in my career that left permanent retinal scarring, or so my optician says).\nWhat I do know is that the 1532 damage to the TS can in no way be described merely as a “scorch” as described above. It’s better described as charring, with a scorched margin. \nThe chemical changes that produce charring, leading ultimately to charcoal, i.e.  elemental carbon, introduce an entirely new range of exotic chemical species, notably  the polycyclic aromatic compounds along the way to graphitic fused benzene rings.  The latter are known to fluoresce strongly under uv light for a number of reasons to do with delocalised pi-bonds, rigidity of planar ring systems etc etc.  Forgive me if this biomedical scientist with a grounding in organic chemistry does not buy into the argument that because the 1532 “scorch” marks fluoresce under uv, and the TS image does not, then ipso facto  the TS image cannot be a scorch mark.\nAnyone intending to play the fluorescence card to those of us familiar with organic chemistry must first place all their other cards on the table, like those that reveal the chemical identities of the fluorescing species. Fluorescence per se is hugely unreliable as a guide to process (as I learned to my cost in that same photochemical project, wasting well over 6 months chasing fluorescence on TLC plates, based on someone else’s assurance that “that is where the money is”. No it wasn’t – six months to find it was yellow-green fluorescent riboflavin (Vitamin B2), totally irrelevant to the medical condition under study.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2014 at 1:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","id":"comment-176717","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?","post":"“One of the most important arguments against the scorch is related to UV fluorescence. “[…]This demonstration together with the observed absence of body image fluorescence is strong evidence against the cause for the body image being a scorch”.

From my own researches I can say this:\n1) The UV photos of the Shroud were done by Miller and Pelicori and are published in the Journal of Biological Photography but are not available on the internet. Considerable care was taken to exclude any visible light emission from the UV source, so that the image captured on film was entirely due to fluorescence. I mention this because all the UV images show considerable background fluorescence which largely masks any extra due to image, scorches, blood serum and so on. There is no apparent fluorescence caused by the body image, but it is possible that there is some which is masked by the background. Those parts of the burn-scorches which are dark in visible light are also dark in UV, but they are often fringed in a pale reddish orange fluorescence, while the rest of the UV marks are greenish-blue. There seems to be no fluorescence attached to the ‘poker holes.’\n2) I have never been able to create reddish fluorescence using a scorch. When I heat an object and press it several times onto linen until it is cool, I find that at the lowest temperature to form a visible mark, however faint, it fluoresces brightly. I have not been able to make the cloth fluoresce without making a visible mark, but that may simply be that I have not had exactly the right temperature. As the temperature increases, the dark scorch/char itself does not fluoresce, but is surrounded by a bright halo which does.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2014 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","id":"comment-176707","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?","post":"It’s worthless discussing the «Scorch Hypothesis»\nDr. Thibault Heimburger has already nicely discarded that theory- just read on this blog his wonderful paper THE TURIN SHROUD BODY IMAGE:THE SCORCH HYPOTHESIS REVISITED\nDefinitly whatever produced the Turin Shroud body Image  was not a scorch and that’s it\n                                                                       Merry Christmas\n                                                                 Antero de Frias Moreira\n                                                           Centro Português de Sindonologia\n\n","date":"December 16, 2014 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","id":"comment-176993","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?","post":"We are often told what hypotheses are worthless, but seldom which ones are not.

Maroni et al. report 70−100 μg formaldehyde in the undiluted mainstream smoke of nonfilter cigarettes and 0.2 mg per cigarette in sidestream smoke.

Not only does that need a much higher temperature than superficial scorching from a heated template, but the 3D geometry of heat conduction would have been entirely different. Heat would have been conducted away from the blackened zone in the plane of the cloth, ie. along the central cores of flax fibres. Put another way, the faintest areas that you describe as scorches received thermal energy laterally via the celiulose cores of the fibres. That’s an entirely different geometry from receiving heat from the surface, especially at lower temperatures that produce little or no damage to the cellulose cores. \nDifferent temperatures, different geometry of heat conduction result in  different chemistry, and to end-products that differ in their physical and chemical properties. It’s hardly surprising that a core scorch on the margins of a burn hole should differ in its fluorescent properties from a superficial surface scorch.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2014 at 1:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","id":"comment-177454","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?","post":"This distinction between “a core scorch” and a “superficial surface scorch” is just another fallacy.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2014 at 2:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","id":"comment-177467","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?","post":"I rest my case, and shall now be taking a break from the TS for a couple of weeks or so.

The St.John account with mere passing reference to J of A, and with none whatsoever to his conjured-up bolt of fine linen, stays on the back burner for now.\nEven Charles Freeman, bless him, helped too in a manner of speaking, suggesting that we should look to art for answers. Well, both of us have now looked, but arrived at entirely different answers. \nAu revoir.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2014 at 3:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","id":"comment-177474","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?","post":"Thanks Colin for your replay.\nOf course I understand your reasoning.
