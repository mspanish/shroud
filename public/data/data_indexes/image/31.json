I simply said it was not the primary reason for the bilateral loss of peripheral image – and indeed Barrie Schwortz’s photo-enhancement, shown above, with raising of the luminance on the B/W photograph (which incidentally is equivalent to lowering the luminance on the actual Shroud image) without the need for Fourier transforms should serve to prove my point. The Fourier transforms are being used to window-dress a dud hypothesis that is full of self-contradictions, like that crease I mentioned. The dud hypothesis (banding) simply attempts to preempt discussion as to the real reasons for bilateral loss of peripheral image symmetrically on both sides of the face – which is more likely a result of the imprinting mechanism, NOT the banding. \n Once again I must thank Dan for supplying so egregious an example for my new site of the shameless misapplication of a specialist technical tool – mathematical in this instance – one  designed to make the gullible think there is “more than meets the eye” where the Shroud is concerned.

It was not a sand bed  those medieval hoaxers used.  Sand does not provide  enough give – and moist sand does not provide sufficient cooling to prevent discoloration on the reverse side of the linen. I now think it was a bed of SNOW.\nIt seems obvious now, but here’s what led up to the sudden realization that snow ticks more boxes than sand. I was looking at the reverse side discoloration today through a lens, and realizing that it was totally different in character from the frontal side scorch. The latter is highly localised, mainly to the crowns of the threads, scarcely intruding laterally beyond the contact area, whereas the reverse side is a diffuse and very lightly toasted-looking colour. Why would that be I wondered. Then the penny suddenly dropped. I have so far been considering only 2 of the 3 methods of heat transfer – conduction (favoured) and radiation (rejected). But there’s a third method which I suspect caused the reverse side -toasted appearance – CONVECTION.  When the hot template is pressed against linen, air in the pores of the linen becomes superheated, but can only escape by crossing the thickness of the fabric to escape on the far side (into my sand bed). En route it physically and then chemically dehydrates the fibres. By substituting snow for sand, I suspect, nay predict, that the secondary “roasting” from hot convected air will be much reduced. What’s more, snow will make for a much better medium into which the template can snuggle down to get optimal contact between cloth and template – not too little, not too much. Too little and there is insufficient 3D effect; too much and there is distortion through converting too much of the relief into a planar image.\nTrouble is, I don’t have snow to hand to test this idea (the UK is having an unseasonably mild winter right now). I could probably use crushed ice as a substitute – to provide the cooling effect that will reduce “convection scorch”, but it won’t have quite the same give as snow for optimal wrap-around effect. Never mind – it is that reverse-side discoloration that is my main focus at present with a view to  ticking one more box on matching model with Shroud (though let’s not forget that the latter also has a reverse side image of the face and hands).\n","date":"March 1, 2012 at 10:57 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/the-turin-shroud-man-is-a-scorchograph-and-i-challenge-anyone-to-prove-otherwise/","cat":"barrie_schwortz","id":"comment-41","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud Man is not a photograph, but a negative THERMOGRAPH – and I challenge anyone to prove otherwise…","post":"Here is a comment I have just placed on the other site – one of several in a similar vein that are my response to the kind of reception my “scorchograph” theory has received in Shroud Fantasy Land:\nI have blanked out the name of the individual to whom it was addressed:\n“I repeat – the Shroud image is a thermal scorch, produced by direct contact with a heated object. There is no need whatsoever to invoke any kind of radiation. It has taken this retired science bod several weeks of study and experiment to arrive at that categorical statement, one that I realize clashes with the preconceptions of you and others who may have studied, but who have done no experiments of your own, and consequently have no handle on the problem . \nNow if you think this is a game, xxxxxxxx, or that I am pushing a “pet academic theory” then so be it. I prefer to think that I have made a sincere and honest attempt to establish the truth regarding something billed as the most intensively studied object in history.\nAnyone with a hot coin and a piece of cotton or linen can simulate the scientific principle that underpins the Turin Shroud. With care they can produce a highly superficial image which affects only the outermost cell walls of the cloth, probably the primary cell wall hemicellulose, which is light/dark reversed, which has encoded 3D information, which will almost certainly fade with time and so forth. There is no need to invoke magic where the Shroud image is concerned. To claim it defies modern science is complete and utter poppycock.\nThe Shroud has become a symbol of pseudo-scientific misinformation, indeed, in some cases, deliberate disinformation. I think I can safely say my work is done. I have stated my hypothesis, one that rationalises the image in terms of accessible, conventional science. I leave it to others to fine tune the technology, if they so desire.

To say the whole thing looks distinctly fishy would be a gross understatement:\nShroud Damage in 1532 Fire\n The fire in the Castle Chapel \n1532 – 4 December – Fire breaks out in the Sainte Chapelle, Chambéry, seriously damaging all its furnishings and fittings. Because where the Shroud is kept is protected by four locks, Canon Philibert Lambert and two Franciscans summon the help of a blacksmith to prise open the grille. By the time they succeed, Margaret of Austria’s casket has been melted beyond repair by the intense heat. But the Shroud folded inside is preserved except for having been scorched and holed by a drop of molten silver that fell on one corner\n1534 – 15 April – Cardinal Louis de Gorrevod holds canonical investigation at Chambery at which three bishops and ten noblemen testify to the cloth before them being the same as that they knew before the fire. According to the Cardinal ‘It is the same sheet as we ourselves before the fire have many times held in our hands, seen, touched and shown to the people’ ”\nAmazing, eh, that the casket is “melted beyond repair “ by the extreme heat” yet just one molten blob has dripped down onto the Shroud, with the latter having been strangely been folded down its midline.\nHere’s that earlier post of mine showing where a single blob of “molten silver” can penetrate to obliterate not just one but both shoulder regions:\n  one single hole is all it took \nAnd there was an inquiry in the aftermath, we are told, that involved 3 bishops and 10 noblemen – no less – and it centres on the Shroud, and whether a substitution had been made in the aftermath of the fire, presumed to have begun accidentally(?) Oh my. What suspicious minds they had in those days …\nOh, and here’s what the Lone Ranger enthusiast had to say about melting (or trying to melt) silver.\n“Then we tried to melt the silver. Given its high melting point, we were also concerned about oxidation.  Dr. Jaansalu also informed me that molten silver has a tendency to absorb air, which not only hardens the metal but may cause it to spit, pop, and splatter when pouring. Getting splattered with molten silver doesn’t sound like much fun. Rather than using a flux, he suggests that we rig a second Bunsen burner to create a reducing environment. I was delighted to have someone more knowledgeable than myself making such decisions. The apparatus was very pretty. The main burner gave off the traditional bright blue flame, which turned magenta as it lapped around the ring stand and crucible. The brass diffuser of the upper burner gave its flame a bright green color. Overall, it looked like some fantastic Olympic torch. With two burners running wide open, we placed five ounces of silver bullion in the crucible, and waited. And waited. And waited. Despite its considerable aesthetic appeal, this apparatus was unable to get hot enough to actually melt the silver.”\n","date":"February 26, 2012 at 3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/the-turin-shroud-man-is-a-scorchograph-and-i-challenge-anyone-to-prove-otherwise/","cat":"barrie_schwortz","id":"comment-38","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud Man is not a photograph, but a negative THERMOGRAPH – and I challenge anyone to prove otherwise…","post":"Health warning: what follows is strong stuff – not suitable for those of a nervous disposition.\nIt began with a discussion on the other site (see sidebar) about those elongated bony fingers. I was accused of failing to grasp the implication – namely that the entire Shroud had been the result of imprinting by x-rays  similar perhaps to the kind of thinking from that ENSA group with their uv laser beams, but going even into even more energetic, indeed penetrating electromagnetic frequencies (“soft” x-rays). Strange some might think how one can take x-rays of the hands but not the feet, but let’s not get too hung up on the small details.\nWhat follows now is a train of thought that began with my “scorchograph” theory, which envisages a metallic template, used like a “branding iron”,  e.g. a bronze statue or bas-relief of the crucified Christ, and explores the numerous implications of that hypothesis, ever on the lookout for new ways of rationalizing things that have previously defied explanation, or which give clues to new things to investigate (all theories to be useful need to have predictive utility).\nRight, let’s begin. We’ll suppose for starters that it was a bronze statue that had to be detached from a cross.\nWhat folk would have seen, looking up at the statue, would be the nailed hands (or wrists). Looking up at anything creates a foreshortening effect that can be artistically distracting or worse. Architects certainly sometimes compensate for it – as with the Parthenon in Athens where the pillars are splayed slightly outwards. I believe that the fingers on the statue were made deliberately too long in order to compensate for foreshortening – and arguably to create a better artistic effect anyway, perhaps suggesting that the hands had been stretched under the weight of the body – even if anatomically improbable.\nWhat about the boniness?  We see on the Shroud the imprint of the BACK of the hands, not the front, so the “sculptor” (perhaps not the best term for someone who casts in bronze, but the original template would have been carved, say in wax) may not have been too concerned about appearances. Indeed a ribbed construction may have been deliberate “round the back” of the hands and fingers for added stiffness and strength, making them less liable to be snapped off in transit.\nBut the arms in the statue are in the outstretched position – that is the first thing that has to be attended to if producing a hoax Shroud.  The arms have to be sawn off, and will be displayed  the other way round, preserving the modesty of the man. Ah yes, modesty. There was no doubt a loin cloth on the statue. But could that remain in place? Unlikely. Even if it could be left without occasioning  comment ( “surely it would not have been needed inside a shroud?”) it would not look right on a supine individual. Cast metal, made to look like a piece of cloth, would not hang right, would it?). So the loin cloth had to go  BUT ONLY ON THE FRONT– it would have been filed away.  If you think that is improbable, then take another look at the Shroud image, and look at all the scarcely imaged region in and around the hands and lower forearms. Yes, it could represent tenting of fabric, but the latter would have been accentuated by the loss of additional metal  loincloth in that area.\nAs for the dorsal image – I have a hunch that the loin cloth was NOT filed away on the back. That would have presented difficulties – better to leave some impression of buttocks than none at all. Leaving the loin cloth in place would explain the dense image in that area, and the poorly imaged region immediately underneath (which others have commented upon), which would have been due to a stepped effect from one level down to another with consequent tenting.\nNow do you see where those long bony fingers came from?  They are the result of using a recycled statue instead of a customised template.\nBut there’s more iconoclasm to come. Kindly fasten your seat belts.\nCutting the arms off a statue, and repositioning them, even with the aid, say,  of some temporary lead solder, is going to be difficult to look right, even on a “scorchograph”.  Did the Mark 1 version attract some scepticism of suggestions of high jinx?\nYes, I believe it did, but so much reputation and credibility had been invested in that “holy relic” by then that drastic steps were called for.\nHere’s what was done. The Shroud was folded down its centre (long axis) – hardly the way to treat a holy relic, as I pointed out in an earlier post – but desperate measures were called for. The folding ensured that one of those problematic shoulder regions lay directly above the other – as a result of folding symmetry.  Some test probes were done with a red hot poker, to check on the methodology for obliterating embarrassing  defects in manufacture. Molten metal was then dripped carefully onto the shoulder region, in the certainty it would burn through to the one underneath, destroying the image in both junctions of arm and collar bone.\nOnce that was done the Shroud was lightly roasted to get scorching around the edge.\nThe Castle Chapel of Chambery then became the seat of a devastating and intense fire in 1532, hot enough, we are told,  to melt the silver reliquary which contained the Shroud (folded conveniently down its midline remember). \nThere’s only one thing wrong with that story. It is inconceivable that a fire would be hot enough to melt silver (962 degrees C approx) without charring the entire contents of the reliquary to a crisp. Later i could provide a link to a website in which someone tried to cast silver bullets, and found that he was unable to melt silver even with two roaring Bunsen burners trained on the metal. He finally had to resort to a muffle furnace (cue suggestions that the Chapel acted as a giant muffle furnace). Using a silver alloy, e.g. sterling silver, 92.5% silver, 7.5%copper, effects only a fairly modest reduction in melting point (to 893 degrees C).\nSorry, but this science bod simply does not buy that story that it was molten silver that did the damage, and if that version of events given was incorrect, then what else can be believe?\nIncidentally, to those who will cite the evidence that the “L-shaped poker holes” were there before the 1533 burn holes, and show the pictorial evidence from an earlier 16th C. copy of the Shroud, none of the scenario above  would preclude those strange poker holes being there months, possibly years before the main ones as an experiment. However, the fact they lie on or very close to the scorched fold lines would surely suggest that all the holes arrived at the same time. Or maybe the alignment is just a coincidence. Maybe the L-shaped holes were the result of a previous mishap, but may have given someone the idea of using hot metal deliberately to char and destroy a carefully selected part of the image area. \nComments welcome.

It’s difficult to be critical of a model when there are no credible alternatives, and I have to say that none of the alternatives I have encountered – gaseous diffusion of putrefaction chemicals, corona discharges, miraculous flashes of light, strike me as being in the least bit credible.\nSo for now, at any rate, it’s a case of seeing how the principle works in practice, the principle being that the image was produced by “branding”, aka thermal imprinting, aka scorchography.\nThe main obstacle that has to be overcome, surely, is one of getting linen to conform to the contours of one’s template, without too much “tenting”, i.e.becoming stretched in a straight line between prominent features. In fact, if one looks at the Shroud, it’s clear there was considerable tenting. it is especially noticeable in the area around the crossed hands and forearms, which is only to be expected. given those appendages and limbs would represent one of the highest points on a torso when supine.\nHow could tenting have been reduced?  As suggested earlier, I believe that the statue or bas reliefwas pushed downwards into linen overlying a bed of sand. What’s more I believe there is a tell tale signature of this configuration being used, which are the two prominent creases in the linen at the top of the head and the chin. I doubt whether those creases would have been tolerated, had they been visible in a “head up” configuration, and were only discovered after lifting the template from a sand bed or similar.\nI believe there is another tell tale sign of tenting – the absence of ears and indeed of the side aspect of the face much beyond the prominent cheek bones. I suspect that is because the template had the representation of hair in cast metal,which not only accounts for the unnatural “hanging dead straight down” look but gave rise to some tenting, with the consequent failure to image the sides of the face. A representation of hair in cast metal obvious cannot compress down in the way that real hair can.\nMore later. The devil as they say is in the detail.\n","date":"February 25, 2012 at 11:08 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/the-turin-shroud-man-is-a-scorchograph-and-i-challenge-anyone-to-prove-otherwise/","cat":"barrie_schwortz","id":"comment-36","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
