[{"title":"We need to know much more about the chemistry of linen pyrolysis before excluding the scorch hypothesis","post":"It’s late here, so I’ll just post a holding reply MutantB. \nI’m not clear why you refer to a wet dip system first, especially as you are apparently using it to image front and back simultaneously. That’s not the appropriate model for scorching, where two separate imprints are made, frontal then dorsal.\nAs for your second point, I fail to see how you can be so categorical that scorching cannot work. Have you done any experiments yourself?  I have, admittedly on a small-scale. Look at the banner on this page, showing the thermal imprint I obtained from a heated brass crucifix, and the way it responded to inversion and 3D enhancement in ImageJ. What’s not to like?\n","date":"February 10, 2014 at 12:00 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/we-need-to-know-much-more-about-the-chemistry-of-linen-pyrolysis-before-excluding-the-scorch-hypothesis/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2960","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"We need to know much more about the chemistry of linen pyrolysis before excluding the scorch hypothesis","post":"The scorch Idea is wrong for the image, take a manikin head and dip ii in somthing that will transfer and place it in the head so that the same side of your cloth covers the back of the head as well as the face, then compare to the SOT and that will prove that is not how the image was made, then do the same thing with a hot head and compare and you will see that draping a cloth over a hot statue will not produce an image like the SOT\n","date":"February 9, 2014 at 11:49 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/we-need-to-know-much-more-about-the-chemistry-of-linen-pyrolysis-before-excluding-the-scorch-hypothesis/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2959","author":"Mutant Buzzard","site":"colinberry"}]
