[{"title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image","post":"Good to see these old papers revived from time to time. It gives us a chance to revisit old ideas, and maybe introduce new ones to those who haven’t seen them before.\nMy first thought is: Was it really as recently as 1999 that the word ‘computerised’ could be used to give some sort of authority to what is really not much more than a collection of guesses? How we’ve grown up since then!\nTo more significant matters. Everything hinges on two questions: Did the man in the shroud have his legs bent?” and “Was the shroud over the top of the body horizontal or draped?” Without clear answers to both these questions, all the measurements and superimpositions are more or less meaningless. There are other related questions, but these are the important ones.\nQuestion 1.  The dorsal image shows clear impressions of the calves and thighs. As the simplest experiment will demonstrate, the slightest bending of the knees lifts the calves well clear of the floor. Prima facie, the man did not have his legs bent. Other possibilities – even under the body, the shroud followed its contours, perhaps by being laid on some sort of mattress, or, the image of the calves is not a contact image, but a collimated projection of both image and bloodstains downwards from the body.\nQuestion 2. If the shroud on the top of the body followed its contours, while the shroud on the floor remained flat, the top image would be longer than the bottom image. The more bent the knees, the more pronounced would be the discrepancy. Although there is room for manoeuvre here, if the two images are superimposed crown-of-head to crown-of-head, the rest of the features match up very well without any adjustment of the upper image length. Prima facie, the two images are the same length. Other possibilities – the two images also match up reasonably well if the lower image is stretched by 10cm or so, so it’s all a bit subjective.\nTo answer Ron’s question: “How valid is this?” Not at all.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2013 at 10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/23/paper-chase-computerized-anthropometric-analysis-of-the-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-37864","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image","post":"Hugh, I think it is pretty clear when viewing the Shroud image, that the legs are bent. I noticed this first time I viewed the image + notice the feet placement- I would think it pretty difficult to have the feet flat on the image if the legs were not bent. It is also apparent that the back is also slightly bent. The fact that the calves and thighs could be imprinted points to the Shroud being wrapped and bound tightly to the body, therefore the Shroud would follow the contours of the body pretty close….This I believe is the consensus among most Shroud scholars.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2013 at 11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/23/paper-chase-computerized-anthropometric-analysis-of-the-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-37867","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image","post":"Thanks Ron. Well, yes and no.

The trouble with the ‘wrapped and bound’ hypothesis is those invisible sides, and the lack of any gross “Agamemnon mask” distortion of the face. I myself would very much doubt if the consensus among shroud scholars was ‘wrapped and bound’ but I could be wrong; it’s so difficult to know, isn’t it?

I’ve always thought it curious that in Anglophone countries anyway, those who had a first degree in medecine claimed the title ‘Doctor’, and are usually referred to as ‘doctors’, whereas those of them who had qualified in surgery were given the apparently more prestigious title of ‘Mister’. With any amount of luck, we might have no further ‘ad homs’ in this posting thread anyway. \nThe apparent absence of flattening of the buttocks on the TS image, might be explained by the image being formed while on its side. Max evidently has a theory about it being corroborated by an ‘off-elbow-tipped bloodstain’. We might then expect that gravity might displace the hand position from off-centre but that’s not what is seen. The lack of hand displacement could be explained by body being set in rigor mortis. But that also might conceivably explain why there is no buttocks flattening. Or there would be no such flattening if the image were formed with the body suspended in mid-air conceivably during the Resurrection, or else supported at the extremities by two stones. Hypotheses, speculations, theories, but sadly we lack any kind of real knowledge about the image formation process. \nBack to the “anthropometric analysis” by Fanti, Marinelli, Cagnazzo at the head of this posting: I would call it a brave effort, but I personally do not find it too convincing, as demonstrating that the tibia/femur ratio, for example, demonstrates that the TSM was Jewish, possibly consistent with, perhaps – but not persuasive. The reported error margins are too broad, and the tolerance ratios in the ethnic tables are not shown, nor is the source for them even cited. One reservation I have is that an error in measurement can result from a limb’s angular displacement at right angles to the cloth. It only requires an angle of 18deg, for an apparent shortening of 5%, which would skew the results. Essentially there are too many underlying assumptions that have to be made in any such analysis, to attain conclusive results. And I did it all without any kind of engineering drawings ot metaphysics! Hope you didn’t find it too tedious!\n\n","date":"June 24, 2013 at 4:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/23/paper-chase-computerized-anthropometric-analysis-of-the-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-37976","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image","post":"Re MR Colin Berry being entitled to the honorific ‘Doctor’ as he has frequently laid claim to a Ph.D. in Chemistry, I do think that the title that suits him best is ‘Doctor Arrognoramus’ indeed!\n\n","date":"June 24, 2013 at 5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/23/paper-chase-computerized-anthropometric-analysis-of-the-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-37978","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image","post":"Actually, Dave, it is the title “Dr.” as applied to those with the MB, BS degree in Medicine that is the courtesy title, whereas Dr. is by contrast NOT a courtesy title, at least where academe is concerned. But it is complicated by the fact that the general public and most of the print media, at least in the UK (the Continent is a different matter) reserves the title Dr. for those who are medically qualified, and in many cases will refuse to address a PhD scientist as “Dr.”. which is their prerogative to do so.  Back to academe, medical academe that is, the title Dr. would strictly speaking not be given to the first degree MB, BS, being reserved for those with a higher medical research degree, i.e MD not to be confused with the American MD, which is equivalent to the MB, BS in Britain. But in practice it is used in medical schools, though I have heard of one or two that don’t (I’ve forgotten which). All very confusing what… What makes it more confusing still is when a non-scientific PhD gets a role in Government, and all of a sudden the print media begins to describe him or her as “Dr” as if “Dr” were a “higher” courtesy title that only the press can bestow.\nFor my part, I only ever insist on the title Dr. if or when I take up an appointment at research institutes, schools,colleges etc  where PhDs are already addressed as such.  But I  strongly discourage folk from addressing me as Dr. in everyday life, the few who know I have a PhD, that is, like the postman or those getting my mail through their letter box, for fear they start to unburden themselves of their intimate medical details at parties, or worse still, bang on my door in the middle of the night because little Johnny has developed sudden ear ache.\nWhere the internet is concerned, I sometimes mention my doctorate if the topic is getting heavily scientific, and when I consider others are getting  out of their depth, while I am not. No sense in watching folk make a fool of themselves. Yes, that may sound a little arrogant, and that is the default position of many on the internet – that anyone who wants it to be known that they have a solid research-based grounding in science must be “arrogant” and needs putting in their place. But that is part and parcel of the general anti-science, anti-scientist culture that has long prevailed, at least in the UK, encouraged by the media who are for the most part either non-graduate in any subject, or liberal arts graduates if they are.\n\n","date":"June 24, 2013 at 5:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/23/paper-chase-computerized-anthropometric-analysis-of-the-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-37984","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image","post":"You say I “lay claim” to a PhD in Chemistry.
