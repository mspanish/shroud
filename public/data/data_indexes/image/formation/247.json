[{"title":"New Paper in JIST by Giulio Fanti: Regarding the Formation of the Body Image on the Turin Shroud","post":"Thank you Dan !\nI have downloaded the article, and for sure it’s a must-read : clearly written and informative.\nBut there is one thing that puzzles me. I don’t understand why Giulio Fanti never mentions in his articles the results published by other Italian physicists in Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids (http://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?type=simple&filter=multiple&stemming=yes&searchText=turin+shroud&x=0&y=0&publication=40000603)\nFazio and Mandaglio (the leaders of this team from Messina, Sicily) remain skeptical about corona discharge and even in their last paper about double superficiality (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10420150.2011.629320)\nSo my question is:  is there a kind of schism between Italian shroudies?\nThanks.\n\n","date":"December 26, 2011 at 9:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/26/new-paper-in-jist-by-giulio-fanti-regarding-the-formation-of-the-body-image-on-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-6138","author":"cazab","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper in JIST by Giulio Fanti: Regarding the Formation of the Body Image on the Turin Shroud","post":"Sorry if this question sounds dumb but I have to ask it anyway.\nQ: has any DNA (of human composition) been lifted from the areas on the Shroud of Turin that seemed to be blood?\nAnd… if so, could it be used to identify the DNA of the lineage of the House of David?\njust thinking …Maybe the coming AnitChrist will use it to prove his Lineage, as many are trying to figure out how he will be able to prove himself.\nI also have my own theroy as to the 3-D image & how it is present.\nThanks for ur post!\nAnnette\n\n","date":"December 27, 2011 at 1:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/26/new-paper-in-jist-by-giulio-fanti-regarding-the-formation-of-the-body-image-on-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-6161","author":"Annette Herrera","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper in JIST by Giulio Fanti: Regarding the Formation of the Body Image on the Turin Shroud","post":"As far as I know, they did manage to pull some DNA from the blood, but it was too deteriated or damaged, I can’t rememeber how they described it.

He was only able to state that there was male human DNA on the cloth but nothing else could really came out of the analysis because the DNA is too much degrated.  Normal, the blood is really old…\n\n","date":"December 27, 2011 at 6:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/26/new-paper-in-jist-by-giulio-fanti-regarding-the-formation-of-the-body-image-on-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-6190","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
