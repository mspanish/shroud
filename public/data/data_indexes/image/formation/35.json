[{"title":"David and Richard Goliath Dawkins","post":"I welcome the analogy and the comment. Dan is right, it was Goliath who issued the challenge, but Dawkins has and continues to challenge every thinking deist. I have a hunch that, in the long term, the Shroud may well be the stone that topples him. With the momentum gathering for this challenge, we shall see. The timing of the conference in Valencia, attended by representatives from Turin, could not be better. \nAnother very auspicious event has been the publication of Thomas de Wessellow’s new book, The Sign, which I am still working through. De Wesselow’s qualifications as an art historian are impeccable. His conviction that the Shroud cannot be mediaeval is forceful. (Not much of a surprise to sindonologists, of course, but impressive to the secular world). It would appear his tome rests on the Maillard reaction. As a foundation, quicksand is probably better. \nDavid\n\n","date":"April 20, 2012 at 8:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/20/david-and-richard-goliath-dawkins/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-10634","author":"shroudenigma","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David and Richard Goliath Dawkins","post":"Apparently I was in error in my earlier K.I.S.S comment, as the “A” weight facts were NOT only of STURP conclusions, but of the Shroud Science Group discussions and findings. So with that now cleared up, I would suggest a review of the ‘A’ facts which are listed as “unquestionable facts” and break them down to the most scientifically precise and observable ‘unquestionable facts’. As I found through my reading of such, some may be ‘subject to interpretation’. Otherwise I agree with the ‘reader’s’ points on image attributes to be included in the challenge, excluding the reverse side image. I don’t believe admitting any previous ‘image formation hypothesis’ to the challenge would be a good idea as the challange must be started from a ‘clean-slate’ sort of view.\nSo the KISS principle still stands as the best method in my mind….Keep it simple, keep it too scientifically known facts of the attributes of the Shroud, and he may use whatever method he finds necessary to accomplish the task. But then obviously the final product reached would need to go through the same rigorous, scientific scrutiny the Shroud has endured, ‘refereed’ of course.\nR\n\n","date":"April 20, 2012 at 1:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/20/david-and-richard-goliath-dawkins/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-10648","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
