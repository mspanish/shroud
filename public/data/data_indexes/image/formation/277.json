[{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"In the post “Father Filas’ “Discover Pilate’s Lepton Coin” Paper Available”, Giorgio Bracaglia kindly offered a pwd for readers of this blog, so that we could download the original material from his website. I have done so, and thanks a lot Giorgio for it. Additionally, I have carefully read the full post “An Excellent Analysis of the Coins-on-the-Eyes Issue” by Jos Verhulst from Antwerp.\nIn my opinion, there are two major difficulties regarding the coin issue that I guess at this stage, are nearly impossible to overcome or revert.\n1.All the photographies used were taken in the analogic era. In the case of father Filas they are second generation photos. The image analyzing techniques used at that time cannot be compared with current ones and determining the degree of validity corresponding to those techniques….is just impossible. In some cases, some of these photos have jumped into the digital era after being scanned. But how? For example, most scanners provide JPG images which though not visible at first sight, originate a compression of pixel values. Only TIFF images should be used. This is only an example. How much information –if any- is lost in the way? I miss a thorough research on this aspects.\n2.All the claims –as mentioned by Murra and DiLazzaro-are based on a subjectivity approach of the images. It is someone who sees something that the rest sometimes can see or not. However, the existance or not of hidden images is something that can be defined in an objective way. Current machine learning algorithms like Self-Organizing Maps or Random Forests combined with MonteCarlo/bootstrapping techniques could provide a mathematical approach and determine if a discernible pattern exists or we are talking about noise.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2011 at 6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4434","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"The last days, I have tried to find the existing literature about coins/letters on the Shroud. To start with, I have exclusively sought literature on peer-review papers belonging to the Journal of Citation Reports (JCR). For those readers not familiar with the JCR, I will briefly say that in every field of expertise there is a group of top journals in which the members of a given scientific community publish their results. This takes place only after at least two colleagues have scrutinized that paper and if finally accepted, it can be considered that there are not sound mistakes or repetition of previous results. This means that authors are making a contribution to the advance of knolewdge in that area. Depending on the impact of the papers published on that journal, the JCR also provides a ranking. Usually, the higher the journal is in the ranking, the more strict are the conditions to get a paper published. Before someone comes with the case of Nature (#1 in the JCR) and the C14 I will say that the errors in the datation–if any- must be atributted to the sample selection stage, the only stage that peers could not scrutinize and had to give for granted. Never to any of the stages.\nWell, the only paper I have found that meets these standards is the paper by Marion in Opt. Eng. 37(8) 2308-2313 (August 1998). A quick consultation, indicates that in the field of Optics in 1998 there were 47 journals and Optical Engineering was in position #24. This means quite a good position in the ranking  and you can bet that the paper by Marion went through a strict filter and was only published because the methodology followed was -at that time- a standard one, widely used and accepted by the rest of the scientific community in the fields of optics and image analysis.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2011 at 6:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4435","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"After reading this paper, I see a serious attempt to overcome the difficulty of the gap between analogic/digital material while using a mathematical tool like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n“Many photographs of the face were digitized: a reproduction on film of the Enrie photograph (I931) and several others (negatives, slides, and paper prints) made by Vernon Miller in 1978 under various lighting conditions and in different wavelength bands (red, green, blue, IR).”\nAfter digitizing, he used PCA as a way to combine and extract the meaningful information from different wavelengths and sources. The outcome is a set of inscriptions obtained in an area around the face.\n“Before interpreting the graphical signs that the digital processing highlights, let us note that these signs are much larger (1.5 to 3 cm) than the fibers of the cloth (about 0.7 mm wide). This size is evidence of the fact that the letters are not artefacts due to the weaving of the cloth.”\nAs an expert, he was well aware of the things that usually happens with images\n“But the digitizing and processing techniques can create their own artefacts, especially aliasing effects. Precautions must be taken to minimize such effects in digitizing and processing periodic structures. such as a cloth. Note also a subjective artefact, called the Rorschach effect, which, for instance, makes shapes appear in randomly located stains on a paper. This effect is dangerous in interpreting inscriptions.”\nTo avoid this:\n“To avoid false interpretations, we used criteria for deciding whether the signs that we see can correspond to real writings:\nl. The signs are not isolated but they form groups.\n2. Their gray values are similar.\n3. They have approximatively the same size, thickness, slope, and fashion.\n4. They are correctIy aligned and periodically spaced.\n5. They have a significance because they form a word or a piece of word in a known language.\nIf these five conditions are simultaneously verified, the probability of an artefact becomes very small. “\nA final check:\n“To eliminate this possibility completely we made a final check: if we apply the same processing to a neighboring similar region and if this operation does not cause any graphical signs to appear, we finally decide that the group of signs must correspond to writings.”\nWe can discuss on how good is this method but I would like to stress the idea that if this procedure had not been an acceptable one (in 1998), the peers would have rejected his methodology, his results and his paper.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2011 at 6:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4436","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"Two additional results from Marion’s paper:\nAgainst having been painted\n“It is an isotropic image. The Fourier transform of the image shows no preferential frequencies, proving that no preferential direction exists in the image itself. Consequently, it is difficult to imagine that this image could have been made directly by a human hand.”\nThe letters are originated the same as the rest of the image\n“Although the physical nature of the letters is not known, curiously their fine structure in the photos is the same as that of the body image: the letters are also formed by the variations of the size and the intensity of the rods. This characteristic is difficult to explain, but it shows that the useful information required to decipher the inscriptions is entirely contained in the image pattern. This observation is fundamental to understanding the image processing method.”\n\n","date":"October 28, 2011 at 6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4437","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"Very good posts Gabriel! Some interesting points made which I agree with. The main problem is the fact analog era photos were used. I’ve read just about everything I could find on Dr Filas’s work, including the paper mentioned above, which I believe Filas gives very strong reasoning as to why in his method used, you are able to see the images of letters and staff. ( I think they show up quite clear) without any pre-expectations of the mind…One point he makes which is quite interesting is about the mathematical chances of these artifacts being precisely where they are! Of the whole area of the Shroud, what is the chance that these letters and staff  ‘grouped’, ‘spaced’ and sized almost exactly matching a known coin of the era and would be placed precisely where they are? I agree with Filas that it is pretty slim. So, I personally see no reason to simply discard these findings out of hand but to wait for more studies to put this topic to rest.\n\n","date":"October 30, 2011 at 10:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4445","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"“Interpretations of shapes, coins, faces, flowers or letters “seen” on acheiropoietos images by means of image processing tools should be considered a track useful to address further studies, but they cannot be considered as self-consistent proofs.” (P; Di Lazzaro & D.

I’m not here to make friends but to express my point of view !\nI just want to say this :  In science, every conclusion MUST have a scientific confirmation from AN INDEPENDENT researcher or research team.  In Shroud science, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to find this kind of independence of mind because almost every scientist who’s interested in the Shroud believe it is the genuine Shroud of Christ and have some preconceptions ideas about the subject.  I don’t think we can say that this work of Marion found his scientifically independent confirmation yet !\nAnd sorry, but many of those kind of articles and researches about those kind of images (flowers and coins) are often done to confort the agenda that is to prove the resurrection using the Shroud.  Why ?  Because it is proven that the Corona discharge can produce an image of coins on linen.  So the stretch isn’t to long to associate the image of coins produced by Corona discharge and the resurrection of Christ !  I think there’s a real danger of biais there.\nI dream of the day when Shroud science will be lead by atheists or agnostics scientists who DON’T CARE ONE BIT about the Shroud being authentic.  Understand me, here I’m not talking about the Walter McCrone of this world but I’m talking about honest scientist who have no preconception about the Shroud (like the majority of the STURP members were by the way). Now, that would be science we can trust because it would not be agenda driven.\nAnd, I think Ray Schneider said it well the other day when he state : “The best of the “enhancements” do present the impression of elements of the Pilate coin, however the elements seem to be out of placement and not in the correct scale, so it may well simply be a case of similarity and not a real image at all. Remember that the folks doing the processing were looking for a particular appearance so there is a selection phenomenon at work which will drive the process to the best apparent fit.”\nI think the last phrase is very true even when Marion pretend his method avoid every subjective interpretation.  I’m not so sure about that because he knew what he was lookin for and I’m pretty convinced that he wanted badly to find it.  By the way, this guy Marion worked with Barbara Frele and both believe also that the ghost writtings represent Jesus death certificate !  So, if you don’t see an agenda behind those claims, you could at least agree with me that there is something fishy about all those researches…\n\n","date":"October 30, 2011 at 7:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4449","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"Oh, and I forgot to say that I agree with the last statement made by Ron : “So, I personally see no reason to simply discard these findings out of hand but to wait for more studies to put this topic to rest.”  \nMore studies (direct studies involving more than just image analysis) are definately needed before we can consider the presence of those images as a scientific fact…  We’re not there yet !\n\n","date":"October 30, 2011 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4450","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images","post":"Why do Di Lazzaro & Murra TOTALLY ignore FALSE NEGATIVE IMAGES to retain only FALSE POSITIVE IMAGES?

And even then, the fact that Matthew accepted to follow Christ show that he was still waiting for the Messiah.  So, I don’t see him living a complete Hellenistic way of life.  And he was surely well aware of the law of Moses…  For the others, they were all children of Abraham that surely tried to follow the law the best they could and I just don’t see them performing a pagan rite like that during the burial of the men they considered the Messiah.
