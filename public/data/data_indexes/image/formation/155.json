That is due to microbial action – the bacteria have enzymes that hydolyse peptide linkages in proteins and then go on to decarboxylate the amino acid monomers to free amines (ammonia, putrescine, cadaverine etc). It’s a bit more problematical deciding how free amines can form simply by adding a weak alkali (limewater) to flour in the 14th century as distinct from 1st century model, but my nose says they do.\nAs I say, it’s somewhat of a long shot to implicate a free amine in my flour/hot iron model, based purely on that fishy smell one gets on mixing flour and alkali. I might try testing flour that has been pretreated with lime, even heated (since heated flour works as well as cold flour). If the putative amine is lost, then one predicts there should be little or no linen-associated  Maillard reaction if the production of a “Shroud”-like imprints really requiring a free amine to react with the PCW pentosans, as distinct from protein. There would still be an overlying brown crust from reaction between flour protein and its own reducing sugars,maybe with simpler caramelised products,  but I am routinely washing the developed image with soap to remove that, focusing on what survives – a resistant fainter highly-superficial looking image attached to the linen fibres. There is of course that intriguing reference to be found on the shroud.com site (history section) to the linen having been subject to some ferocious treatments (boiling in oil etc) in an attempt to “test the permanence” of the image. Alternatively, those treatments, even if exaggerated, may have been intended to attenuate the image, making it look more ‘ghostly’.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2015 at 4:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/the-morphing-of-rogers-and-berry/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-206364","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Morphing of Rogers and Berry?","post":"Here’s that shroud.com quote:\nApril 14, 1503 Good Friday: Exposition of the Shroud at Bourg-en-Bresse for Archduke Philip the Handsome, grand-master of Flanders, on his return from a journey to Spain. The Shroud, which has been specially brought from Chambéry, with great ceremony, by Duke Philibert of Savoy and Duchess Marguerite, is exposed on an altar in one of the great halls of the Duke’s palace. Savoy courtier Antoine de Lalaing records of the events of that day: “The day of the great and holy Friday, the Passion was preached in Monsignor’s chapel by his confessor, the duke and duchess attending. Then they went with great devotion to the market halls of the town, where a great number of people heard the Passion preached by a Cordeilier. After that three bishops showed to the public the Holy Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and after the service it was shown in Monsignor’s chapel.” Lalaing adds that the Shroud’s authenticity has been confirmed by its having been tried by fire, boiled in oil, laundered many times ‘but it was not possible to efface or remove the imprint and image.’ \nNote the date, a mere 150 years or so after the first appearance of the linen “imprint and image” in western Europe (Lirey, approx 1357). Would it really have been subjected to those treatments, real or apocryphal, if there had been the slightest suspicion that it was “just a painting”? Note the use of the word “imprint”, employed also in the d’Arcis memorandum.

Hemicelluloses and pectins have been oxidized (note: here, Rogers don’t use the term “primary cell wall”, but that’s what he meant anyway), leaving most of the more stable cellulose.

Yes, Rogers was clear about a lot of things which are a lot less clear to others, and which he only partially substantiated.The ‘thin layer of impurities’ which only resides on the crowns of the fibres does provide a reasonable explanation of why vapours emanating from the body would only discolour the crowns of the fibres. However, Rogers’s attempt to achieve his ‘thin layer of impurities’ by means of an evaporation gradient has not been satisfactorily demonstrated, and the uniform source of adequate vapours from all parts of the body has neither been demonstrated nor satisfactorily explained. Rogers’s ‘thin layer of impurities’ contradicts the findings of other scientists, who didn’t observe starch, and who did observe corroded fibres. Rogers explanation that these only consisted of his ‘thin layer’ cracking off is naive.\nRogers’s critique of coronal discharge consisted of carrying out his own experiments ad finding them unsatisfactory, which is fair enough. However, his experiments are not comparable to Giulio Fanti’s, and therefore his comparisons about colour and corrosion are not necessarily valid. I do note that he says: “Even a short exposure will erode the surface of flax fibers. No such changes can be observed on Shroud fibers.” In fact this was exactly what was observed by Heller and Adler.\nIf a thin film of impurities is necessary, or a discolouration only of the crowns of the threads of the cloth, then some form of contact, whether by acidified paint, or wheat flour paste, or even a hot bas relief, is far more likely than evaporated dextrin.\nIt may, after all, be that some of Rogers’s ideas turn out to be part of the explanation for the image on the Shroud, but there is a great deal more to be done before they can generally be accepted as confidently as Yannick supposes.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2015 at 12:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/the-morphing-of-rogers-and-berry/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-206400","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Morphing of Rogers and Berry?","post":"All I say is that the hypothesis of Rogers is far more credible and possible than those proposed by Fanti and Di Lazzaro.

Under that scenario, the film would then develop on the outermost fibrils of the yarn, so that following weaving of the cloth, this notional film would then be evident more or less uniformly on the surface of the cloth, regardless of the final location of particular threads.  However it is evident that the image is confined only to the crowns  of the thread and not elsewhere, such as the valleys and interstices.  \nIn medieval times, to obtain a more uniform colour, the practice grew, particularly in the Low Countries, of postponing bleaching to after weaving of the cloth, which was then spread out in the fields to dry.  Under that scenario, the evaporation would then more likely concentrate the film to be confined to the crowns.  If the image resides only on a film, as postulated by Rogers, then that would tend to suggest that the whole cloth would have been bleached, rather than the hanks of yarn.  \nAdler et al, seemed unable to detect any such film layer, and therefore postulated that the image resided on the PCW.   An alternative postulate would be that the reason for image concentration on the crowns would be the result of some kind of quasi-contact process.  \nSummarising, if the image resides in a film, as postulated by Rogers, then its concentration would tend to suggest a medieval provenance;  If it is on the PCW, then a kind of contact process would seem to be involved.

Note however that the new link was to a posting that appeared on this site almost three years ago. It was one that followed the site owner’s MO of cut-and-paste from someone else’s site (mine) of a selected passage, followed by a selected passage from that of Ray Rogers (RIP). Comments appeared, some critical, from folk who clearly had read only what was in front of them, who hadn’t bothered to read my posting in full. My response? To provide a relevant link to my site. Dan’s response? To delete that link and comment. When I then commented on the missing link his curt reply was that he did not accept link-only comments on his site.\nSo Dan Porter is quite happy to mine other folk’s site for content – selected passages thereof – and then set them up in contest with another scientist (dead). He then expects the author to respond to criticism that appears on his site, much of which is clearly uninformed, coming from folk who cannot be bothered to check what was written on the primary site.\nThis is bad, bad netiquette, as I have said on so many previous occasions. There’s a whole raft of reasons why Rogers’ experiments are not valid if claiming to be (a) a simple unassisted Maillard reaction or (b) an unassisted  Maillard reaction that could occur on the linen enveloping a recently interred body. There’s more than one way of assisting a Maillard reaction, as I’ve set out previously (raise temperature, raise pH, e.g. with excess ammonia, use highly degraded starch – more sugar than starch – instead of starch per se).\nHowever, this is neither the time nor (arguably) the place to be discussing the detailed science. I may add a section to my current posting, despite its length.  My site is a diary – not a political manifesto. Repeat: I do not engage with trolls. Nor do I respond to criticism on sites that tolerate trolls.\n\n","date":"July 24, 2015 at 1:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/the-morphing-of-rogers-and-berry/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-206443","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"}]
