Ron is right, there is a large noticeable gap between the 2 images.  Of course there is also the water stain that is being “falsely perceived” as being the beginning of the image, when it is not.  Like has already been mentioned the image was formed by a light source (likely individual laser beams 1/100th the thickness of a human hair) working in a vertical fashion.  It is consistent with the entire Shroud image.  No side image anywhere.  As for the chin band, it seems obvious that this was used.  You can see it on both sides of the face.  The lines it made on both sides of the front image.   Top of the head problem is not a problem.\n1. Image is strictly vertical to the horizontal plane\n2. A chin band was used   (not the Sudarium)\nIt is a combination of both factors that the image appears the way it does.   I know I just repeated what Ron just said.\n And for whatever it is worth, The Lord confirmed it with me personally that a chin band was used and the image is strictly vertical to the horizontal plane.  I thought I would ask the person who image is on The Shroud.  That is the answer I got.  I am very aware of the fact that the mental health of a person who claims to have communication with the Spirit of God would be in question for making such a claim.  Nonetheless, I am doing it anyway.   For me this matter is closed and my questions answered.  Thanks for letting me post on this blog.  I really enjoy reading the comments on it.\nMay the Power and Love Eternal of The Holy Spirit Be With You All.

You can do accurate measurements there to whatever accuracy you want, using the zoom and scale tools.  From scaling the distance from nose to occiput (bump on back of head), and comparing the same distance with our own heads, we reckoned that the Shroud cloth was placed quite firmly over the top of the head, so there was virtually no loose fold or gap there. The simplest explanation of why there’s no image of the top of the head is that there was some type of separate head cloth masking the Shroud cloth from the image process. \nThe Soudarion of Oviedo apparently shows blood shed in life, so that it seems to have been a type of mask placed over the head before death, and probably kept in place during the portage to the tomb, possibly to mask the gruesome death rictus of the face. The cloth placed over the head during the burial was likely some kind of other ritual head covering.  There were likely other cloths as well, such as any used for binding the jaw, and to keep the arms in place. \nI had made the same error that Bruce Robinson seems to have made, in assuming that the water stain was the start of the dorsal head image. The regular pattern of the water stains identifies it for what it is.  There are several other errors and presumptions in the Robinson posting, he has a lot of catching up to do to get his facts right. He might start by regularly checking out this blog, as his presumptions would soon be corrected!\n\n","date":"February 28, 2014 at 5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/28/top-of-the-head-puzzle-redux/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-83336","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of the Head Puzzle Redux","post":"For God’s sake, here we go all over again…\n\n","date":"February 28, 2014 at 8:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/28/top-of-the-head-puzzle-redux/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-83385","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of the Head Puzzle Redux","post":"Dave you wrote: “The simplest explanation of why there’s no image of the top of the head is that there was some type of separate head cloth masking the Shroud cloth from the image process.”\n Or archaeologically speaking, the other “simplest explanation” is plants (with ferocious thorns used as pins) and flower heads (used e.g. as fly repellent) were pressed via tightly wrapping-up against the top of the head.\n\n","date":"February 28, 2014 at 10:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/28/top-of-the-head-puzzle-redux/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-83411","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of the Head Puzzle Redux","post":"My point was that such a ritual wrapping would mask the Shroud cloth so that the top of the head would not be imaged onto the cloth.
