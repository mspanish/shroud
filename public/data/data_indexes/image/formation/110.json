[{"title":"Revisiting Rogers’ evaporation concentrations for scorching an image.","post":"Thanks for the onion skin comparison, that the skin of an onion is 1000x thicker than image layer on the Shroud.  Great word picture.  It is hard to articulate to an audience.  One I have been using is as follows:  Each thread is composed of about 200 microfibers.  The image penetrates only the top two AND only effects the top of the fibers.  Therefore the image penetrates less than 1% of a single thread. The impurity layer can best be described as being similar to a soapy film.\n\n","date":"March 13, 2012 at 10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/13/revisiting-rogers-evaporation-concentrations-for-scorching-an-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-9277","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"}]
