[{"title":"ENEA Folks Again? Déjà vu of last December?","post":"Dan, I think this Deja Vu dates back  to some years ago. This is what I wrote last October when you first announced it\n*****************\nThis paper in Applied Optics is a copy of the same paper the authors published in another journal in 2010 (1). I hope that the editor of Journal of Imaging Science and Technology has previously agreed with authors the use of graphics and tables in this new paper. Otherwise, authors may get into problems for violation of copyright, regardless they also authored the previous paper, Even if so, to say the least and to keep polite, the authors do not give any new relevant information and re-sell the same they have done before. Truly sad.\n******************************************\nHere is a non-exhaustive short list of the figures and tables that are the same in both papers\nApplied Optics 2012:Figure 10 is the same as Figure 1 in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 2010.\nApplied Optics 2012:Figure 11 is the same as Figure 2 in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 2010.\nApplied Optics 2012:Figure 8 is the same as Figure 6 in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 2010.\nApplied Optics 2012:Figure 5 is the same as Figure 5 in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 2010.\nApplied Optics 2012:Figure 9 is the same as Figure 9a in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 2010.\nApplied Optics 2012:Table is basically the same as Table 1 in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 2010.\nPage 25 in Applied Optics 2012\n“In summary, our results demonstrate that a short and intense burst of directional VUV\nradiation can color a linen cloth so as to reproduce many of the peculiar characteristics of\nthe image on the Shroud of Turin, including the hue of color, the shallow penetration depth\nof the color, the inhibition of fluorescence.\n”\nPage 040302-6 Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 2010.\n“In summary, our results demonstrate that a short and\nintense burst of directional deep-UV radiation can provide a\nlinen coloration having many peculiar features of the Turin\nShroud image, including hue, coloration of only the outer-\nmost fibers of the linen yarns, and lack of fluorescence.\n”\n*****************************************************\n(1) Paolo Di Lazzaro, Daniele Murra and Antonino Santoni.Deep Ultraviolet Radiation Simulates the Turin\nShroud Image\n.Journal of Imaging Science and Technology 54(4): 040302–040302-6, 2010.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2012 at 7:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/18/enea-folks-again-dj-vu-of-last-december/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-20618","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"ENEA Folks Again? Déjà vu of last December?","post":"I just can say again and again what I just said before:  The results obtained by M. Di Lazzaro and his team (a coloration of the impurities AND of the primary cell wall of the linen fiber) proved what Ray Rogers said concerning any form of energetic radiation:  these radiations are too strong to be able to ONLY colored a thin layer of impurities residing on-top of a linen fiber, which is the most probable hypothesis for the image chromophore on the Shroud.  \nAnd as I know, so far, the only scientist who’s ever been able to accomplish the feat of only producing a coloration similar to the Shroud’s image in a thin layer of impurities without affecting the fiber underneath is Ray Rogers himself while using ammoniac gas.  This fact strongly suggest that the body image on the Shroud was caused by a natural phenomenon.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2012 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/18/enea-folks-again-dj-vu-of-last-december/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-20636","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"ENEA Folks Again?

Déjà vu of last December?","post":"The best Science Fiction is based on pushing the boundaries of credible science.  POF has just got to be Fantasy, likely of the worst kind.  I’d put my money on a rerun of Star Wars any day.  Does anyone remember Buck Rogers and Wilma?  Probably before everyone else was born!  Incidentally NZ is about to score another on-site film project with Joan of Arc – Wonder if the Battle of Poitiers will feature? Or maybe that came afterwards!  Hope everyone enjoys Peter Jackson’s “The Hobbitt”.  Check the backdrop NZ scenery!\n\n","date":"December 19, 2012 at 6:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/18/enea-folks-again-dj-vu-of-last-december/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-20690","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
