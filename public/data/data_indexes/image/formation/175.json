[{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"Paolo Di Lazarro has drawn attention elsewhere to this quote which seems very relevant.\n“Naturally there can be no contradiction of clear scientific data. The Resurrection accounts certainly speak of something outside our world of experience. They speak of something new, something unprecedented — a new dimension of reality that is revealed. What already exists is not called into question. Rather we are told that there is a further dimension, beyond what was previously known. Does that contradict science? Can there really only ever be what there has always been? Can there not be something unexpected, something unimaginable, something new? If there really is a God, is he not able to create a new dimension of human existence, a new dimension of reality altogether? Is not creation actually waiting for this last and highest ―evolutionary leap, for the union of the finite with the infinite, for the union of man and God, for the conquest of death?\nJ. RATZINGER: Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance into Jerusalem to the Resurrection, Ignatius, San Francisco 2011, translated by Philip J. Whitmore from the original German Jesus von Nazareth: Zweiter Teil: Vom Einzug in Jerusalem bis zur Auferstehung, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Vatican City 2011, pp. 246-7.\nThis opens the debate to the issue of the Resurrection, obviously, but so, too, to other possibilities. The speculations of Dr. Andrew Silverman and “New Physics” is a good example. http://www.lightoftheshroud.com/Presentations.html\nYannick, have you given any consideration to how Ray Rogers might have accounted for the homogeneity of the image?  The theory might account for a few square inches. Perhaps even, say, the area of the face.  But to assume that the impurity layer and the transfer mechanism was homogenous over 14ft x 4ft and (probably) acting over parallel planes is stretching credulity further than any alternative.  \nYou paint a picture of a scientist proceeding without any motivation other than to reach a conclusion based only on the available evidence. All scientists in my experience claim this. In practice, they, at best, can impose the strictest self-discipline on themselves to minimize bias.  Ray was “furious” (his word) that STURP was “hi-jacked” and came to be dominated by Jackson’s (in his view “unscientific”) collapse theory.  His avowed motivation was to produce an alternative “rational” explanation.  He was fighting a highly charged “war” with a rival.  Chemistry against physics,  and science versus (his view) pseudo science.  That is a very different reality.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 7:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42869","author":"shroudenigma","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"Quote: “Yannick, have you given any consideration to how Ray Rogers might have accounted for the homogeneity of the image?

Please don’t underestimate the power of nature (which was created by God as you know) to create masterpieces.  We got plenty of good examples of this if you look carefully around us.  And here’s a good example of this: the images of plants, leaves and flowers that are created by the Volckringer pattern phenomenon!  On this subject, I really encourage you to read carefully (and with an open-mind) the very good paper that was written by John DeSalvo about a possible link between this natural phenomenon and the Shroud image: http://shroud.com/pdfs/ssi06part4.pdf\nQuestion for you (and anyone else):  And what if Rogers’ hypothesis could not be coupled with DeSalvo’s own hypothesis in order to explain the Shroud image?  I don’t see why some elements of both hypotheses could not be considered together to build a new natural hypothesis that could maybe explain even better the Shroud image.  On this subject, I think there are some possibilities that some biological substances (like urea and lactic acid for example) were still present on the skin and hair of the Shroud after the probable drying of his intense sweat, which could have taken part in the image formation process by a diffusion mechanism of the molecules of those substances, along possibly with the post-mortem gases described by Rogers.  I think it’s fair to assume that there is a real possibility that such a mixture of gases and molecules could well have taken part in the final formation of the image.  Until some scientist can investigate properly and in-deep all these possible avenues, I think it’s intelligent to leave this door open for the moment…  Remember that it is even possible to think that a fine coach of urea that would have been left on the dry skin and hair of the Shroud man after the drying of the intense sweat could also have produced a release of ammoniac gas as well…\nBy in the end, the most important question we must answer to determine if a natural process should be seen as the most rational and probable thing that lead to the formation of the body image is the question of the chromophore of the image.  And as I said in my guess posting, in face of all the pertinent data and observations coming from the Shroud I never encountered so far a better, simpler and more rational hypothesis than Rogers’ own impurity hypothesis.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 2:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42909","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"Complement to the last paragraph of my answer to Mr. Rolfe:  Because I really think Rogers’ hypothesis versus the impurities is the best concerning the question of the image chromophore and because I think it is the best to explain all the characteristic of the image (especially the discontinuous and very superficial aspect of the image), that’s why I think it is scientifically sound to conclude, just like Rogers, that the image formation was most probably natural.  On this question, we must always keep in mind this great quote from Rogers: “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source: the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non-image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” \nTaking this fact into account, if the image chromophore is truly located in a thin and uneven layer of impurities on top of the most superficial fibers of the cloth, then the conclusion must be that the image formation was most probably natural in nature.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42938","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"Excellent summary and analysis.  I will confess to being guilty as charged as one who holds to a “magical” explanation.  One of the reasons is that Rogers himself wasn’t convinced that the maillard reaction alone could explain the high resolution image we see especially of the face and hands. Second, it is hard to imagine that gas emitting from a decaying body could produce an image of identical intensity top to bottom and front to back.  Others who have experimented or explored this theory have also indicated that such emission of gases would be more pronounced around bodily orifices but this is not the case.  Rogers did not support any supernatural cause of the image yet he acknowledged that the lack of decomposition stains on the cloth supported the resurrection hypothesis.  Unless we assume that the body was stolen and the cloth left behind…or that Jesus woke up found Mary Magdalene and headed for the coast of France, then somehow and in some way the body literally disappeared.  There are too many verses of scripture that suggest light was involved.  So while current experiments with lasers don’t explain everything neither does gas emitting from a decaying body.

Also, I can say that, on the contrary of you and many others, it was even harder for Rogers to imagine the dead body of the Shroud man being able to release some energetic radiation that would have been able to colored ONLY a thin layer of impurities without affecting at all the entire structure of the underlying linen fiber and so, no matter if some parts of the body were in direct-contact with the cloth and some other parts were located at some distance from it (up to maybe 4 cm)…\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 3:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42914","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"Quote: “Rogers did not support any supernatural cause of the image yet he acknowledged that the lack of decomposition stains on the cloth supported the resurrection hypothesis.”\nMy answer:  I don’t if Rogers really was thinking that the lack of decomposition stains was truly a piece of evidence in support of the Resurrection account (again, I’ve never read anything of that nature in any of Rogers’ writings), but one very important point has to be make here:  Even if Jesus’ Resurrection is true (as I believe it is), that cannot be seen, scientifically speaking, as any kind of evidence that this particular event had anything to do with the formation of the body image on the cloth.  Here, I think it’s good to reprint a new though I wrote this morning about Rogers’ new paper: “It’s also important to note that because it is a proven fact that a dehydration of ONLY a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities located around a linen fiber is almost impossible to achieve with any sort of energetic radiation, and because all the data coming from the Shroud (especially the fact that the bloodstains were not affected at all during the image formation) strongly suggest that the image formation was very mild, I’m almost sure that this is why Rogers became convinced that a totally natural process (which he was still seeking to fully determined at the time of his death) was really what have caused the formation of a very faint image on the cloth. In sum, the strong conviction of Rogers that the body image color must only reside in a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities, which would be completely independent from the entire structure of the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall of the fiber) is the most important thing that lead him to conclude that the image formation process was most certainly totally natural. I think it’s fair to say that, in Rogers’ mind, the most probable nature of the image chromophore (i.e. an impurity layer) was the most crucial data to consider when it was time for him to determine the particular nature of the image formation process (i.e. natural and very mild or supernatural and much more “strong” because it would be related to some form of energetic radiation). And here’s the most relevant statement made by Rogers to explain why a thin layer of impurities as the image chromophore should automatically lead to the conclusion that the image formation process must have been natural and very mild: “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source: the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non-image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” We can find this particular quote in the paper The Shroud of Turin from the viewpoint of the physical science published by Emmanuel Carreira in 2010.”\nAll this to say that even if Jesus body truly disappeared from Inside the Shroud during the Resurrection, that cannot be taken as any serious evidence to think that his body image that we see on his shroud was formed by anything else than a natural process.  Remember this great truth (which is an integrant part of the Christian faith):  Jesus body was a dead body before he resurrect and disappear from Inside the shroud!  This is an important part of the Incarnation dogma that most people sadly seem to deny, forget or underestimate.  And because it is a very probable reality that his body was a dead meat for several hours prior to his Resurrection, I don’t see why this tortured corpse could not have emitted any biological substances that could have taken a huge part in the formation of the body image…  So far, there is nothing in all the Shroud data to really contradict such a possibility.  Sorry for those who are only seeking something supernatural on the Shroud…\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 3:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42921","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"An extract from my article written in polish:\n“Ale wizerunek jest.

How is it possible to create such an unusual image not denying the statistical laws of thermodynamics? Rogers concluded that there is no point in considering this problem, just happened to such an incredible event and we can only investigate a posteriori how it naturally happened (this does not mean that the theory of Rogers denies the resurrection, just does not take it into account) .

Until that time, they were unanimous in declaring the image to be a feature of the shroud itself, and were confident that no coating of any kind was involved, even though “we expected to find starch on the shroud.” I do not find the discovery of an entirely superficial layer of starch created by an evaporation gradient very convincing, although I agree that it would be a convenient explanation.\nThe idea that the expectation of finding starch on the shroud meant that they didn’t look for it, is ludicrous. Rogers’s photo of a few blue strands resulting from the evaporation of a ‘very dilute solution of a blue dye’ is interesting, but needs to be supplemented by experiments involving a rather less dilute solution of something starchy to contribute to an explanation of the shroud image. We also need to consider what should happen when the toasted coating was subsequently subject to a soaking in water, as evinced by the water-stains.\nRogers concluded by believing that “a combination of relatively rapid decomposing impurities on the surface of the cloth, with transfer/diffusion of catalytic compounds from a body” could account for the image. The relevance of his sideline into thermal radiation direction, and his mention of calculating “the temperature of a surface that would be sufficient to caramelise any of the possible sugars or starches on a cloth” is thus somewhat dubious. It reads as though as least some of his mind was on thermal, rather than chemical, degradation.\nOne thing that Rogers explains well, and which I believe to be true, exactly contradicts Mottern, London and Morris’s paper on the X-ray examination of the shroud. He says, of the manufacture of Holland cloth: “Considerable material was lost during the bleaching process, and the newer linens are less dense, as can be seen with the Holland cloth. The newer linens are also homogeneous. They do not show bands of different thread in the weave.”\nMottern et al agree that “the holland cloth is a more loosely woven fabric than the linen,” but then say: “A few measurements indicate that the linen threads [of the shroud] are rather uniform 0.15mm. In contrast the thread diameters of the holland cloth vary from 0.1 to 0.45mm.” They also say: “The bands of high and low densities which run along the length and across the width are the result of the different thread diameters of the backing cloth. … In contrast, the linen threads are more uniform in diameter.” Mottern et al also describe the holland cloth as cotton. Although Rogers was referring to colour and Mottern to thread thickness, their divergent opinions of the homogeneity of the two cloths are irreconcilable.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42882","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"Quote: “The idea that the expectation of finding starch on the shroud meant that they didn’t look for it, is ludicrous.”\nMy answer: STURP main purpose was to check out the painting hypothesis regarding the Shroud image.  That’s probably why they never check out for the presence of starch, although Rogers was clear in later writings that McCrone had already reported a probable presence of starch on some Shroud fibers during his microscopic inquiry of the samples that were taken by Rogers.  Note that it’s a bit bizarre that Rogers didn’t said a word about that in his 2001 paper, but later on, he was very specific about that.  Also, you must understand that Rogers eventually did exactly what he wrote in his 2001 paper, which is that he went on checking out for starch and, guess what?  He was able to confirm McCrone’s claim about that!\nIf you read carefully my paper about Rogers’ observations and conclusions regarding the image (http://shroudnm.com/docs/2013-01-10-Yannick-Clément-Reflections-on-Ray-Rogers-Shroud-Work.pdf), you will find these important statements made by Rogers about the presence of starch impurities on the Shroud:\nQuote #35: “The fact that the color resides only on the fiber surfaces leads to the hypothesis that the color formed as a result of chemical reactions involving impurities on the surface. The spectra strongly suggest that the impurities were carbohydrates that dehydrated as a result of image-formation process. The hypothesis of carbohydrates impurities is supported by observations of traces of some starch fractions on image fibers.”\nQuote #36: “Microchemical tests with iodine detected the presence of starch impurities on the surfaces of linen fibers from the Shroud. Impurities were detected that could take part in color-producing Maillard reactions.”\nQuote #37: “A search for carbohydrate impurities on the Shroud confirmed McCrone’s detection of some starch fractions. Starch and low-molecular weight carbohydrates from crude startch would color much more easily than would cellulose as a result of either thermal dehydration or chemical reactions.”\nThere is no good reason to doubt these statements from Rogers (especially when you understand that starch was not found by just one researcher but by two independent researchers), which strongly support his hypothesis about the image chromophore, which is the corner stone of his whole Maillard reaction hypothesis and which strongly suggest that a totally natural process was what has formed the image on the cloth.  Important note to conclude my point:  whether this image formation process only came from post-mortem gases and a release of heat from the body and/or from some other biological or burial substances that could have been present around the corpse and/or from some other “facilitating” factor, that remains to be verify more deeply under proper lab control.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42951","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"Additional comment:  Here’s some more very relevant quotes from Rogers’ writings about the starch issue:\nQuote 141: “When amines and reducing sugars come together, they will react.

There is very good reason, therefore, to doubt either Rogers’s post-2000 work, or his and STURP’s 1978 work. Would you care to speculate which one is wrong?”\nHugh, in this “new” paper from Rogers, I think you you can find a pretty good explanation for why the post-2000 finding of starch claimed by himself (which confirmed a previous microscopic conclusion made by McCrone) is most probably correct and it doesn’t necessarily contradict the conclusions you quote from his STURP paper. \nThis comes from the fact that the detection of carbohydrate impurities like starch in the context of the ancient method of manufacturing linen cloths was not part of the official STURP test plan, which means that Rogers and other STURP members did not build specific chemical tests to detect this particular substance, especially on non-image fibers. Rogers was very specific about that in page 6 of his “new” paper: “We expected to find starch on the Shroud (here, Rogers certainly means in non-image areas), so we did not specifically look for it.”  And he had: “We should have tested for starch and other polysaccharides.” This must be understand like this: Back in the STURP days, he and others scientists from STURP should have designed a microchemical test plan to detect residues of starch, saponaria and other possible polysaccharides (like hemicellulose and pectin residues) that could have been left on the top surface of the cloth (in a layer of various sort of carbohydrate impurities) by the ancient manufacturing method that was used to make the cloth, which could have been dehydrated (colored) by the very mild (and probably natural) image formation process, instead of just checking out if the image fibers could have been artificially colored by a starch-based painting media (which is something totally different, chemically speaking, than a dehydration of starch and other carbohydrate residues by some “catalytic compounds” like post-mortem gases).\nIn sum, McCrone check specifically for things like starch because he had in mind to prove the Shroud had been painted and starch could have been used in the painting media, and he found some but, on the contrary to his idea that such a substance had been used to paint the Shroud, Rogers explained in his later writings that such residues would most probably have been left on the fibers by the ancient method of making linen cloths (with starch that was used to protect the threads during the weaving) and not because of a painting forgery (note that the bloodstains on the cloth are enough to discard any painting hypothesis while showing that the Shroud is a real burial cloth that was used to bury a real crucified body).\nNote also that most of the quotes from the STURP paper of Rogers concern specifically the painting hypothesis (which was the primary goal of STURP). This means that Rogers had most probably designed a microchemical test plan to see if some starch-based painting media could be detected in image fibers (which was one part of the whole “check the painting theory” build by STURP) and if such a media could be the cause of the color of the image.  Obviously, he wasn’t able to confirm the presence of such a painting media that would be responsible for the color.  In the meantime, he or any other STURP member never did a specific microchemical examination of the non-image fibers of the Shroud samples (especially in non-image area) in order to detect or not the presence of starch fractions (or other polysaccharides) that could have been left on those fibers by the ancient method of making linen cloths, for the simple and good reason that, back then, no one had in mind that the image color could have been located in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that would have been made partially of starch. On the contrary, back then, every members of STURP was almost sure the image chromophore was located directly inside the structure of the linen fiber, because (among other things) they were able to totally discard any painting hypotheses (including the idea of a painting forgery that would have been made with a starch-based painting media)…  \nI think this is the most logical and probable explanation for this apparent discrepancy (only apparent but most probably not real) between the paper Rogers wrote for STURP and his post-2000 writings.  In sum, back in the STURP days, he and all the other scientists of the team had not thought of designing a specific microchemical test plan to verify the presence of possible traces of starch, saponaria and other possible carbohydrate in non-image area that could have proved the presence of a thin layer of impurities on the top-most fibers of the cloth, thus giving us a pretty good confirmation that this is really were the image color is located on the Shroud (image chromophore).  \nAnd when, after 2000, Rogers made new chemical tests that were more specifically designed to detect the presence of traces of starch and saponaria, he came out hitting 1 for 2, as he was able to confirm McCrone detection of some strach fractions, while he wasn’t able to find traces of saponaria, even though he was able to find some circumstantial pieces of evidence that can support the real presence of such substance in the thin layer of impurities that was probably colored during the image formation process.  One thing’s for sure: this confirmation of the presence of starch residues on top of some superficial fibers on the Shroud, along with the observation of ghosts of color and the banding effect, strongly support the idea that the image chromophore is located only in a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities and that no part of the fiber structure was colored during the image formation process, which, if this is correct, MUST have been very mild in order to color only this kind of unstable carbohydrate layer, while not affecting at all the underlying fiber (including the external part of the fiber, i.e. the primary cell wall).  Concerning this, Rogers was very clear about the fact that if the color is really located in this kind of thin layer of impurities (as he proposed), then this means that we can forget any image formation process that would involved some form of energetic radiation (including the UV light, the corona discharge and the earthquake hypotheses of Di Lazzaro, Fanti and DeLiso).\n\n","date":"September 7, 2013 at 6:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-43202","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"I think your summary is quite excellent because it discusses this former theory in light of other theories, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of many of the theories and also highlighting good science compared to no science.

Even though the whole portrait given by the numerous data and observations coming from the Shroud (in my guess posting, I’ve mentioned the most important ones) really point in the direction of a natural formation of the image (most probably coming from some biological substances released by the dead body or already present on his skin and hair), which was related to a very mild image formation process that most probably didn’t implied an important release of heat and/or energy, people still wants (seem to me that this is at all cost) to keep on believing in a supernatural cause for the image that would be related directly to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and, consequently, would give them a sure proof of this event.\nMore deeply, the major part of all the comments regarding my guess posting really give me the strong impression that most “shroudies” (by the way, I hate that very American way of talking of someone interested in the Shroud – Sounds like “treekies” to me) are associating the question of the authenticity of the relic with the Hollywoodish idea that the Resurrection of Christ (its “dematerialization” if you will) must have produced a release of energy of some sort. Their thinking can be summarized like this: If the Shroud is really authentic, then the “mysterious” image on it MUST be directly related to the Resurrection of Christ. It cannot have come from anything else than a supernatural burst of energy coming from the corpse, which was in its “Resurrectional” mode. And, even worst, I can sense that many of these people are even thinking something like this (which has absolutely no sense to me): If the Shroud is authentic and the image on it came from a totally natural process, then this could mean that Jesus’ Resurrection did not really happened. \nPersonally, I think that this is a very bad way to look at the Shroud, because this kind of thinking really open the door very wide to the strong temptation to put aside (or not really considering with true rationality) all the pertinent data that really point in the direction of a natural cause for the image, mainly due to a fear (conscious or not) that such a natural cause could really be true. Here’s an example of such data that are pointing strongly in favor of a natural process for the image formation: The very probable location of the chromophore in a thin layer of impurities (honestly, I think Rogers has given us well enough solid arguments to place this hypothesis in no.1 place concerning the chromophore question) really makes it almost impossible to think that any form of energetic radiation (related to the Resurrection or not) could have produced this very subtle, superficial and discontinuous coloration everywhere on the cloth (no matter if the body was in direct contact with the cloth in some places and as far as 4 cm away from it in other places). Here’s another one: the fact that the bloodstains were not affected at all by the image formation process, along with the discontinuous and very superficial aspect of the image strongly suggest that the image formation process was very mild and that it happened at normal temperature with no release of a high amount of energy. As Fazio and Mandaglio wrote (along with another researcher named Roberto) in a short paper that was published in 2012 in the British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter (link: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n75part10.pdf): “Nowadays, we know that a slight transfer of energy triggered a stochastic process.” Note: this is a kind of process that can cause an image that is discontinuous and very superficial like the one on the Shroud and that can only be natural in nature (in a paper entitled “Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image”, these 2 Italian scientists were very clear on this question and there’s no doubt that Ray Rogers would have agreed with them about that). And in the same BSTS Newsletter paper I just mentioned, they emphasized this conclusion by saying: “The Shroud body image, produce over many years (e.g. a few decades), is natural. Therefore, to explain the image formation we do not need to say that it was a miracle and we can rule out the medieval forgery hypothesis.” And they also said: “…the UV radiation, the corona discharge and the attempts made to demonstrate a forgery must be excluded.” \nAlso, the idea that if the Shroud is authentic, the body image that we see on it must be directly related to the Resurrection leaves the door wide open for every possible supernatural concepts (which, as I said before, often rests on a magical thinking, which, by nature, is truly unscientific) that could make believe that the image was really formed at the time of the Resurrection. \nFinally, and it’s a shame for a Christian like me: This kind of thinking seems to completely put aside (or forget or even denied) the reality of God’s Incarnation in our humanity! One thing’s for sure: For me (who is also a Christian who believe in the reality of Jesus’ Resurrection), the Shroud is a burial cloth showing the bloody stigmata and the body image of a dead Jesus in a total state of rigor mortis, which makes me feel strongly that the image on the cloth is most probably related much more to the Incarnation of God than to his Resurrection! Here, it’s important to state this very loud: this probable fact shouldn’t be seen as a denial of the reality of Jesus’ Resurrection in any way! \nHaving said this, I really think that the “supernatural” fans out there should try for a second to forget about the Resurrection when it comes to reflect upon the image of a dead Jesus that we see on the Shroud and concentrate much more on the very important concept of the Incarnation of God in our humanity. Effectively, most people interested in the Shroud (most of them being faithful Christians) seems to forget that before his body disappeared from inside the Shroud (as well as from inside the tomb), Jesus’ body was dead like any other body would be after a Roman crucifixion and this dead state of Jesus’ body was still an integrand part of God’s Incarnation!  As such, there should be absolutely no theological or philosophical problem for anyone interested in the Shroud (especially the Christians) to consider the idea of a natural formation of the body image with great peace, knowing that, if this is really how the image of a dead Jesus got on the cloth, this would NOT AT ALL be a fact that could put the Christian concept of the Resurrection of Christ in jeopardy, while, at the same time, it would emphasize even more the Christian concept of the Incarnation of God in our humanity, which is a reality that speak about who God really is as loud as the Resurrection!\nUnfortunately, this is not what I normally see in most blog comments, especially when it comes to talk about a probable natural cause for the body image… I really think those persons should really ask themselves these good questions: \nWhat would be the problem for your Christian faith if the body image on the Shroud would be directly related with the Incarnation of God instead of the Resurrection of Christ? \nHow would this be a problem for the Christian concept of Resurrection?  \nAnd why would the idea of a body image produced by the dead body of Christ (which is a possibility that is still somehow related to the concept of the Incarnation) BEFORE the happening of his Resurrection would not be possible in your mind or, worse, would be problematic for you and your faith?\nAnd why would such a scenario (i.e. a natural image formation process that was active before the Resurrection) be in contradiction with the reality of Christ’s Resurrection or be in contradiction with the idea that this Shroud and its body image were really part of God’s plan for each one of us who would eventually be interested and fascinated by this relic, even though he didn’t needed, to accomplish such a plan, to rely on some supernatural powerful means but on the natural laws that he created?\nAnd here’s the most crucial questions of them all: Is it possible that, since the conclusion of the STURP inquiry, most people have completely passed by the most profound message the Shroud had to give us by thinking that this relic is mainly speaking about the Resurrection of Christ while, in reality, there are some very good chances that the Shroud, with its image that probably come from a natural interaction between the dead body of Christ and the cloth, is speaking primarily of the Passion and death of Jesus Christ and, by implication, of the Incarnation of God in our humanity (without putting aside the Resurrection of Christ that immediately followed this natural process of image formation)?  \nBefore answering this question, I think you should read and reflect upon the great article written by Father Peter Rinaldi in June 1934 and entitled “The Holy Shroud” (link: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rinaldi1934.pdf), in which you will clearly see that, back then (and up until at least the STURP days), most Christians (and even serious Shroud researchers like Barbet, who was able to analyze the Shroud while leaving his faith in his back pocket) were understanding the main message coming from the Shroud exactly that way (i.e. as a relic that’s mainly speaking about the Passion and death of Christ, well before his Resurrection).\nIn sum, is it possible that the Shroud, with its body image of a dead, beaten, tortured and crucified Christ in rigor mortis and its bloody stigmata, is speaking first and foremost about the Passion, death and Incarnation of Christ (in other words, of his human nature that would have been able to left a natural and graphic body and bloody imprint on the cloth, which represent the greatness of his love for all humanity), much more than his Resurrection or his divine nature (even if it really does in the end but surely not as clearly and not as directly)? More profoundly, is it possible that the most important message of the Shroud talks primarily of the greatness of the love of God for all humanity much more than his own personal Resurrection, while showing us in graphic details where such a God was willing to go with his human body in order to reveal us this awesome and eternal truth: His merciful love for all humanity (Christians or not, “good” or “bad”, that doesn’t matter to him) has absolutely no limit at all when it’s time to save even the most lost of his children and, consequently, we have absolutely no good and rational reasons to fear such a loving and merciful God (even though most people, Christians included, still do even today)?\nAnd in the end, is it possible that the body image that we see on the Shroud (along with all the bloodstains on it) can really be a real and great SIGN of the Incarnation of God (a real and complete incarnation in our humanity with a real human body that can suffer and die like the body of every other human being, which therefore could surely have emitted some “catalytic compounds” that could have colored the surface of the cloth soon before and/or soon after his death) instead of being, like many people today desperately wants to see (even if it’s simply not there), a real and sure PROOF of Christ’s Resurrection?\nAnd here’s a final and important question for all the Christians interested by the Shroud: If the answer to all those questions (or even just a few) should be “yes”, what would be the problem for your faith in Christ (including your faith in his Resurrection)?\nI hope those who will read this comment of mine (especially those who are thinking the Shroud image cannot have come from anything else than the Resurrection event) will at least take some time to ask themselves seriously those questions and, more importantly, will reflect with an open mind upon the possibility that the formation of the body image of a dead Jesus that we see on the Shroud could be related directly, not to the Resurrection of Christ, but to his Passion, death and, by extension, to his divine Incarnation in our humanity and therefore, could really come from a natural interaction that happened between his human corpse and the cloth in which he had been placed after his death…  \nI think such a concept, which reinforce the conviction that the Shroud is truly an authentic burial cloth and that it is truly associated with Jesus of Nazareth, while never putting the reality of Christ’s Resurrection in jeopardy in any way, deserve some serious thoughts, especially in the light of all the pertinent data coming from the Shroud, which strongly suggest that the body image of a dead Jesus that we see on the cloth has been formed by a totally natural process that still need to be fully describe and reproduce.  \nImportant note to conclude (which is mainly for all the anti-Rogers folks out there): Whether or not a Maillard reaction, in the way it was proposed by Rogers, can have taken part in this still undetermined but natural process is another story that shouldn’t interfered here.  \nYannick Clément, Louiseville, Québec.\nP.S. : When I look at the Shroud, I see, first and foremost, an image of a dead and crucified Jesus that mainly speak of his Incarnation in our humanity and, therefore, I don’t see any good reason why such an image could not have been caused naturally by his human corpse (especially by the fact that his body was tortured so bad before his death). And when I analyze all the pertinent data and observations that have been collected over the years versus the Shroud image, the fact that there is none of them that need to be link with the Hollywoodish notion of what should has been the Resurrection of Christ (i.e. a supernatural and extraordinary event that must have been accompanied with a burst of energy of some sort) in order to get explained just reinforce my way to understand the most important message coming from the Shroud and its image of a dead Jesus in rigor mortis (i.e. as the greatest sign of the reality of the Incarnation of God in our humanity and, by implication, the greatest sign of the unconditional love of God for every one of his children (Christians or not, “good” or “bad”, that doesn’t matter to him) that we all are).\n\n","date":"September 10, 2013 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-43603","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)","post":"I can’t help chuckling at the inadvertent irony of Yannick posting a new ‘guess’ posting after his previous ‘guess’ posting!
