Not entirely Mr.Klotz. The sweat-imprint idea, prompted by the Veronica-like addition to the Machy mould is to be found in postings I did back in February. But there was no mention of “forgery” because it seemed at least a possibility that the body image had originally represented a “scorched ” Templar as a memento of the pogrom and 1314 executions by slow roasting. It’s Charles who has made me abandon that hypothesis, telling us we have to see the TS as just another painting. Charles has made me take a fresh look at the body image, detail by detail, looking not only for what features are portrayed, but – just as important – what is not. Methinks the artist/artisan was going out of his way to signal that the image was NOT to be seen as a portrait, but as a somewhat idealized  full body version of the Veil of Veronica, i.e. a passive imprint of body relief, NOT a painting.

The too- good -to- be- true scourge marks are a case in point. \nAllow me to explain. Having decided at the outset that the body image was to be restricted to skin and hair (sweat-laden hair supposedly behaving essentially like sweat-coated skin) a decision had to be made re wounds. Do open wounds sweat? No, they leak blood, but don’t sweat. So there are no wounds visible anywhere on the body image (don’t let anyone tell you otherwise).  Committee resolution: wound sites have to be identified entirely by blood That’s no problem as regards nail wounds, lance wound, crown of thorns wounds etc where a copious blood flow can be imagined and then suitably executed. It’s those scourge wounds that are the problem, How much blood do you apply to each tiny scourge wound site? Add too much and it’s then no longer clear that it’s a scourge wound. So what we have are all those production line dumbbell-shaped blood imprints looking for all the world as if they had been applied by an ink-jet printer – precisely metered amounts just enough to show the shape of the business end of a Roman flagrum and no more. But that’s not how real wounds behave. Some scourge wounds would bleed more than others. Committee resolution: don’t be too perfectionist. The average pilgrim isn’t. It’s first impressions that count.\nAs I say, the TS image has (metaphorical) human fingerprints all over it – from clever, meticulous, self-disciplined fingers to be sure, working to a rigid protocol, but human ones all the same. The end result had to be minimalist, credible and seemingly realistic, but not too much so, more an exercise in technology  with any art highly rationed and ‘stylized’.   \nYes, I’m more and more inclined to think the TS was a committee job, probably involving a sizeable investment and lengthy gestation period – maybe years rather than months with much fine tuning to achieve the desired end result.\n\n","date":"November 18, 2014 at 12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-171902","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint","post":"Hello Colin\nWhat kind of fine tuning would a passive imprint of body relief require?\n\n","date":"November 18, 2014 at 12:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-171905","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint","post":"It depends on the mechanism of imprinting Louis. If using heat from a template, then it’s important to get a minimalist scorch that does not go through to the reverse side, or which produces too obvious “burn” marks on the top surface – just faint yellow or tan coloration. There must not be excessive lateral distortion from the wraparound effect, though a little can be tolerated. \nThe difficult bits out of plane with the long axis (notably feet) must be imaged but not excessively so. The neck/chin area is tricky – very tricky. That prominent transverse baked-in crease may be there for a purpose, perhaps to distract from a unnatural look that comes from imprinting a 2D image from abrupt changes in relief on a 3D template or to suggest kinking of the linen as the reason for anomalies. \nThe intensity of the frontal and dorsal images must be very nearly the same. There must be a severe cut-off at both sides of the face, since it’s been decided (committee resolution) that  “sides” don’t image. By the same token the top of the head won’t leave an image, being a kind of “side” so the gap between the frontal and dorsal head must be just right for credibility, given it’s a single immobile body that is being imaged in a “thought experiment”.\nThe eyes are critical. There has to be just the right amount of image intensity to suggest weakly imaged closed eyes (weak because of difficulty of imprinting from recessed features set back in a cavity). Too much image intensity might suggest the eyes were open.

I was wondering when you would be along to fire your customary broadside. You raise a number of points, too many to address in a single comment. Let’s just take the first, re the Veronica not being a sweat imprint but a miraculous image.\nFirst, I think you are putting the cart before the horse. Let’s start with the horse, first, and see what wiki has to say, not because it’s always the ultimate source of wisdom, but because it’s most people’s first port of call, so is unlikely to say anything that has hugely offended common sense (which is the crucial issue here in my view – common sense, not specialist historical or theological knowledge).\nI’ve bolded up the words that in my view make it reasonable to assume that the Veronica image WAS seen as, first and foremost, a sweat imprint IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. To deny that, or dismiss it as irrelevant, seems unhelpful to say the least.\nThe Veil of Veronica, or Sudarium (Latin for sweat-cloth), often called simply “The Veronica” and known in Italian as the Volto Santo or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved crucifix Volto Santo of Lucca) is a Catholic relic of a piece of cloth, which, according to legend, bears the likeness of the face of Jesus not made by human hand (i.e. an Acheiropoieton). Various existing images have been claimed to be the “original” relic, or early copies of it, but the evidently legendary nature of the story means that there are many fewer people, even among traditional Catholics, who treat claims of actual authenticity very seriously compared to the comparable relic of the Turin Shroud.\nThe final form of the Western legend recounts that Saint Veronica from Jerusalem encountered Jesus along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin sudor) off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by the Sixth Station of the Stations of the Cross. According to some versions, Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor Tiberius and the veil possesses miraculous properties, being able to quench thirst, cure blindness, and sometimes even raise the dead.\nAs I say, a sweat imprint in the first instance. That does not prevent it being somehow miraculously upgraded to a spectacular portrait if one is minded to do so. I’m sure generations of artists were only to happy to assist that upgrading, given that sweat imprints per se offer limited opportunities to show of their artistic skills. But let’s not overlook one thing – there is no biblical basis for the Veronica anecdote, and thus no compelling reason for the man or woman on the Clapham omnibus to believe that any relic described as the Veil of Veronica had any miraculous origins. It’s just a legend.\n14th century entrepreneurs may simply have seized upon that legend as a pretext for fabricating a burial shroud with a  FAINT NEGATIVE IMAGE of a recently deceased man that would be immediately perceived as some kind of imprint, one that would be assumed to be made by sweat, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, as per the then celebrated Veil of Veronica.  But making that connection, i.e. imprint -> Veronica -> sweat needed some extra help, which will lead on (tomorrow) to my second response to your comment, namely the appearance of that Christ-like face above the word SUAIRE on the Machy mould. We can discuss tomorrow whether the eyes are open or closed, and much else besides, though I somehow suspect this discussion is going to lead nowhere,  it being down to individual interpretation.  \nThose who see the TS as the genuine burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth are making  an interpretation, and must not be surprised at the existence of counter-interpretations, especially those like mine that have a strong (though not exclusive) scientific basis and are based on a now lengthy period of intensive study and research. It will take more than statements of others’ opinion or interpretation to shift me from mine, unless they come up with new authoritative information or data, which you, TH, if you will forgive my saying, have so far failed in your comment thus far to deliver.\n\n","date":"November 18, 2014 at 6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-171953","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint","post":"PS  Here’s an article featuring the Veronica that appeared in the popular press just over 3 years ago. \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2022329/Priceless-Veil-Veronica-painting-shows-true-face-Christ-recovered-woman-burgles-mobile-home-tries-sell-church.html\nThe only reason for mentioning it now is that it attempts to make clear the relationship between an initial “imprint” and later more attractive versions, stating that the initial imprint was “copied” by artists, thus preserving for posterity the “likeness” of Jesus. Based on that I think it’s a mistake to place too much emphasis or credence on the narrative that would have us believe that the imprinting aspect is an irrelevance, that there was some kind of instant or even slow motion one miracle that of itself generated a high quality image without artists needing to become involved. Once the latter happens, and paint starts flowing freely, things tend to spin rapidly out of control, the end results of which are currently plain for all to see. I refer to Charles Freeman’s claim that the TS initially showed a  “Crown of Thorns”  that one can see in later painted copies, and that ipso facto there must have been a crown of thorns on the original TS that has since  (selectively!) faded from view.\nWhat seems more likely, indeed certain, is that there was a Veronica like process, where an initial image that was at best a mere imprint gradually acquired further embellishment with each new generation of artists, so that blood on forehead or in hair from presumed thorns and their wounds, the latter not imaged, was considered insufficient, making unreasonable demands on the average pilgrim’s interpretive skills. Thus it was argued it was perfectly legitimate to insert the ‘missing’ crown of thorns as a visual aid. In time the distinctions between fact and fancy became progressively blurred.\n(Turning that on its head, one feels that Charles as a historian really had no business in back projecting from later copies of the TS to the original in the way that he did, knowing as he should the nature of artistic licence, especially as regards devotional art)\n\n","date":"November 19, 2014 at 2:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-171996","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint","post":"What Colin has made clear with his mention of artists, the embellishment of images ,etc,etc, is that he is in the realm of history of art.

The family was of course French and supported the anti-pope at Avignon, Clement VII having a family connection to them.

Clearly the de Charnys felt they were not too off major routes to attract visitors, and lots of them. Some might think they knew they were onto a winner. Time proved them correct, spectacularly successful in fact, overlooking that initial difficulty they had with the local bishop with his unhelpful view that the TS was a forgery that had been  “cunningly” painted. Why did you omit to mention that crucial adverb “cunningly” from your article Charles, stating it was simply dismissed as a painting or that the TS was immediately seen as a “forgery”, not a mere prop or work of art? \nIn fact Lirey and Troyes are just 120 or so miles south-east of Paris, on a major route leading to the Alps, the Mediterranean  and, among other places,  Rome – hardly the back of beyond.

I say the pilgrim needed a little help in the visual aid department, and what better way to achieve that than to add a image to a new badge above the word SUAIRE that while possibly referring to the image on the Shroud, though with no encouragement to do so (no blood, crown of thorns etc) may have been there to work via the power of association.

I don’t remember discussing this recently, but if it’s old hat I’ve no doubt daveb or OK can rustle up the last time. There is a presumption that, if the Shroud is a natural formation from a dead body, he would probably have had his eyes closed, but if an artificial creation, then I think there is nothing in the image itself that says whether his eyes are open or shut apart from the lack of distinct irises. If they were painted on, then we are off into Charles’s flaking off issues, but if the image derived ffrom a bas relief – what would the irises have looked like then? Veronicas are usually shown with open eyes, and the Shroud is almost invariably described as having “staring” eyes. Did anybody describe the eyes of the man in the shroud as shut before the negative image was discovered?

My record of notes taken:\nVeronica:  Father Heinrich Pfeiffer, Jesuit and Professor of Iconology and History of Christian Art at the Gregorian University of Rome, thinks the veil of Manoppello is the Roman Veronica. According to the historic reconstruction, Veronica, called “acheiropoietos”, reached Constantinople in VI century (coming from Jerusalem and then from Camelia, in Cappadocia). It stayed there until 705, when it disappeared mysteriously, perhaps to save it from the iconoclastic movements of the time. It was in Rome under Pope Gregorio; after several vicissitudes, it was carried into St Peter’s Cathedral, becoming an important destination for thousands pilgrims. After the demolition of the chapel where Veronica was held, in 1608, no trace of the veil was found. The veil appeared in Manoppello is thought to be the historic and legendary Veronica.  \nItalian chronicler Matteo Villani reported that the Veronica was exhibited in Rome in 1350, and from Christmas to Easter there were constantly around 1 million pilgrims.  So clearly it was rediscovered after its being hidden from iconoclasts in 705, assuming it was indeed the same object.  Colin’s comments about attracting pilgrim tourists would seem to be to the point.  \nManoppello Veil:  According to the tradition based on a historic account written by Father Donato from Bomba in 1640, it arrived in Manoppello on an unknown day in the year 1506, when the physicist and astrologer Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, while was talking with some people, met a foreign man. He was invited to follow him into the Church. He received a mysterious wrapped veil. He should have taken care of the mysterious object. In return he would have got material and spiritual advantages. While Father Donato was unrolling the veil, thus discovering the image of Christ, the foreign man disappeared.  \nIt might seem a reasonable conjecture then that sometime before 1608, possibly as early as 1506, the Veronica veil was uplifted from its place in the chapel, and soon afterwards disposed of in Manoppello by a person unknown, for what reasons can only be surmised. \nOne plausible reason that occurs to me, is that the perpetrator may well have thought he was doing a holy deed and saving the relic from a corrupt papal court.  The saintly Savanorola had been executed (hanged and burnt) in 1498, and the Borgia Pope Alexander VI had died only in 1503.  The year of the relic’s alleged arrival in Manoppello 1506 seems suggestive.  Its subsequent history is hardly edifying.  \nFr Donato’s 1640 chronicle continues: From 1506, the veil stayed at the Leonelli family for almost one hundred years; but in 1608 the several heirs started to contend for it. Pancrazio Petrucci, a soldier, one of the heirs’ husband (Marzia Leonelli’s husband), carried the veil away with force. Since that day the Leonelli family started falling down. Pancrazio was arrested and imprisoned in Chieti; his wife was forced to sell the precious veil to Donantonio De Fabritiis in order to free her husband.  As De Fabritiis was not well, he showed the veil to the Capuchin Friars to verify the real value of the veil. \nThe Friars were happy with that relic and put it inside a frame (today you can still see it) in order to protect the veil. In 1683 De Fabritiis gave it to the Capuchin Friars who showed the relic for the public veneration in 1646, after the notarization.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2014 at 4:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-172013","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint","post":"Discovered this interesting piece:\nhttps://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n56part5.pdf\nConcludes that the Shroud may have been taken from Constantinople to Athens in 1205.\nMight that explain the emergence of the epitaphios between 1200-1300AD?????\n\n","date":"November 19, 2014 at 4:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-172019","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint","post":"Final part of TH’s comment:\n“What were the criteria that could be adopted first to produce a whole body imprint of the crucified Jesus that would pass muster, yet importantly pose no threat to the status of the Veil?”\nDo you really think that a medieval forger was concerned with your 16 criteria?\nMy answer: YES, with an almost obsessional attention to detail to recreate what a contact imprint might have looked like. However there were a handful of  departures from the “imprint only” script, no doubt carefully mulled over, made in the interests of artistic impression (like that gap between the frontal and dorsal head images, when there should have been continuity given the straight-line skull-circumference distance of separation shown). \nPlan A, with unbroken image continuity across double fused heads would have been a real turn-off. \nPlan B? Separate the heads too much as if there had been a generous surplus of linen?  Nope. It then ceases to look like a practical, economical snugly-fitting burial ‘bag’. \nSo settle instead for the SSI Working Party’s compromise Plan C (no one will notice, except maybe a 21st century NZ engineer in the distant future who measures the separation of heads and declares that something’s not right as regards the failure of the top of head to leave an image).\n\n","date":"November 19, 2014 at 5:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-172022","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint","post":"NZers are well-known for pulling beyond our weight, even though we’re not all named Rutherford.  You might recall that I had mistaken a water mark for the dorsal image of the head and I had then thought it far too close, and it prompted several fruitful comments at the time.  Both Hugh F and myself measured the distance on Shroudscope from tip of nose to where we thought the occiptal bump was and it came out 35cm, which was spot on, possibly because we have such big heads.  \nThis required the Shroud to be drawn firmly over the top of the top of the head which only needed to be masked by a cloth, such as a jaw strap or other, so as not to produce an image.  Mario L disagreed because of where the blood stains had accumulated, maintaining the cloth was loose over the top of the head, and offered his own explanation, suggesting a home experiment by lying on the floor to see where the back of head touched the floor.   \nEither way, there seems to be no problem with the distance between ventral and dorsal images.

One then sees folk on this site go into what I call INNIT mode (INNIT = It’s Not Inconceivable That…) and then the qualifying assumptions begin to flow freely. It’s the need for those qualifying assumptions that is scarcely constrained by the existence of Occam’s razor, occasionally needing something more akin to a chain saw massacre. You yourself acknowledge solutions offered to resolve the ‘top of head’ problem, one of which may or may not  require certain Jewish folk to revise their knowledge of 1st century burial practice (the “jaw strap”). Incidentally, I was taught that Occam’s Razor is “entities should not be multiplied needlessly”. The more commonly quoted one on internet sites, i.e. “the simplest model is likely to be the correct one” probably came later, and is often misapplied in the scientific context where testing of hypotheses is concerned, models being for using, not believing, and can thus be shamelessly refined or qualified.\nIn my model, the ‘top of head’ model is explained quite simply. The artisans didn’t like the look of fused heads, so inserted a damp cloth or similar to prevent imaging at that point. Look, no need to make assumptions about ancient burial practices, and one can make a prediction: if there’s one concession made to practical or artistic considerations, then there are likely to be others too (“no top of head, no open wounds either, just blood, but let’s image the soles of those feet since legs without feet will look odd etc.etc”).
