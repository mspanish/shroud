A run away reaction could explain that and traversing along the fibril.” \nYes, it’s all in the excellent paper by Fanti et al (2010) : “Microscopic and Macroscopic Characteristics of the Shroud of Turin Superficiality”, easily googleable and available in full for free,\nHowever I still think the explanation of the image on the other side is weak, as whatever heat is conducted has to go through the body of the material and if its hot enough the pyrolyse the hemicellulose on the other side, its hot enough to pyrolyse the hemicellulose of the in-between fibres and darken them as well(which it doesn’t). \nMethinks someone has forgotten the difference between heat and temperature, It’s not enough to have the right temperature. There has to be sufficient thermal capacity for the hemicellulose-coatings to be “ignited” – possible with hot backing sand, with ample mass, probably not with light cellulose fibres en route (but the latter can still conduct, as they do to high thermal capacity water in that trick with the bag.\nAnd again I think you’re pulling a fast one with the supposed high conductivity of cellulose, which the tables show isnt the case.\nI did not make, or mean to make,  a big thing about “high”conductivity, certainly not in terms of classic good conductors like metals, and Irest assured I am not planning to market cardboard saucepans anytime soon. Don’t you think it impressive that the cellulose of a paper bag is able to conduct heat at a sufficient rate to boil water, and to so so without any sign of degrading?  In that sense the paper is a “goodish” conductor, good enough to dissipate the heat from a naked flame into water on the opposite side of the paper. Had Raymond Rogers been aware of, or thinking of that trick, would he have been so ready to dismiss scorching as a mechanism, based on the juxtaposition of image fibres with cellulose that looked entirely normal under the microscope? But that sharp transition between charred and pristine now needs to be re-evaluated anyway in terms of heat-labile hemicellulose adjacent to more heat-refractory cellulose. That’s not to belittle Rogers – far from it – since it was his adhesive tape studies that first alerted us to the superficiality of the image, which as I’m sure you know he interpreted as attached to adventitious starch and saponins, rather than a more mundane botanical explanation in terms of primary cell wall and hemicelluloses. So near yet so far as they say… May he rest in peace…\n\n","date":"February 18, 2012 at 5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/18/a-new-hypothesis-leapfrogging-luigi-garlaschelli/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8446","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A New Hypothesis: Leapfrogging Luigi Garlaschelli","post":"Colin, I even think, for your theory to work to sustain the exothermic reaction until it reacts all the way around the cylinder, it needs that cellulose have low thermal conductivity because otherwise the heat gets removed from your reaction zone.

Your science is skewed again, Colin. For heat to flow from hot metal side of cloth to hot sand side of cloth, there has to be a temperature gradient, so if its hot enough to send facial information and pyrolyse onto  the sand side, its hot enough through the middle of the cloth to pyrolyse as well. So if metal is say 350 and sand is 300 and pyrolysis kicks in at 320…for the sand side to get a facial marking, it must have risen to above 320 due to heat flow from the metal side (and any cloth in between will be similarly scorched as due the temp gradient it must be above that 320 temp). So you are asking of your forger to not only be a superb artist, anatomist, historical expert but also a thermodynamicist capable of making heat go in the wrong direction from cold to hot. A tall order if I may say so!\nSo though I like part of your theory, it only partially explains the Shroud image and I think it would also struggle with the blood markings as well. I know it a bit like asking you to gnaw off your own leg, Colin, but would you concede that the Shroud is not just a mystery to the gullible as your blog implies, its a puzzle to seasoned observers, sceptics and scientists as well?\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/18/a-new-hypothesis-leapfrogging-luigi-garlaschelli/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8458","author":"ArtScience","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A New Hypothesis: Leapfrogging Luigi Garlaschelli","post":"Well, not only do I have a Plan B where the image on the reverse side is concerned, but you’ll have to take my word that it was Plan A right up to a few hours before posting! I could wheel it out now, but it would look like I was backing down on the heat/temperature thing. I’m not. Think about the static electricity when you pull a woollen jersey over your head. I had such a belt a few days ago, when the humidity was down in the mid 20s, but it did NOT singe my hair, or if it did the missus has not commented (and I would have smelt it surely). An electric arc has a temperature in thousands of degrees Celsius, but will not burn if there is insufficient electrical or thermal energy to cause pyrolysis..\n  “… would you concede Shroud is not just a mystery to the gullible as your blog implies, its a puzzle to seasoned observers, sceptics and scientists as well?”\nAgain, I don’t have to concede a thing, since I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments expressed.  But being a scientist (well, a retired one) I believe that the mystery can be unravelled by patient application of known scientific principles.\n My starting point, back in December last year, was that appalling paper by Di Lazzaro et al and the press reports that accompanied it, given it assumed that the Shroud image had been  produced by some kind of electromagnetic radiation at a distance, in the absence of any means of focusing it to form an image, and then making a huge song and dance about producing a small superficial scorch mark on linen with their death ray high energy uv laser (like something out of a Bond film). It’s what I call Mickey Mouse science, and will continue to do so until I see some correctives appear in the media, preferably from the authors themselves. 2011 ended as a black year for science… Those Italians were using their hi-tech toys to take us back to a pre-Enlightenment era of magic and superstition.

But we are talking here about details, not principles, so let’s not get too bogged down in the detail.\nPlan B is very simple. Given the cloth is a (“nominal”) 0.34 mm thick, then infrared radiation could be making a contribution at such short range if there were to be a dark-coloured absorber available, as indeed there is. Infrared could be trapped by a backing semi-opaque sand-bed and then bake the adjacent linen to produce that faint fuzzy image on the reverse side. Passage of infrared rays through the linen would be assisted by preliminary scorching by contact, reducing white-surface reflection/scatter of incident radiation, thus creating a partial black body absorber/emitter.

Then we get a darkened E shape scorched onto the top surface of first sheet of paper, and then this heats up more and re-radiates ir light, say through 3 more sheets of paper at the bottom of which is a black sheet of paper (representing the sandbed), that black sheet gets a bit hotter where a fuzzy image of the E would be, and that extra heat is enough to trigger pyrolysis on the back surface of the final white sheet (which has been kept at a temperature just below pyrolysis normally). \nNice idea but with some big problems;\n1)the intervening light layers of paper who reflect much of the ir back, perhaps with multiple reflects giving a very fuzzy image\n2)the faint scorched E is only very faintly different from the rest of the paper so the temp difference is going to be very slight on the black sheet, and additionally during most of the scorching time there is even less difference.\n3)the black sheet (ie the sand bed unlike the metal) is hard to evenly heat, and ensure is just below pyrolysis (and we are talking about the days before decent thermometers)\n4)the ir heat that gets to the black sheet has to first heat this up (and we’re talking a heat sink of sand), before it can start to pyrolyse the last sheet.\nI’m not sure this is any better than Plan A, sorry.\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 4:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/18/a-new-hypothesis-leapfrogging-luigi-garlaschelli/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8477","author":"ArtScience","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A New Hypothesis: Leapfrogging Luigi Garlaschelli","post":"Sorry, you’ve lost me there Ron, what with those 3 sheets of paper.
