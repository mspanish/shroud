Garlaschelli’s pseudo-Shroud is not even near a real 3D rendering ! :) \nIt’s normal because the Shroud wasn’t create by a forger…\n\n","date":"December 22, 2011 at 11:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/22/do-your-own-vp8-like-3d-images-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-5901","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Do Your Own VP8-Like 3D Images of the Shroud of Turin","post":"By the way, Yannick. A month ago, I suggested to you in this blog a small experiment with this same sofware and your photos of some imprints left by leaves. Did you get any interesting result?

Unfortunatelly, I try but wasn’t able to operate this software on my computer !  It’s like something was missing and the software didn’t work.
