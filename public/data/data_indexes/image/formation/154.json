Perhaps I had seen this report once, but cannot recall when or whether it was indeed this. \nThe general problem with any examination, spectroscopic or otherwiese, is the impossibility to remove glasses. They are obstacle -they produce reflexes, and are not transparent to every band of electromagnetic spectrum.\nAnyway, I see it extremely unlikely for Manoppello to be a painting.

This makes close analysis impossible, obviously. Nevertheless, a spectroscopic analysis performed in 1902 by Gennaro Sperindeo and Raffaele Januario claimed that the spectrum was consistent with hemoglobin. A later analysis, with similar conclusions, was carried out in 1989\nThen, read the paper :\nF. D’Onofrio; P. L. Baima Bollone;M. Cannas; quoted by Cardinal Michele Giordano (1990), Prolusione, in Proceedings of the Symposium on the VI centenary of the first liquefaction of the blood (1389–1989), December 1989, Napoli, Torre del Greco (Napoli), p. 10\nYears ago I have bought (and read) the inherent book by Baima Bollone … \nWhat is your comment (…apart the problem with the wavelength to use\nduring examinations) about the spectoscopic analyses on little blood stains ?\n\n","date":"June 23, 2014 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/the-manoppello-this-little-cloth-cannot-be-further-ignored-in-shroud-research/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-132525","author":"Piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Manoppello:  This little cloth cannot be further ignored in Shroud research!","post":"What is your comment (…apart the problem with the wavelength to use\nduring examinations) about the spectoscopic analyses on little blood stains ?\nSpectroscopic analysis are of course possible. There is some minor problem with glass, which has its systematic effect on transparency indifferent wavelenght, which should be taken into account. According to interview with prof. Jaworski (see http://www.manoppello.eu/html/jaworski.html , only polish version, sorry, try Google Translator), the glass is not transparent in the UV band that is responsible for byssus fluorescence. The blood should be no great problem, but if you want to know my opinion, I doubt that those blood stains are real blood. Rather images of bloodstains.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2014 at 11:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/the-manoppello-this-little-cloth-cannot-be-further-ignored-in-shroud-research/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-132527","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Manoppello:  This little cloth cannot be further ignored in Shroud research!","post":">” images of bloodstains” … … ?\nWhere is the inherent proof ?\nThak you in advance …\n\n","date":"June 26, 2014 at 9:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/the-manoppello-this-little-cloth-cannot-be-further-ignored-in-shroud-research/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-132921","author":"Piero","site":"shroudstory"}]
