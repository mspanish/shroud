Dan’s observation re Nature journal and its downloadable pdf format is scarcely relevant, given that submissions to Nature are generally refereed before appearing in print (and the journal has a Letters page too).\nI have suggested to Dan that each time he adds a pdf paper to his sidebar he adds a link to a separate posting that functions as a kind of ‘letters page’, one that would gradually accumulate, over the weeks and months, folks’ first and subsequent thoughts, and hopefully responses from the paper’s author(s) too.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2014 at 10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/revisiting-the-turin-shroud-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-131252","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Revisiting:  The Turin Shroud Image is not a Scorch","post":"While I don’t share your irritation, Colin, I do like your suggestion.

I have no problem with pdf’s because they are critical in protecting the integrity of written work in digital media. I say this as a writer (non science). But in this context it is only fair to ensure proper discussion can occur re: the contents of the ‘impenetrable’ pdf.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2014 at 10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/revisiting-the-turin-shroud-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-131279","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Revisiting:  The Turin Shroud Image is not a Scorch","post":"PDFs are not so impenetrable.  Unless they are in ‘secured’ format, they can be downloaded and saved, and then comments added, by way of the ‘text highlight’ and ‘sticky note’ tools.  I have used this facility in exchanges of documents with others seeking comment on their work.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2014 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/revisiting-the-turin-shroud-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-131421","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
