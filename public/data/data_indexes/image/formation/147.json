[{"title":"The Colin Berry Dislocated Shoulder Theory","post":"Seems an odd pairing to have the head facing straight ahead, with the eyes closed on such a crucifix.  Most artists tilt the head slightly downward, or angled to one side to signify death.  If the head is facing straight-on, wouldn’t the eyes likely be shown open, looking straight ahead or upward?  I suppose some variation could exist.  A crown of thorns is usually depicted in sculptures, doesn’t appear to be the case here.  Could have been an add-on item to contrast with the sculpture or chipped away, smoothed out-why not?  As to alternatives, quite a serene expression for someone being slow roasted-maybe they used a lot of butter.\n\n","date":"May 10, 2014 at 9:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/10/the-colin-berry-dislocated-shoulder-theory/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-116060","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Colin Berry Dislocated Shoulder Theory","post":"Dislocated right shoulder is no new discovery.

The notable difference is that in this case left hand is stretched.:\nWhen the executioners had nailed the right hand of our Lord, they perceived that his left hand did not reach the hole they had bored to receive the nail, therefore they tied ropes to his left arm, and having steadied their feet against the cross,pulled the left hand violently until it reached the place prepared for it. This dreadful process caused our Lord indescribable agony, his breast heaved, and his legs were quite contracted. They again knelt upon him, tied down his arms, and drove the second nail into his left hand; his blood flowed afresh, and his feeble groans were once more heard between the blows of the hammer, but nothing could move the hard-hearted executioners to the slightest pity. The arms of Jesus, thus unnaturally stretched out, no longer covered the arms of the cross, which were sloped; there was a wide space between them and his armpits.\n(from http://www.catholicplanet.com/ebooks/Dolorous-Passion.pdf)\n\n","date":"May 10, 2014 at 10:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/10/the-colin-berry-dislocated-shoulder-theory/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-116100","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Colin Berry Dislocated Shoulder Theory","post":"“As I wrote yesterday, the dislocated shoulder has been on my mind for some years now.

Both Gibson (Australian) and Caviezel(American) are devout Catholics, the former more conservative and that is why he based many of his ideas on Emmerich.\nI am sceptical when it comes to visions, and it becomes less when concrete results are seen and if I get my own “feel”.While touring Europe when I was very young, Fatima, Portugal could be “felt”, there was a sort of “strange”, sad atmosphere there, very different from Lourdes, France. Francisco’s body was found incorrupt when exhumed to be taken to the basilica and USSR communism came to an end, which had been hooked on to a request during the apparition. During a general audience in Rome, sitting about 15 feet away from Paul VI together with a group on the stage, the feeling of saintliness in the man was unmistakable. It could be seen on his face, his manner and this week’s news about his beatification is no surprise.\n\n","date":"May 10, 2014 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/10/the-colin-berry-dislocated-shoulder-theory/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-116123","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Colin Berry Dislocated Shoulder Theory","post":"Orthopaedic surgeons VL Caja and MM Revert-Vinaixa, on the other hand, in their letter to Injury Journal responding to Bevilacqua’s first paper say: “Blunt violent trauma on the right shoulder: Simply, there is no evidence.”\n\n","date":"May 10, 2014 at 11:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/10/the-colin-berry-dislocated-shoulder-theory/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-116127","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Colin Berry Dislocated Shoulder Theory","post":"Louis, I believe that Jacinta of Fatima was also incorrupt.\n\n","date":"May 10, 2014 at 11:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/10/the-colin-berry-dislocated-shoulder-theory/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-116138","author":"Chesterbelloc","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Colin Berry Dislocated Shoulder Theory","post":"“When the tomb of Jacinta was opened in 1951\nher body was found practically incorrupt.

Dislocation could only take place in the joints of the shoulder and the elbow. A dislocation of one or the other would shorten the arm and would not lengthen it.” A shortening is not what is seen on the Shroud image. The result of suspension from the wrists can result in an elongation of four or five centimetres at the most, and this conforms to the geometry of the arm taking up the position from horizontal to 65deg as the hypoteneuse of the triangulation. “Doctor at Calvary” Pierre Barbet, 1963; ‘The Wounds of the Hands, p.107. Barbet had his original French work published in 1950;”\nMy views on alleged dislocation of shoulder, remain neutral pending more authoritative comment from forensic pathology.  However, Barbet seems not to have thought so, and his opinion matters more so than the speculations of film producers, visionaries, chemistry doctorates advocating hot statues with arms broken off, and even Italian professors with a miraculist agenda. I remain unpersuaded.\n\n","date":"May 10, 2014 at 4:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/10/the-colin-berry-dislocated-shoulder-theory/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-116265","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Colin Berry Dislocated Shoulder Theory","post":"On June 23, 2013 at 3:22 pm I wrote: \n“The true fact is a loosely draped body actually is totally inconsistent with the Greek verbs used in the Gospel to describe Yeshua’s body wrapping in shrouds: entulisso, “to wrap, encircle, wind”; eneileo, “to compress, tightly wrap up” and deo, “to fasten, bind”.\nAs wrapping in shrouds was/is one of the Judean/Jewish burial core procedures, in order to counteract arms forced in rigor mortis from adduction to abduction, a crucifixion victim’s bloody body fastening/binding + compressing/tightly wrapping up were most needed.\nThe true fact is the TS bloodstain cartography implies a tightly wrapped up cloth-to-body front and back configuration.
