And yet you complain about ad hominem attacks on this site. Anyway, that’s not important. What is important is your assertion in points 1 and 2 on your website that the Shroud image was formed through heat imprinting from a shallow bas relief template. John Jackson’s work tried to replicate such a process and to summarise these were the findings:\n1. The resulting image didn’t yield a consistent high resolution. There were hollow spots round the eyes, bridge of the nose etc. Garlaschelli’s replication effort had the same problem.\n2. Regardless of the temperature of the bas-relief, thermal discoloration appeared after a few seconds.\n3. The superificiality of the image found on the Shroud could not be replicated. The scorch extended several layers into the thread, instead of the outermost fibrils.\n4. All efforts to increase the scorch time (by wetting the cloth for example) resulted in distorted images with reduced contrast.\n5. Any blood stains would undergo thermal decomposition on contact with the surface of the bas-relief. (Remember, there is no image underneath the blood on the Shroud. You could counter that a forger made a template to ‘skirt’ the bloodstains – but why would he do that? And surely such a process would be detectable under the microscope?) \nAnother problem is that wouldn’t an image produced by heat scorching fluoresce under UV light? The Shroud body image does not fluoresce under UV light but scorches like the burns from the 1532 fire do.\nsciencebod, I would like to know why you assert that heat imprinting was used given these problems? Really, I am interested.

The triangular burn marks were certainly not in alignment (no reason why they should be of course given that each layer of linen burns differently), but the burn marks were LOWER on the dorsal side, whereas the head and thus apparent length/height was GREATER on the dorsal side. Had I shifted the dorsal side higher to get the burn marks in better alignment, the dorsal head would have looked EVEN HIGHER than I showed. In other words, any bias was AGAINST the point I was making.\nLater, after the dressing down from Miss, I went back to Google images, and found someone who had done my exercise, but with clearer images which showed the different sets of “poker holes” (see my site for the link). Those holes were in near-perfect alignment, both the set at the very top and another lower down.\nIn other words, if I am being charged with deliberately misaligning in order to manufacture the appearance of a disparity in size, then there is no case to answer. \nGiven that one of the “must read” references  we were given earlier  today starts by stating categorically that the dorsal image is 7 cm longer/taller than the ventral, and given that I merely suggested on the basis of my own “playing with the laptop” (my very words), and that I could hardly have done more to hedge my words, then I frankly consider this inquisition bang out of order.

It would also misguide anyone who is not familiar with the Shroud. (We also can’t assume whomever folded the Shroud during the fire did so from where we would expect) …so I would have suggested aligning the image from a central point or from the top of the head. Maybe you can do so once you get a better hold of the software! As for the second issue; May I suggest that before taking things literally from ‘loose’ facts posted here, and just  “playing with the laptop” before you make comments that dispute evidence for the Shroud, you investigate first much more material.

Nowhere does that paper consider the sceptics’ view that the image was produced from an inanimate replica. e.g. a bas relief or statue. Instead it makes numerous explicit assumptions that it was a body that had been taken down from a cross in a state of rigor mortis with head tipped forward, knees drawn up, that an image had been acquired on a cloth that was loosely draped over etc.  Talk about self-serving assumptions – ones that make that final diagram of the two “supeimposable” (sic)outlines totally at odds with unaided, non messed-around-with simple observation, e.g. \nlink to non-computer transformed dorsal v frontal comparison\nNote too they say “superimposable”, not “superimposed” – a crucial difference, and then refer to “compatible”, a term that is shot through with subjectivity.\nNowhere does the paper say how the image was formed from a real person on that draped-over cloth, especially those parts not in direct contact with the cloth. What a worthless publication – the referees should have thrown it straight back, or better still in the bin…\nI am only too painfully aware, needless to say, that the icy-cold objectivity of (real) science is not for everyone (present company excepted ;-) and that would include those so-called scientists who use computer-aided (re-)imaging systems in an attempt to escape the evidence of their own eyes, to say nothing of common sense…  \nThe clue to the artefact – a term I use deliberately-  lies I believe in those (over)long bony fingers, says he with a gleam in his eye,  which I intend to put up for discussion shortly. But probably not here… I know where I am not welcome…\nColinB\n\n","date":"January 30, 2012 at 2:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/26/sciencebod-reacts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-7683","author":"sciencebod","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sciencebod reacts","post":"Sorry.
