I really think it’s sad that the Shroud is always seen as a “mysterious” object that goes in the paranormal or supernatural category.  If this would really be the case, then there’s A LOT of phenomenon in the material universe that would go into that same category, starting with the apparition of life on earth.  But, at the same time, as science always progress, this list of “paranormal” phenomenon is always growing thiner and thiner.  Does it not tell you anything ?

I have a n-th generation image of the Shroud someone gave to me so its origin and quality is dubtious. However, using a software that is freely available (Image-J http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html) that has also been commented in this blog and that allows 3D visualization, I have obtained that the flat heights (3D information) corresponding to the burnt areas are 20-30 times higher than those corresponding to the body.  Since this image is black and white, the presence of intense white areas (burnt areas) originates this big difference with human figure areas. These seems to me a plausible explanation.  We have a original image with 3D information and years/centuries later very white stains appear that in a B&W image like mine give 20-30 times higher heights (3D) values. However, I will not go any further because the validity of my small experiment is exactly zero due to the unknown origin of my own image. \nFor this reason, this is not but a comment based on a very dubtious image.

If Rogers hypothesis is correct about the fact that it is a thin layer of impurity that was colored on the surface of the Shroud, then the ENEA TEAM DIDN’T PROVED HE WAS WRONG !

High Resolution. As various points on the Shroud intersect different topographical features on the body surface during the collapse process, radiation dose on the cloth begins to accumulate. If the radiation is assumed to be strongly absorbed in air, radiation effects on the cloth cannot begin until virtual intersection with the body surface occurs. Thus, a one-to-one mapping between a given point on the body to a unique point on the cloth is achieved for all points on the Shroud, which is equivalent to stating that the resulting image is well resolved.” (Jackson, J.P., “An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image,” in Berard, A., ed., “History, Science, Theology and the Shroud,” Symposium Proceedings, St. Louis Missouri, June 22-23, 1991, The Man in the Shroud Committee of Amarillo, Texas: Amarillo TX, 1991, p.340. Emphasis original).\nwithout the need for a converging lens.\nJackson’s Cloth Collapse theory also explains every other major characteristic of the Shroud:\n“Thus, the hypothesis of the Shroud collapsing into a radiating body explains all the above characteristics of the Shroud image, something that other image formation hypotheses posed thus far fail to do. (Jackson, 1991, p.342).\nJackson also made a testable prediction of his theory that “the frontal image should reside on both sides of the Shroud, whereas the dorsal image should reside on only one side”:\n“Testable Predictions of Hypothesis … 2 Surface Discolorations on Both Sides of the Shroud for the Frontal Image. As noted above, the superficial nature of the image is explained by the theory. However, the above reasoning leads to one other prediction concerning the superficiality of the image; the frontal image should reside on both sides of the Shroud, whereas the dorsal image should reside on only one side. The reason is that when the upper part of the Shroud falls into the body region, radiation from the body impinges upon both sides of the cloth. However, in the case of the dorsal image, radiation impinges from only one side because the cloth there never moves into the body. Unfortunately, there are no suitable data available to test this prediction because the reverse side of the Shroud has been covered since 1534 with a backing cloth. But if such a prediction could be confirmed by a future examination of the reverse side, then the theory proposed herein would be given considerable support. It is likely, however, that if a frontal image discoloration exists on the reverse surface of the Shroud, it would be somewhat less intense than the discoloration which is observed on the normal viewing side because that side presumably entered the body first.” (Jackson, 1991, pp.342-343. Emphasis original).\nJackson’s prediction was found to be true in 2004 when “The ghostly image of a man’s face” was discovered “on the reverse side of the Shroud” (i.e. what was originally the uppermost side of the Shroud as it lay on Jesus body in the Tomb) which “had a striking 3-D quality and matched the known face in form, size and position”:\n“The ghostly image of a man’s face has emerged on the reverse side of the Shroud of Turin, the piece of linen believed to have been wrapped around the body of Jesus after he was crucified, scientists say. The discovery, using new digital imaging techniques, adds new complexity to one of the most controversial relics in Christendom. The study, which will be published online ahead of print publication in the Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics, examined the back surface of the famous handwoven linen. … the back side has remained hidden for centuries beneath a piece of so-called Holland cloth … The back surface, however, was photographed in detail and the pictures published in a book by Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti, one of the Church’s top shroud officials. … `As I saw the pictures in the book, I was caught by the perception of a faint image on the back surface of the shroud …’ said Giulio Fanti … the study’s lead author. Imaging the face Fanti used sophisticated image processing based on direct and inverse Fourier transform, enhancement and template-matching techniques on Ghiberti’s pictures to uncover the image of a man’s face. Lying behind the known image of the bearded man bearing the marks of crucifixion, the new image had a striking 3-D quality and matched the known face in form, size and position. `Though the image is very faint, features such as nose, eyes, hair, beard and moustache are clearly visible …,’ Fanti said. But the enhancing procedure did not uncover the full body image as it appeared on the front side. `If it does exist, it is masked by the noise of the digital image itself. But we found what it is probably the image of the hands,’ Fanti said … Fanti’s finding matches a hypothesis postulated in 1990 by Dr John Jackson, a U.S. physicist who conducted the first major investigation into the shroud in 1978. Jackson speculated the presence of a faint image on the back surface of the shroud, only in correspondence to the frontal image.” (“Turin shroud shows another mystery face,” Rossella Lorenzi, Discovery News, ABC Science, 12 April 2004).\nJackson’s Cloth Collapse theory is also fully compatible with the ENEA report that the image was created on the Shroud by ultraviolet radiation:\n“5. Chemical Nature of the Image. Electromagnetic radiation that is absorbed strongly in air consists of photons in the ultraviolet or soft x-ray region. It happens that these photons are also sufficiently energetic to photochemically modify cellulose. Such photons are strongly absorbed in cellulose over fibril-like distances. Experiments performed by the author have shown that subsequent aging in an oven of photosensitized (bleached) cloth by shortwave ultraviolet radiation produces a yellow-browned pattern like the Shroud body image composed of chemically altered cellulose. Thus, I posit that radiation from the body initially photosensitized the body image onto the Shroud. This pattern would have appeared, if the radiation was ultraviolet, as a white (bleached) image on a less white cloth. With time, natural aging would have reversed the relative shading of the image to its presently observed state where it appears darker than the surrounding cloth (which also aged or darkened with time, but not as fast).” (Jackson, 1991, p.341. Emphasis original).\nAs far as I know, Jackson’s paper is not webbed and is only available in the Berard, ed., 1991 St. Louis Symposium Proceedings book above.\nStephen E.
