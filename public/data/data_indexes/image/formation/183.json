But we just don’t know if in fact such a cloth existed and except for the Sudarium which appears authentic and which if properly analyzed by new scientific tests could, or could not be, matched. By that I mean the kind of  deep “quantum” analysis that was performed by Heller and Adler on the blood from the Shroud. Matching spectra?\nBut here is something that is beyond theory and into the area of speculation. However when it comes to the process of image formation, everything for now is speculation. The importance of the image is that the image “is”.  Is it a part of the great mystery of Christ’s “I am?” We should know better but we tend to still think of the Resurrection in our three dimensional “physical” universe. \nMany decades ago, before I went to college, I remember seeing at the magazine section of a local drug store, a copy of a magazine that popularized scientific issues a cover proclaiming an explanation of time as the fourth dimension. The cover included an illustration of Salvador Dali’s “Persistence of Memory” famous for its drooping watches. When I looked inside the magazine, the entire article was just a few lines referencing the Dali painting. I was disappointed.\nA few years later, I was at a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol attending a two week encampment at Samson Air Force Base at Seneca Lake, We slept in barracks and ate the Air Force food. There are two things that I remember vividly. One was a fellow cadet calling out in the middle of the night “You know that stuff they put in the food?” and then answering the question “It doesn’t work..”\nThe other was a fellow cadet, Melvin Weinstein, from Albany NY who had won a Westinghouse prize at some level or other. I asked him about it and he said “I made  model tesseracts.” “What was that?  I asked. “It’s a four dimension cube,” he replied.   “Want to make one? Get some straws.”\nI did and we did. If you have ever drawn a three dimensional cube on paper which is essential two squares with four corners joined by a slanted lines at the corner, you might be able to visualize what we did. We constructed two three dimensional cubes from straws and then connected the eight corners by straws. I was amazed because it reminded me of a stroboscopic picture I had seen in Life magazine of Ted Williams swing a bat. It was as if the cube was moving through space. The distance traveled being the length of the connecting straws. Time was the fourth dimension,\nFreidman cautioned me that the model of a four dimension cube we had created was not the most accurate. Actually, the cube moving though time expanded in all directions. The proper representation was one cube inside a larger one, joined at the corners. That would have been tough to do with soda straws.\nAssume arguendo the reality of the Resurrection. Something happened to Christ’s body that has no precedent. Dame Isabel Pizcek has referred to the Shroud as an “event horizon.” Perhaps she is right and perhaps that explains the image. We would tend to think of the body as moving through the cloth in a singular direction. But if it was moving into another dimension, or existence, it would have been moving from our perspective in all “directions” or no direction at all. I would suggest that these are issues of quantum mechanics.\nOn the other hand, applying Occam’s Razor, the existence of a head band, as proffered by Dave, may be the simplest solution. :-)\n\n","date":"January 15, 2014 at 8:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-73370","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of Head Puzzle","post":"I no longer  wish to comment on this site, in the sense of needing to proffer an opinion.

However the blood stains from the cap of thorns are visible there, the outline of the hair pretty well matches that on the frontal image, and on the better negatives the pigtail is clearly visible. \nThe closest I can get to describing what is seen is a quote from my post: “If two separate photographs were taken, say on large glass plates, at a scale of one-to-one, the first of the front of the body, and the second of the back of the body, then transferred onto a cloth so that they met at the crown, then the result would be very close to what we see on the Shroud, apart from minor distortions only.” \nHow this can come about based only on a naturalistic explanation escapes me.  If all the technology and a suitable model of the body were available to him, then an artist might be able to reproduce it with photographic glass plates in the way described. Otherwise I need to have recourse to a miraculous intervention. \nThe fact that the two images abut each other at the crown cannot be explained, even with attempting a graphics explanation.    \nIt is as if there was a time warp at the moment of image formation. One half of the cloth (section 1) is suddenly flattened, with the cloth’s midpoint level with the crown and the frontal image transferred. The second half of the cloth (section 2) is flattened, again with the cloth’s mid-point level with the crown, and the dorsal image transferred. That is as close as I can get to explaining how the two images can abut at the crown. \nDraping the cloth clear of the head might allow a naturalistic explanation only if there were a gap between the two images not less than about 30cm. But of course with the two images abutting, no gap is seen. \nEither a forger has been able to use something like the glass plate photography I’ve described, or the image has to be some kind of miraculous intervention. I cannot see how any kind of naturalistic explanation can ever provide a satisfactory explanation for the sharp discontinuity of the two images, no matter how the cloth may have been draped, nor whatever process may have created the two images.\n\n","date":"January 15, 2014 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-73383","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of Head Puzzle","post":"I’m seeing a 6-8 inch gap between the crowns of the images.

However, neither of these edges of colour represent the crown of the head, so it cannot be said that they show the heads separated by 15cm. The curved edge above the face is about level with the top of the forehead, and the straight edge at the back of the head a bit higher up.\nAssuming that the bottom edges of the line of bloodstains along the back of the head correspond roughly to the level of the inion of the external occipital protuberance, there is a distance of about 38cm between there and the bridge of the nose, which corresponds well to the same distance on my own head. In other words, the image which is visible is consistent with a cloth wrapped tightly over the head from nose to occipital protuberance, and possibly a cloth about 15cm wide underneath the shroud and tied around the top of the head to account for the lack of image all the way.\n\n","date":"January 15, 2014 at 7:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-73397","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of Head Puzzle","post":"Hugh – well put, I totally agree.\nDoes this not create difficulties for the “faked” scenario?

A few measurements on Shroudscope as others have pointed out, tends to confirm that the dorsal crown is roughly in line with the four burn-holes.

The cloth could simply have extended a few cms away because the distance of about 23cms between the back and front images would allow it.” \nI agree we are treading on uncertain ground here, but the measurements do not allow it. The distance from the bridge of the nose to the occiput is about 38cm, as noted above. Taking the top of the head as approximating half a sphere, this corresponds to about half a circumference. A cloth draped along the same contour, but 1cm away from the head, would increase the length by 3cm. That is just about acceptable, but if it were “a few cms away” the distance would be increased by almost 10cm, which is wholly inconsistent with the measurement of the Shroud. Also, the difference between a tightly wrapped cloth, and a cloth stretched horizontally behind the head, then vertically downwards grazing the top of the head, then back horizontally to the inion, is about 7cm. This is also inconsistent with the measurements made on the shroud.\nIf the shroud was indeed a burial cloth, then the measurements suggest a close wrap, and not any padding or significant extension of the shroud away from the body at the crown of the head.\n\n","date":"January 16, 2014 at 6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-73430","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of Head Puzzle","post":"you beat me to it Hugh\n\n","date":"January 16, 2014 at 7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-73435","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of Head Puzzle","post":"Great discussion.\nAnd it has raised, in my opinion, big questions for the anti authentic position.\nMost particularly, why would we see this gap if the image was created from a hot statue, or bas relief.\nIf the former, presumably we would also see an image from the top of the head, as the linen contacted the hot top of the head as well as the rest of the body.\nAs several of us have stated, the measurements between the 2 head images (frontal and dorsal) are pretty much spot on in terms of anatomical distance.\nCompelling…\n\n","date":"January 16, 2014 at 8:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-73441","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top of Head Puzzle","post":"I agree.

Anyway, it would be good to check it.\nLouis: Thanks, OK. The band and helmet of thorns are two different things. I would like your and David Goulet’s views on the sides of the face image\nI have no definite opinion on that. There were many theories suggested. But first, we should clarify what are we talking about. The space between cheeks and hair? Or outside the hair.\nIf we are concerned about the former, there are some suggestions that those spaces are actually darkened due to yarn bandings, as raised by Rogers and others, see https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image37.png \nBarbara Frale put forward a theory that strips of papyry with ‘death certificate’ and ID of the body was glued to the face in this place.\nThere were also suggestions, by Marion & Courage, that wooden supports for head were used during the burial. The would have kept the Shroud over the face, just like on this picture http://ok.apologetyka.info/upload/ap_upload/articles/15/2013/06/rysunekxi.jpg, other suggested solid spices to perform similar function.\nThe outer space is most likely a chin band, perhaps Cahors. This could perhaps explain also the lack of image in space between cheeks and hair, however I am not certain about this.\nIt is also posiible that the sides of the face were actually imaged  on the Shroud, but they were obscured by hair, which we see on the front image. Or they were at large distance from cloth – the Shroud is over 1 m wide. \nThere are many options, as you see.
