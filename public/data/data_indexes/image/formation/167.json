[{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"Even if I’m sure Thibault did a very clever job as usual, I have to say that this was a totally useless effort in my opinion…  I hate to say this but that’s the truth.  First, this demonstration has already been done long before by the STURP team (by John Jackson particularly) and secondly, if anyone has read carefully my paper about the Shroud’s authenticity, IT IS EVIDENT that this relic has not been created by any artistic technique !!!!  The solid evidence of the bloodstains ALONE is well enough to prove that the Shroud CANNOT have been created by someone using a scorch technique !!!  \nQuestion :  Do you really think someone could have been crazy and skilled enough to take a blood stained burial cloth and reproduced a body image around the stains with a scorch technique so well that it would have fooled all the medical experts that have studied the Shroud over the years and have all concluded that the body image MUST have come from the natural (or supernatural) interraction of a real crucified corpse with a real burial Shroud made of linen ???  This simple exercise of logical thinking is well enough to understand that the Shroud CANNOT have been created with any artistic technique, including a scorch technique !\nThibault, don’t take my comment as an insult or anything like that.  I’m sure you did a great analysis of that hypothesis but the thing is this :  I really think this was a useless effort and you should concentrate on analysing all the natural hypothesis for image formation that has been proposed over the years.  On this subject, I have a question for you : In 2007, you published a very interesting paper that analyzed the image formation process proposed by Rogers and you came up with a very interesting complementary hypothesis concerning the possible presence of urea all over the skin of the Shroud man that could have caused the released of ammoniac gases and eventually lead to the formation of the body image on the top-surface of the cloth (note that if this hypothesis is correct, we must assume that the chemical reaction occured with the thin layer of impurities proposed by Rogers).  At the end of this paper, you wrote that you would published a follow-up paper for this 2007 paper.  WHY DON’T YOU START WRITING IT RIGHT NOW ???  Honestly, I really think such a paper would be a “much needed contribution to shroud science” than this paper about the scorch hypothesis !!!\n\n","date":"October 21, 2012 at 6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-17993","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"Yannick,\nIt is not true that “this demonstration has already been done long before by the STURP team (by John Jackson particularly)”. Did you really read Jackson’s paper ? Do you want me to quote exactly what he wrote in the 1982 article quoted in the references of my paper ?\nThe same for Rogers.\nThat’s why I wrote: “I must confess that their conclusions (at least in the papers I have) were often not so definitive as expected.”\nAlthough I knew the arguments against the scorch hypothesis, something was lacking (to my knowledge) :direct observations through the microscope with various parameters.\nIt seems to me that you think that your demonstration starting from the bloodstains only is the absolute proof against an artifact and therefore that my work is useless. This is clearly a problem for any hypothesis involving a forger. But not a proof. Rogers himself never thought that the authenticity (i.e. a burial sheet) could be based on this kind of “proof”. \nYou wrote: ” At the end of this paper, you wrote that you would published a follow-up paper for this 2007 paper. WHY DON’T YOU START WRITING IT RIGHT NOW ??? Honestly, I really think such a paper would be a “much needed contribution to shroud science” than this paper about the scorch hypothesis !!!”\nWhy did I not write this paper? For many reasons that I can’t explain now.\nI am now convinced that any kind of paint, dye or scorch can be ruled out with the highest degree of certainty. A chemical reaction remains as the most probable body image formation process.\nMaillard reaction is probably the most interesting (perhaps not the only one). Putrescine and cadaverine are not the reactive amines as suggested by Rogers (whatever you might think). But other reactive amines are possible.  I will post as soon as possible a message explaining what I found in the scientific literature. \nIn any case, Yannick, I have not be surprised by your comment. It was so foreseeable !\nYou are not required to read my paper and/or to comment it stating that it is a “waste of time”.

I have found it really interesting because I have learnt a lot on the Shroud at fiber level. Its comparison with the scorch clearly indicates their different origin.\nI would like to suggest you a further step of this work and it could be the development of a mathematical model describing the patterns present in the colouring of fibers, something that you have qualitatively already done. From figures 20 onwards it seems to me obvious the existance in the Shroud at fiber level, of a consistent pattern regarding the color, layout, grouping of fibers…that in my view, could be described mathematically with state-of-the-art algorithms.\nThe advantage of this is that any future claim on tentative methods that could explain the image could be evaluated on the basis of the mathematical pattern obtained when analyzed at fiber level. A quick mathematical test on similarity of fiber patterns could be the key for evaluating to which extent the new tentative method reproduces the characteristics of the Shroud.\nBesides, what we see in figure 20 onwards, is really interesting. The coloured fibers tend to group in clusters of coloured fibers including a certain number of them. The really interesting thing is that colourized areas tend to follow the profile of the fiber and do not jump from certain areas of a fiber to another fiber leaving uncolorized zones. Why.?\n Finally, Thibault you once mentioned new apportions on the heavy amines issue.

BECAUSE OF THAT, THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO SERIOUSLY DOUBT THESE TWO CONCLUSIONS. It’s also important to mention that these conclusions are the same as the main conclusions reached by the STURP team, after the scientific investigation they did on the Shroud at the end of the 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s. In this context, why would we waste one more second of our precious time arguing about false ideas (like the Shroud being an artistic forgery) that simply do not fit with what science knows about the Shroud?”\nUnfortunatelly, Thibault di djust that (wasting one more second of his precious time) with his paper !!!\nThis quote from my paper that you just read IS THE SOLID TRUTH WE KNOW RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE SHROUD.  NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.\nBecause of this, I really don’t understand that a doctor like Thibault don’t seem to be able to understand that the bloodstains evidence (which is far from being a banal data concerning the Shroud) is WELL ENOUGH to conclude that this cloth is a REAL BURIAL CLOTH OF A REAL CRUCIFIED PERSON and consequently, the image on the cloth IS NOT and CANNOT BE the work of an forger that would have use some sort of artistic technique (like the scorch technique he analyzed)…  Unlike Thibault, the vast majority of the medical experts who analyzed the Shroud over the years (from Barbet to Zugibe and many others) NEVER thought for one second that the image on this cloth could have come from anything else than an interraction between the cloth and the corpse that was once present inside it !!! The truth is this: once you accept the STURP conclusion that the blood on the Shroud really comes from exudates of blood clots, you have to also agree with the conclusion that the image can only comes from an interraction with the cloth and the corpse it covers and not by the will of a forger using some sort of artistic technique!  THIS IS PURE RATIONAL THINKING!\nAnd this leads me to state this other truth that most people don’t seems to understand: even if Thibault’s experiments would have give a result that would have closely match up the chemical and physical nature Shroud’s image, that would not have change one iota of this truth that the image on the Shroud is NOT the product of a scorch and can only comes from the interraction between the cloth and the corpse it covers!!! Again, the FACT that the blood on the Shroud really comes from exudates of blood clots is the SCIENTIFIC CONFIRMATION of this TRUTH!!! Note that the same line of thinking is also true for all the 20th and 21st centurties technologies that could produce a coloration that can come more or less close to match up the chemical and physical nature of the Shroud’s image, like the UV lasers of the ENEA or any kind of nuclear bombardment of linen that have been done in the past (by Rinaudo for example).  Sadly for some “true believers”, the image on the Shroud is no more the product of 21st century technologies than the product of a forger who would have used some sort of artistic technique…\nI hate to make this kind of hard critic (especially in this case because I know Thibault really seek the truth with honesty), but I definately think it is important to clearly set the record straight once again versus what the Shroud is and what it is not !!!!\nSometimes, like in this particular case, truth hurts and I know it very well…  So, Thibault, I hope you’ll forgive me for this “hard” critic that I hope will be constructive in the end. Believe me, I only hope this critic will help you to focus on serious and credible things like all the possible natural hypotheses that exists regarding the image formation, while it will leads you to forget definitely all the artistic hypotheses that have been proposed over the years.  I repeat that this is a pure waste of time for the simple and good reason that all those hypotheses have been set aside by science long ago and again, the very particular nature of the blood transfer that occurred on the cloth is the best SCIENTIFIC CONFIRMATION of this…\nAnd by making the kind of paper you just wrote (note that I don’t have any doubt that you made a clever job as usual), you only play the game of skeptical persons like Colin Berry and I still think it’s a pure waste of time… In your reply to my first comment, you end’s up by saying that in our quest for truth about the Shroud, we have to go step by step.  Even if I agree with the heart of this general principle, that doesn’t mean we have to constantly take 2 steps back by trying to disprove what already have been solidly disprove by the STURP team or by some others SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD.  Again, by acting like this, you only play the game of people like Colin Berry.  The question is :  WHY?  I really don’t understand.  Don’t you think the mystery of the Shroud is enough thick right now when we try to find a natural mechanism that could have come from the interraction of the corpse and the cloth and that can account for the image on the Shroud??? When it comes to explain the image on the cloth, I really think we should only focus on hypotheses of that nature because that’s the correct and only road science tell us to follow right now if we want to finally solve the mystery of the Shroud!!!! As for the potential supernatural aspect of this image, I don’t think science should focus on that because it goes way beyond his field of expertise.\n\n","date":"October 23, 2012 at 8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-18105","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"I would think you could just refer them to your paper, pgs x – xx…:o)\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 11:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-18252","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"My friend Andy, the problem I can see is this :  PEOPLE DON’T SEEM TO GET THE MAIN POINT I TRIED SO HARD TO MAKE IN MY PAPER, which is to understand once and for all that the Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man, that it cannot be the product of any sort of artistic forgery and on the contrary, that the image on it can only be the product of some kind of interaction (most probably natural and biological) between this ancient cloth and the body it covered for less than 72 hours !!!  \nThat’s where we SHOULD AND MUST stand in the Shroud world versus this relic but sadly, we constantly see people from the inside as much as from the outside casting doubts over this general conclusion made by STURP, even though this general conclusion (which I separated in two in my paper) is as solid as any other fact in other scientific fields.

Having a school science laboratory to play with, I began to investigate the degradation of cellulose in some depth, mostly, like Thibault, by scorching linen. You can read how I got on in my comments on Colin Berry’s blogs, if you’re interested. I’m writing here because I want to defend my approach (and Thibault’s, possibly). Whatever the actual mechanism for producing the shroud’s image, a real understanding of how linen behaves under a variety of circumstances is a worthwhile study. It’s not so much the source of energy – heat, light, nuclear radiation, acid, vapours, whatever – that we’re understanding, but what linen does when that energy arrives. I found Thibault’s paper very interesting and very worthwhile – and I wish I had a good microscope camera!\nIt seems clear that there are at least two effects that have to be explained: the overall discolouration of whole threads, and the superficial darkening of the topmost fibres.

Independent observations have proved that all of the image color resides in a very thin layer on the outside surfaces of colored fibers. \n“Evaporation concentration can explain the superficial nature of the image and the identical properties of the front and back images. It can also explain the “doubly-superficial” image, i.e., the presence of a superficial image on the back surface of the cloth as reported by Ghiberti and Fanti and Maggiolo.\n“When a solution evaporates at the surface of a porous solid, dissolved solutes are concentrated at the evaporating surface. The principle is illustrated in the photomicrograph with blue dye. A piece of linen was saturated with a dilute solution of blue dye, and the cloth was dried while laying on a sheet of Teflon. All evaporation occurred at the top surface, and the dye concentrated on that surface. It is obvious that most of the dye deposited on the highest parts of the weave and the upward-pointing fibers of the nap. A sheet of cloth that contained sugars and starches would deposit those impurities at the very topmost part of the weave after washing and drying.”\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 1:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-18207","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"Dan, this is something I have a problem accepting.

The only way that I can envisage the orthogonal aspect occurring, is if some of the 100lb package was packed along the sides of the body, to present an orthogonal view, and concealing the sides.

Now, If there were helpers around, and it seems there were, they would be less likely to break any rules and the job would be done in great haste.  \nYes, it is probable that the packages Nicodemus bought were placed along the sides of the body, which explains the lack of lateral aspects, (and which also contributed to the Maillard reaction theory in the 20th century!).\n\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 6:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-18304","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"Quote from Louis : “There seems to be no certainty that the body was tightly wrapped, in fact it may not have been tightly wrapped because the burial was a temporary arrangement as Sabbath was approaching.”\nComment from me :  You got it right on the target Louis !  And this is exactly the impression we get when we analyzed properly all the data coming from the Shroud…  In other words, these data that indicates a very incomplete burial (that include no wrapping of the body with strips of linen, except maybe for the feet, no washing of the body and no anointing as well) exactly echoes the Gospel accounts of Jesus burial.  For example, let’s read the description from St-Matthew’s Gospel: “Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.”\nMany people like like to speculate wildly about certain Gospel parts in order to fit them with their preconceive notions concerning Jesus burial, but when we forget to make any speculation or additions to this particular text, we understand perfectly that Jesus burial was very partial and done very fast.  In fact, that’s exactly what the data from the Shroud indicates :  When it reached the tomb, the corpse was most probably put inside the Shroud without any preparation of the body whatsoever (i.e. the body was still covered with dirt, blood clots, etc. and no anointing was done) and then, move to his final location, which was a stone bench.  Nothing more, nothing less, except maybe, if we believe St John’s account, for the possible use of aloes and myrrh (most probably in powder put in bags that were placed around the body) that was only done to chase the bad odours in prevision of a return to the tomb on sunday morning to complete the burial rite properly.\nThat’s what the Shroud’s data indicates and it fits very well with the Gospel accounts. The idea that they could have continue to work on the burial rite during the Sabbath (which was also the day of the Passover by the way) is quite simply ludicrous and doesn’t rest on any credible historical source as I know…\n\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-18297","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"Yannick, you are absolutely right in all these comments.

IT IS NOT THE PRODUCT OF AN ARTIST. The blood stains are composed of hemoglobin and also give positive test for serum albumin…»\nAnd if this last quote is not enough for you, then here’s some quotes from Ray Rogers book A Chemist’s perspective on the Shroud of Turin (published in 2008):\nFirst quote: “Microscopy proves that image fibers and scorch fibers are quite different in structure and composition. The distribution of color is different, even at the level of single fibers. The image was NOT formed by scorching the linen fibers.”\nHere’s another one: “Other than observing collored medullas, crystallinity and birefringence give good clues for differenciating between scorched and image fibers.  The evidence is strong that the image is not a result of dehydration of the cellulose (note: don’t forget that when Rogers was using this word, this included the primary cell wall of the fiber, which is partially composed of cellulose) by any mechanism, thermal or radiation.”\nAnd here’s a third one: “Image fibers do NOT show the properties of scorched linen fibers.” Then he add this very important comment: “The observation of colorless cores in image fibers, « ghosts » pulled from fibers by the adhesive, the reduction of the color with diimide, lack of fluorescence in image area and optical differences between image and scorched fibers eliminate any high-temperature heating event or energetic radiation in image formation.”\nNow folks, what do you need to understand that Thibault’s demonstration don’t really bring any new stuff to the sum of data we already knew about the Shroud ???  \nI’m sure Thibault did a great comparative analysis (as usual) between the image of the Shroud and a scorch image on linen, but the truth is this:  it was unnecessary ! Just like any future comparative analysis between the Shroud and any other artistic technique on linen will also be unnecessary because WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THAT WAY THAT THE IMAGE ON THE SHROUD WAS FORMED !!!!!  WHEN DOES PEOPLE WILL FINISH TO UNDERSTAND THIS BASIC TRUTH ABOUT SHROUD ???\nAnd in the future, if there’s another Garlaschelli or Colin Berry who wants to make us believe that the image on the Shroud don’t come from the natura interaction between the tortured corpse of a crucified man (most probably chemical in nature and related to some biological products released by the dead) and an ancient linen burial cloth that most probably possess a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on its surface, why not just ignore their false claims ?  I think that’s the best thing that could be done…  Why wasting our precious time challenging hypotheses that we already know are completely wrong versus the Shroud ?   Good question, no ?\n\n","date":"October 28, 2012 at 7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-18466","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"Dear Yannick,\nI don’t understand your insistence on saying that my analysis was unnecessary.\nThis is your opinion and I respect it but please don’t repeat again and again the same things.\nIn fact, I had many good reasons to study myself the scorch hypothesis.\nThe first one is that I do what I want !!\nThe second one is that there are some arguments (the reflectance and UV spectra) which seem to support the scorch hypothesis.\nThe third one is that I was not able to find any  STURP paper based on experiments that truly and completely rule out the scorch hypothesis as the result of the the conscious work of a man.\nIn my opinion, nobody can definitely exclude any hypothesis without experiments showing that this hypothesis is false.\nIn this case, it means spectra, 3D, microscopy, fluorescence and if possible chemistry.\nJackson studied 3D properties and did not definitely rule out this hypothesis\nMiller and Pellicori studied fluorescence and concluded from their experiments that there is strong evidence that the TS image is not a scorch.\nTo my knowledge, nobody made chemistry experiments on lightly scorched fibers\nAnd nobody (to my knowledge) tried to compare under the microscope the color pattern of any kind of scorch with that of the TS image.\nIn my experiments, the differences were so obvious that I could write: “now I know for sure …”\nYou are quoting Rogers. I am glad to read that some of my observations were also found by Rogers particularly this one: “Microscopy proves that image fibers and scorch fibers are quite different in structure and composition. The distribution of color is different, even at the level of single fibers.”.  However, Rogers’ observations were made on scorched fibers of the TS (from the 1532 fire) and therefore were not necessarily relevant to the scorch hypothesis as a result of the conscious choice of a forger.\nTesting a hypothesis is a construction. My observations are only the last step.\nNow there is no doubt.\nYou was convinced a long time ago. I was not completely convinced before my own experiments.\nSo, now we agree.

Well yes and no.\nFanti and Maggiolo did a lot of deconvolution of some photographs of the back side, and managed to derive a faint correspondence of the hair, moustache and nose, an even fainter correspondence of the hands area, and nothing resolvable from anywhere else. Given that the ‘normal’ image is entirely superficial, they assumed that the ‘back’ image was also entirely superficial, and consequently that the fibres between the two images did not carry the image through. They also show that the image on the back is not due to the frontal image “showing through,” as it might if it were much darker. They do not describe the back image as ‘smaller’; the correspondence of the bloodstains (which appear clearly) is accurate. They do describe it as having some slight differences from the front (specifically the nose appears more symetrical).\nThe secondary image is in keeping with Rogers’s hypothesis. If an entire sheet is washed in a weak solution (and/or suspension) and allowed to dry, the solute appears concentrated on the outer fibres of the sheet, and minimally in the middle. The tightness of the weave may also prevent penetration to the middle anyway. I have not confirmed Rogers’s vaporograph ideas myself (cadaverine and putrescine seem remarkably difficult to get hold of…), but IF the image on the shroud is due to emanescing gases reacting only with the solute layer, and IF the gases penetrated the cloth, then I would expect an image on both sides but not in the middle, and considerably stronger and better defined on the contact side.\nThe reaction of (e.g.) putrescine with starch is a Maillard reaction, so IF Rogers’s ideas are at all valid, then the discovery of the ‘back’ image certainly does not blow them away.\nI agree with Bippy that nearly all the naturalistic theories are flawed, and that, so far, none have produced wholly convincing explanations. However, even if they all ‘tumbled down’ I fear they are truly all science will ever have to offer. There is no scientific paradigm for the investigation of ‘unnatural theories,’ however true they may be. I don’t know where you got the idea that Science was the pursuit of truth. Only non-Scientists think that! Science is the gradual refinement of models that describe or explain observed phenomena – methodologically natural if you like – and it does a pretty good job of it. For truth however, you have to go to Philosophy or Theology.\n\n","date":"December 29, 2012 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21334","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"There are also a few other problems with the theory that the spices blocked a natural image formation on the sides of the shroud. There are even more problems then I previously suspected, as Stephen jones has brilliantly noted on his blog.\nThe more I research into this the more unplausable this theory becomes.\nhttp://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html?m=1\nA second problem concerns the directional relationship between points on the body to their corresponding image location on the Shroud. For example, a point on the side of the nose might conceivably be mapped perpendicular to the local body surface, or the local cloth surface where point is imaged, or vertically upwards from the nose point onto the Shroud. After careful study, I have concluded that body points are imaged essentially in the vertical upwards direction for the entire frontal image. This conclusion is further reinforced by noting that there are no side images about the frontal image and particularly in the space between the frontal and dorsal heads. If the image formation mechanism discolored the Shroud according to a principle that projected perpendicular to either the body or cloth surfaces, image shading should have occurred along the sides of the body and at the top of the head. On the other hand, a vertical mapping logically precludes shading in these regions where, in fact, no shading is observed.\nWe cannot, however, argue that the cloth was held away from the sides of the body as an attempt to explain the lack of side images, or that intervening material, such as burial spices, blocked image formation. Lavoie has shown that the blood feature off the elbow in Figure 1 could only have occurred by direct contact of the cloth with the side of the arm. Thus, the Shroud must have been in intimate contact with the body at that location and, yet, no image discolorations were formed there.\nA similar argument follows from a consideration of the space between the frontal and dorsal heads. Geometrically, the Shroud must have been in intimate contact with the top of the head, as we have shown by enfolding a human body in a cloth model of the Shroud. Again, no image discolorations can be seen there. A hypothetical chin band may explain part of the void, but it is likely not to have covered the entire head and at the same time tuck neatly under the jaw.\n\n","date":"December 28, 2012 at 8:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21296","author":"Bippy123","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"Very well informed comments Bippy, and I agree with ‘most’ all you have stated.

Perhaps curiously, the former’s photos are not as good as the one in Rogers’s “Chemist’s Perspective” and the latter do not actually include a straight photo of the ‘back’ side, which I had to Google for.\nAnyway, equipped with a school laboratory (I should say I live and work at a residential school, with continued access to ‘my’ lab in the holidays) I set to work, starting with the long-term axiom: “The image on the shroud cannot be a scorch because scorches fluoresce but the shroud image does not.” With a bas relief, a UV lamp and a sheet of linen, it was easy to discover that although fluorescence is an invariable associate of scorching, it appears as a surrounding ‘aura’ to a scorch, while the discoloured fibres themselves do not fluoresce. (unlike cotton, as I discovered much later, where the brown image itself glows brighter than the background under UV light). Further experiments showed that it was extremely difficult to prevent a scorch from travelling through the cloth and producing a clear image on the ‘back’ side, except by gently brushing the surface with a very hot spatula. However on obtaining some twill-woven cotton (I couldn’t obtain twill linen), it is very noticeable that the ‘back’ image was then much weaker than the front, compared to the 1/1 weave linen I was using. Returning to UV, it then became apparent that although strictly speaking the visible image does not fluoresce, the whole image area fluoresces quite brightly, so that any extra fluorescence produced by scorching could be difficult to detect. Rather to my surprise,I find that this background fluorescence can be obtained from myrhh (which is fluorescent in its own right, or simply heating the cloth to a little over the boiling point of water (say 150C or so).\nAs to blood stains. Observations of photographs of threads are pretty inconclusive, I think. It appears that a solvent called diimide removes bloodstains to such an extent that the fibres beneath go white (i.e. no image). However it is not clear whether the same solvent applied to image fibres without blood, or indeed non-image fibres which are ‘yellowed with age’ has the same result. It may be that diimide removes everything, including any image, in which case the idea that there is no image under the blood stains is distinctly not-proven. \nYou have noticed, I think, my capitalising of the word IF in my posting above. I have carried out a number of experiments with gravy browning, which in my bottle consists almost entirely of ‘ammonia caramel’ in water. The chemical is reasonably equivalent to the ‘impurity layer’ postulated for the shroud, with the advantage of being easily visible. Allowed to dry and teased apart, it is apparent that the colour appears principally on the outer surfaces of a cloth and, depending on how well it is soaked or rubbed in, rather less so within the thickness of a thread, or in places where two threads overlap. How much of this is due to evaporation concentration, and how much due to a failure to penetrate in the first place is difficult to say. Either way, Colin Berry’s latest post on shroudofturinwithoutallthehype reminds us that image formation had at least some effect on the structure of the fibres beneath it, which are described as altogether more fragile than non-image fibres.\nI think I’ve gone on long enough for the general readers of this blog! If you want to contact me for more information my address is hughfarey (at) hotmail (dot) com. My latest experiment is using minced beef, which I have left to decay in a boiler-house with a starch-washed sheet over it, it the hope of catching some putrescine!\n\n","date":"December 30, 2012 at 6:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21367","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch","post":"“How much of this is due to evaporation concentration, and how much due to a failure to penetrate in the first place is difficult to say.

You seem to be having fun with your experiments! … I have images of the HeadMaster of your school returning after the Christmas break to find you’ve turned his boiler-house and science labs into a scene from Silence of the Lambs as you search for putrescine (is that a substance/chemical for real?)\nAlso donkey’s years ago, I first heard of the Shroud via the Dean of my college who so happened to be Rev John Robinson, but I didnt really follow it until last Christmas and wondered why the uncertainty about it hadn’t been resolved one way or other over the intervening years. One of my interests over the years has been artistic techniques and trying to unravel how various artists created their astonishing works. So I started to look at the Shroud from that perspective whilst taking in the information that seemed to indicate an earlier than 1300 date (much of it mildly persuasive). Without carrying out experiments its hard to know for sure but it did seem to look like a mild scorch. To get the projective image it had to be either contact with a flattened plate or something like Roger’s theory (I’m not sure about Fanti’s discharge theory nor the seismic discharge theories either as neither seemed to be have appropriate directionality). My problem with Roger’s theory is 1)resolution 2)turbulence and 3)being gravity dependent it only seemed to work for the upper body image, as I can’t see how the warm gases could move downwards. Its great that you are at least experimenting with some aspects of possible image formation mechanisms.\nSo am I to take it from your experiments that it might be possible to scorch and the fluorescence might be masked or will it always show?

At 25X it is easy to see individual threads are most coloured on their exposed surfaces. At 250X and greater, it is much more difficult to identify the coloration of individual fibres, but I’m working on it! The trouble is that the thicker I make my caramel solution, the less it travels, but the thinner it is, the less visible at high magnifications.\nArtScience. After cooking a piece of linen for 20 minutes or so at 150C, or after smearing it with myrhh oil (or both, I guess), it glows quite cheerfully under UV light. In the first case it appears a faint yellow-brown under visible light (‘yellowed with age’), and in the second it has an oily translucency. Subsequent scorching at low temperatures (250C say) actually decreases the overall fluorescence. This is because the brown scorch marks do not fluoresce, so the more there are of them, the less area of fluorescent cloth is left. I do not know if it it makes a difference whether the ‘overall’ fluorescence is applied before or after the ‘image’ fluorescence.\nAnd yes; putrescine and cadaverine are amines produced by decomposing flesh.
