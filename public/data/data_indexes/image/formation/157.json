The image reminds one about the way some priests of the Russian Orthodox Church tie their hair. The “mandylion'” carried by Russian Soldiers in the battefield during the time of Tsar Nicholas II also shows the same feature, and can be seen in IWs first Shroud book, published in 1978.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 10:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/12/indifferent-to-gravity-jesus-hair-floomfs-out-and-falls-to-his-shoulders/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-98695","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Indifferent to gravity, Jesus’ hair floomfs out and falls to his shoulders","post":"Would someone tell me where these supposed records are that say the Shroud was “brighter and clearer” in earlier times? I see this mentioned in all of the skeptical literature, but I’ve never seen one direct quote or piece of evidence that says this is true. I’d like to know where that information is, and if it’s available to the general public. Thanks for any info.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 12:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/12/indifferent-to-gravity-jesus-hair-floomfs-out-and-falls-to-his-shoulders/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-98722","author":"Larry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Indifferent to gravity, Jesus’ hair floomfs out and falls to his shoulders","post":"Some people think that some barely visible features on the Shroud were more visible in the past, and depicted on some old icons of Jesus. Anyway, there are no evidence for the Shroud being brighter in the past.The fact that originally white Shroud yellowed with time (thus the contrast with the image was getting smaller) may also play some factor in the perception of the image.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 12:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/12/indifferent-to-gravity-jesus-hair-floomfs-out-and-falls-to-his-shoulders/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-98728","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Indifferent to gravity, Jesus’ hair floomfs out and falls to his shoulders","post":"Thanks very much, O.K.
