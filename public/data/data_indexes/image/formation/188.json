The darker areas on the shroud are not heavier in colour nor penetrate deeper in the fabric. They are all in monochrome and the darkness is because of the number of coloured fibres per square area. Did CB check uv fluorescence, did he check his image in transmitted light, did he check the depth of the image, was the density of the image a factor of colour variation or number of fibres?

The fluorescence thing is the major flaw in the scorchers’ argument.\nBUT.\n(Isn’t there always a ‘but’)\nThe faintness of the image suggests a very different process from the the very clear marks around the burn holes. Pellicori and Miller found that the dark scorches fluoresced in red, something I have been unable to achieve myself, and may have been produced in a very oxygen-poor environment. I have been unable to produce red fluorescence even when scorching cloth in an oxygen-free environment, so there may be something else which affected that fluorescence. Secondly, the entire cloth fluoresces quite brightly on its own, and I have no idea why. However it is difficult therefore to judge whether the faint image marks have a faint fluorescence of their own or not. My own experiments with heated spatulas, bas reliefs and so on invariably produce significant fluorescence as soon as, or even before, any discolouration of the cloth, but if the cloth was pre-treated, for example with an alkaline wash or primer, then the lower temperature required to produce discolouration might do so without producing fluorescence. I myself currently incline to a chemical rather than a heat ‘scorch,’ which might discolour cloth without producing any fluorescence at all.\n\n","date":"March 17, 2014 at 1:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/two-comments-promoted-colin-berry-has-cracked-the-shroud-enigma/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-90103","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Comments Promoted:  Colin Berry Has Cracked the Shroud Enigma?","post":"Thank you Antero.\nDear Hugh, you wrote:\n“The scorch hypothesis has not been disproved by Heimburger at all.

I agree C. Berry’s ideas are worth continued investigation.  And the concept of the cloth being treated with some agent to affect the scorching process is also worthy of further study.  I grow frustrated with all the claims of “this has been proved” or “that’s been debunked” or “I’ve cracked it!”. That is not the language of serious science. As Ray Rogers himself said, “I don’t believe in miracles that defy the laws of nature”.  While we are free to disagree with Rogers here, seeking the truth wherever it may lead is the only way forward.\n\n","date":"March 19, 2014 at 8:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/two-comments-promoted-colin-berry-has-cracked-the-shroud-enigma/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-90956","author":"matt K","site":"shroudstory"}]
