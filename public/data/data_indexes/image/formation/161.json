I may have missed it in his earlier paper, but saw no mention here concerning any pretreatment of the linen.  In this regard, please see recent posts and comments particularly alvin/daveb, “Good Chemistry Questions” of April 15 and “Remember the Valencia Conference …” of April 16. \nAlvin had made the point that Ray Rogers had succeeded in removing the image coloration on a TS fibre using diimide revealing an unaffected fibre underneath. The diimide had removed the image coloration but had not affected the fibre which remained intact.  Rogers was therefore convinced that the chromophore lay in the starch coating, not on the PCW. He was also persuaded by this result that any kind of radiation hypothesis could not be sustained. \nThe further point was made that various attempts at producing coloration, whether by excimer laser, corona discharge, or scorching should therefore be carried out or repeated using Edgerton type cloth manufactured according to the ancient methods which would leave such a residual coating. If coloration of the coaing succeeded by any of these methods, then they should be treated with diimide to see whether the coloration was in fact limited to the coating, and whether the fibrils underneath remain unaffected, as was the TS sample. \nRogers had succeeded in coloring a sample of Edgerton cloth treated with dextrin and saponaria, and exposing it to ammonia for about 10 minutes. Coloration was produced within 24 hours. However it is not clear whether Rogers tested his Edgerton treated sample with diimide to see if similar results were obtained as with his TS sample. \nThibault may wish to attempt a few scorches using Edgerton cloth and then treating the results with diimide.  He may also wish to see how any of his samples to date react with diimide.  There is yet plenty of work to do to exclude the various imaging hypotheses.\n\n","date":"April 18, 2014 at 1:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/17/the-turin-shroud-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-100573","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Turin Shroud Image is not a Scorch","post":"This a very interesting paper and food for much thought.
