[{"title":"More on Press Release from the Institute on Religion and Science of the Regina Apostolorum on the Shroud of Turin","post":"And I hope that at least one researcher is going to mention Fazio’s last article , accepted for publication in Radiocarbon Effects and Defects in Solid (April 2011) : “Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image” \nAbstract : The fibrils that yielded the Shroud body image show a stochastic distribution on the Linen of Turin. In fact, the probability of a fibril yellowing is a function of the energy, while this is not the case for the optical density value. This means that the above image is a latent image. We suggest thermal radiation or low-temperature chemical processes as possible natural energy sources to explain, by stochastic effects, the Shroud body image formation. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the phenomenon, we are not able to extract the energy source.\nhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a936373150\n\n","date":"May 13, 2011 at 3:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/13/more-on-press-release-from-the-institute-on-religion-and-science-of-the-regina-apostolorum-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-3128","author":"Cazab","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Press Release from the Institute on Religion and Science of the Regina Apostolorum on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Edit : it’s “Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids” and not “Radiocarbon Effects…”\n\n","date":"May 13, 2011 at 3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/13/more-on-press-release-from-the-institute-on-religion-and-science-of-the-regina-apostolorum-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-3129","author":"Cazab","site":"shroudstory"}]
