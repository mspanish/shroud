I like this posting very much, can follow the technical commentary very well, but not being a chemistry specialist, cannot make a detailed technical comment on the argument.  Being a relative latecomer to this Blog site, I appreciate the quotations from Raymond Rogers.\n2.  My objections to the statue thermal imprinting proposition come from its unlikelihood.  It beggars belief that anyone, even an enthusastic relic forger, would commission such an object.  (a) There was insufficient anatomical knowledge to create the accuracy of detail; (b) Any such lifesize statue woud in fact be more impressive than its mere image on a cloth; (c) There is no historical record of any such statue, and there is no contemporary tradition of making such statues with all the realism required. (d) It defies any contemporary art forms. (e) It contravenes conventional belief about the crucifixion, e.g. wrist nailing, and consequent thumb flexure.\n3.  Temperature is relative.  Have there been any tests on checking whether any fauna tightly wrapped in a linen cloth will leave a printed impression after two days, before corruption sets in?  I vaguely recall that there may have been some attempts several years ago which did include a mixture of myrrh and aloes, but they may have been inconclusive or negative,\n4.  I pick up Colin’s comment elsewhere that all (scorched?) images fade over time.  The (pseudo?)-Abgar legend says that when Addai brought the image to Abgar, the image was shining brightly (possibly a legendary over-statement).  Inquisitions of the Templars say that the head that they allegedly worshipped had a “terrible” aspect.  The present image has neither of these aspects.  On the Barrie Schwortz site, there are comments that the image seemed somewhat faded after the most recent restoration work.  It suggests that the image may have faded over the millenia, and that if so, it may well have been a lot more impressive than it now appears.\n5.  The Shroud is unique in all of relic history.  Forgers typically imitate. They seldom create originals or other unique objects, even when there is a lucrative trade in the genre, whether art, artifacts or relics.  Their copies are usually quickly discovered as forgeries.\n\n","date":"February 10, 2012 at 5:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/10/the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8120","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The image on the Shroud of Turin is not a scorch","post":"I think everyone is forgetting an important fact. The idea of the Shroud image being the product of scorches caused by a heated metal statue has been around for a long time (since the STURP days), and was first proposed by Joe Nickel, avowed atheist and Shroud skeptic.\nSince the color of the image is very similar to the color of the scorches, STURP understood the need to test this theory and performed specific experiments for that purpose.  A primary test was to photograph the Shroud using ultraviolet fluorescence photography, since true scorches on linen will always fluoresce in the red. As there are many documented scorches on the Shroud from the 1532 fire, testing this was not difficult and the results of the tests were published in this peer reviewed reference:\nMiller, V.D. and S.F. Pellicori, “Ultraviolet Fluorescence Photography of the Shroud of Turin,” Journal of Biological Photography, Vol. 49, No. 3, 1981, pp. 71-85.\nEvery documented scorch on the Shroud fluoresced in the red, as expected. However, the image did NOT fluoresce and in fact, even quenched the background fluorescence in the image areas. The only conclusion possible from these observations is that the Shroud image is NOT the product of scorched or heated linen.\n\n","date":"February 10, 2012 at 8:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/10/the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8125","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The image on the Shroud of Turin is not a scorch","post":"Actually Barrie, I think that fact was posted very early in this discussion and I think skeptics are well aware of this fact, such as our friend Bod here.

There are degrees of pyrolysis that are likely to produce different thermal degradation products with different patterns of single and double bonds and thus differing fluorescence characteristics under uv.

In fact water has 10 times the thermal conductivity of paper\nWater – 0.56 W per m per deg K\nPaper – 0.05 W per m per deg K\nThe table seems to show that paper has one of the lowest thermal conductivities of the solids listed. On the face of it, it seems to be saying the exact opposite of what you are saying about cellulose….Care to comment on that disparity?\nBut I suppose the really important question regarding your scorch theory ….the big gorilla in the room, is the lack of UV response in the image area as Barrie Schorwtz kindly points out. In science, it is important to try to not necessarily jump to conclusions….I dont know whether your scorch theory is correct or not… but the best guide we have is to see how well it fits the facts, or in the case where it doesnt, give a good explanation why not ( and with backing experimental proof). So for example, to help save your theory, could you suppose show that the scorch marks reabsorbs oxygen (or is it water?) over time in such a way that the image still remains in visible light, but  its UV response disappears (I doubt it but until you try, you never know for sure)\n\n","date":"February 11, 2012 at 2:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/10/the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8130","author":"ArtScience","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The image on the Shroud of Turin is not a scorch","post":"Well, I commend you on your research, “artscience” and do not for a moment deny those figures, or their importance in other contexts. However, by way of a partial reply, I would suggest, perhaps a little unkindly, that you inadvertently demolished your case for water as the key component with your reference to the rubber balloon working just as well. Rubber is hydrocarbon – and thus totally water-repellent…   ;-)\nThere is also the small matter of crystallinity: the highly ordered regions within cellulose fibrils (fibrils note, not necessarily fibres) do not allow water to penetrate, which explains why plants with 90% or more water in their tissues  can stay upright…\n\n","date":"February 11, 2012 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/10/the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8132","author":"sciencebod","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The image on the Shroud of Turin is not a scorch","post":"My point was to show that the major effect in your paper bag experiment could be explained by the conductivity of water, not of cellulose (which was the point of your experiment….so it was a  false conclusion you drew from your experiment).\nI did not say that the conductivity of water was the only thing going ….I even mentioned perhaps its was the thinnest of the barrier that allowed sufficient heat flow to stop hotspots developing. So you are putting words into my mouth. Going on to the rubber balloon experiment, the tables show that rubber to have more than 3 times the thermal conductivity of paper, so though rubber survived the heating, you can not conclude paper (without being water saturated) would as well. So I think your logic is skewed as well as your science, and I say this kindly.  I left it an open case, in need of further checking. So to re-iterate, you got to be careful in science to jumping to conclusions.\nHowever the figures in the table fairly demolish your argument about cellulose being a good conductor, which was your main contention. But these are diversions….I’d like to  focus on the point about the lack of UV in the scorch images. \nBTW I am generally a sceptic myself but only really started to look at the Shroud following the Tom Chivers article in Dec. The one think that struck me is actually how good some of the Shroud research and evidence is….I’ll most probably remain a sceptic, but more out of habit after 40 years in physics, its my mindset, but I’m honest enough to admit that the Shroudies seem to have the upper hand and pretty good evidence. I’m particularly impressed by the correspondences in the Hungarian Pray Manuscript, which I note you dismissed with some remark about the need to show puffs of smoke if its a set of burnt holes – that’s ridiculous (you assume the artist believe it ignited at burial?), it made me laugh out loud, I thought to myself “Here’s a man who really knows how to shoehorn data to fit his worldview”.  I do think the Shroudies have a point in saying that the sceptics avoid dealing fairly with the data, and claim too easily “Eureka, I’ve done it, I’ve shown the Shroud to be a fake” though missing much of its characteristics. Science has to be sceptical but also fair.\n\n","date":"February 11, 2012 at 5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/10/the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8136","author":"ArtScience","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The image on the Shroud of Turin is not a scorch","post":"\nMouseInTheHouse :\ni think the world can safely conclude it is not a scorch for about 12 reasons not just fluorescence prob which you deny is a prob\n\nThen could someone kindly stop the world.
