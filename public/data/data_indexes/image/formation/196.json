[{"title":"What might we learn about the Shroud of Turin?","post":"Dan,\nFor one thing this technology allows the identification of the chemical composition of any particular point on the Shroud were it employed on the Shroud. It does so essentially without affecting the Shroud and the results available in a digital format are then available indefinitely. There were similar studies made by STURP. The Quad mosaics were a rough analogy but they did not have the ability to allow specification of materials, only differences in gross composition.  A rough analogy would be the ability of the VP-8 analyzer to convert differences of intensity into a tree dimensional representation of the object.\nThe most directly relevant STURP test may have been Heller and Adler using the spectrum of Methemogloben to identify ancient blood.  It might also be possible to identify the the presence or absence of Vanillin at various places on the Shroud. Maybe we could do Arizona’s remaining sample and whatever is left of he Gonella hold back.\nThe process would work on large areas or microscopic. It would all be one digital file recording the chemical composition of each point of the globe. We might also be able to back track and create views at various points of its history.\nIt would require some adaptation of the equipment. Incidentally., a presentation of this methodology was made 14 years ago at a Shroud conference. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/grndfest.pdf  \nTwo years ago, I was examined for a tear on my retina. It wasn’t until I saw the Grunfest article a few months ago that I realized that digital spectrum photography was used in identifying the problem and directing the hand of the ophthalmologist that operated on my eye.\nI am believe that this was one of the proposals to Turin that was never acted upon.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2014 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/09/what-might-we-learn-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-77781","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What might we learn about the Shroud of Turin?","post":"This is completely non destructive.
