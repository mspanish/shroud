[{"title":"Onion skins and Dawkins","post":"What baffles me about all these attempts to reverse engineer the shroud image and claim they have found how it was fabricated in the middle ages, is that only historical reference from that era asserting the shroud to be a fake is the D’Arcis Memorandum which claims the shroud was “cleverly painted.”  We also know that this document was never sent to the pope and had clear economic and political motives.  But the question remains…who was the artist?  How did he “paint” the image when there is no visilbe trace of paint or pigment on the shroud?  The critics all start with this document but then ignore the fact that it was alleged to be a painting.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2012 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/10/onion-skins-and-dawkins/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-10304","author":"Shroud Encounter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Onion skins and Dawkins","post":"Daniel Scavone has an interesting angle on the D’Arcis memorandum in a paper he presented to the Ohio conference in 2008: BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400.  Rather than Ian Wilson’s Knights Templar theory, Scavone postulates that the Burgundian Othon de la Roche, who was Seigneur of Athens from 1204, sent the Shroud to his church St Stephens in Besancon.  It so happens that Jeanne de Vergy, widow of Geoffrey de Charnay was a direct descendant of Othon.  Besancon was vulnerable to both German and French forces, and at some time Jeanne is believed to have rescued the Shroud from St Stephens and substituted a copy showinig only the frontal view.  It can be construed that the D’Arcis memo may actually refer to this copy.  In 1389 St Stephens was destroyed by fire and all records together with the copy were lost.  Even in the rebuilt church, few records survived as a result of the subsequent Terrors of the French Revolution.

It was only a draft, no evidence ‘anywhere’ of it ever been sent or of a response to such letter (draft). Written in 1389 it states the ‘inquiry’ was proportedly done 34 years earlier by Bishop Henri de Poitiers, dating it too 1355. Problem is in 1356 Bishop dePoitiers presided at the consecration of the Lirey Church, at this consecration he gave his unqualified and lavish blessings, praising it’s canon and founder (Geoffrey de Charnay). I doubt he’d be praising anyone if a scandal had occurred just a year before. There is absolutely no record of any inquiry taking place either, no matter what year it may had occurred. D’ Arcis’s ‘claims’ are based on several layers of compounded hearsay, which would never pass in any court of any time. Further, D’Arcis never reveals his source, never vouches for the truthfullness of his information, meaning he may be simply relating gossip or rumor. To top it all off we have unequivocal scientific evidence that the Shroud in no sense of the word is a painting.\nR\n\n","date":"April 12, 2012 at 11:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/10/onion-skins-and-dawkins/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-10310","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Onion skins and Dawkins","post":"Ron, I know all of that and appreciate all those arguments.  Read what I said again.  Scavone hints in his paper that it may have been a copy that Jeanne de Vergy substituted and returned to the Besancon church that really prompted the d’arcy memo, possibly resulting from some kind of garbled misunderstanding. Seen in this light, we could understand that he felt action was required, even if he did not fully understand what had happened, and had to rely on hearsay.  It’s merely another angle on what may have prompted his memo, and consequently dilutes inferences and criticisms made on the true Shroud’s authenticity resulting from his memo.  It seems he was probably aiming at the wrong target, instead of aiming his criticism at the actual copy at Besancon.

But I’m saying it doesn’t really matter as the d’Arcis memorandom was strictly ‘heresay’, nothing more. d’Arcis never saw the Shroud, he wasn’t there in Lirey and he’s talking about something that had ‘supposedly’ occurred before his time. Therefore strictly on those grounds, it can and should be found useless with no merit. Opponents to Shroud authenticity ‘ignore’ these fundemental shortcomings of the memorandom blindly, same as they blindly ignore all the evidence for the Shroud. Thats all I’m saying.\n\n","date":"April 13, 2012 at 9:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/10/onion-skins-and-dawkins/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-10337","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Onion skins and Dawkins","post":"Sorry I also wanted to add that the Shroud opponents, at the same time regarding this ‘heresay’ memorandom as fact will totally ignore or disptute evidence such as the Hungarian Pray Manuscript or the writings of Robert d’Clari on absolutely no grounds….hypocricy at it’s best. ;-)\nR\n\n","date":"April 13, 2012 at 9:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/10/onion-skins-and-dawkins/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-10338","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Onion skins and Dawkins","post":"What does not seem to be appreciated, here or elsewhere, is that a 12.8 billion pixel digital image of the Shroud was taken as long ago as 2008 – one that was supposed to provide an invaluable resource to researchers. \nhttp://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/02/28/shroud-of-turin.html\nYet as far  as I can establish, no image files on the internet have this image or sections thereof, and there have been no scholarly papers based on that new resource (why not?)

There are copyright issues, and a degree of protectiveness on the part of the Turin custodians, perhaps understandable, but we seem to be making progress.\nI personally believe that a lot of ‘received wisdom’ re the Shroud image will need to be re-evaluated once the full 12,8 billion pixel image file becomes generally avaialble.\nI now refer to David’s banner as  “Rolfe Panel A”.

I on the other hand believe these HD images may just bring out even more tantalizing evidences to the Shroud authenticity and maybe raise more questions.
