How does Allen explain that there is an image on both sides of the cloth? How is it possible to capture 3D data with a camera? How come there is no photosensitive emulsion on the cloth?\nSomeone invented a camera 500 years before the camera was really invented, used it once to make a fake shroud, and then it disappeared from history. If someone had invented a working camera, they would have been famous.\nThis guy is really flakey. If the Discovery Channel is using his weird theory they are falling into the trap the History Channel has gotten into like UFOs and crop circles.\n\n","date":"February 21, 2009 at 8:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-281","author":"Thinker","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die","post":"Dear “Thinker”\nBefore you write something defamatory take the time to check your facts.

I thought you may find the following observation useful. It requires no science, but stands by your theory of a photograph of some sort. For a cloth that was supposed to “wrap” around someone over the head, have always wondered how the 2 images, front and back, meet on a line at the top of the head? If it was wrapped over the head to cover both top and bottom, front and back, then there would be a space between the images. A gap between them when laid flat. The images could not meet together on a thin line? Unless HE was actually paper thin? It really needs no further explaining. It can’t have been wrapped around someone as the top of the head is completely missing. Just a thought…\n\n","date":"November 14, 2013 at 7:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-51367","author":"Just a thought","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die","post":"I recently came accross a new publication titled “Origin the blood of Christ” i think it is well worth a look as the new theories are very interesting.You can find it at Smashwords.com\n\n","date":"May 8, 2009 at 4:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-456","author":"Jason Lingard","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die","post":"Ok lets move on to debunk the next phony relic, the painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe. This relic is ovbiously a painting. \nI am an artist who has studied the old masters techniques and materials and after looking at the image of OLOG it became clear to me that this supposidly holy relic was a simple painting. \nIt always puzzled me why OLOG was created in what was clearly a Renasaunce style. Did OLOG have a preference for that way of presenting herself if so why? \nI took up the challange to see just who could have painted such a portrait. I looked at the date that the painting was made and then made some comparisons with artists works who were doing art of that type in Europe.\nI was convinced that the painting was commissioned by the bishop and produced in Eurpoe as Mexican art of the time was clearly not of that style.\nAlso comming from Europe would have given a lot of cover as to the Identity of the artist. \nIt was common in the early chruch in Mexico to import painting and statuary from Europe as a way of teaching the population about Christianity. The art style of the Mexican people which was popular at that time is called Retablos a much simpler style, certianly not Renasaunce. \nafter several hours of looking at the works of artists that were popular in europe at the time on the internet I notice that there were several who could have done this painting. but clearly one or two looked most likely. Unfortunately I didn’t have the time or interest to take it further. \nAn Art Historian like Mr. Allen could probably make short work of this project and debunk another tool of deception used by the Catholic Church.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2009 at 6:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-502","author":"John of the High Desert","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die","post":"I saw a more recent documentary on the shroud. It explained that a couple researching the shroud had discovered that fibers from around 1200 A.D. were woven into the damaged portions of the shroud. Ironically, the tiny piece that the scientists were allowed to cut off of the cloth contained these fibers. As a result,  “older” cloth fibers tainted the results of the carbon dating. They then discovered that carbon dating it again would not be possible because of the chemicals used in the storage and preservation of the shroud which had subsequently been employed. So, the carbon dating was wrong! You folks who still hold onto this carbon dating error theory are in denial. Let’s face it, the shroud is astonishing, and they STILL don’t know how the image was formed. Certainly nothing in the 12th century could have produced it. It is the modern day “doubting Thomas” cure-all; I was appropriately named. :-)\n\n","date":"June 27, 2009 at 1:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-646","author":"Tom M., New Jersey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die","post":"…correcting a typo: I wrote “As a result, “older” cloth fibers tainted the results.” I meant to say that “younger” fibers had tainted the results.\n\n","date":"June 27, 2009 at 1:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-647","author":"Tom M., New Jersey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die","post":"The Italian chapter of CSICOP, i.e. CICAP has just held a conference in Abano Terme, Italy, to celebrate its 20th anniversary.
