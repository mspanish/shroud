Effectively, both man could have presented a very high level of bilirubin and urea in their blood.  Who knows if those components could not have been part of the image formation process in both cases ???  In the present state of our knowledge (and remember that this mattress wasn’t studied that much by experts in chemistry), I don’t think someone can state with 100% confidence that those imprints on the mattress have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Shroud images.  Of course, it’s pretty evident that both images don’t present exactly the same characteristics, but we have to understand that the 2 objects that received the body imprints are very different.  In this context, I don’t think nobody can be certain if there was not some chemical similarities in the processes that were at work in both cases, even if there’s good chances that those processes were not exactly the same.  More researches need to be done on both objects to be sure if there’s not some connexion (here I think mostly of chemical similarities in the processes).\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 7:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/italian-tv-on-the-enea-report/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-6520","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Italian TV on the ENEA Report","post":"The real name of “Mr Jospice” was “Mr. Les” – ;)\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 2:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/italian-tv-on-the-enea-report/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-6506","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Italian TV on the ENEA Report","post":"For how long Shroud fiction is still to prevail?\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 3:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/italian-tv-on-the-enea-report/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-6508","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Italian TV on the ENEA Report","post":"Till the end of time I’m afraid ! :-)  There will always people out there that will see God as a Mighty Magician, a Super Hero, a Tooth Fairy or something like that…  Nobody can make them believe otherwise.
