Until recently I supposed that the image side was the weft side, imagining that as one sat at a loom weaving, each of the four heddles in turn would lift every fourth thread, and the shuttle would therefore go over three warps and under one. The side facing the weaving would be predominantly weft, and the back side would be predominently warp. However, I wasn’t really thinking: of course when the sheet was cut off the loom, it wouldn’t have a front or a back, and even if it did, there’s no reason to suppose which side might be the one in contact with the ‘body.’\nNow I see that the close-ups of the weave were taken when the shroud was horizontal, and that they show predominantly horizontal threads. Unless the photos have been rotated, this means that we are looking at the warp side (as colinsberry and Thibault Heimberger suppose), not the weft.\nIs this a correct interpretation?\n\n","date":"November 7, 2012 at 10:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/27/image-is-scorched-lemonade/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-18866","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Image is Scorched Lemonade?","post":"Yes it is.
