I’ll have to rewrite the opening to that very old article written in 1996. It is incorrect. The recent comments I made are accurate and I thank Andy and Pete Schumacher for correcting my comments yesterday. I did not know the VP-8 had been donated to STURP by the manufacturer. I’ll update the article later today. Thanks Mike!\n\n","date":"March 30, 2014 at 2:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/30/nasa-had-nothing-to-do-with-it/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-94955","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"NASA had nothing to do with it.","post":"Oops.
