[{"title":"Creative Ideas That Work","post":"Yes, Dan. Today astronomy is in fact more image analysis, using sophisticated software and images from various sky surveys that are publically released. In fact anyone can make research, provided that he or she has sufficient knowledge and abilities to do so.\nLook at some sites of the astronomical surveys:\nNED: http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/\nSDSS: http://www.sdss.org/\nI would like to have similar database for Shroud studies!\nThe great help is that in astronomy there is one standard, and very portable format of graphic/data files, that is FITS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS\nIt is strange to me that it is used widely only in astronomy, and not in other scientific areas.\nBut perhpas this will change.\n\n","date":"July 21, 2014 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/21/creative-ideas-that-work/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-139643","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Creative Ideas That Work","post":"Here two or three words in order to return\nto our main topic: the Shroud …\nThe hope is that someone is (or : will be) able to interpret\nin an interesting way the images obtained by Hal9000.\nSee also: my past notes about the book by UTET.

Flickr may help in image processing in Shroud studies, but it will never reveal everything that is hidden up there. The more is found, the more the need arises to understand that there is a lot more searching to do. As time passes, flickr will not exist, new technologies will be used, more things will be discovered and with it will come the realisation that there will be a lot more searching to do.

One never gets the feeling that these are being monitored by by Shroud researchers who repeat again and again that piece about the stitch found on a woollen cloth from Masada. Sure, herringbone weaves in linen are known from ancient times (as they are from medieval times) ,so why not correlate the evidence and see where it leads?\n\n","date":"July 22, 2014 at 4:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/21/creative-ideas-that-work/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-139772","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Creative Ideas That Work","post":"E.g.
