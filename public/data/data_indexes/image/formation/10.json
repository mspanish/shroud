I wanted to point out that the original observation Rogers made in 1978 was this: “Tapes pulled from the darker body-image areas with extreme ease: I could barely measure the pulling force.”\nAnd such an observation concerned ONLY the level of Adherence of the tapes that was much lower in the image areas and this never concerned the strength of the fibers themselves. Here’s the correct interpretation made by Rogers himself: “Dehydration causes shrinkage; therefore, any coating of carbohydrate impurities would “CRAZE” during dehydration. Such a crazed coating would be easy to pull off with adhesive, explaining the EASY REMOVAL of tapes from image areas.”\nIn other words, according to Rogers, the fact that there are fibers in the image areas whose surface impurities were dehydrated, it produces a narrowing of the impurity layer accompanied by fine cracks, which results in reducing the Adherence level of the surface of the cloth and it is for this reason that the tape applied by him were much easier to take off in areas with image.  That’s all!!! It has nothing to do with the level of ease to remove fiber or not, as it was suggested by Fanti et al. in their paper. \nNote that, according to Rogers, the result would be the same if it was pcw (or entire fiber) would be oxidized and/or dehydrated. In short, this observation Rogers made in Turin in 1978 does not say what is the real chromophore of the image.  BUT…  It cannot be taken as something that can go against Rogers’ hypothesis concerning the chromophore being located ONLY in a thin layer of impurities on-top of the fibers.\nAnd for Rogers, this observation made by himself in 1978 is totally consistent with his hypothesis concerning the image chromophore concerning the impurities.  Here’s one relevant quote of Rogers about that: “…the surfaces (of the image fibers) appeared to be “CORRODED”. That observation suggests that a VERY THIN COATING OF CARBOHYDRATE had been significantly dehydrated on the OUTER SURFACES of the fibers.”\nYou see?  For Rogers, the corroded aspect of the image fibers was simply to a dehydration of the impurity layer and this dehydrated layer was the cause of the lower adherence level of the image areas surfaces.  That’s all!!!!\nFanti et al. would like people to believe that Rogers was dead wrong and that the primary cell wall is the real chromophore and to do that, they have made a bad extrapolation of one of Rogers’ observation concerning the sticky tapes…  Why do you think they want so much the chromophore to reside in the primary cell wall instead of a thin layer of impurities? Simply because that’s the result they get with their personal image-formation hypotheses involving a corona discharge or a UV laser!!!\n\n","date":"January 1, 2013 at 5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21434","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"I want to re-write one phrase: “Note that, according to Rogers, the result would be the same if it was the primary cell wall (or the entire fiber) that would have been oxidized and/or dehydrated.”  \nAnd I forget one word in this part: You see?

THAT’S THE REALITY and THIS IS NOT HOW SCIENCE SHOULD WORK.  The way they proceed was like doing science in reverse…  Rogers proceeded exactly in the contrary of that.  First, he collected all the solid facts and observations (especially the diimide and the ghosts, along with the fact that the image only resides on the external surface of the cloth), and then, he build a testable hypothesis and only then, he made some preliminary tests and got a coloration very similar chemically and physically as the coloration he observed himself on the Shroud through a microscope.  Note that Rogers was a true microscopist and chemist who observed the Shroud in person in Turin, totally unlike Di Lazzaro, Fanti et al.\nAnd concerning the interpretation these authors made about the observation of Rogers that it was easier to remove the tapes in image areas (“suggesting that the topmost fibers in the image area were somehow weakened”), I never found anything of that nature in Rogers papers…  On the contrary, here’s what I found: “…the surfaces (of the image fibers) appeared to be “CORRODED”. That observation suggests that a VERY THIN COATING OF CARBOHYDRATE had been significantly dehydrated on the OUTER SURFACES of the fibers.”\nIf you want to put your trust on people who have personal hypotheses to defend (which always represent a great danger of bias), it’s your liberty.  Of course, people will tell me that Rogers too had a personal hypothesis to defend, but as I said, in the case of Rogers, and unlike Fanti et al, he followed properly the scientific method by developing a testable hypothesis that include the possibility that the chromophore could really be only located in a layer of impurities and ONLY THEN, he made some preliminary tests to verify if his hypothesis had some chances to be good.  His first results were good enough for him, so he continue to defend his hypothesis until his death.  Don’t worry about the fact that if his results would not have been good enough, Rogers would have change (again) his mind about the chromophore and would have started to look elsewhere for a proper explanation. I didn’t.  To me, that speaks loud.\n\n","date":"January 1, 2013 at 8:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21447","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"Please Hugh, read again my newest paper (https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/yannick-clc3a9ment_raymond-n-rogers-observations-and-conclusions-concerning-the-body-image-that-is-visible-on-the-shroud-of-turin.pdf) and you’ll see that Rogers NEVER wrote that the image fibers were more fragile or would broke more easily or something like that.

If the image were produced by radiation, image and non-image fibers should be much different.”\nAnd finally, here’s a good question:  Is it possible that Fanti et al. made an interpretation mistake while attributing a physical characteristic of weakness to the color fibers while, in fact, this characteristic applied to the fibers that were scorched by the fire of 1532???  I think this is a possible explanation…  I would not have any problem to believe that the scorched fibers on the Shroud are more fragile and could break more easily than the non-image fibers that were not affected by this fire…\n\n","date":"January 1, 2013 at 9:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21452","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"Last thing for tonight:  I have made a quick research in the paper presented by Fanti and many other researchers at the 2005 Dallas conference about the Shroud which contains an exhaustive list of facts and unconfirmed data concerning the Shroud (link: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/doclist.pdf) and I never found anything in there suggesting that the image fibers on the Shroud were more fragile or could break more easily than the non-image fibers.  In fact, it’s the opposite as I have noticed one observation coming from Rogers suggesting the contrary (pretty much the same than what I just gave you above): “The crystal structure of the cellulose of image fibers has not visibly changed with respect to that of non-image fibers (scorches have).”\nSo, let me ask you the question: If it’s a fact that the crystal structure of the image and non-image fibers is the same, then why the image fibers could really be more fragile than the non-image fibers???

In sum, I think Rogers was probably right about the impurities as the main chromophore but I think it is truly possible that the growth nodes (or dislocation bands as Thibault call them) could also have been affected by the image formation process directly or by a long time of exposure to a dehydrated layer of impurities that was in direct contact with them. It is this chemical degradation of the growth nodes (dislocation bands) that would have been eventually responsible for the fact that the image fibers really appear to be more fragile and could break more easily…  I think this idea deserves some thoughts.\n\n","date":"January 2, 2013 at 2:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21485","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"Although I tend to think that Rogers hypothesis is in a good position in the ranking of plausibility,  in this blog we can customarily read what in my view, are too cathegorical statements on aspects that would need further and independent confirmation.\nThis is particularly true in the aspects being discussed in this post, that in my opinion, to be definitively established as being this way or another, would need an independent verification with state-of-the-art methods.\nAfter reading for months on the Rogers views about the structure of the fibers, the chromophore and the impurity layer, I have the feeling that the same arguments are being repeated once and again, we are moving in circles and almost everything eventually comes down to Rogers observations.\nI dont have any reason to doubt about his scientific profile, but at this moment, I have the impression the discussion does not progress the least and I need other observations to make my mind up and as said before, Rogers is in a good position in the ranking, but – I know some will not like this- if objectively analyzed, is far from being the final explanation.\n\n","date":"January 2, 2013 at 7:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21464","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"Gabriel, You are right about your position and the broken record is something that has been pointed out by me from time to time.\n\n","date":"January 2, 2013 at 9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21467","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"Yes, that’s the point Louis.

You can found this exact quote in page 11 of that paper.\nAnd I can also confirm the accuracy of the rest of that particular quote in Fanti et al. paper that say: “the linen fibers seen on the body-image tapes shorter and more fractures than are those from nonimage areas.” This comes directly from the paper “A Comprehensive Examination of the Various Stains and Images on the Shroud of Turin” published in 1984 by Jumper, Adler, Jackson, Pellicori, Heller and Druzik. You can find this exact quote in page 454 of that paper, along with the same quote taken from Rogers and Schwalbe’s paper. Here’s the entire quote: “Schwalbe and Rogers note that in removing the tape samples, the tape pulled up more easily from the body-image areas than from the non-image areas. The linen fibrils seen on the body-image tapes are shorter and more fractured than are those from non-image areas. Both of these observations suggest that the body-image fibrils are more chemically degraded than are those from the non-image areas.”\nIt’s interesting to note the little change at the end. Rogers and Schwalbe wrote “somehow weakened” and Jumper et al. wrote “more chemically degraded”, which can mean roughly the same thing in the end. \nAnd in the same paper published by Jumper et al., I have found 2 others relevant quotes:\n“The physical properties of the cloth in the areas of the body-only image (the microscopically corroded appearance, the lack of migration of the image with water, THE LOWER TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE COLORED FIBRILS, and the lack of color change in the presence of elevated temperature) are all consistent with this sort of chemistry (i.e. the chemistry of a light scorch).” You can found this exact quote in page 456 of that paper and they gave the paper published by Rogers and Schwalbe as a reference for these observations.\n“At 500x to 1000x magnification, the (non-image) fibrils have the typical morphology of linen, but their surfaces are only lightly corroded (oxidized) although clearly less than body-only image fibrils as seen by phase microscopy. There are, also, FEWER BROKEN AND CRUSHED FIBRILS THAN IN THE BODY-ONLY IMAGE AREAS, SHOWING LESS DEGRADATION in further support the arguments presented in the body-only image chemistry (i.e. that the image is the product of an oxidation-dehydration of the linen fibers).” You can found this exact quote in page 464 of that paper and they gave no reference this time, so I assume that such a microscopic conclusion came from Adler and Heller.\nNow that I have found all these pertinent quotes, I have to think that Rogers really change his mind drastically between the days of the STURP team and the last few years of his life, while he was trying to explain the image scientifically, because at first sight, when you only consider these quotes, you really have a sense that it is effectively the linen fibers themselves that have been chemically degraded by the image formation process in a similar way than the scorched fibers on the Shroud.\nIt’s somewhat intriguing to note that, in all the writings he did in the last few years of his life, Rogers never reported the observation that probably came from Adler and Heller concerning the fact that “there are more broken and crushed fibrils in image areas, showing more degradation.”\nHowever, he did talked about the fact that the surfaces of the image fibers are more corroded (chemically degraded) and interpret it like this: “At high optical magnifications, up to 1000X, no coatings could be resolve on the surfaces of image fibers; however, the surfaces appeared to be “corroded”. That observation suggests that a very thin coating of carbohydrate had been significantly dehydrated on the outer surfaces of the fibers.”\nSo, near the end of his life, Rogers was really thinking that the chemical degradation noted by himself and other STURP members during the STURP investigation could be consistent with a body image color that would be located only in a thin layer of impurities while leaving the linen fiber intact.  He also wrote: “Dehydration causes shrinkage; therefore, any coating of carbohydrate impurities would “craze” during dehydration. Such a crazed coating would be easy to pull off with adhesive, explaining the easy removal of tapes from image areas.” Again, this quote show that, near the end of his life, Rogers was really thinking that the observation he made in Turin in 1978 concerning the fact that the sticky tape pulled up more easily from the body-image areas than from the non-image areas could be due to a dehydrated layer of impurities instead of an oxidation-dehydration of the linen fiber itself (possibly located in the primary cell wall).\nSo far, I have no problem with Rogers reasoning. But I have some difficulty to understand Rogers thinking in the light of the observation probably reported by Adler and Heller that “there are more broken and crushed fibrils in image areas, showing more degradation.” Unfortunatelly, in all the official writings of Rogers that I have read for my documentary research, I never found a place where he talked about that particular observation versus his own hypothesis concerning the impurities. Too bad Rogers is not here no more to adress that issue!\nNevertheless, because Rogers seemed to be so convinced that all the facts and observations coming from the Shroud were consistent with the hypothesis of a body image color only present in a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities while the underneath fibers are left intact, I JUST CAN’T IMAGINE SOMEONE AS PROFESSIONAL AS ROGERS NEGLECTING SUCH AN IMPORTANT OBSERVATION when he was trying to build a scientific hypothesis to explain the Shroud’s image!  Such an idea is just too ludicrous when you know the integrity and profesionalism of a guy like Rogers and when you consider the fact that he was the one who lifted up the samples on the Shroud with sticky tapes!  \nIn fact, when you read the last part of the quote taken from the STURP paper he wrote with Schwalbe and that say: “suggesting that the topmost fibers in the image area were somehow weakened”, you really have a sense that he agreed with this observation probably made by Adler and Heller that the image fibers are more fragile than the non-image fibers, which seems to back-up the conclusion of the STURP team (including Rogers at the time) that the image on the Shroud was the product of an oxidation-dehydration of the internal structure of the linen fibers. Because of this, we must believe that when he build his hypothesis for the Shroud’s image near the end of his life, Rogers wasn’t thinking that this particular observation was in contradiction with the idea that the body image color could really be located only in a thin layer of impurities while leaving the linen fiber intact. \nI know that, at first sight, this sounds strange because the observation probably reported by Adler and Heller really seem to suggest that it is the linen fibers themselves that have been weakened by the image formation process… But as I say, I just can’t imagine that Rogers would have forgotten or neglected (consciously or not) to taken such an important observation into account while he was building his personal hypothesis. That’s something I just can’t believe! So, if he concluded that a chromophore located only in a thin layer of impurities was the best hypothesis that can explain all the pertinent observations and facts coming from the Shroud, we must think that such an hypothesis can also explain that particular observation that was probably reported by Adler and Heller.  I’m sure you understand my reflection! \nThe only problem is the fact that Rogers, to my knowledge, never talked directly about this particular issue in his later writings about the Shroud. Effectively, in all his later writings, Rogers, with his personal hypothesis concerning the impurities, gave a possible explanation for the corroded aspect of the surface of the image fibers and also for the fact that it was much easier to pull out the sticky tapes from the surface of the image areas, but as I know, he never wrote something to explain the fact that the image fibers seemed to be more fragile and easy to broke, in the light of his hypothesis concerning the impurities.  \nDid that mean that, in some chemical way, a dehydrated layer of impurities located on-top of the linen fibers could render the underneath fibers more fragile and easy to break???  In my mind, that’s the only rational conclusion we can make if Rogers’ hypothesis is correct…  \nFor example, would it be possible that a dehydrated layer of impurities could affect the stability of the “growth nodes” of the fiber so much that the fibers would become more fragile and easy to break, while leaving the crystal structure of the fibers intact?  Note: the crucial fact that the crystal structure of the image fibers is no more defective or damaged than the non-image fibers is an observation reported many times by Rogers in his writings, making it hard to believe that the structure of the fiber (whether it be only the primary cell wall or the most deeper part of the fiber) could really have been colored during the image formation process. Here the most important quotes of Rogers about that:\n“Direct comparison between image and non-image parts of the Shroud shows exactly the same amounts and types of radiation damage in the two types of areas.”\n“…the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non-image fibers.”\n“There is absolutely no evidence for destruction (damage in the fiber’s structure) in any of the image fibers: other than possessing a colored coating, they are identical to non-image fibers.”\n “If (John) Jackson were correct, and energetic photons caused the image color, the image areas should show significantly different amounts of diffuse radiation damage than the non-image areas. They do not.”\nHonestly, if these comments of Rogers are correct and if Rogers’ hypothesis is also correct concerning the impurities, then I don’t think there are many other valid options to explain the STURP observation concerning the more fragile aspect of the image fibers than thinking that the growth nodes of the fibers (and only that) were chemically affected (probably degraded) in some way, maybe directly by the image formation process or maybe a long time after that process was active, by the presence of a dehydrated layer of impurities next to them. \nAnd I even have a feeling that such an hypothesis could explain pretty well this other observation of Rogers: “The color of image fibers was often stripped off of their surfaces, leaving molds of the fibers in the adhesive. THE MOLDS SHOW BOTH GROWTH NODES AND IMAGE COLOR.”\nOne thing’s for sure:  Rogers certainly had a proper scientific explanation concerning that more fragile aspects of the image fibers that would fit with his hypothesis about the impurities, or else, he would never changed his mind so drastically concerning the chromophore of the image!!!  So, personally, I still think his hypothesis about the impurities is the best we have to explain the Shroud’s image because, in my mind, it’s the only one that offer a rational explanation for some very particular observations coming from the Shroud like the reduction of the color with diimide leaving a clean fiber behind, the ghosts who also left a clean fiber behind, the absence of a noticeable difference in the crystal structure of image and non-image fibers and the very superficial  nature of the body image… Effectively, Rogers made it clear in his writings that all these observations are inconsistent with the idea of a chromophore located in the linen fiber itself.\nBut in the light of all the observations I reported in this long comment, I also think that, along with the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the impurities, the growth nodes can also have been chemically degraded by the image formation process or by a long time of exposure to a dehydrated layer of impurities that was in direct contact with them. I truly think that this hypothesis should be investigated more deeply…  And if my feeling is right about these growth nodes, then the question that comes to my mind is:  Did these growth nodes of the image fibers are also colored like the layer of impurities or did they have been affected more mildly without having produced any color?\n\n","date":"January 2, 2013 at 2:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21482","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"Complementary note concerning my previous comment #21 (just above): I used the term “growth nodes” to talk about a specific part of the linen fiber that should be called “dislocation bands”, as Thibault Heimburger told us in his recent comment.  I kept that term because it was known to most shroudies and because this is the term used by Rogers in all his writings about the Shroud.  But in the end, that doesn’t change anything for the long reflection I share with you in this comment.  In the light of all the known data and observations coming from the Shroud, I think it’s truly possible that Rogers was correct with his idea of the main chromophore being only a thin layer of impurities but I now think that it’s also possible that the growth nodes (or dislocation bands) of the linen fibers could have been affected enough that this possible “chemical degradation” could be responsible for the fact that the image fibers of the Shroud appear the be more fragile.  In sun, I don’t think this single observation should be considered as being a real problematic fact that goes against Rogers’ hypothesis concerning the chromophore, but I think Rogers’ hypothesis should be reconsidered and/or more precisely described in the light of this observation because, as I said in my long comment, I have not been able to find any direct comment of Rogers concerning this particular issue and I really think he should have address it in his writings.\n\n","date":"January 2, 2013 at 3:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21487","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”","post":"Gabriel way back at #14: “Although I tend to think that Rogers hypothesis is in a good position in the ranking of plausibility, in this blog we can customarily read what in my view, are too cathegorical statements on aspects that would need further and independent confirmation.” \nI agree completely.

On the contrary, the 2 authors were clear about the fact that, in theory, the 2 most likely processes that could give such a discontinuous distribution is thermal radiation or low-temperature chemical processes and they mentioned specifically the hypothesis of Rogers as a possible answer to the Shroud’s image…  Now, if that’s not independent confirmation that, at least, Rogers was close to the truth regarding the Shroud, I don’t know what it is.  \nOf course, this conclusion of the Italian researchers is only theoretical for the moment.

I truly think that this hypothesis should be investigated more deeply…  And if my feeling is right about these growth nodes, then the question that comes to my mind is:  Did these growth nodes of the image fibers are also colored like the layer of impurities or did they have been affected more mildly without having produced any color?”\nI think we can find a beginning of answer in a few important quotes of Rogers that you can find in my recent paper in which he talks about the reduction of the image color with diimide and the resulting aspect of the linen fiber:\n“Heller and Adler found that the image fibers could be decolorized with diimide. Reduction left colorless, undamaged cellulose fibers behind. All image color resides on the outer surface of the fibers.”\n“The image can be chemically reduced with diimide leaving colorless cellulose fibers.  The color resides only on the surface of the fibers, and it is the result of conjugated double bounds.  The underlying cellulose (linen) fibers are not colored.”\n“The image color can be reduce chemically (diimide and sodium borohydride), leaving colorless, lustrous linen fibers.”\n“The layer of color can be specifically reduced with diimide, leaving a colorless flax fiber behind.  Diimide reduction confirmed the presence of double bounds.”\n“Adler’s observation (concerning the decolorization of the image with diimide) proved that the cellulose was not involved in image formation. This is an extremely important observation.”\nThese few quotes of Rogers are well-enough to understand that the reduction of color left an linen fiber completely intact behind. It’s important to note that all these quotes of Rogers never suggest that the growth nodes (dislocation bands) were damaged after the color reduction with diimide.  So, taking this EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OBSERVATION (Rogers words) into account, I think that even if it’s possible that the growth nodes have been CHEMICALLY DEGRADED enough to render the image fibers more fragile and easy to break, we must assume that those growth nodes of the image fibers WERE NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY (OR IN THE SAME PROPORTION) THAN THE THIN LAYER OF CARBOHYDRATES IMPURITIES ON-TOP OF THE IMAGE FIBERS, WHICH IS MOST PROBABLY THE REAL CHROMOPHORE OF THE IMAGE. \nThis reflection makes me believe that, unlike the thin layer of impurities, these growth nodes were PROBABLY NOT colored by the image-formation process, which seems to suggest that the possible chemical degradation that could have affect them enough to render the image fibers more fragile only came later on, well after the image-formation process has stoped and was probably a bit different than the dehydration process described by Rogers for the impurities. In other words, I still think that a chemical degradation of the growth nodes could explain why the image fibers seems to be more fragile and easy to break, but now, after taking into account Rogers comments about the diimide reduction of the color, I am much more skeptical concerning the possibility that these growth nodes could have been also colored during the image-formation process. I think that IF they really were chemically degraded, it is more probable that such a chemical degradation was slowly caused by a long period of direct contact with the colored layer of impurities that has been probably dehydrated during the image-formation process. \nSo, if the growth nodes are really the cause of the more fragile aspect of the image fibers, I think it’s fair to assume that their chemical degradation was DIFFERENT (AND PROBABLY LESS RADICAL) than the very probable dehydration of the impurities present on-top of the colored fibers. Otherwise, the use of diimide would surely have cause some noticeable damages in these growth nodes, which is something that doesn’t seem to have happened. To my knowledge, there is no report about that in the writings of Adler or Rogers.  In fact, when you read their reports about that, you really have a sense that all the diimide have done is to remove the color that was resting on-top of the fibers and that’s all! Finally, I think it’s also fair to assume that such a chemical change in the growth nodes probably happened very slowly and gradually, which eventually caused a more fragile nature for the image fibers after a pretty long period of time (i.e. a long time of exposure to the dehydrated layer of impurities present on-top of them). \nAnd if that’s what really happened, we must also conclude that the rest of the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) was much more stable than these growth nodes because it’s only this tiny part of the linen fibers (the growth nodes) that would have been chemically degraded in some way by the dehydrated layer of impurities present on-top of them (which would be the real and only chromophore of the image). Here’s we must trust Rogers judgment who said that the linen fibers were left “colorless, lustrous and undamaged” after the use of diimide and who also said many times in his writings that “the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non-image fibers”. Finally, we must also take into account this other very important comment of Rogers concerning the ghosts, which really seem to confirm the fact that the growth nodes are really more unstable (i.e. more susceptible to chemical degradation) than the rest of the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall): “The color of image fibers was often stripped off of their surfaces, leaving molds of the fibers in the adhesive. The molds show BOTH GROWTH NODES AND IMAGE COLOR.” \nTo summarize my thoughts, I would say that the probable more unstable nature of the growth nodes versus the rest of the linen fiber, which was probably caused by the presence of a dehydrated layer of impurities next to them, is probably responsible for the fact that the image fibers really seem to be more fragile and easy to break… Since I’m not a chemist, you can see that I have often used the words “probable” and “probably” in this conclusion! There’s no doubt in my mind that if Rogers could have talked specifically about this issue in his writings, I would not have been forced to use these words and my conclusion would have rest on a much more solid ground!\nAnyway, that’s where I now stand in my reflection about the chromophore of the image, mainly because of the diimide and the ghosts observations. And this leads me to two important questions: \n1- Is it possible that a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities located on-top of a linen fiber and that have been chemically dehydrated could gradually affect the integrity of the growth nodes of this fiber so much that some of these nodes would have been left in the sticky tapes used by Rogers, along with the colored impurities of the body image?\n2- Is it possible that a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities located on-top of a linen fiber and that have been chemically dehydrated could gradually affect the integrity of the growth nodes of this fiber so much that they became weak enough to render this linen fiber more fragile and easy to break?\nThese are good questions that I think only an expert in chemistry could answer properly… Nevertheless, I have a feeling that the answer could be yes to both questions. The key word in these 2 questions is “gradually”, because I have a feeling that a long period of direct contact between the growth nodes and the colored impurities could really be the ultimate cause of the probable weakness of the growth nodes.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2013 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-21548","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
