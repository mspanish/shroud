You see, I have checked my thesaurus, and nowhere do I see “appropriate” listed as a simile for “outlandish”. \nPost carbon-dating, the default position re the science bit is that the Shroud is a medieval fake. Theories about invisible reweaving, spliced threads, cunning dyeing with alizarin etc etc which are just that – theories – no disrespect to the late Ray Rogers – cannot alter the fact that the Shroud fabric is medieval era in origin – until proven otherwise.\nThe Shroud is just a re-run (or should that be pre-run?) of the Piltdown Man, but having a supernatural dimension it has attracted a far greater following from those of a particular religious persuasion (there, I’ve said it) and one moreover with an immensely greater stake in the outcome of the debate.\nMy interest, at least initially, was not in proving the Shroud was a fake, but in rejecting the claim that it defied scientific explanation (yup, the two are subtly different).  But you know how it is – bit between the teeth, mission creep etc etc…\n\n","date":"March 4, 2012 at 3:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/04/stephen-jones-has-an-important-posting-on-heated-bas-relief-images/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8926","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones has an important posting on heated bas relief images","post":"Colin, your comparison to Piltdown man is exceedingly weak.  How does part of a skull and a jawbone fraudulently hyped as the missing link in any way compare with the Shroud? All the detractors of the Shroud allege that it was the work of an artist in some way shape or form.  If that is the case, then certainly the process or technique used by the alleged artist should be able to be replicated. Its that simple.  So far McCrone, Nickell, Allen and others have all been proven wrong.  None of them to date, including you have made a credible copy using some alleged medieval technique.  It is a reasonable request.

If he’d spent a semester or two in the Philosophy dept while at Uni, he might have picked up a few useful lessons in Logic and Critical Thinking.\nThe various pieces of corroborative evidence act in parallel, not in series.  If they operated in series it would indeed be sufficient to rebut only one piece of evidence for the case to fall over.  But they act independently in parallel, so that it’s necessary to rebut each piece of evidence in order to prove a hoax.\nIf the image is a scorch, as he maintains, then the heat emanated from the virtue of the Shroud Man, not from any notional Wizard of Oz Tin Man that never existed.\nHe’ll probably accuse me of more Ad hom argument, that I’m denigrating him; but that’s not my intention; it’s just that his whole approach is inadequate to the case.  Unfortunately there’s a few vulnerable souls out there who take his word as gospel.  But the truth of the gospel lies elsewhere.\nI read Stephen Jones response on his site, and even though he has his own persepective on the matter, it adequately covers the case.

Ian Wilson in his 2010 book gives some interesting insights into the background of the pre-sampling haggling among the stake-holders.  The Papal scientific representative had lain out a well-designed formal protocol, both for sampling and testing, and this had included labs using more traditional and proven methods.  (Sorry I don’t presently have Wilson’s book at hand to set out the specifics.)  The Papal representative was no match for the street-wise Turin rep, a lecturer at some Turin Polytech, nor for the three lab reps, anxious to get in on the action and enhance the reputation of their relatively unknown new methods.  The formal protocol was ditched, and the selection of the sample was virtually done on a spur of the moment decision, no formal representative sampling process being involved at all.  The result was that the tradtional proven labs eventually went out of business, and the three new labs, all clones of one another enhanced their reputation, and continue to thrive – such are the ways of the world!

Seeing as just about everyone involved knew quite well that that specific corner of the Shroud showed signs of being different from the rest of the cloth (this fact has been brought up by several people, including the late Ray Rogers). But what is almost never mentioned is that the STURP team was involved early in the process and were completely excluded at the end, including many exploratory tests which had been designed by the team…this exclusion has never been explained either.
