How can Paolo Di Lazzaro claim  that it has to be radiation of a highly specific kind, modelled by his specialist laser?  Extremely short pulses of coherent high energy radiation are needed he says to explain the extreme superficiality of the TS image layer (“300 – 600nm”). Yet in the same breath he says the image is confined to the PCW of linen fibres, not affecting deeper layers.\nI’m sure i don’t need to remind him that the PCW has a rather different chemical composition from the core cellulose in the SCW, with a higher proportion of reactive hemicelluloses, and with relatively non-crystalline cellulose (also more reactive). They allow the young cell wall to expand in its active growth phase, prior to acquiring the SCW.  So who’s to say the image superficiality is not simply due to exposed botanical placement and chemical factors, needing no fancy radiation to make it turn yellow, all that’s needed being more conventional chemical or thermal insults?\nPaolo is the only scientist quote unquote I know of who has ended a press release by imagining that his (let’s face it) underwhelming results – a faint yellow discoloration of linen with NO attempt to project an image from a person or object – might elicit  “a philosophical and theological debate”.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-say-turin-shroud-is-supernatural-6279512.html\n\n","date":"March 31, 2015 at 9:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/31/whats-to-like-over-on-colins-blog-right-now/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-194963","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What’s to like over on Colin’s blog right now?","post":"Clarifications:\nHugh: errr.. So Paolo di Lazzaro is being classified as an amateur? How nice,coming as it is from the editor of the BSTS newsletter. I understand that the newsletter has no party line, and that is correct, however it does seem that the Italian scientist’s research is being underestimated. Is’nt it so? \nIt also appears that the responses in the interview have not been read with care, for the second time. Di Lazzaro used the words “current paradigm” with reference to another scientist.\nObviously I respect his opinion because he responded as a scientist, not as a biblical scholar or systematic theologian. The part about the New Testament and systematic theology was my opinion in the introduction and I stand by what was stated.\nI personally believe that “current paradigm” means something, but only to a certain extent. Can science answer all our questions? Only someone indulging in scientism would say that. Science can indeed inform philosophy when it comes to some questions, as Dennett seems to have demonstrated, but he is religion-friendly and knows a lot about Catholicism. There are questions that science simply cannot answer. It is something that even Stephen Hawking seems to admit. How far can “current paradigm” be stretched?\nColin: errr… Di Lazzaro never said that it was radiation. If you read my question it says “radiation-like…” and that was prompted because laser was used. From what I can understand, “extreme short pulses” are needed to explain the extreme superficiality of the image on the Shroud. If you can perform an experiment demonstrating such extreme superficiality, not forgetting to take all that is seen on the relic’s image into account, I would love to see it. Di Lazzaro is looking for people who can perform experiments, he never said that his research is the last word on the topic. \n———————————–\nWhat is coming next, within the next few days, will require the attention of both of you, in the field of science. It has nothing to do with scorch, painting, printing, photography. The research is sort of just beginning, but it has made a good start.\n\n","date":"March 31, 2015 at 2:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/31/whats-to-like-over-on-colins-blog-right-now/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-194989","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What’s to like over on Colin’s blog right now?","post":"How scientific is it Louis to fire laser beams at linen to get “coloration” of the fibres when you don’t know what chemical changes you are producing, or which class of carbohydrates are being modified, or even whether they are the same changes as those on the TS? And when champagne corks pop because the coloration has been confined to the PCW, might one not reasonably ask whether coloration of the PCW could have been achieved by more mundane means, given the highly superficial location of PCW carbohydrates of linen fibres – essentially a redundant surface film – and their greater susceptibility to chemical or thermal treatments compared to the highly crystalline core cellulose of the SCW?\nHow scientific was it to go to the media with one’s gee whizz lasers, claiming one has a model that should get us all thinking about philosophy and theology, and then 3 years down the line be saying “Well, it’s not necessarily radiation that produced the TS, but something, you know, sort of, er, radiation-like”. If the energy input is not defined, then it’s not science, but pie-in-sky speculation.\nI look forward to hearing you new thinking  Louis. Any hints as to the energy source – chemical, thermal or radiation?  Please don’t tell us it’s “radiation-like”.  Please assure us your ideas are testable, at least in principle, and better still in practice, on a realistic time scale.\nMeanwhile, I shall continue trying to think like a medieval artisan, looking for a way of creating an imprint on linen that can be claimed to be that left on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen. No lasers are permitted. Image superficiality is just one of numerous boxes that have to be ticked.

Image fibres are weaker than non-image fibres. That was shown by the ease with which they could break off and stick to Rogers’ Mylar adhesive tape. It would take more than changes in the PCW – an ultra- thin skin on a much thicker mainly SCW fibre – to render the entire fibre brittle and prone to fracture. (Let’s not forget that the Mylar initially stripped off entire fibres – not image “ghosts” – the latter not being seen/inferred until image fibres were subsequently pulled away from the tape).\nTry by all means to get the Vatican to consider your AFM scanning. But let’s dispense with the notion that the imaging process affected only the most superficial parts of the fibre. The core of a linen fibre is not entirely crystalline cellulose. There are significant amounts of hemicelluloses and pectins there too –  the so-called non-cellulosic polysaccharides (NCPs).Their physical and/or chemical disruption could compromise the strength and integrity of the entire fibre. Being in a minority relative to cellulose microfibrils means that changes to those NCPs might not be so readily visible as coloration, which is where we came in.\n\n","date":"April 1, 2015 at 4:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/31/whats-to-like-over-on-colins-blog-right-now/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-195057","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What’s to like over on Colin’s blog right now?","post":"In March 26, 2013 at 1:08 pm\nI indicated that :\n>I believe that now we have the possibility to control the linen fibrils using the SPM apparels (AFM, SNOM, etc.)\nand this is by no means a mantra, as instead was interpreted the question by Louis, who (I suppose) wrote in a joking way …\nHowever it is not sure that the technique of preparation for furneral linens was just the same and in Egypt the weather is a bit different compared to Jerusalem.\nI think it is possible to work [in a Project] in the field of “Diagnostic Methods for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage” using an AFM Microscope … [and I have read something about an AFM/SNOM Mod.Multiview 1000  (Nanonics).

Rather than reading absurdities behind the text that aren’t there – thinking that I or Colin call di Lazzaro an amateur for example – just take what is written as it comes. What am I to make of this?\n“Di Lazzaro never said that it was radiation.”\nfollowed by this:\n“Of course VUV radiation is pure radiation.”\nand then this:\n“I do not believe that radiation had anything to do with the image.”\nWhat on earth does this mean? Fortunately you followed up with:\n“Now, it seems that you have not understood why I used that term.” And you’re absolutely correct about that.\nAnd why did I say that Colin could proceed with Science while di Lazzaro waits for a change in paradigm. Because by his own admission Colin is on a journey of discovery concerning the image formation, while di Lazzaro has succeeded in what he wanted to do, but acknowledges that it cannot have happened without a miracle. After discussing the problems with Jackson’s hypothesis – “of a body wrapped by the Shroud that becomes mechanically transparent while emitting VUV radiation” – and Rogers’s experiments – “samples often were converted into a little amorphous powder and gas” – di Lazzaro explains that by finding the correct parameters he has succeeded in demonstrating that “VUV radiation is truly capable of generating a Shroud-like colouration of linen cloths.” But he goes on to admit that in terms of a dead body emitting these VUV pulses, something beyond the realm of science is required.\n“How can one untie the knot of this impasse? As scientists, we are not entitled to argue about theological and philosophical implications of a flash of VUV radiation as a possible by-product of resurrection. We are only qualified to investigate the complex chain of chemical and physical processes triggered by VUV radiation on cellulose/hemicellulose, that produce conjugated carbonyl groups as the chromophore, or, in simpler words, a Shroud-like colouration of linen. We did this scientific work, and we have made our experimental results and related arguments public, that is, in our papers.” Now all he can do is wait.\nSo, go back to your gratuitous abuse: “How nice,coming as it is from the editor of the BSTS newsletter,” and see whether it is justified by what I actually said, rather than what you think I may have meant.\nJoe is completely correct in that a true assessment of the Shroud must not begin with an assumption that it is one thing or another. However, Science works by proposing an idea, and then attempting to justify or reject it. We may say: IF the cloth was made by an artist / by a corpse, then how might it have occurred? We may even say: perhaps it was by something outside the realm of science, but in that case it is pointless to try to investigate its cause further. Colin is exploring a painting hypothesis. To do that he must begin with an “IF the Shroud was made by an artist” assumption. di Lazzaro is exploring a radiation hypothesis. To do that he must begin with either an “IF a corpse can produce radiation” assumption or an “IF the Shroud was produced by a miracle” assumption, or there would be no point in pursuing his experiments.\nI believe David Mo was rather more dogmatic than I would be in declaring a 99% certainty that the Shroud is medieval, but that does not justify Antero’s “Once more skeptics show themselves ignorant about serious scientific studies on the Shroud and uncover their fanatic anti-authenticity agenda-driven comments.” As I have pointed out many times recently, non-authenticist views are almost invariably based on detailed study of the “serious scientific studies” while authenticists frequently appear not to have read it at all.\n\n","date":"April 1, 2015 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/31/whats-to-like-over-on-colins-blog-right-now/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-195078","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What’s to like over on Colin’s blog right now?","post":"Hugh,I am not confused.

A cotton sample similarly treated retained its colour and mechanical strength. The difference may be due to the presence in the central  cores of linen fibres (secondary cell wall) of appreciable amounts of hemicelluloses that are more chemically reactive than cellulose and essentially absent from cotton.\nThese results raise the possibility that the difference between the Turin Shroud’s coloured image v non-image fibres are NOT confined to the highly superficial primary cell wall (estimated 200-600nm thickness) and may extend to the central core of the fibres too, resulting in loss of physical and chemical integrity, explaining perhaps the relative mechanical weakness of image fibres reported by STURP’s Raymond N.Rogers in his sticky tape sampling. If so, the process that gave rise to image imprinting on the TS may not have been as subtle as previously claimed, making it possible perhaps to model using technology that was available in the 14th century, corresponding to the radiocarbon dating.”\n http://colinb-sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/what-happens-if-you-spill-battery-acid.html\nUnfortunately I hit the Post button prematurely, so the posting’s URL (above) carries the provisional title, not the final one.

It was interesting that the linen fibres were weakened with scarcely any colour change – a warning against supposing that superficial yellowing equates with superficial chemical change – Paolo Di Lazzaro and ENEA please note – but the minimal coloration makes H2SO4 unpromising as a model for the TS image per se.\nThe next acid to be studied is nitric, HNO3. The more I read (history, primary and secondary cell wall structure and carbohydrate and protein composition) the more promising it looks. The working hypothesis is that the yellow TS image is formed by a xanthoproteic reaction between HNO3, nascent or preformed, and trace protein (defunct enzymes) in the primary flax cell wall. Quite a number of things can be accounted for – diimide bleaching (reduction of nitro to amine groups) and even the “apparent” blood first/image second ‘mantra’.  Adler and Heller’s enzyme not only digested blood, but a yellow  underlying nitrated protein, i.e. body image too!

However, having spent 3 years in attempting to suss out the peculiar TS image, and been told by fellow scientists (well, some at any rate) that it has to be “supernatural” I can scarcely contain my growing conviction that a solution is finally within reach. A hint was provided in the previous comment or two. The question is: how to communicate the new idea?  A fait accompli set out point by point? Sorry, not my style. I don’t do fait accompli  Science works by hypothesis, experiment, interpretation, modification of hypothesis etc etc. There’s no room there for springing a fait accompli on folk. Better to build the story in easy instalments, ones that address the many disparate peculiarities of the TS image that have to be accounted for. (The new “hunch”  could of course be wrong, and quickly demonstrated to be so, given it is capable of immediate testing by existing means were there free access to the Shroud. But there’s not, and indeed this blogger/retired biomedical scientist is not even able to wander into that Turin Cathedral simply to see the TS with his own eyes, so feels it’s not a huge and shameless imposition on folk, certainly on this ‘cutting edge’ site to say what’s in his mind, and to do so sooner rather than later.\nThere are two ways I can lift the lid on the new thinking. One is to post on my own site, and (no disrespect to Dan) hope it gets reported here with no details neglected or glossed over – detail being crucial in scientific research.  The alternative is to drip-feed the new model here as a series of comments, as a continuation of this particular thread (why not, since Dan’s posting links to my site?) and not bother composing a posting to my own site until the feedback here has appeared. Might that not be a more internet-friendly and democratic way of doing things, while admittedly a far cry from the traditional route via peer-reviewed publication in journal articles (abstract only, cough up $$$ to get behind the paywall). What do folk think? Fait accompli on my site, or drip feed to this one?\nTitle for the new idea?  How about: “A novel NOx/protein fumigation model for the Turin Shroud.”  NOx represents the binary mix of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) that react together with water  and oxygen to form nitrous and nitric acids (HNO2 and HNO3 respectively), or alternatively are generated  in a reverse reaction when preformed HNO3 from a reaction mixture in a distillation flask dissociates at high temperature. Nitric acid reacts quickly with proteins that contain aromatic side chains (tyrosine, tryptophan etc)  to form yellow ‘xanthoproteic’ reaction products. Both light sepia TS non-image background or darker, more intense TS image could be xanthoproteic reaction products formed by NOx fumigation of intrinsic linen OR extrinsic non-linen protein, or both. Several boxes can be ticked (e.g. lack of image fluorescence, even the Shroud’s mysterious side strip). \nComments invited re the best strategy for reporting a distinctly new angle on the TS body image – blood will have to wait until later.  Happy Easter.\n\n","date":"April 5, 2015 at 8:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/31/whats-to-like-over-on-colins-blog-right-now/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-195422","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What’s to like over on Colin’s blog right now?","post":"I don’t believe the Father would give later Christians the edge over the first 1400 years with something like this.
