[{"title":"Image on the Outside of the Shroud?","post":"Would you expect de Wesellow to accept the Scriptures as a Christian would?  I don’t find this unbelievable.  I believe de Wesellow’s case would be more believable if he would not discard information that contradicts his theories.  That’s difficult to do because then one has to change the theory in light on reality.  The Scriptures are proven reliable, first-hand  accounts so to discard it to put forth a theory is quite dishonest.  No offense to de Wesellow or anyone else is intended.\n\n","date":"April 5, 2014 at 6:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/05/image-on-the-outside-of-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-96893","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Image on the Outside of the Shroud?","post":"Like the blood, the Shroud came first before the Story (Stories) of the Man whose Image shocked and rocked that world into a world beyond the senses.  So whatever was written about the linen shroud in the tomb was not documented history and not “gospel” as we think of the word today  but “Story” and an announcement of the victory over death of a new conquering Lord.\n\n","date":"April 5, 2014 at 9:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/05/image-on-the-outside-of-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-96942","author":"clublu22014","site":"shroudstory"}]
