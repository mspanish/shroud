[{"title":"Value of Putting HAL 9000 Shroud of Turin Images Online","post":"Personally, sorry but I don’t agree with what you say Dan.  If an analysis of those images (no matter how good the resolution is) is not backed up by microscopic and chemical analysis, we walk in a VERY dangerous territory…  Flower, coins, writings, etc., etc.  The recent Shroud history is full of “I think I see” conclusions that are not backed-up by microscopic and, most importantly, chemical analysis !!!  I have great fear that it would also be the case if those high definition images would be released freely to anyone interested.  I think they should be kept aside UNTIL the Vatican permit a new series of direct tests on the relic (a kind of STURP 2 if you will).  It’s so easy to see things on an image (especially on an image like the Shroud) but that doesn’t prove no way that it is real.  That’s what I think…\n\n","date":"October 3, 2011 at 10:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/03/value-of-putting-hal-9000-shroud-of-turin-images-online/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4106","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
