As noted by this reader, the human eye perceives contrast by a complex mechanism that not only is not linear (relative to brightness) but depends on the color spectrum. The only objective way to analyze details (e.g., contrast) in an image, as complex as the one on the Shroud, is to use a computer and obviously a digital image. And by the way, I keep being surprised by researchers referring to the VP8 (to analyze the 3D data of the Shroud) because it is an old technology made obsolete by today’s computer and software.\n\n","date":"August 27, 2013 at 2:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/27/nicely-done-continued/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42145","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"}]
