[{"title":"Rogers changing his mind in a big way","post":"It’s interesting to note, as Dan told me by email, that Joe Nickell have used this particular quote from Rogers to back-up his anti-Shroud agenda!  That means one thing: There are always many ways to understand one quote from someone!  I wonder if bloggers agree with my interpretation of Rogers quote or if they see things more like Nickell…\n\n","date":"December 10, 2012 at 2:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/10/rogers-changing-his-mind-in-a-big-way/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-20152","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rogers changing his mind in a big way","post":"This is not at all clear.

It’s important because it shows that along the way, he completely change is opinion when he learned new facts and observations, especially the ghosts of coloration found by Adler.  This and many other facts and observation leaded him to conclude that the body image on the Shroud must have been formed by a natural formation process that acted at normal temperature.  For me, this quote clearly shows the honesty and professionalism of Ray Rogers.\n\n","date":"December 11, 2012 at 9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/10/rogers-changing-his-mind-in-a-big-way/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-20206","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rogers changing his mind in a big way","post":"Thanks, it is clear now.\n\n","date":"December 11, 2012 at 3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/10/rogers-changing-his-mind-in-a-big-way/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-20236","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rogers changing his mind in a big way","post":"Yes indeed.
