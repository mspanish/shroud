Because (1)  it will be a series of sentences preceded by “UP” or “DOWN” (with far fewer ups than downs – that being the nature of the scientific method) and (2) because I shall take a leaf from James Watson’s “Double Helix” and be, er, refreshingly candid about the reception – good or bad – given to my numerous  postings, some 300+,  deserved or undeserved. I shall name names, or in most instances anonymous internet pseudonyms, and divulge previously private thoughts, not all of them charitable…\nAs I say, it should  be FUN TO WRITE, the colloquial expression being “demob happy”.    😉 One has to hope, needless to say, that Dan Porter will stick by his assurance that the lapsed ‘shroudstory’ site he hosted remains available as an archive, since that was the effective portal  and discussion forum for most of my findings (appearing within hours, sometimes minutes even, of posting here or on sciencebuzz).\nAfterthought: each annual summary will be constructed in a series of small ongoing instalments, with the most recent entry being added at the top, i.e. reverse chronological order, true to the original blog (“webLOG”) concept. That allows me to do a little now and again, as and when there’s time available (Stonehenge is presently on the back burner while I remonstrate with Google for leaving my postings off simple searches under “stonehenge” which as the wag once said: “If you’re not on Google you might as well not exist”.

So when I open the book, a present from a close family member rather better acquainted with Ben, it’s to find inscribed, on the title page: “To Colin. June 2016. Happy reading! With very best wishes. Ben Wilson”.\nI shall now re-read it, and probably re-re-read it, such is its vast  sweep and global perspective on an amazing decade in British and world history (approx 1850-1860).

First, this was no 8000 word splurge, submitted to a single issue of a magazine available at one’s newsagent, guaranteeing lots of Google hits but not much else.\nThis began as a project at the tail end of 2011 with a clear objective – to reproduce the Shroud image in all its subtlety (negative character, superficiality,  bleachability etc etc) making due allowance for what probably were minor ageing changes (but not, repeat NOT the major deterioration proposed in that aforementioned magazine article that is frankly a copout, to say nothing of an insult to the intelligence).\nThat was an ambitious objective, and at the outset meant ruling out any prospect of pulling a white rabbit quickly from the hat. It was for that reason that a second objective was chosen: to report the progress (or otherwise) week by week in real time until such a time that one could say – “Well. that’s as far as I intend to go. Judge for yourselves dear reader whether the goal has been achieved.” If I’m not mistaken that second aspect made the project a one-off: I’m not aware of any other attempt to use the internet to report a research project informally in real time, warts ‘n’ all .But such is this blogger’s confidence in the scientific method – of setting up hypotheses and testing them to destruction if need be – that it seemed a realistic and worthwhile exercise.\nSelf-indulgent maybe, given all the twists and turns? Maybe, in which case the time has come to wind things up, but in a manner that is true to those twin objectives of reproducing an image, explaining how one got there, especially what had to be rejected as well as selected along the way.\nHere’s what I propose to do next. I shall write a  summary of each quarter’s research, starting with Jan/Feb//Mar of 2012, then April/May/June etc up to April/May/June this year (2016). That’s 18 quarters in all, 18 weekly reports, taking us through to autumn this year. Each of those quarterly reports will be a maximum of 1000 words. Anything else I want to say in excess of 1000 words will go into the Comments (where naturally feedback is welcome if judged reasonably civil AND constructive in keeping with the open-minded  modus operandi of this exercise – I am synthesising a view not proselytizing which means there’s no place for gratuitous insults or browbeating tirades).\nFinally when that backward look at 4 years of research has been summarized, I will write a grand (or maybe not so grand) summary, again keeping it short (probably 2500 words max), inviting more comments, and then  leave it at that. Title: possibly “Modelling the Shroud of Turin, 2016. Are we nearly there yet?”\n(Nope: change of mind. Too much hard work over too long a time, and who’s going to want to read twenty or so 1,000 words summaries?\nA single post summary of the 4 year project should suffice).\nWhy call a halt now? Because further progress is scarcely possible without new detailed chemical information on the TS image against which to compare the model systems.  I have previously suggested what could usefully be done, e.g. bleaching image v non-image areas with tritium-labelled diimide (NT=NT), i.e. diimide, NH=NH, after partial tritiation, recovering and concentrating radiolabelled material with suitable extraction procedures, identfying the products and/or molecular fragments on glc-mass spec and deducing the nature of the chromophore (dehydrated carbohydrate? modified lignin? Maillard reaction product? )\n No, I will not be making any proactive advances to mass media outlets, but they are welcome to approach me, on the understanding that they produce the write-up – given I confine myself to informal blogs, not articles or books –  and am allowed to see any copy before it appears in print, and given an opportunity to make suggestions or corrections).\n","date":"June 19, 2016 at 7:29 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-7376","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures.","post":"Where am I coming from?

This blogger contributed a number of comments to that thread, including some with original research (on the so-called ‘lateral distortion’ effect). Those comment earned this appreciative response from the site’s Acting Editor:\nlizleafloor wrote on 23 February, 2016 – 15:55\nWow! You really went above and beyond – nice work! It’s great to see results of experimentation. Thanks very much Colin. \n(later comment from Liz Leafloor)\n  The investment in time and effort you’ve made is appreciated.

Keep up the great work 🙂\nThe suggestion here that this blogger operates in a vacuum is  ill-informed and totally uncalled for.  The problem one has right now is (a) a poverty of research oriented sites (b) the blinkered refusal of wiki to recognize blog postings as valid sources of new data and insights (c) the bias that Google and other search engine show for articles that appear in mass media outlets, regardless of quality, and tending to self-perpetuate once initial  clicks have establish them high in a list of returns, then being the first to be seen and clicked long after their topicality and indeed value has passed.(d) the overwhelmingly ‘pro-authenticity’ nature of online sindonology that guarantees off-message sites such as this one will be totally and DELIBERATELY ignored.  Do not expect to find generosity of spirit in sindonology.\nAt some point I intend to do a summary of the major conclusions to emerge from my four years of image research, combined with the insights gained from Dorothy Crispino’s historical research and my own interpretations.  But there are more pressing matters to attend to right now, notably the Stonehenge/Silbury Hill project, and a 28 month old project that’s been lying dormant (the tragic death of young Zane Gbangbola in the Feb 2014 as a byproduct of the Chertsey floods – cyanide or carbon monoxide or maybe something else entering the home?).\nhttp://colinb-sciencebuzz.blogspot.it/search/label/Zane%20Gbangbola\nThis blogger has been assisting a Sunday Times reporter with the chemical and toxicological detail; the inquest, expected to last several weeks, finally got under way 3 days ago,  which I’m following closely, updating my sciencebuzz posting.

Nope, you would not have discovered it by entering (shroud of turin) into Google (google.com that is, i.e. the one you get when googling Stateside). Why not? Because according to google.com, this site does not exist, despite the hundreds of postings here and on my sciencebuzz site, despite any number of ‘curated’ versions of the postings having appeared on  Dan Porter’s shroudstory.com, prior to its being wound up December last year. So have I been doing something wrong at a technical level, perhaps, that has kept me off google.com’s radar screen? That was the persistent message from Dan Porter, suggesting ever so helpfully I was maybe not doing this or that right (like failing to make proper links to social media sites etc). Well, I’m doing something right here in my own country, inasmuch as entering (shroud of turin) into google (which is automatically google.uk by default, NOT google.com) shows me on page 4, with which I’m entirely content. So how do I know I’m not listed (or more probably have been DE-LISTED) on google.com? Answer? By typing google.com/ncr into the address bar. Ncr is short for ‘no country redirect’, which takes me to the US-version, not the default UK one.\nSo, I post new and original onto my blog sites in the UK,  most of it anti-authenticity needless to say. It gets instantly hoovered up and ‘curated’ by a US-based site (up till December). My claims and sometimes even full name frequently appear in those titles. Result: a US-based site uses my content to preserve or even enhance its position on Page 1 of google.com returns.  Oh, and let’s not forget the 2000 and more comments I’m said by the site owner to have placed on that site. And what do I get? At best a small lift in google.uk, while CONTINUING TO REMAIN INVISIBLE  to any Stateside searcher who simply googles (shroud of turin) without the kind of qualifiers (white flour etc) that presuppose a subject ‘insider’ with prior knowledge.\nSo why is this happening – something that is censorship by any other name?\nIt’s not only shroudstory that is or was into the business of content curation. Google almost certainly does it as well, as I’ve discovered from closely following the fate of what I currently post on entirely different topics (Stonehenge etc). Google’s curation of its algorithm-generated raw returns can happen within hours, sometimes minutes: one wonders whether the regulatory authorities in Europe are aware of this (possibly not,   judging by its half-hearted threats to make Google reveal its algorithm, assuming that it’s robotic, pre-programmed IT technology alone  that is promoting Google’s own sites and businesses at competitors’ expense).  When curation becomes effective censorship, the problem with Google becomes far, far more serious than one of anti-competitive abuse of market-leader near- monopoly’. Google Curate as I now call it (or, on bad days. Google the Hutt) might, just (might just) be sufficient to explain why I’m invisible to stateside searchers. But I doubt that is the entire issue. There’s another even more disturbing possibility that needs to be addressed, namely that third party interests in the States, with or without the passive cooperation or even active connivance of Google, are preventing the general searcher from seeing new ideas that conflict with someone’s all-consuming, single-minded agenda. Quite how that could work in practice, e.g. whether it works via paying extra to eliminate off-message content, or indirectly by failing to place ads on Google, or serially placing/withdrawing as reward/punishment, is anyone’s guess. The mere fact that these possibilities exist in theory should be sufficient to make the leaders of the so-called Free World take preemptive action against Google (not forgetting less popular search engines) e.g. by making them sign up to a code of practice, maybe voluntary to start with. Failing that, they could be required to give prominent “health warnings” on their home page to those naive or foolish enough to assume that the returns they see, unless flagged otherwise, are free of covert commercial – or worse still-  ideological taint.\nWe always used to think the danger came from a Big Brother “watching you” probably from the ‘closed society’ side of the old Iron Curtain. Instead it’s coming from a supposedly open-society Big Brother ensconced in Silicon Valley USA, or rather one of his army of 53,000 employees (!). He’s  not just watching you, but zapping you on screen as if a hostile alien in a video game at the first sign of one being deemed off-message (specifically Google’s carefully-filtered click-baiting e-commerce messages, but maybe other  more covert “messages” of a mind-control nature).\nIs there anything this blogger could or should be doing in the short term that could place his Shroud research, final white flour/wet linen model especially, on Stateside Google, i.e. google.com.? All suggestions, whether by comment or email (sciencebod (at) aol (dot)com will be gratefully received and acknowledged (with privacy to those that request it).

I’ve been busy elsewhere – like my sciencebuzz site – but also picking up the threads of an investigation into some other enigmas that were temporarily shelved some 4 years ago.\nHere’s a summary posted just a few minutes ago on that other multi-enigma system – Neolithic Britain’s Wiltshire’s monuments (Stonehenge, Avebury stone circle, Silbury Hill etc):\nhttps://sussingstonehenge.wordpress.com/\n1.Stonehenge, Avebury and other standing stones served as bird perches, the latter being encouraged to ‘adopt’ the site for the purpose of excarnation of the recently deceased. The primary purpose of excarnation was to (a) release the soul and (b) to isolate the skeleton that was then further cleansed by cremation. The cremated bones were then either buried in situ, OR interred in a nearby round or long burial barrow OR taken back by relatives to the deceased’s home.\n2.Silbury Hill was a repository for soft organs, probably harvested prior to avian or other excarnation, possibly the heart only. Silbury was what might be called a local speciality provided at the Avebury site/complex, some distance from the Stonehenge/Durrington Walls/Woodhenge/barrow complex i.e. 25 miles away. The soft organs were probably interred with a handful of the deceased’s local turf and soil, probably with a deliberate inclusion of earthworms to ensure complete integration between old and new soil.\n3.The carpentry aka woodworking joints at Stonehenge were an aid to construction, rather then necessary for final stability (see schematic accompanying  this post). They served to fix and partly stabilise the intermediary arch-like geometry before removal of the earthern “formwork” i.e. the ramp followed by placement of rammed rubble around the base of each pillar for final anchoring of the structure.\n4.The bluestones were chosen for the Mark 1 Stonehenge because – being smaller than the Mark 2 sarsens, the working surfaces  i.e. tops were at eye level and thus visible.  They would have quickly become unsightly with uneaten flesh, bird droppings etc.  Thus the desirability of importing igneous bluestone in place of local sarsen sandstone. That’s because rocks of igneous origin, i.e. soldified magma and/or lava,  (e.g. the predominant dolerites and rhyolites of Preseli and other Welsh ‘bluestones’)  are non-porous and liquid -repellent, and thus easier to keep clean and presentable.  It may be the lack of local bluestone that prompted the construction of the sarsen megaliths at Stonehenge. Being so much higher, the tops were largely out of human sight, and thus seen as safer more attractive places for scavenger birds (crows, ravens, rooks, seagulls etc).to perch, feed, roost and maybe even nest.\n","date":"April 22, 2016 at 10:09 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-7099","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures.","post":"Have just placed a “late” comment on the Nature paper from October of last year, with the title “Uncovering the sources of DNA on the Turin Shroud” by G.Barcaccia et al\nHere’s a link.

I have been monitoring the returns on google,com for (shroud of turin) very carefully, and I have to say am not liking what I am seeing.  One particular gripe is the way that a particular story, in this instance the Nature DNA report, appears 17 times no less in the first 10 pages of returns (that’s 17% approx of the total, blocking out others – like ME!!) merely because it’s been reported upon by 17 different news outlets.\nThat is frankly ridiculous, given that all but one are secondary reports that add virtually nothing to the original except instant opinion from a journalist  or agency-reporter who in most cases is ill-equipped to judge the quality or significance of the data (indeed, the readers’ comments, if invited, can often be a lot more cogent and well-informed ).\nFortunately then, Nature journal itself has a comments facility hosted by Disqus, of which  this blogger availed himself, using his ColinB login.

It’s the problem faced by anyone attempting to imprint off a 3D subject – living, dead or statue – onto linen. It’s variously known as “lateral distortion” arising from the so-called “wrap-around effect”.  Sure, it’s easy to demonstrate for oneself at home, say by smearing one’s face with chocolate spread or similar, then lying down and getting someone to press linen onto and around the sides of one’s face. Sure, the result could be the so-called Agamemnon mask-effect, one where the face looks far too wide, showing that “lateral distortion”.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon\nBut what’s this got to do with the Shroud of Turin one might ask? My answer:  precious little, if anything, provided one starts by making some reasonable assumptions, like: \n1. The Shroud is of medieval origin, if one accepts the radiocarbon dating, warts an’ all.\n2. Someone – a medieval artist or mere artisan – set out to model what a double-body IMPRINT onto linen might look, first when fresh, and then aged for many centuries.\n 3. That same individual then did some trial experiments, so became quickly aware of the image distortion that can result from using a 3D subject to produce a 2D imprint.\n4. That individual did not abandon the project. Instead he persevered to produce the image that today we call the Turin Shroud.\nSo how did he get a realistic-looking body image? Answer: he didn’t. That was not his goal. His goal was to produce what would be immediately perceived as a CONTACT IMPRINT. It did not need to look too realistic, like a well-executed painting. Had he done so, folk would have scarcely given it a second glance (“Oh look, another devotional work of art”). No, he wanted an image that was strangely unrealistic, and in that respect could be said to have been successful beyond his wildest dreams. So what did he do “right” in terms of producing a highly credible artefact, suggestive of a real body imprint onto a sheet of linen?\nAnswer: he wanted an image that was what today we call a “negative”. Parts of the anatomy that an artist might show in lighter tones, notably the light-reflecting prominences such as nose forehead, chin etc, would be shown dark, and parts that an artist might show as dark, due either to being in hollows, like eye sockets, or in the shadows cast by prominences, would be shown as light. Why the need to reverse the tones? Because that’s what happens when one imprints off a 3D template, instead of placing it in the light and painting it, or taking a modern photograph. Our medieval ‘modeller’ would have been fully aware of the tone-reversal that occurs with contact imprinting, from artefacts like brass rubbings, heat scorches from hot irons etc.\nAll that remained was to obtain that negative imprint in a manner that made it IMMEDIATELY obvious to a first-time viewer that it was an imprint, not a painting. That required imprinting off the highest relief only, studiously avoiding the slightest hint of wrap -around effect. The end result was to produce an imprint akin to that of a footprint in wet sand – negative with “bits missing”. How might that have been best achieved? It was a question of ensuring the technology was fit-for-purpose, as indeed it was. How was, or might that, have been achieved?\nEnd of Part 1.  Part 2 is in preparation and will follow in due course.\nI have placed a copy of this comment onto my own site:\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/\n","date":"February 20, 2016 at 7:33 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-6996","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures.","post":"Have just submitted this comment to an interesting site called “Ancient Origins” that featured an article on the Shroud back in October of last year. (Better late than never):\nhttp://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/shroud-turin-controversial-cloth-defies-explanation-study-shows-it-has-dna-020577\nThis article, like so many others regarding the Shroud, makes frequent mention of there being “wounds” visible in the body image, mixed in with references to associated bloodstains\nWere that true, then the case for authenticity is strengthened, given that the nature of the body image is still a matter for speculation (though this investigator considers he has provided a feasible model with his flour-imprinting/oven-baking model).\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/\nHowever, it’s simply not true that the body image shows injury or damage to flesh and skin. The evidence for scalp wounds from an otherwise invisible crown of thorns rests on bloodstains on the head and hair. Evidence for a nail wound in a hand or wrist rests on bloodstains alone, and likewise for a lance wound in the side. The scourge marks, supposedly from a Roman flagrum, some 372 of them in all we’re told, are entirely due to imprinted blood, there being no evidence in the body image.\nOne does not wish to make light of the task of the medieval artisan, intent on simulating/modelling what the double body imprint in sweat and blood of the crucified Jesus might look like some 1300 years later, as per radiocarbon dating (1260-1390). But let’s not overstate it either. The task is greatly simplified if there’s no need to simulate wounds (punctures, gashes etc) in the basal body image, if all that needs to be done is to paint blood onto the Shroud linen at all the ‘biblically-correct” locations so as merely to SUGGEST the presence of underlying wounds. That’s as far as it goes – suggested, not actual images of wounds,. Why would wounds leave an imprint anyway if still seeping blood?\nIf attempting to apply the scientific method to the mysterious and ‘enigmatic’ Shroud, it’s absolutely imperative that facts be ruthlessly separated from fancy. Were that done more often, the Shroud might seem marginally less mysterious and enigmatic, while still undoubtedly a work of human ingenuity.\nRead more: http://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/shroud-turin-controversial-cloth-defies-explanation-study-shows-it-has-dna-020577#ixzz40dbrkehl\nFollow us: @ancientorigins on Twitter | ancientoriginsweb on Facebook\n","date":"February 19, 2016 at 6:02 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-6995","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures.","post":"I think Colin is correct, as the false-colour image on the cover of that edition of the JBP (not specific to the Miller/Pelicori paper within it), is reversed with respect both to the real Shroud and to the published UV images .

No, none of the  red is due to “blood fluorescence”, given that the non-bloodied nose, beard, chin crease  etc are red as well as bloodstains like the “3″ on forehead.

What I have to say now may look superficially like a conspiracy theory, and some may conclude it’s an anti-Catholic one. I don’t think you will, or rather hope you won’t, and I say that in the knowledge of your own religious persuasion (I’ve read your book!).  Nope, It’s not about Catholicism. It’s about the American (and dare I say Canadian) propensity to place political correctness (i.e  not offending perceived sensibilities) at the top of all considerations where expression of opinion is concerned. Individuals self-censor, and the MSM follows suit, blocking expression of robust opinions. I have long considered PC to be the scourge of the modern age.\nSo where is this going, and how does this relate to your suggestions?\nScarcely a month goes by, as Hugh Farey has observed in his latest News Letter, where we don’t see some hugely speculative idea re the the Turin Shroud and how it acquired its image, virtually all in a 1st century context, ignoring or rejecting the radiocarbon dating.\nWhat about the journalists who report these brainwaves, sprinkling their articles with terms like “mystery”, “enigma”, “defying scientific explanation” etc, keeping the show on the road one might say, regardless of their own thoughts that may be well concealed?\nDo they ever put “shroud of turin” into their search engine? Probably some do, and if based in North America they will get back returns that in my view have all been screened by human agency for that “political correctness”. That is why you will find my site absent if you search on google.com (USA), for which one needs to enter http://www.google.com/ncr (ncr = no country redirection). When I say absent I mean absent – it’s nowhere in any of the 28 pages of returns – extraordinary don’t you think given I’ve produced hundreds of postings on 2 or 3 different sites over 4 years? But if you go to google.uk (or your google.ca) then there’s a chance of picking me up about page 5 to 7 of returns, and in the earlier returns one would appear to have a greater proportion of distinctly sceptical opinions in the titles or brief resume that follows, i.e. less “PC”.\nSo the journos who bother to look, at least in the USA and probably most in the UK, Canada, Australia and rest of the English-speaking world will not, or rather are not allowed to, find my postings and opinions. It’s even worse with the non-Google sites like Bing, Yahoo, AOL etc etc. Why, why,why?????  What IS going on?\nI say there’s human intervention, that the returns are not those generated entirely by an algorithm that simply monitors hits, links etc etc. If  that were the case, I’d be prominent on google.com, given the number of times Dan Porter used to cover my postings, often putting my name in the title, and invariably inserting links to my sites.\nAs I say, it’s about political correctness, about protecting the sensibilities of Shroud-respecting Roman Catholics mainly, whether they want it or not. Robust opinion and free-thinking is being censored, and it’s happening in the so-called Free World.\nAll of a sudden the Shroud of Turin shrinks in importance. There is a far, far greater issue that needs addressing here, and for me to go cap-in-hand to a cub reporter would be to acquiesce to something that in my view is totally and utterly wrong. There should be no censorship of the World of Ideas.\nI understand why the internet may not have turned out to be the potent means I first imagined for reporting a research investigation in real time, given the preponderantly pro-authenticity nature of sindonological websites, and just if not more important, the huge popularity of social media, where much that is said goes unreported and/or overlooked by search engines. But I still believe that it should allow the common man a voice in the  world of ideas, which incidentally is my preferred description of Shroud research. No, it’s not really the world of science, not hard science, given there’s no means or prospect of testing one’s ideas by taking samples from the real thing for comparison.\nSo I intend now to draw a line under 4 years of internet-based research, and leave the MSM – with or without the aid of search engines (almost certainly without) – to find my stuff for themselves. What I may do in the next week or so is make a list of what I consider my 10 chief findings, and add links to the relevant postings. It’ll go up as one more comment, not a new posting. The present one is my last, unless or until there’s a major shift in search engine returns.\nThanks for the tips, David, and for taking the trouble to post them. but I prefer to keep my own counsel from now on, feeling as I say that search engines are not properly supportive of lone bloggers keen to get  their message across.

You’ve got a logical motivation for using the method, the resources needed would be easily accessible, and you’ve replicated the model and gotten characteristics close to the Shroud — as mentioned by another commenter above, you may be the closest yet of all the attempts made by a pro-medieval proponent.

Another appreciative comment. Thanks David.  I must be doing something right at last, or at any rate, marginally less wrong.\nYes, flour is not the most obvious imprinting medium, especially if one sets out to simulate sweat (blood imprints being a separate issue).But if you read your Heller, you will see that Sam Pellicori, pro-authenticty we are told, set out to model the body imprint using lemon juice and oil, but was immediately given the thumbs down by fellow STURP members, Heller anyway, on the grounds that anything that was soluble would migrate, read smudge,  and fail to match TS characteristics, the latter  with mainly (but not exclusively!) frontal side imprinting only. Joe Accetta tried to revive a similar idea, one you mention, namely of dye-imprinting off woodblocks, and tried to get around the migration issue by incorporating gum arabic, supposedly to increase viscosity and discourage migration. It was an attractive idea, but when I checked it out I found that gum arabic does not in fact appreciably increase  viscosity (different from merely adding “bulk”) and was not the answer. Thus the gradual drift to something that was particulate (flour) as distinct from a soluble agent like lemon juice or dye.\nAm finding when I “unspin” image threads from the flour imprints, the results are virtually the same as obtained with the Mark 1 “scorch model” using much-derided one-step image-making with a heated metal template.  I may post a picture here shortly.

Read on and you’ll see the train of thought that was thus engendered, leading to tests with white flour as a “sweat substitute” simply as a means of exploiting the Maillard reaction as a means of making an imprint turn brown in the oven!

On some specimens, there’s scarcely any reverse side image. On others the reverse side image is virtually indistinguishable from the contact side, and\n there are no immediate clues as yet to why one sees this variation.  It could be something as simple as batch-to-batch variation with the linen, linked to the thickness, the closeness of weave, my stretching it when wet to reduce creases,  prior laundring etc. Or it might be more complex, related maybe to the oven temperature, type or amount of vegetable oil.  I shall try to look out the specimens that have mainly TS-like frontal image only and photograph them, if only  to show there’s no barrier in principle to one-sided imprinting, even if I see it less often than I would like.\nMy immediate plans? To take a break in your delightful country, where I shall write my manifesto.\nFuture lines of research? Frankly, there’s not a lot more I can do without specialized  equipment. That would include a half decent microscope with improved depth of field, if only to escape the charge from a certain laser expert that I don’t know how to use my focus wheel …\nI’m especially interested to know the mechanism of coloration in the flour-imprinting model. Might it involve the release of a natural oil or other liquid at high temperature that then percolates a short distance between fibres via capillary action (half tone effect?). Or is a gas released that has a scorching action in the immediate vicinity, again accounting for half-tone effect.

They have already come from an oven in which the wet linen was heated from room temperature up to 200 degrees C approx in the space of 10 to 15 minutes. The linen is no longer white at the end, more an ivory colour (as per the TS!).

What concerns me now is the issue of science versus pseudoscience, and I have not taken kindly to previous commentator’s attempt to turn the tables on me, making out that it is I who is guilty of pseudoscience, given the lengthy experimental programme (4years)  the reporting of results in hundreds of postings and photographs, the constant urging of folk to try repeating my experiments in their own kitchens or laboratories.\nI hope to complete my “Manifesto” in a couple of weeks or so.

Sure, one can cite scripture and say that’s consistent with a pre-crucifixion beating, but that’s not proof. One is simply maintaining a narrative. but lacking an essential reference if one’s to be certain whose narrative – 1st or 14th century – is correct. The missing reference? The image of the Man on the TS as he looked in life, or how he would have looked without the facial injuries.\nSorry, but one cannot deploy the adjective “perfect” and in the same breath describe the features as having suffered injury. Who’s to say the image was not taken by imprinting from a 14th century man, and that the “injuries” are in fact due to deformation of the facial features by a contact-imaging process? One man’s perfection is another’s imperfection.\nSuperficiality? It was not superficiality at thread level that I had in mind. It’s easy to demonstrate that  kind of superficiality experimentally by visibly scorching one side of a single thread, as I have done, then ‘unspinning’ to find that most fibres are unscorched.\n No, it was superficiality at the fibre level I had in mind, notably the claim that the image resides on the top 200nm only (or in some versions 200-600nm). . Where’s the positive evidence for that, more specifically  precise numerical data, as distinct from Rogers’ ‘”guesstimate”?

Do you consider that constitutes hard data? I don’t. \nI consider the degree of superficiality of the visible TS image to be unknown, and even if we knew it, that would not preclude changes to the core of the fibres that might explain their reported mechanical weakness without change in colour.

The amount of flour that attaches initially to the skin\n2. The amount and/or, less importantly, the proportion,  that transfers to the linen (judged by how    much is still left on the skin)\n3. The general look of the imprint when removed from the oven (image density, homogeneity, resemblance to template etc).\n4. The general look of the final attenuated, arguably more TS-like imprint after washing with soap and water.\nScoring of results (somewhat subjective):\nCriterion 1: flour slurry>olive oil> control\nCriterion 2: olive oil>control>flour slurry\nCriterion 3: olive oil >flour slurry>control\nCriterion 4: flour slurry>control> olive oil (highly subjective, given they are all rather similar, though there is scarcely any fine detail of finger joints in olive oil than the other two).\nIf one scores placings as 1 (worst) and 3 (best) then flour slurry is (3 + 1 + 2 + 3) = 9; olive oil is (2 + 3 + 3 + 1) = 9; control is (1 + 2+ 1 + 2) = 6.\nSummary: flour slurry  and olive oil come out joint equal at 9, with control the runner up at 6.\nIf the fresh-from-oven appearance were the chief criterion, then the flour slurry would be penalized, having a thick and unattractive encrustation, relative to the more attractive even granular look of the olive oil. But there’s little to choose between the final attenuated imprints (where even the control looks quite acceptable).\n However, based on experimenter-friendliness, the flour slurry wins. Why? Because there’s the immediate favourable impression created by strong attachment of lots of flour to the skin (though substantial amounts of slurry/flour fail to transfer, which may or may not be a bad thing). Then there’s the undeniable fact that if one’s decided to use a binder, it’s marginally better to coat oneself with flour slurry than with olive oil, at least if one washes the slurry off before it has had time to set like a rock-hard pasta shell.\nSo flour slurry it is, at least for the remaining tests on whole-face imprinting (which will be limited, given the heavy inroads  it makes on limited supplies of hard or expensive to obtain 100% linen). The wider scientific pros and cons of introducing an external source of oil to supplement the natural oil of linen (reckoned to be about 1.5% by weight), given this investigator’s earlier admittedly speculative ideas about a possible role for oil in the half tone effect and other microscopic properties, can wait for another day. It’s the ability to imprint off full 3D relief, relative to, say, a bas relief, that is the prime concern of the present tests, not the microscopic characteristics of the final image.\n","date":"January 29, 2016 at 9:55 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","id":"comment-6882","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures.","post":"Is that the best you can do in response to a solid and substantial listing of points, piero – to suggest I still have some way to go in matching precise image characteristics (which indeed I do, if I were so inclined)?\nYou are doing what all the pro-authenticists do.

That’s because I’ve opted to do everything myself. That means having to open one’s eyes periodically while coating the face with flour, simply to check that flour has been applied evenly. One’s eyes also have to be open to record each stage with a camera. Result – eyes that itch for hours on end…\nSolution? Call in a helper? Not really – others have their lives to lead and don’t necessarily want to be hanging around while I check this or that detail.  Give up on the technology? Simply stick to the science? That’s a justifiable option, given I’ve said several times that reproducing the TS image was not my primary goal (it being to check the claim that its unusual characteristics – negative tone-reversed image, 3D properties, superficiality, half-tone and other microscopic properties  etc-  meant it could and never would be replicated). However, I would like to have one more fairly convincing image to add to the ‘King Neptune’ selfie obtained two days ago for inclusion in my forthcoming “Shroud Manifesto’ that was flagged up as being in an advanced state of preparation.\nA compromise solution has been reached. For the next few days I shall revert to using wet flour slurry as imprinting medium instead of dry flour/oil. It will allow me to quickly compare the different ways of making contact between face and linen so as to get maximum imaging/minimal distortion. Once a good ‘geometry’ and optimal presentation has been discovered, I can then revert to dry flour just once more, so as to get the right degree of image fuzziness that is the hallmark of the TS image (though how much of that is the result of ageing is anyone’s guess). Yes, I will post any good imprints I obtain with wet flour slurry, notwithstanding that it’s not optimized technology. As I say, this site is less to do with technology, more to do with the imaging science. Expect too some references in respect of the Thermal LUT mode of ImageJ for probing 3D properties, whether real or as I believe, entirely artefactual. In other words, the TS image response in ImageJ will be compared alongside the latest model images with that highly discriminating probe of apparent image elevation on the vertical z axis.
