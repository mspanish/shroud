[{"title":"Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick.","post":"Update: Sunday 9th March 2014\nI had reason recently to mention the reception this posting received on the Troll Central site some two years ago in what I now describe as an instance of  a hit-and-run attack by one “Leland of Boston. His emailed “comments”, read trolling, were elevated by the site’s host to guest slot. Since this post is now the topic of a new posting over there, I have put together this speedy response to a selection of the more critical comments that are appearing. Some of the latter carry a whiff of vindictive troll-like character to them, attempting to destroy the credibility of this retired scientist, or to suggest that he lacks a grasp of the literature, especially re Rogers’ largely speculative “impurity coating” hypothesis, seemingly ignorant of the primary cell wall and much else besides (reactive hemicelluloses etc).\nHere’s a cut-and-paste, with their comments in bold, my replies in italics,\nScorching Onion Skins\nMarch 9, 2014 Dan \nI want to call your attention to an interesting discussion going on over at Colin Berry’s site in his posting (link provided)\nFirst, Thibault wrote:\nColin,\n“Can you explain step by step your onion experiment ? I am not sure to understand well, but I see no connection with the scorch hypothesis on the Shroud.”\nColin Responded:\nI’m a little surprised I have to explain (all over again) what to me seems self-evident. Never mind. Let’s start again.\nAnd it goes from there. For more on the subject see, Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick, a posting on Colin’s blog from two years ago.\n•\nanoxie \nMarch 9, 2014 at 7:22 am | #1\nIf you consider oignon is mainly made of starch and sugars, it looks like the suggested hoax recipe based on a thin external layer :\nRogers :\n“Using a cloth washed in a low-surface-tension solution containing pentose sugars (e.g., a Saponaria solution) and dried in the sun, a non-metallic statue at a temperature above 100C might have worked.”\nA thin oignon layer doesn’t absord much heat, it protects only very slightly and briefly the linen. It is just more sensitive to lower temperature.\nSomeone whose default position is the Rogers’ starch/sugar impurity layer. Where’s the analytical evidence (authoritative, that is, not semi-anecdotal) for there being an even coating of those two substances on the Shroud, or of them being in  non-image layers etc etc?\nOh, and there’s no starch in an onion. Sugars – glucose, fructose, sucrose certainly- but not starch. How difficult is it to spend a few minutes on a search engine instead of cluttering up the internet with easily-spotted  falsehoods?\nAs regards the thermal protection, read what I wrote. The epidermis gives excellent protection from the hot metal, when the latter still contains demonstrably sufficient heat to scorch linen.  So the point about the epidermis being more sensitive to scorching, while true, is largely irrelevant. You may disagree with my interpretation, but please desist from misrepresenting the experimental observations, and/or omit to mention my crucial reference to the control experiment.\nMike M \nMarch 9, 2014 at 8:23 am | #2\nI don’t get it? We have linen, why experiment on onions. Or is it claimed that the whole shroud was covered in onion? This is what happens when you perform experiments in the kitchen.\nWell, if you think some more about imaging onto linen, with at least three annular zones (PCW, SCW and cell membrane/cytoplasm) then the term “linen” becomes problematical. Which layer or layers of linen are scorched in the present Shroud, and which others may have been present initially, but have since detached through being more extensively scorches and rendered brittle?\nYes, I like simple explanations too, but one has to distinguish between simple and simplistic.\nanoxie \nMarch 9, 2014 at 8:58 am | #3 \nI guess a 4.4×1.1m linen cloth can be produced today not manually woven but I don’t think the weaving whether manual or automatic makes a difference in the image. What’s your point?\nThe point is modern linen can’t be directly compared to the shroud.\nEven “manual” weaving is semi-automated, inasmuch as there will be heddles that have to be raised and lowered, so one has to be specific if one’s to make any useful comment. (What was your point btw?).\nThere is some, possibly quite a lot of comparison that can be made between modern and centuries opld linen, assuming they are both retted flax fibres. Technological aids to assist spinning and weaving will differ of course, but let’s not repeat Rogers  mistake of looking to Pliny for clues (saponins etc), thereby betraying a lack of scientific objectivity (his task being to prove/disprove authenticity, not to take a 1st century provenance as his working hypothesis).\nMike M \nMarch 9, 2014 at 9:34 am | #4 \nSorry Anoxie, I still can’t get it. what your saying would make sense if Colin is talking about scorching an impurity layer (like Rogers postulated) but he is talking about primary cell wall. What is the difference between primary cell wall of antient linen and modern linen?\nAt last. A valid point. Yes, my focus is very much on the primary cell wall (PCW) for which Rogers had a blind spot (or an inadequate grasp of botany).\nanoxie \nMarch 9, 2014 at 9:42 am | #5 \nI’ve just pointed the similarities, meaning he’s got a degraded idea of what Rogers suggested years ago.\n I have done very extensive and detailed critiques of Rogers “suggestions”, and that’s the trouble. Most of ideas re the impurity layer, and the Maillard hypothesis are little more than suggestions that have not been backed up by experimental evidence. His critique of scorching was not terribly impressive either.\nclublu22014 \nMarch 9, 2014 at 8:55 am | #6\nBut I don’t understand any heat hypothesis when Barrie Schwortz has stated over and over again that the Image doesn’t fluoresce that means it wasn’t heat induced.\nBarrie Schwortz is a photographer, not a chemist. Were he a chemist he would know that the presence or absence of fluorescence in model v ancient scorches  can tell you nothing for certain unless you know something about the physical and chemical  nature of the fluorescent species.  Are they really furfurals as some have suggested, which are (a) volatile and (b) prone to oxidation, with loss of fluorescence over time. I suspect the fluorescent species are many and probably more complex than relatively simple furfurals. (Am not even certain the latter are strongly fluorescent)\nMike M \nMarch 9, 2014 at 9:39 am | #7\nClublu22014; I totally agree, not only that but scorched linen show up in transmitted light photography while the shroud image doesn’t. And the lumen of the fibres are discoloured while the shroud image doesn’t show any lumen discolouration. This is a prime example of how the anti authenticity camp would go to any length (not supported by science) to discredit the shroud. With the hacking hypothesis we have been seeing both extremes of the spectrum.\nTransmitted light? How can one be certain that the original Shroud centuries ago had the same properties as the one we see now, after yellowing, ageing, oxidation  etc etc?\nLumen not discoloured? The lumen is a hole, so any discoloration is likely to be due to the remnants of the original living flax cell (membrane, cytoplasm etc). Who’s to say that some fibres did not originally have extensive scorching that penetrated to the lumen interface, but compromised the core of the fibre so much as to make them break off over the centuries, leaving less extensively scorched fibres –  thus creating the so-called “halftone effect” (an over-optimistic, dare one say hifalutin term if ever there was)?\n clublu22014 commented on Scorching Onion Skins.\nin response to Mike M:\n    Clublu22014; I totally agree, not only that but scorched linen show up in transmitted light photography while the shroud image doesn’t.

Thank You!\n(However I am having a bit of a quandary as to just exactly what the identification of the lumen is regarding the fibril of the linen… It seems obvious that it is the outside molecules of the fibril’s tubing not necessarily the inside. Perhaps you could clarify this for me?)\nCorrect, Club. See my last comment.\n","date":"March 9, 2014 at 3:22 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/modelling-the-image-of-the-turin-shroud-an-interrupted-experiment/","cat":"branding","id":"comment-3287","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick.","post":"From the other site (see sidebar):\n“LOL: Whoa! Why are we using onionskin? Its ranges from about 200 to 400 microns in thickness. That’s microns. That’s 200,000 to 400,000 nanometers. Onion skin is like about 1000 x thicker than the image on the shroud.”\nFirst, why the picture of an intact onion with some brown outer skin lying next to it – as if the latter were the onion epidermis used in my experiments. Onion epidermis is stripped off the inner white scale leafs as a thin membrane..\nYes, the onion epidermis is a fraction of a mm thick – say 1/5, so orders of magnitude greater than the primary cell wall. So what? Have I ever said different? There seems to me an attempt to conflate two entirely different issues. One is the thickness of the image layer on the Shroud, which we are told is 200nm, which is the approximate thickness of the primary cell wall (PCW) of the flax fibril, of which there may be up to 200 per thread. \nBut there is also the SEPARATE issue to do with scorching. Time and again I have been told that it would be impossible to scorch a superficial 200nm image on linen without producing a scorch that penetrates beneath  the PCW or into deeper fibres. Why?  All one has to assume is that the outermost cells of flax fibres accept the image onto their PCW, but the entire cell many times thicker, protects the underlying cells and fibres from scorching in the manner shown here for onion epidermis. \nThe PCW of flax cells has loosely packed hemicellulose and cellulose which other things being equal are more susceptible to pyrolysis through physical contact with hot metal.than the more densely packed arrays of cellulose and hemicellulose in the secondary cell wall that underlies the PCW.\n","date":"March 13, 2012 at 6:27 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/modelling-the-image-of-the-turin-shroud-an-interrupted-experiment/","cat":"branding","id":"comment-58","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick.","post":"Here is a comment I submitted to the other site (see sidebar) late last night, that immediately ran up against the threatened pre-moderation/editing of anything and everthing I now submit there. (The site manager says his regulars are distressed at the way I refer to some Shroud so-called experts, invariably self-appointed, and content to spout 10 a or 20 year old mantras based on cursory, impressionistic research, rarely if ever contributing any new facts or ideas.:\nYour comment is awaiting moderation.\n“Dr. Collins [Berry] has tried to prove superficiality possible by scorching an onion skin laid over linen. What folly. If you will but toss a bit of linen and an onion skin into a fry pan you can see why. The onion skin turns brown quickly. I suspect that it caramelizes at lower temperatures and much faster than linen scorches. You just don’t mess with different materials without testing or researching, not if you are a good scientist.”\nWell, there is a simple experiment I can do, or rather refine, to address that criticism. I shall simply press the hot template down with part in contact with onion epidermis, and part in contact with linen. When I have a faint or even strong imprint on the linen, i shall then peel back the onion epidermis to see if it has protected the underlying linen. I believe it should be possible to produce that result, based on some existing results of mine, unpublished, where there is very faint, incipient scorching of linen, but heavy scorching of epidermis. Yes, the epidermis does scorch more readily. I have already acknowledged that, and suggested that different chemistry operates – forming Maillard sugar-protein reaction products and pyrolysed hemicellulose/cellulose respectively.\nHowever, i shall add that experiment onto the end of the post describing the onion skin data. I shall not be discussing science here in future in view of the pre-moderation/editing policy now in force to say nothing of general unpleasant backbiting tone of many of the comments.\nI must also ask Dan to desist from pirating pictures and text off my site describing my original research, at least until a decent time period has elapsed, say 1 week. Would it not be courteous, to say the least, to write a brief summary and provide a link to my own site? \nColin Berry\nI shall have a go at doing that experiment this morning, hoping that I have enough onion epidermis to get a conclusive result (involving as it does some trial and error, since I cannot see under the contact area to judge when to remove the hot metal).\nUpdate: the comment above, the last I shall post to that site in a proactive sense\n(defensive responses are another matter in the event of seeing one’s ideas rubbished or misrepresented) has just this minute been approved, but I do not as a matter of principle allow blogsite hosts to select bits from my comments. This site operates under a WordPress default system that requires my approval of the first comment. Subsequent ones go through without requiring approval. If a commenter were to become defamatory and ignored warnings I would simply place a block on all their comments. Yup, it’s all or nothing where this site is concerned.\nThere is a lot of ignorance or misundersatnding on the other site regarding the  superficial and chemical nature of the scorching phenomenon, with the word “impossible” being tossed around with gay abandon. I shall be using this thread over the next few days to pinpoint some of the misunderstanding and, most importantly, misinformation.\nIt is my firm belief that a deliberate and systematic attempt is being made to expunge “scorching” from the Shroud literature. One can see this attempt going back years, if not decades, to suppress or deny what I would see as a self-evident explanation for the Shroud image. Now why would anyone want to dismiss scorching – by heat that is – as an explanation, while being eager to play around with high energy radiation (ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays etc)?  Why go to the trouble of producing tiny discoloured blemishes on linen that might also be described as (radiation) scorches while dogmatically excluding thermal scorches, especially those produced by physical contact/heat conduction? The expression “agenda-driven research” springs to mind.  And the Shroudie roadshows are clearly intended to keep alive the “mystery of the Shroud”,  the “haunting”  (and scarcely visible) image of which “defies modern understanding”.  Complete baloney… What a circus!\n","date":"March 13, 2012 at 8:45 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/modelling-the-image-of-the-turin-shroud-an-interrupted-experiment/","cat":"branding","id":"comment-55","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick.","post":"It is not terribly edifying to have to plough one’s way through a lengthy section on radiation physics (with its unnecessary digs about degree level courses) to find at the end one has been misquoted on a major issue: “… because Berry assumes a exothermic pyrolysis of cellulose, that is, by definition, a runaway process, extended in time.”\nNO. I said that it was the pyrolysis of hemicellulose that was exothermic, that it differed in that respect from cellulose (endothermic) which was why one could get selective scorching of the hemicellulosewithout the cellulose being in the least bit affected.  Maybe it was a typo on Dr.Lazzaro’s part, but looking at the references to cellulose medullas I doubt it. I think he has seriously misunderstood the essence of the hemicellulose model. Maybe it’s a language thing – his English is better than my virtually non-existent Italian, so I shall give him the benefit of the doubt, but I really see no useful purpose is served in prolonging this discussion any further. \nAs far as I am concerned, Dr.Lazzaro has said nothing to change my view that the Shroud image was formed by thermal imprinting by direct contact/conduction. Any role for radiation would have been a minor one, because there is no mechanism for radiation-induced scorching in the absence of an opaque absorbing pigment. (Though having said that It is possible that the initial scorch image OR  the sand bed in my model  could act as IR absorbers, producing secondary heating effects, as discussed previously elsewhere as a possible mechanism for formation, say, of that  fainter image of the face on the reverse side of the fabric).\n","date":"February 21, 2012 at 10:42 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/modelling-the-image-of-the-turin-shroud-an-interrupted-experiment/","cat":"branding","id":"comment-25","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick.","post":"“According with a paper quoted by Berry, the onset of pyrolysis in hemicelluloses is at about 220°C.  We have heated a 5-cents euro coin at about 230 °C in contact with a linen cloth. Just 5 seconds after the coin reached the max temperature the whole cross section of threads in contact with the coin was colored.”\nYes, but that was onset of pyrolysis as measured by weight loss. That is not the same as onset of pyrolysis as measured by change in light absorption (yellow coloration).  the latter involves more subtle chemical change that does not involve loss of volatiles.\nTry repeating your experiment at 220, then 210, then 200 etc  until you discover a cut-off point. That’s what experimentalists do – they make systematic changes in the continuous variable, exploring the entire range of interest – not plumping for one temperature just because someone said it’s the only one that matters on some entirely different yardstick.

Firstly the title: “heat cannot produce a superficial coloration”.\nI could have shot that notion down in flames, even if I had no scientific background. Temperature is a CONTINUOUS VARIABLE  (you can set it to any value you want). if heating to 100 degrees produces no coloration, but 300 degrees does,  then what do yuou do? You  try 250. If that produces coloration, then you keep reducing the temperature, first by, say, 10 degree steps, then 1 degree steps, until you get a barely perceptible coloration. Heat (more accurately temperature) has then produced a superficial coloration. Chances are that the chemical degradation  scorch mark is highly superficial, affecting only a very thin layer  (e.g. of cell wall dimensions, say 200nm).  Getting a faint scorch is simply a matter of applying the Goldilocks principle.\nThis would seem to me to be plain common sense. Light scorching is not the equivalent of lighting blue touch paper on a firework display (“all or nothing”). It is gradual, it is progressive, at least at the gross level. But having said that,an “all-or-nothing” effect would appear to operate at the level of individual fibres (of which there are some 200 per thread) in order to account for the half-tone effect, which I think is due to pyrolysis of hemicellulose being exothermic (in other words, once started, it tends to keep going until all the  available, accessible “incendiary” hemicellulose used up.\n","date":"February 21, 2012 at 8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/modelling-the-image-of-the-turin-shroud-an-interrupted-experiment/","cat":"branding","id":"comment-23","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
