I wish this had been available to me when I started experimenting with scorches and UV radiation. I just could not understand why Miller and Pellicori claimed that scorches fluoresced, when every experiment I carried out showed that they didn’t. It was only when Thibault Heimbuger sent me one of Mechtilde Flury-Lemburg’s photos that I realised that I had invariably (and unwittingly) made my scorches too dark, following the contrast in Mario Latendresse’s shroud scope picture, and others. At the level of discolouration shown in Flury-Lemburg’s photo (same as David’s), I found that scorches did indeed fluoresce, and thus confirmed Miller and Pellicori’s conclusion that since the image on the shroud does not fluoresce, it cannot be a scorch.\n\n","date":"August 26, 2013 at 7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42054","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicely Done: You must download this","post":"Could you not get any fluorescence from heavier scorches?

I’m not persuaded that selective degradation of the upper fibrils of a layer of cloth can be achieved by any liquid or gaseous contact. Nor am I persuaded that the image has formed on an ‘evaporation layer.’ It does appear that radiation of one kind or another can achieve the effect, but light, heat and lasers do not appeal to me at the moment. That leaves direct contact with something more or less solid, perhaps some sort of gel. If, just as an instance, a painting on cloth (even after drying) is laid on a backing cloth, there may a possibility that while the pigment remains stable, the medium might nevertheless interact with the backing, by a Maillard reaction or something else.\nAs you can see, this is not well thought out yet, and I haven’t come up with a satisfactory protocol for testing it; it’s just what’s mulling around in my mind at the moment!\n\n","date":"August 27, 2013 at 4:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42114","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicely Done: You must download this","post":"Hi Thibault, are you still working on “other heavy amines” ?\nThanks,\n\n","date":"August 30, 2013 at 5:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42389","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicely Done: You must download this","post":"This is for David Rolfe.\nThat’s quite amazing.

However, the reason is not, perhaps, what you might think. When we describe something as unexplainable, we can mean one of two things. One is inexplicability due to a simple lack of evidence. I hear a noise in the night; in the morning I can’t discover any reason for it. There is no evidence. It is inexplicable. Here is the Pray manuscript. It has a diagonal line of crosses in a pattern made mostly of rectilinear ones. It may never be possible to account for this. It may be inexplicable. This kind of inexplicability is a source of frustration but it stimulates exploration, investigation, further study and consideration. I like it.\nThe other kind is intrinsic inexplicability. This event is wholly beyond any human understanding, even if you had stood there with cameras, microscopes and the full panoply of forensic apparatus. Luckily, it is impossible to prove that any event is of this kind, but if it ever were, how dull! What would there be to do? Marvel? But for how long? I would get fed up with it very quickly and go and find something else to play with. That’s why no Scientist, whether convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud or not, can entertain the idea that it is truly unexplainable.\n\n","date":"August 28, 2013 at 11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42230","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicely Done: You must download this","post":"Thibault write: “The TS image can not be a scorch not only because of the faintness of the image or the lack of fluorescence but also because even a faint scorch does not match the color distribution at macro and microscopic level.”\nMy comment:  Even if I don’t disagree with this opinion, I think you just need to consider the reality of the bloodstains on the cloth to realize, once and for all, that the Shroud IS NOT an artistic forgery of any kind (whether it could be a scorch or a painting or whatever else).

Of course there might still be a valid scientific explanation! But I think the fact that there isn’t, despite all the analysis over the years, is suggestive of a reasonable likelihood of a miraculous creation.\nMy own view is that Christ’s body dematerialised, and the image is somehow a byproduct of that. He then rematerialised in a spiritual form that somehow had quasi physical characteristics eg. three dimensionality etc – that took his appearance beyond a “ghost” and that is the resurrection.\n\n","date":"August 28, 2013 at 8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42260","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicely Done: You must download this","post":"Well, for what it’s worth, I’m a Catholic-born, card-carrying, practising Roman Catholic and Head of Science at a Catholic school whose school badge is the triple tiara and crossed keys of the pontificate. I couldn’t be any more institutionally Christian without becoming a monk! (I could no doubt be a much nicer person, but that’s another facet altogether).\nHowever, one of the Catholic version of Christianity’s core beliefs in is the rationality of the Universe, and the conviction that Faith and Reason cannot conflict. This was first expressed explicitly by St Augustine of Hippo, reiterated by Thomas Aquinas confirmed most recently by John-Paul II and Benedict XV, and is the rationale behind the Pontifical Academy of Science. (Is there another religion in the world with a scientific institution so close to its heart?)\nThe nature of the resurrection may, perhaps, be inexplicable. To deny that anything happened at all, which is the usual atheist line, is absurd, but all attempts to pin down exactly what it was have proved fruitless, and theology has moved on. The science of the physical resurrection, in other words, has stopped. Inexplicable – leave it and move on.\nThat’s exactly why, as I explained above, I won’t be treating the shroud as inexplicable.\nSeveral of the commenters on this blog (including yourself, it seems) would like to have it both ways, and try to intertwine the rational and the irrational, the scientific and the mystic. They would like Jesus to have exploded in a burst of radiation, or dematerialised in an instant vacuum, or even simply ceased decomposing, woke up and yawned; and they would like this to have happened ‘miraculously,’ but without disturbing the laws of physics. This may be permissible within the bounds of individual conscience, but it is not Catholic orthodoxy or teaching.\nBy now, I can feel some of you stuttering with rage and thinking that I have demoted the shroud to the relevance of one of Napoleon’s handkerchiefs. Nothing could be further than the truth. Although St Augustine said that Faith and Reason could never conflict, he famously said that Faith ‘precedes’ Reason. He didn’t altogether mean that if there was uncertainty about a question then Faith should be given the benefit of the doubt, but more that unless you believe something is worth the bother, there would be no point in trying to find out more about it in the first place.\nThe shroud will continue to be important even if it is no more miraculous than any of the great masters’ paintings and sculptures of the life of Christ. It can be an object of personal contemplation, a means of education, a focus of unity among those drawn to its image. It inspires awe, immanence and compassion. Whether it is eventually completely explained rationally, or abandoned as an object of scientific study altogether, it will continue to influence people in one way or another for as long as it lasts.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2013 at 4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42286","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicely Done: You must download this","post":"Well, I storngly disagree.

If I were to accept that there is an inexplicable explanation to the physics of resurrection, how would I begin to investigate it? You go for ‘dematerialisation.’ Shall we follow John Jackson’s idea, that the shroud collapsed “into and through the underlying body structure?” Or Isobel Piczek – that the shroud is a quantum hologram derived from an event horizon? Or di Lazzaro – that the resurrection involved UV laser radiation? The first two are incapable of exploration, as the vocabulary used is scientifically meaningless, and although UV laser radiation certainly does exist, if we accept that it occurred miraculously, then there’s nothing more to explore anyway. Remember that my point is not that the shroud cannot be inexplicable, but that if it is, there is nothing for a scientist to do about it.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2013 at 7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-42304","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nicely Done: You must download this","post":"some things in life are inexplicable, and always wil be in my view.\nI’m happy to leave some mystery in life.\nThere is a degree of human arrogance in our belief that we can explain everything ,predict everything etc.\nDespite the advances in science, we are still SO ignorant of so many things, and keep getting so many things wrong.\nLook, if a convincing comprehensive scientific explanation came out tomorrow for the image, I’d be happy to change my view.
