Over the ages it darkened and the fading of the “image” is in part at least to a lost of contrast as the linen darkened. Am I wrong that one thing that can darken linen is light, just ordinary see it every day sunlight.\nOnce as a child I toyed with developing photographs. They has to be “fixed” lest they faded. The impact of light on any object would depend on its chemical composition. Other times light might bleach a material.\nSometimes it would darken, sometimes it could bleach. When the drawing called “La Bella Principessa” was subjected to Multispectral Digital Imaging (MDI) they had to use special lighting designed to prevent damaging the drawing.\nSt. Paul’s claimed the appearance of Christ to him was in a bright blinding light.\nWhen it comes to the Shroud I am reminded of the Gospel of John:\n“And the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.”\n\n","date":"April 17, 2015 at 6:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/16/rogers-impurity-layer-and-di-lazzaros-experiments/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-196615","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rogers’ Impurity Layer and Di Lazzaro’s Experiments","post":"Visible light, which is presumably what St Paul and the witnesses to the transfiguration saw, is part of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum which includes heat (infra-red) and Paulo di Lazzaro’s UV laser. Depending on its wavelength, intensity and duration, deterioration of linen   is certainly possible, and in some circumstances, as di Lazzaro has shown, results very similar to the discolouration of the Shroud can be achieved.\nThe first question is then, where did the ‘light’ come from? The problem here is that except in very peculiar circumstances which I shall describe below, it could not have come from the object making the image (such as the body of Christ). If you expose a piece of photographic paper to a lamp in a dark room, you do not get a photo of the lamp, just a white blur, as rays from all over the lamp spread out and affect all over the paper. Even if you place a luminous mask on a piece of photographic paper in the dark, you do not get a photo of the mask, although a vague outline of its shape might be possible. This is because the light from all over the mask radiates in all directions. \nThe peculiar circumstances mentioned above would be that if the rays of light from every point on the object all emerged and travelled in exactly the same direction, and if the intensity of the ray from each point diminished according to its distance from the cloth, then indeed, you might get a photo of a lamp or a luminous mask just be exposing it to a photosensitive sheet. There is no known way to achieve this, although Giulio Fanti’s coronal discharge experiments have been exploring the idea.\nThe second question is, can a live, dead, supernatural or earthquake stimulated body produce  the appropriate radiation (such as heat, light or UV) with appropriate qualities.

The image which appears to have been created in a micro-second (Rogers) would be the last instant before that transformation or transportation was complete. A literal event horizon becasue we can not today view or even comprehend where the the body went or how it was transformed.\nThere are some who insist that science can never get to that point. I would suggest that the history of science particularly in the last two centuries has pushed the boundaries of science far beyond what was imagined previously.

Lineros\nApril 14, 2015\narxiv:1504.03261\nunder the address:\nhttps://www.dmhunters.org/?p=12252\n>Recently Blum, Katz and Waxman have claimed that the flux of high energy cosmic ray (CR) positrons near Earth that has been measured with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) aboard the International Space Station can be produced in the collisions of Galactic CR protons and nuclei with the ambient matter in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM).Their claim was based on an alleged “robust upper limit to the positron flux” which neglected the energy loss of e+’s in the ISM. Inclusion of this energy loss, however, yields a much smaller upper limit, which excludes secondary production in the ISM by the Galactic cosmic rays as the main origin of the CR e^+ flux above 10 GeV.\n— — —\nThe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a state-of-the-art particle physics detector designed to operate as an external module on the International Space Station. It will use the unique environment of space to study the universe and its origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter while performing precision measurements of cosmic rays composition and flux. The AMS-02 observations will help answer fundamental questions, such as “What makes up the universe’s invisible mass?” or “What happened to the primordial antimatter?”\n— —\nThen AMS and AFM are the two different ways to know this World…\nB.T.W., here what I have found in a new health field:\n>Nanodentistry is an emerging field with significant potential to yield new generation of technologically advanced clinical tools and devices for oral healthcare. Nanoscale topology and quantitative biomechanical or biophysical analysis of dental surfaces are of significant interest. In particular, using Atomic force microscopy techniques—diseases such as dental caries, tooth hypersensitivity, and oral cancer can be quantified based on morphological, biophysical and biochemical nanoscale properties of tooth surface itself and dental materials or oral fluids such as saliva. An outlook on future “nanodentistry” developments such as saliva exosomes based diagnostics, designing biocompatible, antimicrobial dental implants and personalized dental healthcare is presented…\nDon’t you want to think to improve the health?\nSee also Dr. Childérick Severac of ITAV, Toulouse, with his AFM system…\nunder the address:\nhttp://newsletter.jpk.com/2015/6gd1/row/nw-toulouse.htm?redir=no\n>…In the collaborative research efforts, AFM is being used to probe the mechanical properties of various cells, e.g. cancer cells, to study their invasiveness. …\n— — —\nNow I want to leave alone for a moment the technique\nand then I jump on the question of studies on Early Christianity:\nIn my opinion there are many points of the events of 2000 years ago that are a little unclear.\nFor example: Our Lord Jesus Christ had a foster father: St. Joseph. However: where is the tomb of St. Joseph? Recently I read a short service on the ancient cult of St. Joseph in Palestine. Along with the article was a picture of the so-called Tomb of the Right or of St. Joseph (which exists at the convent of the Sisters of Nazareth), the text was also quoted an ancient document called Judeo-Christian “Historia Josepi”.\nAccording to this ancient report the death and glorification of St. Joseph took place right in the place where according to tradition Jesus revealed his “secret doctrine”, ie on Mount Olivet …\nThe Dominican Milan IsidoroIsolano inserted the History of St. Joseph in his “Summa de donis St. Joseph”, printed in Pavia, in 1522. And in that work the story of Joseph’s life is attributed to Jesus himself, who would confided to the disciples on the Mount of Olives.\nIsidoroIsolano, who wrote the Summa of the gifts of St. Joseph, said that there will come a time when you will discover riches enclosed in St. Joseph.\nThe Gospel of St. Matthew informs us that the death of Christ, “the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints who had died, resurrected. Coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many “… So: St. Joseph was among them?\nAnother question: the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother of Jesus, is seen by some as the dying and then resurrected and went to heaven. Others (here I refer to one of the many responses given by Our Lady in Medjugorje) seem to deny that Mary is dead!\nThen: the Blessed Virgin Mary was dead or simply “asleep”?\nSome theologians, although the precise address expressed years ago by Pope Wojtyla, seems still debating the issue …\n— — —\nAfter these notes, however, I would not be passed to a heretic …\nSt. Joseph by the unanimous opinion of the theologians and the teaching of Blessed Pius IX (Decree Quemadmodum Deus, December 8, 1870), Leo XIII (enciclicaQuamquam pluries, August 15, 1889) and Pius XI (speech of 21 April 1926) exceeds dignity in any other saint of the Old and New Testament Baptist (though John the Baptist died a martyr, shedding his blood, and therefore there is no comparison) and Apostles included. Make faith the true marriage of St. Joseph with the Blessed Virgin Mary, the high paternity exercised against Jesus Christ, the extraordinary mission leader and guardian of the Holy Family, unsurpassed participation and knowledge of the divine plan of salvation\nI don’t put myself against the Truth of the Faith, but I see that some mysteries still seem to remain unresolved. Should we add mystery to the Mysteries?
