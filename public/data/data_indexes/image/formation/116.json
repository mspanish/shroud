(beside cloth body distance)\nThe whole statement is imprecise. Every image is 3D, as it has 2 spatial coordinates + intensity (X,Y,I). The point is that the intensity I correlates with cloth body distance (which is also imprecisely defined Jackson, Jumper & Ercoline used simply vertical, or Z distance).\n\n","date":"June 5, 2014 at 7:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/everymans-vp8/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127010","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Everyman’s VP8","post":"We discussed this on November 3, Maybe the 3D data doesn’t mean what we think it does.  \nHere is another thought. The intensity at each x,y point is also a measure of distance from a hypothetical plane that intersects the body. The problem with that is imagining a process that could create an image. But do we have anything more than imagination so far when we think of body to cloth distance? Maybe the reader will write back. Like you I’d like to know what the many reasons are.\n\n","date":"June 5, 2014 at 8:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/everymans-vp8/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127016","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Everyman’s VP8","post":"Fantastic 3D rendering.

Generally, the better quality picture (that is usually bigger in size), the better 3D effect. \nAlways on the begining go Image>Adjust>Brightness contrast. Use moderate smoothing (a few pixels) -it reduces noises, but also dissipates smaller structures. Grid size -always the highest 512.Usually Min=0 %, Max=100 %. Perspective =0. Play with z-scale and/or smoothing. Other parameters are less important.\n\n","date":"June 5, 2014 at 3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/everymans-vp8/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127099","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Everyman’s VP8","post":"Thank u!\n\n","date":"June 5, 2014 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/everymans-vp8/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127120","author":"George7","site":"shroudstory"}]
