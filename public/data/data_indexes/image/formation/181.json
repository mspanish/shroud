[{"title":"Today’s How do we know? The image is not painted","post":"Oh dear. Shall I? Look at the line labelled “mean blood.” Note how the relative reflectance reaches a minimum at about 350nm, hovers around there through to about 520nm, and then climbs to a maximum off the graph beyond 750nm, with a very pronounced bump-and-dip at about 610nm. Although this line is an average, I have Gilbert’s original paper with his four individual samples, and they all show the same pattern.\nNow try “blood reflectance spectrum” on Google. Or go straight to http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037907381000383X, and the fascinating paper by Bremmer et al on the reflectance spectra of ageing blood.\nDraw your own conclusions.\n\n","date":"October 21, 2013 at 8:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/21/todays-how-do-we-know-the-image-is-not-painted/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-48224","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Today’s How do we know?
