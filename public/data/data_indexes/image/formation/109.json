[{"title":"Revisited:  Argumentum ad Ignorantiam, mea natibus?","post":"When it comes to  the Shroud, unlike Russell’s teapot we know it exists and the issue is: What kind of teapot.? \nThat’s where Science comes in, or at least should come in. And it has. We not only know that the teapot exists but by analyzing the Shroud accross multiple disciplines, Science can state with some assurety that it is the image of a crucified man with woulds consistent with the New Testament and that the images was most likely created within 48 hours of death. That’s a lot of teapot. This teapot even has actual bloodstains.\nIn all of human history, there is been reports of only one human being that matches those circumstnces. (Hint, his intials are JC). Some debate that he was not a human being; they are called Gnostics or Jansenists. It’s clear, that the man in the Shroud shed real blood.\nIs there doubt? Perhaps, but it is reasonable doubt? In a courtroom we would say the burden has shifted. The circumstances DEMONSTRATED BY SCIENCE allow a more than reasonable inference. All of the attempts to explain around the Shroud have failed. The skeptics have had more than a century now to produce their evidence and they have failed. \nSpare me the D’Arcis memorandum. That is hearsay on hearsay. In other words, not ebidence.\nCarbon dating? Let me quote Thomas de Wesellow:\n“The carbon dating of the Shroud will probably go down in history as one of the greatest fiascos in the history of science. It would make an excellent case study for any sociologist interested in exploring the ways in which science is affected by professional biases, prejudices and ambitions, not to mention religious (and irreligious) beliefs. ”\nWesellow clains to be an agnostic and. beacsue he is, he cameup with an imaginative explanation of the Resurrection. That’s a different debate. \nBut yes, Bertrand Russell there is  teapot and it is an ancient piece of linen in Turin, Italy. Sorry you never got to see it.\n\n","date":"May 17, 2013 at 7:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/17/revisited-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam-mea-natibus/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-33862","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
