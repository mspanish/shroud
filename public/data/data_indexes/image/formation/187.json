Early Christians themselves used to reccur to what is called intuitive archeaology. Many an archaeologist do recur to such a technique but there are very few of themt o admit it.

Intuition can be useful in science to bring us into new areas of research, to search where nobody have ever thought to search.  BUT… What do you do with logical thinking ???  It’s also important and, until science can prove or dismiss those images, I think the logical thinking should be preferred than some intuitive thinking.  It’s just my personal opinion.\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/27/two-archaeocryptologists-three-opinions/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4390","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Archaeocryptologists, Three Opinions?","post":"I am sorry Max. We should be talking about facts. This means a scientific approach not an intutive one. Are your results reproducible or not? Where are the photos you have used? Can other scientists repeat all the process following state-of-the-art methodologies or not? I am sorry, intuition is  not a valid methodology in this issue. We should not be wasting our time discussing obvious things. By the way, criptology is a science based on mathematics and linguistics, not on intuition. Once you have let us know your methodologies, I am afraid I cannot give any credit to your current and past claims any longer. \nPS: Is it here where the wise king (l’Shlomo) had his wineyard (Kerem)?\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 12:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/27/two-archaeocryptologists-three-opinions/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4396","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Archaeocryptologists, Three Opinions?","post":"Yes\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 6:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/27/two-archaeocryptologists-three-opinions/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4416","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Archaeocryptologists, Three Opinions?","post":"By the way, I do need a rest from this forum, dont’t you think?

Come on !  Be fair : It all started with some very logical argumentations that I wrote against all those ghostly images that some think are on the Shroud…  The fact that you enter the debate is your freedom.  Don’t blame me after that if I defend my point of view !  It’s not harrasement at all.  And, by the way, debating of ideas like that, when it is done with respect, is always a good thing because it forces everyone who read the posts to THINK and REFLECT on the subject.\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 10:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/27/two-archaeocryptologists-three-opinions/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4389","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Archaeocryptologists, Three Opinions?","post":"I do love, ftrom time to time  riding a horse accross the desert to leave the Bab al-Khali, dont you?

We get great examples of that in the last few days…  I think a good intuitive reasonning must be, at least, based on some logic and, sorry, but Roman coins over the eyes of the man some believed was the Jewish Messiah is not logical at all.  And I don’t even talk about THE FACT that the burial rite wasn’t completed on friday night when they left the tomb, knowing full well that they had to come back to finish the job on sunday…  Why do you think they came so early on sunday if it wasn’t because they had to open the tomb and enter in this place (where a body was lying dead for at least 36 hours) to finish the burial rite ?  Sure, they wouldn’t want to extend the delay more than that because they were fully aware that the body would start to rot in the next few hours (or maybe they even add some fear that the rotting process would be already in place)…  Not a joyful task as you can imagine !  That tells alot about the fact that those Jews were very pious and they really wanted to respect the prescriptions of the Law.  It’s not the kind of portrait that goes well with Hellenistic Jews, don’t you think ?  So, I think you can forget about the pagan rite of the coins over the eyes.  A clue like that tells you that the Jews who took part of the burial of Jesus were surely pious Jews who didn’t believed in things like paying something to be able to cross the Styx river !\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 3:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/27/two-archaeocryptologists-three-opinions/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4410","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Archaeocryptologists, Three Opinions?","post":"NO COMMENT!
