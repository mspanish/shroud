[{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"Hey, ho, fools rush in where angels fear to tread… \nI am not a computer graphics expert, but I disagree. I have a once trendy office toy, which consists of a horizontal mesh about 15cm square, pierced with thousands of vertical steel rods about 8cm long. At rest, the rods all hang at the same level, but when the grid is lowered over an object, the steel rods adjust to the height of the point they touch, and an exact representation of the object appears, modelled in steel, 8cm above the object. If I knew what it was called I’d reference a picture of it; they used to be very common. Anyway, I can’t believe there isn’t a digital computerised version of this, probably using a laser beam instead of steel rods. The height data thus aquired could be imaged as a 3-D representation, as on ImageJ, or the numbers could be converted into a grey-scale, and a “shroud-image” produced. I think you would get quite a good version, and not a “fuzzy, ghost-like representation.”\nNext, I also take issue with: “There is no correlation in a photograph between the density of the imprint and the distance to the object.” In theory, of course this is true, and there are a number of clever artistic installations that bear this out. A series of flat black curtains at different distances from a camera ought to, and often do, produce the illusion of a single plane, and great surprise in an audience when a man walking between them seems just to appear and dissapear in and out of nowhere. However, in practice there often is some correlation between intensity and distance, and faces, especially, bear this out. Consider a white sphere, lit from directly in front. Does it appear in a photo as a disc? No. As the surface of the sphere slopes away from the frontal plane, the angle it makes with that plane reflects less and less light back to the camera, and in the photo the sphere is darker at the edges than it is in the middle. Much the same happens with faces – essentially pale spheres lit from directly in front. However, in detail, it would be truer to think of four or five such spheres squashed together, a big one for the forehead, a small one between two slightly larger ones for the nose and cheeks, and another for the chin. Each sphere appears equally bright where its surface is tangential to the plane in front of the face, which is why in the shroud, and in many photographs, the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin all appear more or less equally bright, and more or less equally high on an ImageJ repesentation. The more angled the surface of the ‘sphere’, the sides of the nose say, or the slopes of the eye sockets, the more different they are in intensity from the ‘flat’ frontal surfaces, and the greater the appearance of distance.\nIn this way, by coincidence more than anything else, the distance/intensity colouration of the shroud image, which is probably real, resembles the distance/intensity colouration of a photograph.\nI’m not sure what the parameters of this observation are. Photos of people, as I have demonstrated on this blog, do show this correlation, while the full moon appears quite flat. Is this due to our inability to resolve contrast at such high illumination, given that the background is so dark? I don’t know.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2013 at 10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-53877","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"Here you go: http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v2/663163602_1/Pinart-3D-font-b-Pin-b-font-Sculpture-Frame-Artist-Fun-Toy-Home-font-b-Office.jpg\n\n","date":"November 29, 2013 at 11:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-53883","author":"Jeffrey Liss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"Hi Hugh, if I amy throw my two cents:\n“There is no correlation in a photograph between the density of the imprint and the distance to the object.” In theory, of course this is true\nIn theory it is both true, and false, dependent on conditions and purpose -remember VP-8 was designed to process photographies.\nHowever, in detail, it would be truer to think of four or five such spheres squashed together, a big one for the forehead, a small one between two slightly larger ones for the nose and cheeks, and another for the chin. Each sphere appears equally bright where its surface is tangential to the plane in front of the face, which is why in the shroud, and in many photographs, the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin all appear more or less equally bright, and more or less equally high on an ImageJ repesentation.

Photos of people, as I have demonstrated on this blog, do show this correlation, \nVery poor correlation, compared to the Shroud.\nwhile the full moon appears quite flat. Is this due to our inability to resolve contrast at such high illumination, given that the background is so dark? I don’t know.\nNo, it’s much complex matter. Generally we can adopt a simple model saying that reflected light splits into two components:\n* light reflected according to the law of reflection (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection) (specular reflection)\n* light scattered in all directions.(diffusion reflection)\nThe overwhelming majority is the second component. Thus the surface of them moon seen at any angle is similar, but not identical. In fact, the luminosty of the full moon is more than twice half moon. \nThe diffusion reflection mechanism is the way VP-8 works in case of the planets. But for our eyes, the relative differences in distance between each part (center or edges) of the moon are too small to see any effect. And the variations of albedo due to the moon’s topography (dark lunar maria, bright  uplands) are differences of much larger magnitude.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2013 at 4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-53945","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"It’s all a bit over my head here but is it possible to deduce from the Shroud image (using our modern understanding of light and image formation) if the “light’ is shining on the human form, versus from the human form itself, when it was made?\n\n","date":"November 29, 2013 at 2:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-53916","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"\ncomputer graphics expert :\nI suggest that the VP-8 Image Analyzer was not used correctly thus leading to a lot of misunderstanding.\n\nObviously, the shroud is not a simple heightmap with a direct, linear relationship between contrast and body-cloth clearance.\nIt would be pure fiction to think of such a claim.\n\n","date":"November 30, 2013 at 7:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-54120","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"“Has anyone ever attempted to create a graph of measured distance between points on a three-dimensional human form (or just a head) and an abstract surface or hypothetical plane using gray-scale tones or luma to represent the data? In other words has anyone produced a heightmap?”\nYes and no.\nThis has been done by Jackson and al. in ” Three dimensional characteristics of the Shroud Image” in Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society, October 1982″ (16 pages).\nThey first used the “Small Sample Correlation Technique”:\n” Our procedure for measuring the degree of correlation between image shading and cloth-body distance involved first measuring the transmittance of a black and white transparency of the face taken of the Shroud in 1978 by a microdensitometer. We chose to sample 13 image locations: tip of nose, edges of nose, cheek, eyes, eye sockets, bridge of nose, lips, mustache, and forehead (…)\nNext we measured cloth-body distance by draping a linen model of the Shroud, hand-woven as to correspond with the herringbone weave and thickness of the Shroud, over a bearded volunteer subject. Side photographs were made with the cloth in place and then after immediately being removed. By superimposing these photographs and using contours gadges (…)we determined cloth-body distances (…)\nWe then plotted these data of transmittance and cloth-body distance and determined a linear regression line (…)\nThe measured coefficient of determination, r2, was 0.60 for the 13 data points, at the 95% confidence level, which implies that the actual coefficient of determination, lies between 0.20 and 0.83. Through the range is quite large owing to the small number of data points available, some observations can nevertheless be made. First the null hypothesis [no correlation] is excluded, indicating that some image correlation with image shading and cloth-body distance is present (……..)\nThe reliability in the measurements of [the coefficient of determination] could be increased if more data points were sampled. We can estimate the numbers, n, of datapoints required (..).\nWe calculate the number of data points to be 1700. (..) This value of 1700 is prohibitive by the manual sampling technique discussed above, but may be possible via some automated sampling algorithms.”\n“Relief Image Technique\nAlthough we have not as yet developed an adequate large number sampling algorithm, we have studied the Shroud image with another technique that allows visual estimation of how well image shading correlates with distance.”: the VP8.\nThen, in this paper, the authors described in detail, step by step and with many experiments how and why the VP8 can be used to estimate the reliability of the “cloth-body distance hypothesis”.\nThey concluded:\n” These results demonstrate that image shading on the Shroud correlates with distance between 2 surfaces, one of which can be interpreted as a body shape and the other as a cloth draping over that body surface. Logically, this does not prove that a cloth was draped over a body shape when the Shroud image was formed because other hypotheses not involving a cloth covered body shape might conceivably account for such an effect. (..)\n“Thus we may refer to the Shroud image as having a “three dimensional characteristic” which means, simply, that image shading can be self-consistently interpreted as being correlated with the distance between a body an an enveloping cloth.”\nAnd finally they tested many image formation hypothesis using this “technique”:\n” (..) A correct hypothesis of image formation must be able to produce an image structure capable of a “three dimensional interpretation”, for in doing so the shading distribution of the shroud image would be duplicated”.\nThis paper is THE fundamental study of the “3-D interpretation” of the TS image.\nEverybody who wants to discuss seriously must read it carefully.\nI had to read it carefully at least 3 times to understand the logic of the reasoning.\nFor me, the reasoning seems to be irrefutable.\nIs it ?\nYou can ask me for this paper.\n\n","date":"November 30, 2013 at 5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-54214","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"Correlation is not high, meaning, correlation is not simple, direct, linear.

Although details of the technique are covered on\npages 30-40 in this report, the principle of the technique involved\nthe production of negative photographic prints from color and black and\nwhite positive transparencies. Originally designed as an expedient\nphoto printing process by this investigator in 1971, the negative print\ntechnique was applied to the ERTS imagery for image enhancement. With\nthe negative print technique applied to band 5, cultural landscapes in\nterms of urban and suburban areas, shopping centers, highway construction\nsites, strip mines, and agricultural areas were enhanced in dark tones\nagainst a light background. On band 7 negative prints, water and\ntopographic surfaces were enhanced in light tones and light shaded\nenhancements on dark surfaces displayed as tone reversals in the\nnegative prints (see Figure 4).\nThe mapping of photomorphic regions and examples of landscape change\noccupied the majority of the Phase III activities. \nCan we consider this as a possible working solution to landuse\nmapping? I believe so but with reserved optimism. First, consider the\nways in which we analyze imagery. The human interpreter basically looks\nat tonal variations in terms of light or dark signatures to interpret\nblack and white ERTS imagery. Tonal variations reflect densities which\ncan be measured, sorted, and displayed by the VP-8 system. Thus, the\nVP-8 distinguishes between light, gray, or dark toned areas and displays mappable areas to which we assign landuse interpretation. The VP-8 can only reconstitute and sort density levels for us. We must interpret those levels in terms of landuse categories. The interpretation can only be as good as the interpreter. His subjective and objective knowledge of the area enters a bias which the VP-8 cannot override. The interpreter or VP-8 machine operator selects the color assignments for different densities and also determines, in part, the spatial distribution of density levels. He can combine density levels into a common color unit and thus obliterate detailed information. Conversely, the interpreter can display up to 8 density color slices and combinations with highly detailed definition. It is this kind of subjectivity in the choice of density combinations which alarms some investigators. No single interpreter, interpretation system, or for that matter data gathering device, or sensor can possibly meet the needs of every\ninvestigation. The VP-8 must be used with caution with the understanding that it produces color coded densities which the interpreter must choose to display.\nGiorgio \nI like to add that the negative print Technique allows less deviation between operators because you’re basically producing a high contrast image with limited gray scales. Another limitation can be the aperture of the microdensitometer used to gather the sampling. In this program above, a 25 microdensitometer was used. 10 micros is the  minimum for Stochastic reproduction.  However based on the negative print technique that proably would not be condusive to the VP-8 system.\n\n","date":"November 30, 2013 at 10:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-54242","author":"Giorgio","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?","post":"The Jackson paper is a good study of the problem, and although I think it extrapolates a little too much from the actual measurements, it clearly explains how.
