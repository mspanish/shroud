[{"title":"I Stand Corrected","post":"Quote from a writer : “ENEA succeeded where Joan had failed. You could color a fiber and Ray was wrong.”\nI’m not sure Joan Rogers intention with his experiments was to test every possible wave lenght that exist (like ENEA did) to see if she could superficially colored a linen fiber…\nNevermind this, ENEA can superficially colored a linen fiber, maybe that’s true, ok.  But the real question is this :  IS IT REALLY THE REALITY REGARDING THE COLORATION WE FOUND ON THE SHROUD ???  IN OTHER WORDS, DID THE CHROMOPHORE FOR THE COLORATION ON THE SHROUD IS REALLY THE PRIMARY CELL WALL OF THE CELLULOSE OF THE LINEN FIBERS ???  If it’s not the case and the chromophore is really a thin layer of impurities that lies ON the primary cell wall, then sorry, Rogers wasn’t wrong…\nMore researches need to be done to know the truth with a great level of confidence.  If someone can fully confirmed Rogers hypothesis for the chromophore, then that would prove that the ENEA’s results are irrelevant to the Shroud.  We’re not there yet, but the fact that McCrone confirmed the starch finding of Rogers is something to consider with great care when we reflect on this question.\n\n","date":"January 16, 2012 at 12:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/16/i-stand-corrected/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-7052","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I Stand Corrected","post":"barry is right. you stepped in it. thanks for saying so\n\n","date":"January 16, 2012 at 5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/16/i-stand-corrected/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-7067","author":"MouseInTheHouse","site":"shroudstory"}]
