Invisible interpolation! Check out Mario’s links above, or visit Shroud Scope for  the pictures. ME-20 shows two warp threads twisted together, either by mistake or because one ran out and was replaced, gradually, by another. For a short while (guess – 6 inches or so?) the two threads run alongside each other – this is clearly visible by microscopy, and is entirely similar to any invisible mending technique. No such double weaving occurs by the C-14 corner. And look at the variation in thickness of the warp threads in ME-02 and ME-14.

A new one on me. However it consists entirely of dogmatic statements with neither evidence nor references to back them up. In particular, the statement on page 15, “This kind of weaving was practiced throughout the Roman Empire,” which appears to refer to herringbone, is not justified by archaeology. My point about the Evans photos was not really to suggest that the face on the shroud has been repaired, but that any kind of reweaving should be as obvious as what we see there, and there is no evidence of anything similar around the C-14 area, in particular on the “Jull” sample photographed by Barrie Schwortz.\n\n","date":"March 17, 2014 at 8:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/15/of-pixels-spectrum-and-density/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-90184","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Pixels, Spectrum and Density","post":"The point I was trying to make is that these are imperfections and errors due to the manual weaving process rather than a reweave.\n\n","date":"March 17, 2014 at 9:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/15/of-pixels-spectrum-and-density/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-90204","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Pixels, Spectrum and Density","post":"Also a quote from textile expert John Tyrer (taken From the resurrection of the shroud by Mark Antonacci)\n” I am very interested in the comparison that can be made between the altar cloth used to patch the shroud, the shroud itself, and the backing cloth…the altar cloth and the backing cloth are plain woven, and are much better products than the shroud. They seem to contain less weaving faults whilst the shroud is a very poor product by comparison. It is full of warp and weft weaving defects, many mistakes in drawing-in the impression I am left with is that the cloth is much cruder and probably earlier fabric than the backing and patches. This I think lifts the shroud out of the Middle Ages more than anything I have seen about the textile”\nBTW, An invisible weave would definitely look (if at all it can be detected) much different than a mistake in the weave.
