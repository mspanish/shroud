[{"title":"Tweet for Today from HAL9000","post":"Hello Dan !  I think we’ll have to agree to disagree ! :-)  No problem.\nBut one thing’s for sure :  In the case of Shroud research, no image analysis will ever replace a good chemical analysis.  And if the autorities should act like you want, I really believe it will open a new Pandora’s box with a new set of questions without any answers because no direct tests will come along with the images.  I don’t think it’s the proper way to act.  I think the HD images should only come to back-up new microscopic and chemical analysis and should only be used by a proper team of SCIENTISTS (that include at least an expert in imagery analysis) and not some wanna-bees.\nDan you wrote : “I very seriously doubt anyone will be seeing any more coins or lettering on these images.”  \nOH YEAH ???  ARE YOU REALLY SURE ABOUT THAT MY FRIEND ???  When I look at the post-STURP shroud research, I’m not convinced at all about that.  Too much wackos out there…\nAnd even if people don’t see coins, flowers and thing’s like that, image analysis only (without microscopic and chemical analysis) would leave the door open to a lot of misinterpretations and I think that could only thicken the mystery instead of solving it more…  As I said, it would be a very dangerous territory.\nI prefer to wait a bit until the Vatican will open the door to a new series of direct tests that should be backed-up by those HD images.  Then, those image will be useful.\n\n","date":"October 6, 2011 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/06/tweet-for-today-from-hal9000/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-4135","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
