[{"title":"Resolution  of the Shroud Image","post":"The problem is that the Shroud of Turin is not a classical image, just like a photograph, where you can clearly define tiny detail.\nIt’s actual a kind of heat plot of a 3D model, where intensity is correlated with distance from the cloth. Looking at the Shroud as mere photograph can be very misleading. What we see are not strictly speaking, say visible details of the face, but mere variations in intensity, usually associated with different facial features. If there is no variation of the distance to the cloth, there is no variation in intensity, and the image is blurred, generally speaking. \nMaximum resolution? There is no one single answer on that. Dependent on region it can be higher or lower. There are areas where details about 1 mm in size can be resolved, and there some where there is uncertainty of 5 mm and more.\nThat is shortly speaking. in fact the matter is a little bit more complex, but it would need to wirte a paper on that.\n\n","date":"June 20, 2015 at 4:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/20/resolution-of-the-shroud-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-202898","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resolution  of the Shroud Image","post":"HF: “Optically speaking a well defined Shroud image would be one around which it would be possible for different people independently to draw outlines of various features (e.g. arms, legs, eyes, fingers) and when superimposed they should not differ by more than a millimetre or so.”  \nI think that’s a good succinct summary and a practical repeatable method of what most could call good image definition.  Clearly it is not satisfied by the Shroud image, which is of variable definition across the cloth, as mentioned by OK, with a range of perhaps 1 mm to 5 mm.   \nWhat might this be telling us in terms of image formation process?  Is the variation in resolution systematic, correlated with any particular variable?  I suspect it is not, and this suggests to me some type of random naturalistic process, possibly akin to diffusion.  If it were say a radiation model, I think I would expect variation in resolution to be correlated, perhaps with body-cloth distance.  And then again, radiation might result in some kind of distorting resolution interference pattern.  Just thinking out aloud.  Does anyone detect any kind of pattern in the variation of resolution, or do observers see it as random?  Any thoughts on implications?\n\n","date":"June 20, 2015 at 4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/20/resolution-of-the-shroud-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-202900","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resolution  of the Shroud Image","post":" Does anyone detect any kind of pattern in the variation of resolution, or do observers see it as random?\nThe “desing” of image is definetly not random -especially in the face area. It is true that the image is actually a kind of density plot, corresponding to the body-cloth distance -but that’s not entire truth. As I have observerd, bandings play a key role in defining the image, and make it a photograph look-like (especially in the face area). This is extremely unlikely for a “blind” natural process. More about that I will write in a paper -but definetly not before July, as I have some more urgent work to do now.\n\n","date":"June 20, 2015 at 5:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/20/resolution-of-the-shroud-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-202907","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resolution  of the Shroud Image","post":"The Shroud image is essentially a Print, everywhere the cloth contacts the Body (front, nose,  hair etc…).  There, the theoretical resolution is the fiber size itself (0,015 mm), increased by area liquid diffusion (small for flax- 2 or 3 fibers- would be much larger for cotton fibers). Between contacts (between skin and cloth) gazeous diffusion occurs (giving the specific tridimensional encoding). There, the resolution is a function of various parameters, the most important being chemicals (too complex to be explained here) and distance (between skin emitting vapors and cloth fibers). It varies from 1 mm to more than 1 cm, particularly when the cloth falls away from the Body.\n\n","date":"June 20, 2015 at 5:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/20/resolution-of-the-shroud-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-202903","author":"ALONSO","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resolution  of the Shroud Image","post":"Do you have any idea concerning the reactants at stake?\n\n","date":"June 20, 2015 at 6:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/20/resolution-of-the-shroud-image/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-202912","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resolution  of the Shroud Image","post":"The reactants are Fluids (corporal ) and Solids (Shroud fibers).

It is unlikely you can go lower, unless the imaging mechanism was able to code the resolution on single fibers -but this would require some extensive and difficult processing of the images to check.\nHuman eye resolution can go an order of magnitude lower. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye#Small_objects_and_maps\nOf course, in practice the resolution depends on relative intensity of neighbouring regions.

In my opinion, they are just a figment of the imagination, from looking at the 1931 Enrie photographs of the Shroud, which were lit by raking light and therefore show up all  the creases and imperfections in the cloth, giving rise to all kinds of objects that can be “seen” on the linen.
