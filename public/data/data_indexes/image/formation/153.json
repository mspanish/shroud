[{"title":"The Man Who Liked to Dip Pickle Spears in His Beers","post":"I do not believe in miracles. I only believe in things we can not explain. Threre is an arbirary divide in our thinking between was “natural” and what is and what is “supernatural or unnatural” If something happens we can not explain, that does not mean it is suprenatural or unnatural”,” it simply means that we cannot explain it.\nThe image on the shroud of Turin has yet to be explained. It that sense it is by definition “supernatural.” But it exists so no one can deny that it is “natural” either.\nAll op the evidence surrounding the image, points in one direcrtion: the Resurrection. Can it be said to “prove” the Resurrection. Maybe not, but the experiments in Italy and other places all point towards some kind of radiation (Sorry Ray R.). There is nothing in antiquity of which I am aware that exhibits the same characteristics and for which radiation seems to be the simplest solution. The fact that we can not explain the radiation by current science does not mean at some future date it will not be explained. \nAncients marveled at all kinds of things that we subsequently explained such as solar and lunar eclipses. Scientists are exploring the issue of human consciousness. It has yet to be explained. \nScience is not an enemy of religion which posits a primordial conscientiousness from which our universe sprang. Science is the enemy of religion that trembles in fear at a solar eclipse because God has taken away the sun or that to prevent the volcano from erupting we must sacrifice a human being.\nSomething happened in that Jerusalem tomb circa 30CE. It is reported that Christ rose from dead. If so, then something in that process, undoubtedly some kind  of radiation caused an image to be created. \nI can understand an agnostic who doesn’t believe it’s been proven. But the atheist who claims it never happened, is well, a fool.\n\n","date":"September 6, 2014 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/06/the-man-who-liked-to-dip-pickle-spears-in-his-beers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-149053","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Man Who Liked to Dip Pickle Spears in His Beers","post":"“the experiments in Italy and other places all point towards some kind of radiation (Sorry Ray R.).”\nThibault Heimburger is active on this blog, understands Ray R.’s work and is the fourth author on “Microscopic and Macroscopic Characteristics of the Shroud of Turin Image Superficiality”.\n(http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2010/00000054/00000004/art00001)\nDo you think he takes a stand for some kind of radiation mechanism?

Even enemies acknowledged the ability of the disciples to heal and cure.\nIn the Catholic Church today, somewhat the same process is used in deciding who is a candidate for sainthood. Any healing and curing made in life are not taken into consideration.\nThere is the famous case of the Jewish millionaire in New York who had two wishes as he lay dying of an incurable brain tumour: meet Pope John Paul II and be buried in Jerusalem. An arrangement was made through the pope’s secretary, Monsignor Stanislaw Dziwisz and one fine morning the dying man was wheeled into the pope’s private chapel on a stretcher. There were also some others attending the mass and the dying Jewish man also received communion like them — from the pope’s hands. He was gently chided by the monsignor after this. A fortnight later the monsignor received a call and learnt that the man had been cured.\nIt was announced in the press in many countries.\n\n","date":"September 6, 2014 at 6:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/06/the-man-who-liked-to-dip-pickle-spears-in-his-beers/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-149157","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
