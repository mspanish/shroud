If X looks tricky, then move to Y, if Y lloks tricky, move to Z.\nCorgiat’s pyrography involved drawing a negative image – perhaps its weakest aspect, but at least it did show some encoded 3D characteristics, which are not that difficult to embed – all that’s needed is a gradation of image density- rather like contour lines on a map. Even the 1532 burn marks on the Shroud respond to 3D imaging – not surprising when you think about density gradients in charring.\nOh, and let’s not forget that the challenge is not merely to reproduce putative medieval technology, but all the ageing changes and assorted insults from hot pokers (allegedly) fires, water, mending etc etc.\nI’m pretty certain that the Shroud image is some kind of pressure imprint, dare one call it a barograph. It’s knowing how the imprint was captured and memorised is the next question. I stioll believe it was a scorch. The head may have been a metal bas-relief, as suggested earlier, but I’m coming round to the idea that it was fired or even unfired ceramic – simply clay that was allowed to set, and then heated to make the ‘barothermograph’ aka scorch, which fits with a lot of the crucial characteristic of the Shroud image.\nOK, I know I’m wasting my time here, but I saw my name mentioned, and as I say, there’s someone rampaging around my own site as I write…\nGoodnight one and all.

It’s not just that the faint hints of images appear only after many levels of computer “enhancement”, filter techniques etc to separate signal from noise (leaving one wondering if Fanti was really seeing a reverse side image  at all as distinct from a transmitted/filtered front side image. It’s the fact that there are only 7 mentions of “blood”, and only one of those addresses the key question as to whether blood seeps across linen as expected. Yup, apart from one brief reference to the famous “3” (epsilon) that’s it. So why, one may ask, if it’s only the head and hands that are vaguely imaged on the reverse side, why does one not see all those blood trails of the forearms prominent there also, even if the rest of the image is absent? \n How can a scientist fail to address so obvious an issue, relegating blood almost to a footnote?
