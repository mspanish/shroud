Use Spectrum/Fire or Thermal LUT instead!\n\n","date":"June 5, 2014 at 2:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/good-3d-from-a-conventional-photograph/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127096","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Good 3D from a conventional photograph","post":"I agree, just compare it to the shroud image posted on the previous thread.

The more closely you approach the vertical, the more closely any 3D image of either a photograph or a portrait resembles its subject. From the side, they usually look pretty weird (see https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/30/new-3d-rendering-of-the-shroud-of-turin-face-by-john-chen/ for a different program just for a change). I said before somewhere that almost any full-face, evenly lit, dark background, monochromatic portrait produces an image which is at least as good, and often better, than the shroud does.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2014 at 3:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/good-3d-from-a-conventional-photograph/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127228","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Good 3D from a conventional photograph","post":"I have just this minute posted some graphics showing what happens when model 2D “shade charts” are entered into ImageJ. \nhttp://colinb-sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2014/06/not-all-images-that-are-3d-enhancible.html\n3D effects, some quite spectacular, are achievable despite there being no encoded 3D information, except that is for the, er, cheiropoietic gradient in image density.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2014 at 4:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/good-3d-from-a-conventional-photograph/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127234","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Good 3D from a conventional photograph","post":"Dan: O.K. I understand why not to use original colors because it includes the underlying image. Is grayscale, here different than gray?\nYesterday I wrote:\n“Every image is 3D, as it has 2 spatial coordinates + intensity (X,Y,I). The point is that the intensity I correlates with cloth body distance (which is also imprecisely defined – Jackson, Jumper & Ercoline used simply vertical, or Z distance).”\nSo I discourage using original colors or greatscale and rotating 3D models, as the shape of it may be distorted by the persepective from which we observe it. So the true-3D images (defined like above) may not look 3D, or opposite not-true-3D may look like true 3D.\nThe best way is to use Thermal LUT with infront view like here:\n \nThe color scale (which is quite objective ) serves for 3D. It is like looking at topographic map. You must then analyze whether the shape looks like real human body, of course taking a linen laid on him into account.\nPhotographs never satisfy this, as far as I tried -they always have too ‘hot’ foreheads due to them being large flat surfaces.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2014 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/good-3d-from-a-conventional-photograph/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127259","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Good 3D from a conventional photograph","post":"I don’t know how you feel that the picture in your llnk demonstrates any satisfactory 3D encoding. If the pale blue areas are supposed to be approximately the same height off the the base, then the forehead doesn’t curve, and is as flat and as high as the cheeks, the hair, and the area under the moustache. There is no curve to the sides of the cheeks, just an abrupt ‘cliff’ from pale blue to dark blue. The highest areas, presumably the contact areas if we set aside Piczek’s floatation model for the moment, are in green and consist solely of the tip of the nose and the beard, not the hair or anywhere at the top of the head. Even if we postulate that the white areas are also contact areas (so the distance/intensity hypotheses breaks down), then the brow still is not an area of contact. However one interprets this image, it clearly shows that the the 3D encapsulation is very poor, and certainly not as good as anybody who wanted could create with a bit of sepia chalk. You are quite correct that to get any good kind of 3D image from the shroud it is best not to look at it from shallow angles: but this is because it’s not a very good 2D to 3D image, not because of the software.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2014 at 7:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/05/good-3d-from-a-conventional-photograph/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-127274","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Good 3D from a conventional photograph","post":"Hugh:\nI don’t know how you feel that the picture in your llnk demonstrates any satisfactory 3D encoding.\nIt is a little bit qualitative rather than quantitive evaluation. Do not consider green areas -those are almost certainly surface contamination, blood & dirt etc. White areas are most probably contact areas, nose, beard, eyebrows, cheeks, front of the forehead. Bluer areas are farther than that. The sides of the cheek are in the dark bands, or are either covered by some headband, or perhaps it is due to the darker bands passing there. \nYou should also consider smoothness of the brightness curve -compare to the contact scorch images on the left (from Głowacki). \nGenerally it needs some experience to know what to look for, (and what not to look), but one can easily see that the Shroud image is distinguished in comparison to others. Only Craig & Breese images have quite similar effect, I do not yet fully understand why.\nGenerally, I think about putting a kind of a gallery of 3D images comparing the Shroud and and its attempted reproductions.
