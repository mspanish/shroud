They show that some parts of the image are a bit darker than the background, for instance the abdomen and ventral thighs, but nowhere in the body image the net effect of oxidation+stars is a lighter image than the background, except perhaps at the four areas at the forehead, beneath a ventral knee, at the back of the head and next to a dorsal foot. But these lighter areas don‚Äôt constitute an image and seem to be artefacts of the light sources or wear. The book ‚ÄúThe Orphaned Manuscript‚Äù has the backlit photo of the ventral side. It shows white borders around the burn patches and some white lines along the scorched longitudinal folds that are not visible in the online photo. \nI wonder if the back of the cloth was lighted uniformly. If the middle strip of the cloth received more backlight than the sides (and if the top and bottom parts of the image received more than the middle part of it), this might explain (at least partly) why the image is less visible than the light scorches and why only the middle part of the ventral image is visible.\nAdler said ‚ÄúIn reflectance photographs the images of the waterstains, scorches, blood, and body images are all approximately of about the same intensity.‚Äù The text then has the two sentences about disappearance of the body image and the presence of the other marks in transmitted light (already quoted), and then follows a cryptic sentence: ‚ÄúIn the reflectance mode the colored body image fibers produce 100% of the reflected radiation recorded, but in the transmitted mode they only contribute about 1% of the radiation recorded, thus demonstrating their superficial one-fiber-deep nature.‚Äù (Adler, Chemical and Physical aspects, p. 17).

I don‚Äôt know if anyone ever did this with a representative light scorch.

I‚Äôve bolded the key section:\n‚ÄúTwill fabrics technically have a front and a back side, unlike plain weave, where the two sides are the same. The front side of the twill is the technical face and the back is called technical back. The technical face side of a twill weave fabric is the side with the most pronounced wale. It is usually more durable, more attractive, and most often used as the fashion side of the fabric. This side is usually the side visible during weaving. If there are warp floats on the technical face (if the warp crosses over two or more wefts),there will be filling floats (the weft will cross over two or more warps) on the technical back. If the twill wale goes up to the right on one side, it will go up to the left on the other side. Twill fabrics have no up and down as they are woven.\nI‚Äôll now have a think about your other points, and add them on to this Reply as an Edit if that‚Äôs OK with you.\nI hope you‚Äôre not bunking off‚Ä¶   üòâ\n\nUpdate 11:47  I‚Äôve just inserted a section that addresses your shadow issue.

Look at the body image on the herringbone weave on the nose, say, where its prominent, and then track it left or right onto cheeks etc where its less prominent. There is no discontinuity in the ridge. So one has simply moved from intense to fainter body image. If shadows and furrows were an issue you would see more evidence of that in the fainter body image areas.

The warp threads are the ones which hang vertically in a loom, through which, by a system of heddles, the horizontal weft thread passes. On the shroud, the warp threads run longitudinally, and the weft threads transverse. Am I correct now in thinking that the photos show part of the shroud in its landscape, rather than portrait, format? So, as you say, the warp threads are prominent (at least on the front of the cloth, and in the pictures). I‚Äôm not sure it matters, but I‚Äôd like to clear it up. I can‚Äôt be sure from the Shroud Scope photos.\nWhatever the answer, there are corollaries I hadn‚Äôt thought of. If the markings are most prominent on the most prominent threads, then of course the back of the cloth, where most of those threads are hidden, would show very little discolouration. It would be interesting to see a bit of 3-1 twill woven entirely from black warp and white weft. Presumably it would be pretty dark grey on the one side, and pretty light grey on the other.\nThe other observation, which I made before, is that any patch of Shroud Scope photo, image, non-image or blood actually shows dark diagonal lines best, which are not marked threads at all, but the shadows between them. The threads themselves are quite pale. So whatever the surface of the threads is coloured with, the image we see on the photographs is primarily made of the dips and furrows where the mainly overlying threads dip under the underlying ones.\n","date":"October 30, 2012 at 11:52 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/a-leisurely-thinking-aloud-appraisal-of-those-recently-released-shroud-photomicrographs/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1031","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"}]
