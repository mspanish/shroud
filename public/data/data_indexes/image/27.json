I’ll give that a try.\nHis template was basically just two tiers of metal, separated by a shallow vertical ridge. There was no subtlety there – no smooth rounded contours around which the linen could drape, and he was not always pressing into a soft underlay. Is it any wonder that there is excessive contrast between the images intensities of those two planes? To reject scorching with so minimalist a template does not strike me as scientifically-prudent – given the kind of work I have been publishing these last few months – see banner – where there is no problem whatsoever re excessive contrast between adjacent planes. In any case, folk have often pointed out that the prominences of the Shroud face, especially nose, chin, beard etc are exceptionally well-imaged … it’s simply a case of managing the template, pressure, underlay etc to get an acceptable image. Yes, I agree re conduction probably being crucial. Having  a poorer heat conductor like plaster may also assist “manageability”. Back later.

(Where’s the scientific evidence?)","post":"Latest playing about…\nComparing contact (conduction?) scorch marks to non-contact (radiation?) scorch marks.\nIf I heat a crucible lid to red heat and drop it on linen, it makes (of course) a charred black rim, and a radiated heat non-contact brown scorch in the middle – about 3mm from lid to linen. If I do the same with a spoon, the scorch is about 3cm wide, corresponding to a radiated distance of 3 or 4mm. If I heat a spatula for ten seconds or so, and press it on the cloth, I make a mark which superficially looks very similar. At least it’s the same colour.\nHowever, under the microscope it is obvious that the contact marks are very specific, just on the thread-fibres which have been in contact, and definitely not continuing into the places where the fibres go underneath other threads, while the radiated marks are much more even, and, when the threads are separated, it is difficult (read impossible) to see any difference between places directly exposed and places where the fibres passed under others.\nWhy this should be I can’t really say. I guessing that under radiated heat the fibres are able to conduct the energy away and discolour all the way along, but in contact they can’t. Something to do with the suddenness of the arrival of the heat?\nBack to UV. I made some marks by pressing a hot spatula along a strip of linen, then cut the linen in two longitudinally, dividing all the marks in two, and washed one half in slightly soapy water then left it to soak for an hour, then dried it and put it back with the untouched half for comparison. Sadly, although the scorch marks seem to have been somewhat scrubbed off, the UV fluorescence is apparently unchanged. Can you think of anything else I might do to get rid of it?\nMy camera is not good enough to adjust for focussing in the dark, and still pictures are disappointing; however a video-camera seems to be able to manage a bit better. Would you like me to send some screen shots of these experiments? I have found an email address from an earlier post, and would be happy to do so if you’d like.\nNext, the BSTS meeting was interesting (particularly as there were life-size photos to pore over), and although in principle extremely controversial, very polite! David Rolfe did not pursue the Dawkins Challenge at all. He read out a goodwill message from Ian Wilson (now living in New Zealand) with interpolations of his own, from which two new movements came to light. Someone in America is reviewing the pollen sample slides, both those taken by Max Frie and those by other members of the STURP team, with a view to explaining the rather different interpretations different people have made of them; and also (quite exciting) a mould for making Lirey/Cluny pilgrimage badges has been found. I didn’t know about that, but immediately Googled “Lirey pelerinage moule” and find a photo of it as the front cover of a book – still only published in France as yet. It does not seem to be the mould for the famous badge, but certainly for one very similar.\nThomas de Wesselow then expounded in detail why he thought the two components of the shroud image, image and blood, were “technically, stylistically and conceptually” incompatible with 14th century art or forgery (I know you and many others disagree, and he did not reveal anything blindingly new, but he set out his arguments clearly and with many illustrations), and then went on, perhaps more diffidently, to explain why he thinks the shroud and The Risen Christ were in fact one and the same, and thus the foundation of Christianity. I found that difficult to take, I must say. Christian or not, to found a lasting worldwide religion on the basis of a stained sheet seems quite a tough deal to me – probably more of a miracle than bringing a man back to life!\nFinally a medical lady whose name I didn’t catch ran through the image as pathology, with some real Roman nails and a flagrum mock-up based on the famous remains found in Pompei. It was interesting for me as I had only seen these things on telly before, but not revelatory; and Tony Luby, a teacher, explained how he used the shroud in his RCRE classes.\nThat should be enough to go on with!\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 1:05 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-964","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

My scorched linen, lit by an ordinary 200W bayonet-fitting UV  lamp in a very ordinary desk lamp, fluoresces a pale greeny yellow, very like, as it happens, fingernails and teeth, which also fluoresce the same colour. However, although I’ve been out all evening, I came back and couldn’t resist looking at a sample under the lamp, and dripping water over it to see what happened. It looked to me as if the scorch fluoresced slightly less brightly, and you may have something in your re-hydration idea. More amazing was the blue ink, of which there was a scribble by sheer chance on the sample, which did not apparently fluoresce at all when applied, or when dry, but bright pink (!!) when it was dripped with water and spread out over the cloth.

You say you it was green. The fluorescence around the Shroud 1532 scorch marks was described by one of the STURP team as red, as I recall. I also wonder what kind of chemical change, could produce any kind of fluorescence –  if indeed it is chemical, whether green or red  if it appears at temperatures below those that produce visible scorching. Suppose it’s simply an effect of dehydration?  Is adsorbed moisture acting as a fluorescence quencher?  Drive off the moisture – and up pops the fluorescence due to modern linen additives – fabric brighteners etc. ?  Suppose you simply place in an oven set at 100 degrees C? Does that produce green fluorescence? Have you seen red fluorescence at any temperature?\nNope, I shan’t be there tomorrow at Beaconsfield, and to be candid won’t be hankering to be associated with the BSTS either – not  while one of its members is harrying, sorry “challenging”  Richard Dawkins – or anyone else for that matter – to prove the Shroud is a fake. That is not how science works. Science, at least in its preliminary stages, is not helped either by having folk, least of all “gifted amateurs”  attend conferences with a view to  hammering out “consensus statements”. Shroud studies are over-burdened with too much unchallengeable dogma as it is, without crystallizing it into consensus statements. (Example: the bald statement in the consensus statement that blood preceded the body image, based on a spot test with enzyme under the microscope).\nThanks for inviting me to pose a question.

Grad Dip.Ed persists in his mistaken belief that the Shroud image is a photograph. (Where’s the scientific evidence?)","post":"Fun with Linen. Not finding any in the house I ebayed a piece and have spent a day happily experimenting in my school laboratory, with a Bunsen Burner, a couple of microscopes and a UV lamp. Firstly, I cannot, at any temperature, scorch the stuff without making it fluoresce. This was quite exciting for me as most cloth these days fluoresces anyway (probably being treated with something) but the linen wasn’t/didn’t until I heated it. Placing a hot spatula on it, in the dark, illuminated only by the light of a Bunsen burner and the UV lamp, produces a dark scorch, of varying depth, surrounded by a clear halo of pale green fluorescence, which also fills up the scorch area itself, except where it is charred to carbon. Carrying out the experiment you suggested, of repeatedly placing the hot object against the cloth until nothing seems to occur, shows that even when the scorch is barely visible, or even not visible at all, the fluorescence is quite clear.\nNext, trying to compare linen with cotton, it seemed to me that the cotton did not conduct heat as well as linen, because, after pulling apart some charred fragments under a microscope, it was easier to obtain banding (the threads not coloured where they passed underneath others, but charred where they were on the top) with cotton than with linen. A very good effect could be produced even on linen, however, if instead of heating a spatula, I used a pin, and rolled it gently over the surface (instead of pressing down with the spatula).\nRemarkably, the most shroud-like markings I could make were when, so that I could find them more easily, I drew a circle around one with a fibre-tipped pen. Astonishing. The ink remained only on the topmost fibres (and, when a fibre was examined under high power, only on one side of some fibres), and clearly didn’t flow into the dips where the threads pass over and under each other, except very occasionally when it seemed to stain a few individual fibres and turned up on the other side of the cloth. I don’t know how big ink particles are, but nothing particulate could be resolved at 400X. The marks were blue, of course…\nLots more experiments suggest themselves to me, but I thought I’d let you know how I got on before I go to the meeting tomorrow. Perhaps I’ll find out about the ‘conspiracy of silence’ about scorches, Maillard reactions and such like. I’ve not heard that you’ll be there, but if not, and you’d like me to raise anything specific, and scientific, I would do my best (if I could understand the chemistry!).

But they can subsequently recrystallize on cooling, returning to something like their original structure, or “retrograding” like starch to new ordered structures that still retain a high degree of crystallinity. I personally am not au fait with phase changes in cellulose, but suspect that so highly ordered and chemically resistant a substance retains or even REGAINS – most if not all of its native crystallinity up to temperatures that are not too far short of those that produce pyrolysis and scorching , i.e. close to 300 degrees C, but the latter are some 60-80 degrees higher than those that pyrolyse the hemicelluloses of the PCW.\nRogers claim that temperatures that pyrolyse linen must irreversibly modify cellulose is I believe a matter of some conjecture. It might have carried more weight if he had mentioned the PCW and its more susceptible hemicelluloses, instead of putting all his speculative eggs in Pliny’s starch fragments/soapwort surface-impurities basket, thus creating that theoretical basket case  😉 known as the Maillard browning theory.\nSelective scorching of the PCW hemicelluloses not only explains why cellulose can escape modification, provided that a temperature is chosen that gives just a faint scorch, but at one and the same time accounts for the exceptional superficiality of the Shroud image, and faint scorch marks in general, if confined to the PCW. \nI agree by the way that medulla is somewhat imprecise as a term, especially as the centre of the fibre core is hollow, but the alternatives with selected chemical or botanical terms all seem somewhat long-winded.\n","date":"October 16, 2012 at 9:23 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-957","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I had a go myself but iPhoto (all I’ve got) is not subtle enough. It seems to me that the drop of blood right at the end of the distinctive 3 shape on the forehead has a light patch in the middle, which could be as a result of a thick encrustation peeling off. The other place is at the back of the head, where, to be frank, the blood stains look as if they have bubbles in them – again, light patches which may be the result of thick bits coming away. If there was no body image (scorch, if you like) under them, then the colour should be perhaps pale pink (???) being the stain left behind by the blood, and nothing else. If there is an image under them, then it should be darker, a combination of the brown image and and pink blood residue. Another place to look for pale spots in the blood might be the dribble from one of the feet, which clearly continues into places where there is no image.\nBack to Rogers. The paper I quoted does not seem to me to concern scorching at all, being all about nuclear radiation, specifically from thorium. How comparable the results of nuclear radiation are with lowish temperature scorching I don’t know. Having irradiated some flax for a week with thorium, it would have been pretty simply just to scorch a bit for comparison, but that was presumably not the object of Rogers’s exercise. His conclusion that, when examined under polarising light, image and non-image threads look the same (although one photo is very blurred) may be significant in terms of emitted particles, but I don’t think his paper establishes that it is relevant to scorching, at least not to me, or, presumably, you!\nThere is a lot in the literature claiming that scorching always damages the medulla of flax fibres, and that the shroud fibres do not show such damage, but I have not found a paper that substantiates that yet. I’m a little perplexed as to the use of the word medulla, which (although it’s perfectly clear what it means) is usually applied to animal rather than plant material.\nFinally, I spent quite a happy time last night scorching cloth and looking at it under a 400X microscope, but it was all cotton, which isn’t really comparable, so I’m going to raid a tablecloth today…\n","date":"October 16, 2012 at 10:03 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-955","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

It requires going back to Square One on the question of what was acquired first – the image or the blood. If the Shroud is authentic, then blood came first – one can be totally categorical about that. (The converse however is not true – the Shroud could be a medieval forgery regardless of whether the blood or image came first, although image first makes life simpler for the forger).\nYes, I know that “blood first, image second” is received wisdom, but it is based on a single finding with protein-digesting enzyme that while suggestive is far from conclusive.  Shroud Scope images suggested to me a while ago that image may in fact be UNDERNEATH blood.  If so, and that can be confirmed, then we have an interesting opportunity to test authenticity, inasmuch as one can search for better tests that establish which is underneath which (even though we are still uncertain as to the precise chemical nature of either the image or the authenticity of the blood).\nI mentioned the Royal Society earlier. I am minded now to include in my letter a request that it invites its members to suggest new and novel means of determining whether blood or body image came first, preferably using instrumentation that causes minimal damage to the Shroud.

I haven’t read the original papers in any detail, but there seems to be some confusion between threads (being the long thin stuff the weaver used), fibres (being the little twisty bits that make up the threads), and cellulose molecules.  It is obvious that threads can be scorched on one side, you can see that with the naked eye. I think it is obvious under a microscope that fibres can be scorched on one side, or at least damaged more in one place than another, although I haven’t been able to verify that personally (yet); but I know nothing about the molecular composition of each fibre, and would need to read the original papers more carefully than I have done so far to see if the polarised light experiments really do preclude scorching, which I doubt. As I understand it, cellulose is a fairly elaborate and extensive network of sub-components (glucose units), which can surely be damaged in some places without affecting others. Heating it is not, I surmise, an all or nothing affair – unlike, say, heating a single glucose molecule, which cannot but cause total decomposition.\nAs to the second, I suppose that if I were wedded to a photographic or chemical or burst-of-cosmic-rays origin, I would cling to any evidence, however tenuous, that the marks are not scorches. Nothing else springs to mind, but perhaps you have better ideas than I.\nAnyway, my next job is to try to understand Ray Rogers’s “Radiation Effects, Aging and Image Formation” whose abstract concludes that “the image could not have involved energetic radiation of any kind; photons, electrons, protons, alpha particles and/or neutrons.” That seems quite dogmatic!\nYou may hope, and I wish you well, that positive evidence alone is enough to establish a theory; but in practice, I think, it is usually necessary to disprove negative evidence as well, especially if it comes from a reputable source.\n","date":"October 15, 2012 at 1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-950","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I’m surprised that so little use has been made of them so far. When did you hear of their existence?

I’ve done experiments of various kinds on pieces of cloth for 30 years (heat, light, UV, acids, alkalies, myhrr, aloes, sweat, you name it) without convincing myself that I know how the image was made. However I have never had access to the high-definition (although sadly not high enough for what I want now) photography of Shroud Scope, and it really has just struck me that we’re all working from pictures, with all their optical imperfections, rather than the artifact itself. I don’t even know if all the diagonal hatching (shadow, reflection or refraction) is actually visible at all in some lighting conditions. Part of the clarity of your scorch from the mask in your banner above comes from the exposure of the cloth so that the individual threads which are not scorched are hardly visible; it may be that the shroud would look very similar if it was photographed in the same way. It should at least be much easier to differentiate scorch marks (if so they are) from liquid flows (if so they are) which would be expected to follow the ridges and furrows of the threads.\nAs for my fascination for minutiae, there are a steadily decreasing number of fields open to original discovery by independent researchers with no facilities, and any original discoveries i have made are indeed extremely minute. The Shroud is not something I’ve thought much about for a few years, as I’ve been concentrating on the history of the Olympic Games recently, but again, delving into some tiny details to try to derive original research from them.\nHere’s another bit of minutiae, for example. The famous crease across the neck of the shroud has a sort of dip, or shallow V, almost in the centre, in a light patch of the beard. Is that V real, or is the shroud lightly creased vertically at that point, and we are looking at the horizontal crease going down one side and up the other? If the V is real, then why is it there or how did it get there? It may be trivial, but it’s the sort of thing that absorbs me.\nIf you’ve found my entry on the BSTS meetup site, you’ll know that I’m a Catholic and a Science teacher, and might have thought I was a “let’s-try-and-invent-some-science-to-explain-a-miracle” sort of scientist. Nothing could be further than the truth. In common with most orthodox Catholic theologians who have faced up to miracles (including the Pope, according to the second volume of his life of Jesus) I fully expect the accounts of what happened physically to be thoroughly explicable in conventional scientific terms. Theologians are now exploring how (and why) these events affected the people who witnessed them and how they were used to illustrate a new (and better?) life style; they are not (mostly) bothering about the science. There are still fundamentalist Creation and Miracle (and Shroud) so-called scientists, but they are not theologians. (Nor Scientists, of course).\n","date":"October 14, 2012 at 10:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-948","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

Presumably the back of the shroud reverses this, and the other three quarters of the warp is visible, the threads running longitudinally from one end to the other, and only one quarter of the weft.\nI believe in the early days (probably round about the STURP examination) there were attempts (or was an attempt) to “remove directional markings” or something similar, by means of the very limited editing software then available. The object of that was to try to prove that there were no brush strokes, and so that the image was not a painting. However I am not aware of any attempt to remove the “shadows between the threads” (ALL the diagonal stripes of the herringbone pattern) to see more clearly what image really lies on top of the threads.\n","date":"October 14, 2012 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-946","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I’m supposing nobody thinks there was any “image making” mechanism there, but the individual threads are clearly differentiated in lines of dark and light. I’m wondering what the dark lines are. Are they on the top of each thread, or in the valleys between the threads? If on the top, then has there been some sort of uniform degradation of the entire shroud, even without any reference to image-formation; and if in the valleys, then presumably there’s a lot of gunk down there, which would play a significant part in the interpretation of anything else that might have formed thanks to scorches, chemicals or whatever to make the image. Or are they, literally, optical illusions?\nSomewhere in your blog you reproduce an extreme close-up of some threads with ‘blood’ on them (Mark Evans: Dense blood stain, scourge mark on back). If one ignores the blood, one  appears to to be looking at a wall of hairy bricks. If however, I blow the photo up to full screen, and then walk backwards away from it, then the vertical shadows between the bricks seem to become more prominent, and one sees two broad diagonal bands each made of closely spaced short vertical black lines. Needless to say, there are no such diagonal markings on the photo.\nSo, if all the diagonal bands observed on the shroud are observable in a similar way, then they are optical illusions, not real markings, so what would the image look like without them? That’s what I was getting at.\n","date":"October 14, 2012 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-945","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

You are now probing at a much deeper level of detail than previously. That’s OK – I don’t mind detail, in fact I revel in it, but must now take stock of your interest in the minutiae of image characteristics. \nI shall go back and have another look at the non-image areas and the detail you say  they show. Hopefully I’ll be able to respond with something sensible – but there again I may not. For now I would just say this: one can put fresh linen under a lens and see fibres, weave patterns without there being any image. I assume that is due not just to shadow effects that you but suggest but also due to differences in reflection and even refraction. As a general observation, I might also point out that you have still not said why you are taking this particular line – what is it leading up to?  Is there something in my observation and /or interpretation to which you have taken exception – and if so, is it on scientific or some other grounds?\n","date":"October 14, 2012 at 8:53 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-947","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

The pictures I have seen of the photography set-up show several overhead spotlights –  not much chance of shadow there surely, without lateral lighting. I’ve seen mentions made to some features showing up better with raking light, but they are the weird and wonderful ones – flowers, coins, writing etc etc, and invariably they come from Enrie and other photographic negatives with light/dark reversal. I have no truck with those – it’s the sepia as-is Shroud image for me or nothing.\nBut why are you concerned anyway on this score? What kind of artefact did you have in mind?

Presumably the photos were taken under the best possible lighting conditions, but if there were no shadows at all, then the patches of recently sewn-on cloth to cover the burn-holes, not having any distinction in coloration, should appear a uniform plain white, which they don’t. Some of the crease marks on the shroud, with higher highs and lows than the ordinary bumpiness of the linen threads, would cast more prominent shadows, and perhaps distort an interpretation of the marks associated with them.

I’d need to know exactly how those chemical-imprinting tests were done, and what precisely was the role of light and/or filters and stencils (if any) before venturing any comment, far less criticism.\nAs for hot brass statues, I’ve never been terribly keen on that idea, unless there had been one of a crucified Christ that had been damaged, say, and for which someone was attempting to find a use as an alternative to selling for scrap.\nI suspect there is more mileage with thermal imprinting from sections cast with Plaster of Paris. They could have been made from a real corpse (in theory a living subject too)  using death mask technology that has been around probably for millennia. The temperatures needed are nowhere near red heat, btw: somewhere between 200 and 250 Celsius, probably nearer the latter, being sufficient to produce a reasonably distinct sepia coloured scorch.\nIf one is a medieval forger, one does not go to the trouble of producing a one-off thermal imprint, outwith conventional artistic practice, unless there is a compelling reason to make the image LOOK LIKE A SCORCH. As I’ve said before, I believe the “unique and relevant” answer to that conundrum lies in the Templar connection, especially with De Molay’s gruesome execution (and preceding crucifixion?) and that of De Charney and other leading Templars. That order may have been stripped of most of its vast wealth, but there were probably still funds, or maybe later donations, that were available for creating a unique and compelling memento, with the focus on HEAT. A scorched memento may have been considered an apt visual metaphor, given that roasting/burning at the stake left nothing at the end to which mourners could pay their respects except charred fragments and ashes (and some sources say they were usually removed by ghoulish spectators taking them home as souvenirs).\n","date":"October 12, 2012 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-933","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I guess most “ordinary white light” includes a fair amount of UV anyway. Some years ago I soaked a handkerchief in potassium dichromate and shone a focussed photographic diaposive slide on it for a couple of hours. The image was very clearly visible (brown on yellow), but then I washed it, ironed it with a hot iron, boiled it and generally  tried to remove all traces of the experiment, but the image remained, albeit so faint that the BSTS were unable to reproduce it in their journal. it had, of course, a negative quality about it, in that the lighter areas of the photo changed the colour of the cloth least.\nI certainly don’t believe that the image on shroud was formed like that, nor by hanging a life-sized image (or real dead person) outside a pin-hole camera the size of a room, or any of the other photographic ideas currently in circulation, and of course it is true that in any of these cases the image is technically formed by the reaction of the sensitive chemical with the linen, not by the direct energy of light rays. (A similar experiment can be performed by shining a very contrasty slide onto a large leaf and carrying out a standard school-level starch test with iodine).\nI have to say that I don’t look forward to Stephen Jones’s photographic evidence (if so it be) with any great hope of being convinced; however, I still have difficulty with the hot brass statue idea, although the bas relief variation is quite compelling.\n","date":"October 12, 2012 at 6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","id":"comment-932","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

There is a world of difference between those two terms and image-forming mechanisms.. THERMOgraphy offers a explanation for the negative character of the Shroud image, encoded 3D information, confinement to the more superficial parts of the weave etc. PHOTOgraphy explains nothing. It is merely a lazy (and erroneous) assumption that Secondo Pia’s positive photographic image must have been derived from a PHOTOgraphic (pseudo)negative.\nIf Jones is dying to unveil a new theory of proto-photography, then let him do it sooner rather than later. In the meantime, I shall give short shrift to Jones or anyone else who bandies around a term that I consider to be highly misleading (and self-serving too, if the user feels it excuses them from having to discuss the specifics of image properties and formation).\nBtw: how can ordinary visible white light degrade linen? Or do you include ultraviolet in your reference to “light”? If so, how was that uv radiation brought to a focus in a way that could produce an image?
