[{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"“Colin has shown one way that apparent relief can be generated that has nothing to do with shape.”\nAnd footprints in the sand have nothing to do with shape either? The contrast of a scorch has all to do with shape, temperature, pressure, and the nature of the hot template.\nScorching is a contact mechanism, and has many properties different from the Shroud image.\nBut that’s not even close to the real problem of the Shroud image, being the nature of the distant mechanism.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2014 at 11:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-175923","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"Might it be the conversion of a simple shade chart with no 3D history to apparent 3D topography that so impressed “reader”, not model scorches in the first instance? In other words, 3D rendering is not unique to the TS, it’s not even unique to the TS and model scorches. It’s simply the way that software programs like ImageJ interpret a 2D ‘darkness’ map – any 2D darkness map.\nThe next target for this slow but systematic model-builder is to scrutinize every single detail of the TS image, before and after 3D-rendering, to gain clues as to the nature of the imprinting process. In fact, that’s been happening for some months now. But there’s a major uncertainty that is holding up progress. A contact scorch off a template can be obtained in one of two ways. The first is ‘tactile’. where the linen is moulded with fingers to the contours of the template (as with Luigi Garlaschelli’s powder or paste ‘frottage’ using a live volunteer, or what I called LOTTO scorching – Linen On Top, Then Overlay) . The other is entirely non-tactile, where the inanimate template is pressed forcibly down onto linen with a suitable underlay, e.g.several layers of damp cloth (LUWU configuration : Linen Underneath, With Underlay). There’s a subtle difference between the quality of imprints obtained by the two methods, tactile moulding allowing one to capture greater detail especially where there’s abrupt changes of relief and/or angularities (not that there are many of those on the TS to serve as ‘acid test’ areas), albeit with greater risk of lateral distortion if one moulds “too far” round the sides. Interestingly, there is little risk of lateral distortion using LUWU, as mentioned recently, showing comparisons of scorch versus (inferior) paint imprints.\nOne working hypothesis is that tactile and non-tactile occurred simultaneously, i.e. in a non-authenticity medieval hoax model, tactile moulding was used for the frontal side, non-tactile for the dorsal.  It could have been inspired by and/or modelled on that artwork ones sees at the top of this posting (Descent from the Cross straight onto J of A’s up-and-over linen), or what I call the pseudo-sweat imprint model (pseudo if scorch technology was used to simulate a yellowed centuries-old sweat imprint).  \nThere’s some corroborating evidence for that model, especially where the chin/neck is concerned, maybe the feet too. But there’s only so much an amateur can do. What’s needed are model studies in which real bodies and effigies thereof are actively scanned electronically with a mobile tracking photocell on guide rails, with and without over- or underlay of linen to see whether or not the TS image can be modelled purely by means of a contact-only mechanism.  I suspect to be the case, though it’s scarcely more than a hunch at the present time.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2014 at 12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-175935","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"Guys don’t get fooled!\nThe Beauchamp/Wilson shadow FAILS 3D TEST!\n\nTS on the left, Beauchamp/Wilson shadow on the right. \nThe distortions due to different illumination are obvious.

Look closely at the painting (lower, not upper half) and you should see that Jesus is no longer wearing a crown of thorns. Look a bit closer, and you will see that it is lying on the ground, left foreground. So what you see on the Shroud imprint (yes, clearly an imprint, NOT painting) is not, and cannot be a crown of thorns, since that would conflict with the logic and self-consistency of the artist’s visual ‘narrative’. Yes, there are dark regions on the head, both frontal and dorsal sides, but they do not extend outside the line of the hair., or if they do (frontal side) only marginally so,and open to alternative interpretation.  I would suggest that what the artist was showing there was not the crown, but the copious blood that flowed from the wounds, exactly as still visible on today’s Shroud image, with blood stains in the hair region, but NO crown of thorns, or the slightest hint that there ever was a crown of thorns.\nThere are one of two inconsistencies with the picture, notably the paucity of blood on the corpse (artistic sensibilities?) and presence of a complete upper torso image on the TS, despite the post 1532 burn holes that obliterated the shoulders. However, the latter should have been the cue not to place too much emphasis on the position of arms etc, given the artistic licence (measured and restrained) on display. Artistic licence probably accounts also for the artist’s decision to show a loin cloth  on the corpse, and thus on the TS imprint too, though interestingly visible as such on the dorsal side only, while failing to imprint on the frontal side (explicable in an artist’s eye view as imprinting better when assisted by body weight)  – imprinting, note, NOT applying paint from a palette.\nIt cannot be said too often, Charles: you are missing the point entirely. What the picture shows without any shadow of doubt is that the TS image was interpreted by that artist as a passive IMPRINT – not a painting, and with  blood – from nails, lance in side, flagrum, crown of thorns. \n So what produced that relatively homogeneous, monochrome, negative body image/imprint? Bodily perspiration aka sweat must surely be the most obvious explanation,and, more importantly, what the artist either assumed and/or wished to portray by linking the TS with the immediate aftermath of removal from the cross (before arrival at tomb and final preparations for interment).\nAm I the only one to be curious to know Dan’s reasons for cropping that picture? If I had to chose just one picture from thousands to illustrate 16th/17th century perceptions as to the likely origin of the TS double image, if only to counter Charles Freeman’s dud hypothesis, and maybe talk up my own real v pseudo-sweat imprint heresy, it would be that one (but necessarily COMPLETE and UNCENSORED!).\nHow many words does that make now obnoxie?\n\n","date":"December 13, 2014 at 2:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-176032","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"Here’s the caption that accompanied the picture on Stephen Jones’s site, October 2012:\n“Descent from the Cross with the Holy Shroud,” by Giovanni Battista della Rovere (c. 1575-c. 1640) or Giulio Clovio (1498–1578): Wikipedia.

However, they act as a powerful disincentive for for the authenticist cause, as they suggest that your views are wholly subjective and have little basis in actual observation. A passionate faith in the Shroud is an excellent thing (although one wonders what its subject would make of such invective) but unless it is controlled, it loses any scientific credibility. Is it any wonder that authenticists find themselves fighting a rearguard battle when one of their more authoritative spokesmen can do no better than that?\nThis is a pity, because you might have a valid point. However, as you have no idea what image Colin was using, your very precise “16-pixel smoothing for 306×72 pixel image” is mere guesswork.\nWhen I try to explore ImageJ I try to begin with the biggest image I can. I select the brighter of the della Rovere images above (I find a good one at http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_k-bPNZiL84A/SWTn3oN7FjI/AAAAAAAAATM/vwIRl6vP8lM/s1600-h/gbdrov.jpg) and enlarge it on my screen until the length of the Shroud almost fills the screen (I use a 13″ laptop). Taking a screengrab of that gives me an image of 1136 x 242 pixels. Feeding that into ImageJ and selecting the “Interactive 3D plot” option, I get a good 3D image with the following settings:\nGridsize: 512, Smoothing: 4.0, Scale: 3.0, z-Scale: 0.1, Max: 100%, Min: 0%.\nI agree that this image may be an artifact of the software, especially as the painting seems to be completely flat and without shading. However, if I carry out exactly the same procedure with the Shroud (using the image at http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_2wiki5.jpg), with a screengrab of 1168 x 292 pixels, and exactly the same settings, I get a remarkably similar picture. In neither picture did I make any adjustment to the colour, brightness, contrast or anything else.\nThe truth is that it would obviously be best if the Smoothing was zero, but the “noise” over the Shroud makes it almost unrecognisable in that case.\nSo is there any validity to your claim? Well, yes. I have also examined my two screen grabs with a Smoothness of zero, in which case the elevation above the background appears in both csses as a series of needlepoints, but this time I used the Spectrum LUT option, made the z-scale 0.5, and adjusted the Max and Min values in an attempt to discern different heights of the needlepoints. Amost all the della Rovere needlepoints appear the same height, while the needlepoints of the shroud image do indeed show a variety of heights, lower at the edges of the image and higher in the middle.\nBoth the VP-8 and ImageJ seem to have a smoothing function, which inevitably gives a slope even to sharp edges. Even at zero smoothing, the needle points in ImageJ appear as pyramids rather than rectilinear blocks. What we don’t know is how much smoothing has been applied to the VP-8 image; the observed curve of the legs and arms might be as much due to smoothing as to genuine image intensity. But then again, it may not.\n\n","date":"December 13, 2014 at 5:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-176154","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"Hugh:\nThis is a pity, because you might have a valid point.

As I observe this blog (and enter his own from time to time) I know that this a constant way he is doing this thing (and not only he).

(I also consider his standard recourse to thermal LUT mode instead of natural colour to be as often as not an unhelpful distraction, but that’s in passing). As I’ve said before, there are no rules. The mere fact that a 2D square can be turned into a shallow tile or a skyscraper should be sufficient to tell folk there are no rules, only judgements as to when  to stop the digital re-processing.\nMy rule of thumb, based on comparisons between 3D rendered images and scorch imprints AND their original templates, extended recently to comparisons between entirely 2D images (like that black square above, or my  colour-coded/BW relief maps, is this: go for minimalist processing, and make no claims that the result is real relief, merely apparent relief.\n“Correct” smoothing settings?  Well.I’ll say this for OK. He has introduced a handy term: “needle forest”. If one has no smoothing then on some images (not all) there is a needle forest due to height expansion being visible at the level of individual pixels. One can then carefully increase the smoothing by degrees so as to get rid of the needles, but go no further. That has been the way I use smoothing – empirically. Theoretical basis?  Never mind theory. There is no theory – just common sense. The smoothing control is needed to bring digitized information, strings of 0s and 1s into our everyday smoothed-off analogue world. It’s merely an extension of what we did in the pre-digital era with our experimental data points. If we had just a few we would display them as a bar chart. If there were scores of readings, then we felt justified in drawing a curve linking up mid-points of the bars. i.e. smoothing the data, converting it from discrete to continuous.\nHere for what it’s worth is a suggestion to all those, OK especially, who make regular use of ImageJ. Adopt as one’s internal standard a 2D graphic that has no 3D history . Always show what one’s current settings do to that 2D control. Is the APPARENT 3D-rendered result sensible?  Is it minimalist – as my 3D renderings are always minimalist these days, for the simple reason that I keep my settings as close as possible to ImageJ’s defaults, and when in doubt I ALWAYS run a check against some kind of internal standard.\nOK’s suggestion that I am a slave to a particular set of parameters is simply not true. It is total misrepresentation, especially with that allusion to my age. ImageJ stores one’s most recent settings and applies them initially when one returns days or weeks later with a new image. I inspect the result at those old settings, note their values, and then proceed to experiment with new settings as if using ImageJ for the very first time. It’s second nature for someone with a lifetime’s experience in scientific research to operate in this fashion, and to keep a record of all settings on the off-chance that someone will ask how one obtained one’s results, as TH did earlier, to which I responded with the relevant numbers. \nAs I said earlier, ImageJ is best viewed as an empirical (“suck it and see”) research tool. There is no need to portray it, as OK does, as some kind of secret garden open only to those who’ve passed his initiation tests. It’s there for everyone to use – cautiously, and with plentiful screen shots that capture one’s control settings for all to see or request.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2014 at 2:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-176234","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"In short, 16-pixel smoothing on 1000 pixel wide picture is safe, but on 72-pixel wide is not.\nThe point is not to remove the influence of convolving gaussian kernel entirely, only not to make it dominant feature of the 3D reconstruction -which happens if you use relatively high smoothing settings compared to the image size.

Comments welcome!”\nComments:\nI think it should primarily be considered that however the Shroud was created, the end objective was not to create a type of (accurate, detailed) 3-D projection when analyzed by modern technology.  It’s easy to work backwards and find conditions that render more appealing images, because the end result is the goal. \nI visited Kevin Moran one summer (who has a VP-8 in his garage) and brought along a few photos to try it out.  I tried to choose those that had prominent contrast, my top pick was the CD booklet/cover of the first Beatles album, Meet the Beatles, featuring black & white head shots.  3-D features were apparent (John was the best, the other three, in my opinion were mediocre-don’t know if they could be identified without knowing who they were), but it wasn’t great-some distortion in each of the four was evident.  The Shroud photos we placed looked identical to those in Heller’s book, collectively more detail was maintained throughout & more 3-D effect was obvious.\nThe caption under the “control” photo of William Ercoline in Heller’s book states regarding “gross distortion of all features and the two-dimensional quality” of other photos, that “the only exception is the Shroud”.  Overhyped?  I suppose it may be a matter of opinion-clearly, you can see 3-D effects of some sort in various artworks (bas-relief, painting) using this technique.  I took it to mean that the degree of detail is what makes it “unique”, not that it is an “absolute”, one of a kind in possessing any aspect of this characteristic.  I think most would agree if it isn’t a “unique” property, it’s certainly an interesting one. \n Difficult to imagine an artist, at least a painter, taking this into consideration, or even occurring via coincidence, particularly to such detail-of course, it may have only resulted after the paint had (relatively uniformly) flaked off, true appearance of the original being down the rabbit hole as it were; My own opinion is that it points more strongly to the cloth covering a three dimensional form (whatever one thinks this is).  Using software to convert light/dark flat circles into conical towers is impressive-it certainly isn’t apparent just looking at the flat shape, but I think even a skilled artist working a priori and with hand held equipment would have screwed it up somewhere, at some point-in the face, along the length of the body and some distortion/misalignment would be apparent.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2014 at 7:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-176477","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"I’ve now said all I wish to say on this thread.

The ‘contour lines’ are perhaps 5mm apart. Had they been 0.5mm apart, the face would have been much more recognisable and smoothing would have been unnecessary. However, what I was showing was that it is possible to create a 2D brightness/elevation image which, when converted with appropriate software, actually looks like a head. The Shroud image cannot be made to do this, as it stands; it is far too flat. \nThere are possible ways round this, as Mario has experimented with. If, for example, the Shroud 3D-Image were printed out by a 3D-printer in rubber, and the flexible sheet so printed were then curved (both longitudinally and latitudinally) over a solid oval template, then the resulting shape might resemble a head a little more. I imagine this is similar to what Soons and Downing were attempting digitally. There would be distortion of a different kind, but the overall shape would be a bit more realistic. This would be explained by authenticists in terms of the image being formed while the cloth was draped over the body, and not, as per Jackson and Piczek, horizontal. However then many of the distance measurements would be wrong, and the head have far too small a diameter to be a realistic image of a real person.\nYou are of course perfectly correct that it is easy to do all this with hindsight, and that even if it were a medieval creation, it is unlkely that the artist was thinking in terms of 2D-3D image visualisation (or, for that matter, the power of the negative image), but it is sometimes assumed that the “incredible accuracy” of the 3D possibility means that it would have been “impossible” for an artist to produce such an image. In fact, as we see, there is no “incredible accuracy” on that score, and so an artist cannot be ruled out on those grounds alone. There are, I agree, no contemporary parallels, but if a 13th/14th century artist did envisage a sheet covering a body and did create an image based on how he thought such an image may have come about, the rather crude an unrealistic 3D effect we actually see is just what he might have come up with.\nIf, on the other hand, the shroud was created by some form of emanation from a dead body, then so far (and Mario may well come up with an acceptable solution some day) the 3D image cannot be reconciled with any brightness/distance correlation yet proposed, without being considerably subjectively distorted to fit the preconception. I’m afraid I find Kelly’s last comment ironic. “I think even a skilled artist working a priori and with hand held equipment would have screwed it up somewhere, at some point-in the face, along the length of the body and some distortion/misalignment would be apparent.” To me, he did screw up, he did fail to appreciate a true brightness/distance correlation, and there is considerable distortion and misalignment, both in the face and along the length of the body.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2014 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-176656","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"Hugh, “To me, he did screw up, he did fail to appreciate a true brightness/distance correlation, and there is considerable distortion and misalignment, both in the face and along the length of the body.”\nCould you identify some of these places where brightness/distance correlation is not correct according to you?

If I ended up with something like the bottom image, I would realise I had not appreciated the true rightness/distance correlation, as the whole thing looks far too flat, more like a bas relief than a full sculpture.\nI have a great respect for your own paper “The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened” which I think illustrates that human body measurements are not badly distorted if a sheet is assumed to be draped, more or less as flat as it could be, but left to settle under gravity, but you do not address the brightness/distance correlation in that paper, by which all points of contact would be equally bright, and the sides of the cheeks (for example) would appear as high as the bridge of the nose. I think you were thinking of undertaking such a study, but have not heard how it progressed.\nGiven the wonders of digital imaging, it should be possible to create a digital body (rather as Ray Downing has done), drape, wrap or lay a digital Shroud over it (which appears in several animations), and then calculate, convert into a coloured dot and plot, the distance between the body and the sheet in hundreds of places. Would the image so obtained resemble the Shroud image?\n\n","date":"December 16, 2014 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-176936","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"Hugh, thanks for the images. I think I understand what you mean. \nThe Shroud image appears to have been substantially smoothed, but that is a peripheral point. \nInterestingly, if an artist would have done the first image, he/she would have made a major blunder. The second image appears as the real correct one and here is the reason. \nThe cloth is loosely draping the body. So, the cloth falls on each side of the head getting closer to the cheeks and the hair (top and sides). They should therefore appear closer, and they do on the second image. The way the cloth is draping the body must be taken into account, which the first image does not do.\nSo, I would say that, at first approximation without going through a lot of precise measurements, the Shroud image appears as the real correct one.\nYou wrote: “I have a great respect for your own paper “The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened” which I think illustrates that human body measurements are not badly distorted if a sheet is assumed to be draped, more or less as flat as it could be, but left to settle under gravity, but you do not address the brightness/distance correlation in that paper, by which all points of contact would be equally bright, and the sides of the cheeks (for example) would appear as high as the bridge of the nose. I think you were thinking of undertaking such a study, but have not heard how it progressed.”\nThanks for the compliment about my paper. \nThis is correct, I do not address specifically the brightness/distance correlation in a precise manner because it requires more advanced techniques than what I presented in that paper. I could calculate the horizontal flattening of what was underneath the cloth with the technique used in that paper but not the vertical cloth/body distance in a very precise way. Yes, I am planning of undertaking such a study of measuring this distance given some real cloth draping over a body and also simulate image formation using different diffusing assumptions.\nA body and cloth could be computer simulated, this is one clear approach. Cloth simulation is very tricky and only recently has the simulation techniques improved enough to the point of physical reality. The advantage, of cloth simulation, is the possibility of a large number of essays and variations of cloth draping and observe the result of the image produced. Using a real body and cloth should be done also to compare it to the results of the simulations. I have done some 3D scanning. This work is in progress. Lots of code need to be written to make this happen.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2014 at 12:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-177158","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Only the Shadow knows","post":"HF wrote:\n“I’m afraid I find Kelly’s last comment ironic. “I think even a skilled artist working a priori and with hand held equipment would have screwed it up somewhere, at some point-in the face, along the length of the body and some distortion/misalignment would be apparent.” To me, he did screw up, he did fail to appreciate a true brightness/distance correlation, and there is considerable distortion and misalignment, both in the face and along the length of the body.”\nProblem is how do you know what’s considerable-it’s extremely subjective in nature-morever, by any of the proposed authentic mechanism one wishes to believe in (Maillard, energy/light, other) do you really know that “considerable distortion & misalignment” would not exist in any of these cases?

But unless k is EXACTLY zero, both 10 and 2) scenarios are possible. Had k=0 this would be extreme coincidence (with, as I said, exactly ZERO probability for random occurence) indicating that the Universe is tuned by some Higher Power, whatever defined (God, or some higher laws of physics, whatever you prefer).\nPlanck, WMAP and other measurements can improve constraints on our cosmological parameters, assuming that our cosmology model is correct (so far it passes succesfully all the tests) -but cannot assure us with 100% certainity that the predictions of those models are correct.
