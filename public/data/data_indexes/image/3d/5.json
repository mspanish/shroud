I think it is very important to discuss halftone when using Ernie’s positive image.  The reversal film clearly  distinguishes the Shroud’s image by  dot amplitude modulation rather than screen builds. Ernie’s original negative which yields a positive print one can distinguish the screen values that are not present in the positive negative image that OK is using. \nIf you observe Durante’s image, the photo’s resolving power alone is not detailed enough to present  amplitude modulation but instead it resembles stochastic screening with trapping (overlays of color) to create the photo image. This is why it’s difficult to produce a 3D effect with ImageJ.\n“how can we scientifically define a 2D image having intrinsic 3D properties (“encoded” 3D data)?  \nI can only answer your question as an  enduser. By converting correlating screen values (distant to cloth as an example) to dots amplitude modulation and with displacement mapping you will achieve 3D rendering. Simple techniques can be see on youtube using “After Effects” and other rendering programs. \nThe question I have is how the amplitude modulation dots are abundantly centered on the linen without falloff giving the illusion of lensing which is why we have dots in the first place.\n\n","date":"October 3, 2015 at 4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-211726","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"I was given to understand, perhaps wrongly, that the orthochromatic film that Enrie used that accentuated dark and light would have created an artificial three:d effect, not seen , for instance, in the Durante photographs.

I can only deal with a few here, and even then I must ask readers to check my sources for themselves rather than have everything laid out for them.\n1) The halftone effect is largely a myth.\nOK’s attempt to demonstrate the representation of the halftone effect on the Shroud is made using a scanned halftone image from the cover of a book. Actually even that doesn’t work very well, but it is hardly surprising that a halftone image has a halftone histogram. Now look at Mark Evans’ micrographs side by side. In spite of different exposure and development, it is clear that the individual fibres on the darker parts of the Shroud image are darker than the individual fibres on the lighter parts of the image. The idea that all the coloured fibres are the same colour, and that the darkness of the image is achieved simply by massing more of them together is quite simply wrong. But don’t rely on me, check it for yourself by screengrabbing the micrographs from Shroud Scope and laying them side by side on a Word document or something similar. The differences are obvious.\n2) The ‘banding’ between the cheeks and the hair is largely a myth.\nOK claims that there are two bands of lighter warp threads on either side of the face, and removes them with some digital manipulation to achieve his wider and more ‘realistic’ image. I invite the reader to try to track these light warp bands upwards and downwards beyond the extent of the Shroud face. It can’t be done. The two light bands are not a feature of the cloth, but a part of the image, and should not be treated differently by darkening them up.\n3) OK’s comparison between my examples of 3D qualities and the Shroud is grotesquely unfair.\nIn Part 2, Slide about 18, OK places the Shroud and five examples of photos of forward facing faces lit from in front in a single group, and by manipulating ImageJ to suit the Shroud image as best it can, shows that the others are not as satisfactory as the Shroud image in 3D terms. This is disingenuous. Why manipulate all the images using the Shroud’s parameters? They are all differently lit and have different contrasts. If each of the photos is made the best of (as they were in the post where I originally posted them) then it is easy to see that they are at least as good as, or better, than the Shroud image.\nThat will have to do for now. OK’s paper is excellent in many ways, and is particularly ccommendable for its clarity, detail and references. It is, however, very selective as to its evidence, and few of its conclusions are altogether justified. Do try my ideas out for yourselves, however, before agreeing or disagreeing.\n\n","date":"October 4, 2015 at 5:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-211786","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"Hello Hugh, \nHere is my observation,\nThe original negatives were made from glass plates 40×50 cm; roughly, 15.75 x 19.7 inches. The plates were a very fine grain orthochromatic film designed for copywork due to it’s exceptional resolving power, high contrast, linear characteristics, visual development inspection and good dynamic range. The second generation negative  was made from duplicating the glass plate. I do not know what type of film was used but visually the film was  probably the same orthochromatic type used for his original photograph. Using the same type of film to create the negative image to produce a positive print greatly reduced the dynamic range giving the second generation print a “litho look”.   \n“This image (UPLOADED) was created from the Enrie’s full size enlargement made from the duplicate negative from the original glass plate. I applied noise filter only on the extreme shadows which ranged from 90% to 100% K reading”. \nAs you can see the image does resemble AM modulation varying in frequency sizes. If you zoom in and out you can see how the different frequency size effects the image. Again, this uploaded image is not from a offset publication scanned, but from the actual Enrie collection of BXW fiber base prints. \nIMHO, The problem I see with OK’s work is he demonstrating  his 3D hypothesis from a representation captured on silver and not from the actual Shroud. \n(SEE IMAGE)\nhttp://www.holyshroudguild.org/ok.html\n\n","date":"October 4, 2015 at 7:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-211794","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"Yes, Giorgio, your image is a really good one.

I know it has been around for many years dating back to 1979 when Fr. Filas used the half tone idea as an artifact (noise) that has to be removed in order to see the Lepton coin. \nWhat I found interesting in both first generation prints (Pos & Neg) from the Enrie’s collection is how the “image” falls off in density abruptly following the uniformity of the herringbone weave.  Without the herringbone weave as a substrate, the image would not appear like it is lensing (Based on the photos), which is why the dot patterns appear.  This tells me that 3 to 1 herringbone bone weave is very important for the image formation and if any other substrate (smoother in texture) was used, a more continuos tone would have appeared, diminishing the details we see on the Shroud.\nI do have in my possession some 35 mm slides of Mark’s close ups that were released to the Guild. Observing them, some densities follow the regression pattern (abrupt fall off in density based on the herringbone weave) seen on the Enrie’s image and some do not. But the problem I have is I don’t have an idea what the markings are. If they are the water stains, I would not expect them to have the same regression as the image formation. And if this is the case, it is possible a substrate (receptor) was added over the shroud to  help in the formation. The substrate concentrated on the highest ridges of the weave producing the lensing effect during the image formation.\nTo answer Charle’s question, Orthochromatic is not relevant to produce the 3d.  According to  a few color experts I associate with at work, they all agree that the 3d effect has to do with the lensing like appearance of Enrie’s prints.\n\n","date":"October 5, 2015 at 5:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-211819","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"I forgot to add that I might have came up with different observation if I only use Mark Evans images and never saw the Enrie’s.

A lot of good papers get lost nowadays in the flood.\nHugh:\n3) OK’s comparison between my examples of 3D qualities and the Shroud is grotesquely unfair.\nIn Part 2, Slide about 18, OK places the Shroud and five examples of photos of forward facing faces lit from in front in a single group, and by manipulating ImageJ to suit the Shroud image as best it can, shows that the others are not as satisfactory as the Shroud image in 3D terms. This is disingenuous. Why manipulate all the images using the Shroud’s parameters?\nIf you want, try yourself and show us results. I can assure they cannot produce 3D images on the order of accuracy of the Shroud.\n2) The ‘banding’ between the cheeks and the hair is largely a myth.\nOK claims that there are two bands of lighter warp threads on either side of the face, and removes them with some digital manipulation to achieve his wider and more ‘realistic’ image. I invite the reader to try to track these light warp bands upwards and downwards beyond the extent of the Shroud face. It can’t be done. The two light bands are not a feature of the cloth, but a part of the image, and should not be treated differently by darkening them up.\nThe bandings on the Shroud are real and evident. See:\n\nor http://shroud2000.com/ImageGallery/Set2/027_27.jpg\nSee also your own paper https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/banding.pdf The presence of lighter and darker bands is clearly visible on both Durante and Enrie, extending beyond image areas.\nHalftone:\nOf course the scanned image I used is not perfect, in that it is much overcontrasted. I put it here merely as demonstration. But has a very good spatial resolution, below single threads. Giorgio, that’s why I discourage using jpegs for comparisons (like the one you presented), as they filter out higher frequencies of the image for compression of the data. Thus micro details of the image (like individual threads color) are diluted. \nThe max practical resolution of the Shroud image is about 0.3 mm -the average Shroud thread diameter. This is the size of a single dot. As I demonstrated, it is easily possible to obtain realistic 3D rendering out of dots image I used, with the use of blurring filters. Without this, you get only a “needle forest” of peaks roughly the same intensity in the place of dots. That’s the halftone. And whether the color intensity of individual fibers is the same everywhere, or varies by a few percent around the cloth, is a secondary issue.\nMore later.\n\n","date":"October 6, 2015 at 11:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-211901","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"As a curiosity: magnifications  and histograms of several Shroud images: \nEnrie, scanned by me from Paul Badde’s book cover, bmpEnrie, presented by Giorgio, jpeg:Durante, obtained from Shroud Scope, saved as bmp:Unfortunately imgur seems to reduce the max resolution of those images.

However, the positive copy is made with the copy material in contact with the back of the original, rather than emulsion-to-emulsion, so it is blurred. After processing this blurred positive is replaced in contact with the back of the original negative. When light is passed through both negative and in-register positive (in an enlarger for example), the positive partially cancels some of the information in the negative.\nBecause the positive has been blurred intentionally, only the low frequency (blurred) information is cancelled. In addition, the mask effectively reduces the dynamic range of the original negative. Thus, if the resulting enlarged image is recorded on contrasty photographic paper, the partial cancellation emphasizes the high spatial frequency (fine detail) information in the original, without loss of highlight or shadow detail. The resulting print appears more acute than one made without the unsharp mask: its acutance is increased”. \nI define this definition above,  “apparent sharpness”.\nOffset prints have a high degree of  acutance. I’m assuming the cover that OK used was printed at either 133 dpi or 175.  That means there are either 175 or 133 halftone dots in a line per inch. By definition, an offset print at 133 or 175 dpi is far from high resolution. \nBut in his defense, I believe  OK is correct to state that the Shroud acts as a half tone. The results of the half tones do increase the image formation contrast and acutance. If the image mechanism produced a continuous tone, most of the body’s details would be lost.\n\n","date":"October 6, 2015 at 10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-211943","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"Hello Ok \nI would like to inform the you and the readers that the original file I have is over 1 gig raw RGB scanned.

You have spotted that my ears appear to be at the same level as my cheeks, and that the irises and pupils of my eyes are too sunken in, for example. However I do say that my photo is a much better 3D representation of a face than the Shroud is. \nSimilarly, I do not say that there are no bands on the Shroud. There clearly are. What I do say is that these bands are not bands of differently coloured threads. They are made up of the different shadows of the two different directions of herring bone ribs, of clusters of threads of different thicknesses, particularly at the spines of the herringbone. They do not indicate that the cloth is differently coloured, so that some sort of correction factor needs to be applied to make the image more accurate. All that is needed to observe this is to magnify them using Shroud Scope – or better still Shroud 2.0.\nFurthermore, a photo by transmitted light owes rather little to the colour of the cloth itself. Even if every single thread were exactly the same colour, a transmitted light image would still show bands, as the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the thickness of the threads, which vary quite a lot.\nIt is true that the fact that the Holland cloth is significantly banded (as can been seen by the bands appearing through the patches over the 1532 burn holes) and that those bands are clearly visible through the Shroud as well, does not preclude the possibility that the Shroud is also banded, but it does mean that the transmitted light photos cannot be used as evidence of that supposition.\nFinally, regardless of any of the photos or reproduction styles used, the half-tone hypothesis says that no image-bearing fibre on the Shroud image is lighter or darker than any other image-bearing fibre.

In case of the face, if you remove effect of their modulation, you will get much more flat and broader representation of the face. This is what we should have expected from body-cloth vs intensity relation regarding the sheet loosely wrapped around the face scenario.\nWith bandings modulation applied, the face looks much more face on photography-like, with its illusion of shadowing to create a visually attractive portrait. As you can see from transmitted light photographs, for example, the darker and brighter vertical bands are positioned in exactly right places to make emphasis on protrude, extended nose (due to its higher intensity on negative images), attenuated sides of the cheeks, left hair more intense (forward) than right (to give -a correct -impression of right tilt of the face).\nThis is very hardly a coincidence!\nFinally, regardless of any of the photos or reproduction styles used, the half-tone hypothesis says that no image-bearing fibre on the Shroud image is lighter or darker than any other image-bearing fibre.

I would expect a major difference in dynamic ranges when one compares offset reproduction vs continuos tone images.

So at the end of the day, we’re comparing reproductions that have no real relation with the Shroud.\nYou may be saying that, and the problem is our heuristics in our interpretation is what’s causing  the confusion.\nAs for your halftone hypothesis, I never doubted that. The halftones (AM) from the reproduction is what gives the unique lack of dynamic range causing a lensing effect. I do see lensing effects on many areas of Mark Evans images but the wider dynamic range from his photos  makes it harder to distinguish and the water stains will undoubtedly not have any correlation with the actual image making it harder to evaluate. \nIMHO, if the imaged substrate was not on the herringbone linen, Dan and I may not be hosting websites about the Shroud.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2015 at 7:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-211964","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"Giorgio. \nThe dynamic range is problematic (and actually largely irrelevant here), because each photography would have it different.

If Evans macro image was captured at the same focal distance in relations to the film size of Enries the severe reduction in the  resolving power would reduce the tonality forcing a contract build up that will resemble the AM modulation.

I come to this conclusion based on heuristic experience of over 40 years in film and digital industry and still at it. One might think that can be an advantage but in fact that may be my downfall.  I am entering this discussion with a preconceived notion why AM modulation exist based on years of experience with film and scan characteristics. However, I can be totally off base because there may be no relationship comparing my work and studies with this hypothesis. \nIf you observe my reconstruction simulation .png file which is not at all scientific, only being used to visually explain the hypothesis of AM modulation in the image.\nImportant to note, I used filters and curves to achieve the results of the background images of Dr. McCrone so I can simulate dynamic range and resolving power.\nThe image is divided in three panels. The first shows a Dr. McCrone macro photograph of the Shroud. The image shows blood on the left side and image formation on the right side. The background simulates the same image photographed (stepped and repeated)  at a further distance that would result in a major reduction in resolving power and dynamic range (that is why in my IMHO, any observation must include these factors). The background image is converted to black and white to achieve the lose of dynamic range more easily.  The center panel is the same as the left panel only inverted. The Right panel illustrates the mask in halftone, and a scanned positive fiber base print of the Enrie glass plate negative of the nose bridge. If you notice, the Enrie’s image seems softer than the mask image, but I can assure you, the Enrie’s resolution is far greater than the mask. Also very important to note is that the most predominate feature in the AM modulation is not the image but the shadow of the over lapping 3 to 1 threads that combines with the image if the characteristics are correct. So I conclude, based on my own preconceived notion,  that the  dot by dot body to cloth correlation is flawed, since the cloth is convex and concave.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2015 at 8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-212130","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"Giorgio:\nSo I conclude, based on my own preconceived notion, that the dot by dot body to cloth correlation is flawed, since the cloth is convex and concave.\nThe dot by dot body-cloth distance correlation makes no sense, because it would create a “needle forest”. You need to get smooth image, by blurring or averaging several neighbouring dots to get some 3D results.\nThe whole correlation approach is actually flawed, due to several reasons. I briefly analysed them in Part 2 (see Slides 10ff.). The first reason is that merely calculating correlation coefficient is not everything to describe 3D. And another reason is that its value can be biased, depending on the (non-representative) selection of body points taken for account. One weakness of Jackson & Jumper paper is that they took into account only 13 points. While this is enough to show there is some correlation, it still should be treated as preliminary result. Following claims about precise maximum range, for example, should be treated as overstretching of the results, beyond their reliability.\nI would like the viewer first read this quick explanation how we perceive images compared to still images. \nThis show us that while analysing Shroud images, we must eliminate influence of our subjective perception as much as possible. That’s why insist for example on using color scale (‘Thermal LUT’ mode) instead of merely rendering of the 3D shape. The scale is much more objective, although does not guarantee absolute objectivity. \nAnd another thing we should remember -the scale is relative, and not absolute. Uncalibrated. As I mentioned above, there is no max range reliably determined -we can clearly throw out 3.7 cm from Jackson&Jumper based on simple and little accurate linear regression on small sample. To get a reliable value of max range we need to build a model of body shape, determine how the linen wrapped it, determine the body-cloth distances, determine the relative intensity of corresponding areas (not merely points!), and compare the results. And go to the second and further iterations… Extremely laborous work.\nBut to make things even more complex, there is more. The image is not merely a body-cloth distance map. As I have shown, the intensities of several areas are modulated by bandings, and there are likely other effects at work.   \nThe body image of the Shroud is extremely,/B> sophisticated and complex. Not some kitchen science Joe Nickell, Luigi Garlaschelli or Colin Berry could make. Negative image composed of several halftone dots, amplitude modulated, with isotropic distribution, resulting in apparent 3D effect corresponding to the body shape, with no contours and boundaries, composed of several bundles of surface colored outermost fibers on the surface threads. Add to this operating by bandings modulation, inherent to the cloth due to the diferently bleached yarn batches, for the purpose to give the body figure (and particularly face) a more visuallly attractive apparent look. Incredible mastery.\nThe fact is that the Shroud body image fools our eyes. It was meant to do so. The body image shows us details (like nose swelling for example), that technically are not there. The Creator of the Shroud plays jokes with our perception. He wants us to perceive the image in appropriate way. He watches whether we resolve His riddles, for example about correct position of the Man’s of  the Shroud hair. Whether we are smart enough to play His game.\nDiddly Squat:\nWe quickly realize that the notion about some sort of body-cloth distance is the epitome of begging the Circulus in Probando question, “it is so because I think it is so”.\nOMG we don’t know jack about 3D and body-cloth distance. Everything done in Padua and Colorado is based on this odd bit of imagination posing as science.\nBut in the science 90 % of it is actually such a “Circulus in Probando” approach! And it’s no problem! Had you any experience in this field, you would know that! For example: why there is a periodic shift in radial velocity of a star? Because there is an extrasolar planet in orbit around it! Why there is extrasolar planet around some star? Because there is a periodic shift in radial velocity of that star!…\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy\nIt is what we call a working hypothesis. We assume some explanation of a phenomena, and test its reliabilty, as well as explanatory power. We test also other, alternative hypotheses. If a working hypothesis works, we stick to it, otherwise we adopt some alternative explanation.\nIn the case of the Shroud and 3D effect, we suppose that there is a relation between image intensity and the distance between the cloth and supposed body wrapped within it. The data show that this is clearly a case, definitly there is such a relation.\nBut I cannot in absolute manner prove that such relation hasn’t been faked and there has been no body wrapped within a sheet at all. Similalry, I cannot prove in absolute manner that such a periodic shift in a star’s radial velocity is due to the interaction between it and planet(s) orbiting it (and not due to some other effects). All I can do, is to test this hypothesis, and test alternative solutions to the problem.\nSo far, all attempts to “fake” the body-cloth vs intensity relation of the Shroud, have failed.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2015 at 4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-212160","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"OK –In the case of the Shroud and 3D effect, we suppose that there is a relation between image intensity and the distance between the cloth and supposed body wrapped within it.\nI am fully agreeing with you OK.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2015 at 5:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-212167","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?","post":"Fair enough.

How do you explain that the banding appears when the stitches alternate.  Are you saying that every time the threads alternate in different directions  the threads are from a different lots, or they have been naturally bleached many years later because of the diverging symmetrical angles? \nI believe there is so much more to this than we’re anticipating.
