Holography experiments.   I am very close to being able record a interference pattern on linen that would match many of the Shroud image characteristics.\nShroud Image and Hologram Image Match Points\n1. Both images are extremely superficial, thin depth image  (1/50th thickness of human hair)\n2. Both have good resolution\n3. Both have 3D Qualities to Image\n4. Both images cannot be seen from the back side\n5. Both have light coming from only 1 direction to form image\n6. Both images fade and or vanish when tilted to the far right or far left\n7. Both are a single color image\n8. Both images involve subject close to film plate to capture image (past 5cm there is no image formation on a reflection hologram)   (I know because I tried it)","date":"July 20, 2015 at 8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/18/blow-your-mind-3d-scanning-technology-and-what-it-could-mean/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-206243","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blow Your Mind 3D Scanning Technology And What It Could Mean","post":"I like the number 1128 and finally it add up to 3.\nYes some sort of electromagnetic waves were involved in creating the image on the shroud and it came out from the body.\n\n","date":"July 21, 2015 at 4:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/18/blow-your-mind-3d-scanning-technology-and-what-it-could-mean/","cat":"3d","id":"comment-206260","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blow Your Mind 3D Scanning Technology And What It Could Mean","post":"Hi Sampath!\nThe English Gematria Calculator witness says \nJesus of Nazareth =1128\nShroud of Turin=1128\n3D Hologram on a Mantle= 1128\nThe English Gematria Calculator does not care if the Shroud is genuine or not, could care less if Jesus rose from the dead or not.
