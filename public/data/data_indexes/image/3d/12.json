It is worth a quick read at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap . Heightmap is better than heightfield. \nThe work you suggest needs to be done. Unfortunately the best images belong to the Archdiocese of Turin (12.8 billion-pixel HAL 9000 image) and aren’t available to the public or to those with the skill to do the work like Ray Schneider. \nAnd lets stop living in the past. The VP8 is not up to the work that needs to be done. Don’t get me wrong, what Jackson and Jumper did was amazing with what was available in 1976.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 10:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23241","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image","post":"If this is the shroud, then I’d like to know either, what have you done with the nose to flatten it out so thoroughly, or what has everybody else (including the VP8) done with the nose to make it so prominent?\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23251","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image","post":"(1) As I understand it (e.g. Wilson’s description in “Turin Shroud” 1978) Jumper & Jackson draped a cloth over an Air Force colleague with a similar physique to the TSM.  They then measured his cloth-body distance (normal or vertical??) and obtained an exact match with micro-densitometer readings on a true Shroud negative.  I am under the impression that that is the fundamental experimental basis for asserting that the luminance provides an accurate 3-D height-map for the image.  I imagine that more rigorous experiments may have been carried out since then with better equipment.  However to obtain a true contour map, I should think that it would be necessary to add the height of the draped cloth at its various points, to the z coordinate.  Although J & J seemed to think that there “was only one true way” of draping the cloth, clearly there’s some scope for variation in the height of the cloth.  The bronze statue cast by sculptor Luigi E Mattei at the Pontifical Institute of Notre Dame of Jerusalem centre and shown on this site recently seems fairly persuasive evidence, even allowing for some artisitic licence.  .  \n(2) As Gabriel hints at above, the fact that there is this correlation between cloth-body distance and luminance, must say something about the image-forming process.  I am thinking that if it is a chemical process for instance, then the gas(?) molecules as they are emitted from the body are perhaps inherently unstable, and in the time they take to arrive at the cloth are partly converted to their stable form with various concentrations depending on the distance they’ve traveled, resulting in the different intensities of luminance, and the consequential correlation with cloth-body distance.  Does this make sense?\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 3:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23255","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image","post":"Jumper and Jackson found that the VP8 image of the whole body was very unsatisfactory, looking distinctly “flat and stiff.” They made a full size physical replica of the VP8 image out of cardboard sheets, however, and by comparing its profile to that of a volunteer (in 18 places along the midline) they were able to derive the distortions to the x-y plane necessary for the z distances (derived from their intensity/cloth-body graph) to look more real. Draping a real cloth over a real body showed how similar their derived cloth was to possible actuality, but that part of their experiments was totally subjective. No measurements were made from the body of a volunteer to the surface of a cloth. It would be possible, I think, using a cloth of fine netting, through selected holes in which a thin probe, marked in millimetres, could be inserted, but to my knowledge this has never been done. Jumper and Jackson’s paper is an absolute model of scientific reticence and, as I said before, they are at pains to point out how far their results are from any ‘exact match.’ Here is an example of their meticulous prose: “These results demonstrate that the Shroud image has a 3-D characteristic in that image shading correlates with the distance between two surfaces, one of which can be interpreted as a body shape and the other as a cloth draping over that body shape.” Perfect.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 7:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23271","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image","post":"No need to use a probe etc. What is needed: a large scale 3D scanner. You scan the body laying down then drape it with a cloth and redo the scanning. So you get two scanned surfaces. You then measure thousands of distance body-cloth by measuring, using a computer, the distance between the two surfaces. That operation should be done for several draping.The caveat: 3D scanning of full body is expensive.\n\n","date":"February 3, 2013 at 12:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23284","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image","post":"I have just downloaded the original full paper by Jackson and Jumper of 1984 from my institution’s library. To my surprise, the widely extended idea that there is a correlation between cloth-body distance and image intensity is based on a very reduced sample: 13 measurement points only! The authors recognize this and state that 1700 points should be needed to clearly establish a mathematical model describing the exact nature of the relationship between distance and intensity of the image. While the fact that the image shows 3D properties clearly indicates that some kind of relationship exists and intensity attenuation of the image takes place (no doubt at this point), the exact nature of this relationship may represent an important step forward because some mechanisms (energetic fields, radiation, diffusion, laminar flow) and their change with distance, exhibit very particular mathematical profiles. Really surprising that after so many years -to the best of my knowledge- no complementary research has been done in this line!\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 8:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23273","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image","post":"the scorch theory might also account for the image intensity variation?  if the cloth had been laid over a hot bas relief then the protruding elements like the nose could press more firmly into the cloth,compared to less protruding elements,therefore creating higher intensity image.\n\n","date":"February 3, 2013 at 12:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23283","author":"matthias","site":"shroudstory"}]
