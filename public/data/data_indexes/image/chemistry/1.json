[{"title":"A possible new approach to learning more about the chemical make-up of the Shroud’s image","post":"To summarise: it would be difficult, perhaps well-nigh impossible, to discover how the imaging process has altered the surface carbohydrates of the Shroud. The chemistry is too complex – especially if as seems probable the tan-coloured image consists of high-molecular weight condensation polymers. There is an alternative strategy – which is to obtain profiles of unaltered carbohydrates, and to deduce (by comparison with non-image areas) which classes of carbohydrates have been modified. The technology to do that exists, although it will  be destructive.\nOne could speculate that it is the chemically more reactive (5-carbon) pentosans of the primary cell wall that are modified, with the  chemically-stable more ordered cellulose fibres being largely unaffected. \nXylan polymers might de-polymerise, releasing free xylose that then dehydrates to furfural, the latter then oxidising and polymerising via condensation reactions to give the yellow and tan products (see the Comments above for details).\n","date":"October 14, 2013 at 5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/a-possible-new-approach-to-learning-more-about-the-chemical-make-up-of-the-shrouds-image/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2296","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
