[{"title":"Why are the ‘radiationists’ still plugging their imaginary physics and chemistry?","post":"Well, I’m no expert in bleaching or ageing chemistry, Hugh, but have encountered two quite different types of chemistry in my career  that might be contributory  factors. Where yellowing of paper and linen is concerned, it’s reckoned to be the woody lignin that is responsible, being prone to oxidation to yellow phenolic compounds. Being such a slow process, it would work with ordinary ground state (triplet) oxygen with unpaired electrons making it relatively inert (surprisingly so).\nIn contrast, bleaching of yellow organic material under sunlight is a rapid process, and probably involves activated singlet oxygen with paired electrons. Singlet-state oxygen adds readily across conjugated double bond systems. By interrupting the conjugation that absorbs blue light frequencies (giving the yellow colour) the end-result is bleaching – though how permanent is anyone’s guess.\nAtmospheric oxygen looks simple when written as O2, but it is a sly old customer, due to surreptitious promotion of electrons to higher energy orbitals when it encounters other often innocent-lookiing substances. Oxygen is a fickle friend. Keep taking the antioxidants…\n","date":"February 4, 2013 at 11:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/why-are-the-radiationists-still-plugging-their-imaginary-physics-and-chemistry/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1829","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Why are the ‘radiationists’ still plugging their imaginary physics and chemistry?","post":"Every now and then, having nothing more pressing on my mind, I wonder about the expression “Yellowed with age” which is invariably used as an overall description of the shroud. It came to my mind most recently when I was reading about that chap (sorry, chap, I forget your name but mean no disrespect) who painted a face on glass and exposed his shroud to sunlight. He found that far from yellowing, sunlight actually bleached the shroud, making it whiter, not yellower, than it was before. So what does happen to old linen? And by what mechanism? Heating it, of course, according to Pellicori and Miller, not only turns linen a very pale yellow but also quite fluorescent, exactly like the shroud. But what about ‘age’?\n","date":"February 4, 2013 at 11:27 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/why-are-the-radiationists-still-plugging-their-imaginary-physics-and-chemistry/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1828","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"}]
