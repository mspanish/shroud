[{"title":"Resurrection:  What happens with quantum entanglement?","post":"One of the problems with some Christians  including many Popes is that they are continually insisting on faith as independent from science. It isn’t. Some scientists now posit the brain as an kind of quantum computer and that conscience thought are in fact a non-local process – another phrase for quantum entanglement.\nI believe that love is a quantum entaglement of consciousnesses. Fifty years ago Tennessee Williams stated in an interview with Mike Wallace: The most important moments of life are when we break out of our own egostical shell and really sense the rpesence of another person. I thpought then that he was defining love. I think now, science is catching up with Williams. Time for religion to do the same.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2013 at 5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/23/resurrection-what-happens-with-quantum-entanglement/","cat":"science","id":"comment-34420","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resurrection:  What happens with quantum entanglement?","post":"But it is independent from science.

Gould felt that there was non-overlapping magisteria.Yet, he was open-minded, went to the Vatican when called, encouraged in this approach by Sagan, and both of them were secular Jews. It is therefore somewhat early to depend entirely on what quantum physics and evolution have to say.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2013 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/23/resurrection-what-happens-with-quantum-entanglement/","cat":"science","id":"comment-34518","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resurrection:  What happens with quantum entanglement?","post":"Angel says:\nPerhaps Jesus utilized anti-gravity at the resurrection.\nThe US Military has a fleet anti-gravity spaceships, disk shaped and cigar shaped. that disappear.
