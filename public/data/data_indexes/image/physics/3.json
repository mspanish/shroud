Welcome to the site.\nPerhaps we could deal with those issues one at a time. \nPray codex?\nFar from having “forgotten” the Pray Codex, I’ve commented on it extensively in the past, and been given a rare compliment too Across The Way:\nhttp://shroudstory.com/2012/06/22/pray-manuscript-thank-you-colin-and-david-mo/\nMost of my detailed reasons for rejecting any connection between the TS and Codex are not in this site, but another that I set up for addressing more contentious issues.\nhttp://strawshredder.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/preliminary-opinion-on-that-pray-codex-that-is-supposed-to-show-the-shroud-of-turin/\nI’ve also placed a lot of comments on that other site, e.g. \nhttp://shroudstory.com/2012/06/02/a-masterly-demolition-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/\nhttp://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/\nTake away message (in brief): what Mechthild Flury-Lemberg and others interpret as the shroud, with a herringbone weave and L-shaped poker holes is nothing of the sort. It is the rigid lid of a sarcophagus propped up at an angle. The pattern on the lid is a stepped pyramid, probably intended to represent a mosaic of some kind, and the little circles form  L-shapes more by accident than design (and why would an illustrator want to show burn holes on Joseph of Arimathea’s newly acquired acquired length of expensive linen?).  The illustrator makes liberal use of little circles in the other line drawings too. There is some fabric sitting on that lid, possibly a nominal shroud, or less probably the separate head cloth.\nSorry, I think that Codex connection is fanciful bunkum, and it’s unscientific anyway to focus on a single picture in an obscure codex that just happens to have so-called points of correspondence when there’s even a lack of internal consistency between the 4 pictures in the series.\nI’ll wait to hear your reply before addressing your other points.\n","date":"February 26, 2014 at 7:08 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/is-the-man-on-the-turin-shroud-a-pseudo-negative-imprint-from-a-death-mask-could-that-be-why-the-modern-day-photographic-negative-looks-so-much-better-than-the-original/","cat":"corona_discharge","id":"comment-3132","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Is the Man on the Turin Shroud a pseudo-negative imprint from a DEATH MASK?

That doesn’t sound credible to me. I know you are interested in the science more so that history and psychology, but credible theories on the shroud require both science AND history\nAgain I’m not a scientist so would be interested in your answer as a science bod.

(Could that be why the modern-day photographic negative looks so much better than the original?).","post":"Is there not some double think about the ease of visibility of the image on the Shroud? When one suggests that it is a scorch, one is told that the Shroud image is far too faint and superficial to be a mundane scorch.  Yet when it comes to explaining the embarrassing  gap in the Shroud’s history between the 1st and 14th century AD we are told that for part of that period at least it was on display as the Mandylion, albeit face only,  inspiring and informing generations of artists as to the “real” appearance of Christ (beard, moustache, long hair etc). So the image was considered intense enough to warrant framing and displaying as the Mandylion, but not intense enough to have been produced by a resourceful manufacturer of made-to-order medieval icons. Yet another instance methinks of everlasting cake – the kind that can be saved yet devoured simultaneously.\nSeriously I have no insights into the question as to why things look the way they do, centuries after their first appearance. Certainly the initial image may have faded, due maybe to addition of active oxygen species (hydroxyl, hydroperoxy free radicals, singlet oxygen etc) across conjugated diene chromophores, resulting in less intense absorption of blue light, less yellow colour.  (I have found that 6% w/v hydrogen peroxide solution can bleach the faintest scorches – but not the more intense ones). Alternatively, as some have suggested, as the the linen itself yellows with age, there is correspondingly less contrast between image and non-image areas.\nIf as I believe the Shroud image was originally intended to convey graphically the idea of a hot corpse leaving its signature on linen (you may place whatever construction you wish on who was depicted, and the mechanism of imprinting) then the artist may well have aimed for a light as scorch as possible – while still visible from a few paces. Why? Because as I have suggested before, the crucial consideration may have been the need for ambiguity – because ambiguity generates an air of mystery.  If the scorch is too intense, folk would simply dismiss it as a hot-metal brand. Make it too faint and they won’t see it. Make it sepia-coloured, and folk will ask themselves: am I seeing a faint scorch from heat? Or is it a faint STAIN from some kind of chemical interaction between a corpse and cloth. \nIf ambiguity was deliberate, as I suspect, then it was spectacularly successful, given that radiation versus contact-scorching versus chemical Maillard reactions are still being discussed as alternatives to this day, some 660 years after the first recorded display in a remote French village in 1355. (Doesn’t say a great deal for STURP/STERA probing, does it?). One thing’s for certain. The image must have been intense enough to attract pilgrims in 1355, willing to part with money in order to take back home with them the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge… But the badge does NOT show the classical image of the crucified Christ, or even a typical Christ-like figure.  What it does show is a matter of conjecture… I say it is that of a tortured Knight Templar, before or after slow-roasting, as was the ignominious fate of Jacques de Molay, Geoffroi de Charney and others whom we now describe as the last of the Knights Templar.\n","date":"September 3, 2012 at 11:16 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/is-the-man-on-the-turin-shroud-a-pseudo-negative-imprint-from-a-death-mask-could-that-be-why-the-modern-day-photographic-negative-looks-so-much-better-than-the-original/","cat":"corona_discharge","id":"comment-588","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Is the Man on the Turin Shroud a pseudo-negative imprint from a DEATH MASK?

I am compelled by much of your theory, but the fluorescence is an outstanding question. I am not a scientist and have no connection to scientists. As I said, I do not expect the pro-authenticity crowd to test the theory, as an answer consistent with your theory would obviously undermine their case (conversely, of course, an answer hostile to your theory would do them great good!). You have an opportunity here  to really underline the strength of your argument, and perhaps get close to putting the final nail in the coffin of the pro-authenticity crowd’s argument.\nI think the question of fluorescence is an important one – for me the answer would probably get me off the fence either to the pro or anti authenticity camp.\nPerhaps you could “name a name” in terms of someone who has access to a UV excimer laser.

(That for the uninitiated is the so-called “Shroud of Turin Education and Research Association”).\n Call me old-fashioned or a science snob if you like, but I don’t think it is the job of a photographer-cum-copyright hoarder to be dictating the scientific agenda, even if he does now delude himself into thinking that 30 years of association with the Shroud  now makes him a scientist. If he were a scientist, he would not be bandying around the issue of fluorescence knowing and caring nothing about the origin of the phenomenon, and merely content to use it as an errant Scud missile to demolish my case for scorching. (You can find his comments on sidekick- Porter’s site – made back in February as I recall). \nThere is no case to answer as far as I am concerned, since it is based on the false premise that if a 1532 burn mark that produced full thickness charring generates fluorochromes, notably benzenoid aromatics,  then so should any thermal process that produced the Shroud image, no matter how superficial in comparison. If that is the view of Barrie Schwortz and others who deploy pseudo-science in defence of authenticity, then let THEM do the necessary experiments with graduated temperatures. \nFor my part I refuse to be drawn into phoney arguments that have no scientific underpinning. The key question, as far as I am concerned, is the precise chemical nature of the tan-coloured chromophores,  and whether they are modified linen carbohydrates per se or impurities.  The priority is to initiate long-overdue  model studies, starting initially with plain linen (without those Pliny additives that so fixated Raymond Rogers!) which is then progressively heated and pyrolysed, monitoring the changes using as wide a range of physical and chemical methods as possible, and (Shroud custodians willing) comparing with the image on the Shroud.  If a match can be found that stands up to close scrutiny, with no quarter given to those who attempt to dismiss on trivial or pseudo-scientific grounds, then perhaps an answer can be found to the question: how could the Shroud image have been produced in medieval times, corresponding to the radiocarbon dating? \nI am now 99% confident that those experiments will produce an answer, with the rider that fluorescence will play a minor role if any in defining the precise conditions needed to produce the Shroud image.\nAt the risk of repeating myself, the energy source will be verified as being thermal, more specifically heat conduction (NOT electromagnetic radiation of any kind) requiring DIRECT CONTACT (no air gap) with a hot object to be precise. The temperature will be just sufficient to produce a faint and superficial scorch on the crowns of the weave, possibly modifying cellulose fibrils, but more likely to involve selective pyrolysis of PCW-associated hemicelluloses (xyloglucans etc).\nAgain, thank you for your interest Matthias.

Yes I know he was burnt at the stake, hence maybe giving someone the idea of scorching his image onto a cloth. I’m just finding it hard  to reconcile what is a good theory of yours with the actual reason why it would be done.\nIt really would be good if someone could do further research on the fluorescence issue. You couldn’t pursue this further?\nI think your theory really needs to be tested further. If lighter scorches don’t fluoresce then we can truly say your theory stacks up very favourably. If they do, then it might be time to move on from your scorch theory.\nIs there not a scientist’s arm you could pull?

The customary challenge to us science bods is to come up with an explanation as to HOW it was done, not why it was done. The latter is best left methinks to psychologists, medieval psychologists to be more precise, assuming any exist.\nNope, I’m not rising to the challenge on the fluorescence issue either. There one is up against the time-honoured human predilection to have one’s cake and eat it. I refer to the constant taunts that come my way that a scorch does not meet the criterion of superficiality (less than 200nm thick we are told). When I say that a scorch can be as superficial as one wishes, right down to the limits of detection by the human eye, back they come and say that my scorch HAS TO BE fluorescent, just like the (non-superficial) 1532 burn marks. Methinks they need to be consistent if they wish to be taken seriously. Constantly ducking and diving  simply to score sparring points may help pass the time of day on internet forums, but it ain’t science – or even serious debate.\nRepeat: I say that the Shroud image is a highly-superficial scorch, far too superficial to show fluorescent properties. If there are those who dislike my position, then all they need do for starters is prove me wrong on the fluorescence. But the kind of people who have access  to uv excimer lasers (naming no names!) can surely beg, borrow or steal a decent uv source, with variable wavelength control. Speaking for myself, I have no intention of embarking on half-baked experiments with £30 second hand equipment bought off eBay anytime soon…\n","date":"September 2, 2012 at 9:31 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/is-the-man-on-the-turin-shroud-a-pseudo-negative-imprint-from-a-death-mask-could-that-be-why-the-modern-day-photographic-negative-looks-so-much-better-than-the-original/","cat":"corona_discharge","id":"comment-581","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Is the Man on the Turin Shroud a pseudo-negative imprint from a DEATH MASK?

Matthias. \n“We find in France, then, as part of this elaborate cult of the dead the practice of forming a death mask of the deceased king. Nor did the death mask serve directly to hand down to posterity the features of a great man. The death mask is simply a technical aid in modelling the face of the effigies. It is this, the wax image of a living man, contrasting strangely with the mortal remains of the dead, which interests alike the artist and the public.\nBut the death mask is a mere by-product in the concern of the survivors for the dead. It was not till the beginning of the fifteenth century that the grasp of reality was accepted as the aesthetic norm in the artistic production of Europe. It is therefore almost safe to assert that we shall not meet with the death mask before that period.\nIn fact it is on the death of Charles VI. of France in 1422 that we first hear how Maitre Francois d’Orleans, court painter since 1408, made a death mask, as well as models of the hands and feet, from the corpse for the purpose of a magnificent image. Thus it is possible to prove by means of written records the use of the death mask in the preparations for the strange funeral ceremonies of all French kings of the Quattrocento, with the sole exception of Louis XI. (1461-83).”\nhttp://www.undyingfaces.com/info/death-mask-history/\nSo there are two crucial points. Firstly, death masks did not really become acceptable until the “start of the 15th century”, which is some 50 years after the first reported exhibition of the Shroud in Lirey, and then for royalty only. But that was on account of a shift in cultural norms we are told, in which folk gradually became accustomed to the shock value of a replica taken from a deceased individual.\nSo while it might appear at first sight that a Shroud image produced via a death mask replica was somewhat before its time, though not greatly, let’s not forget that it was not the 3D or semi-3D death mask per se that was on display, but simply a faint 2D sepia image that while recognizable as a man, and probably a deceased one, had little or none of the ghoulish quality of a 3D death mask.\nIn fact, it is not that the technology did not exist prior to the 15th century. The technology for producing a death mask  had been in existence for millennia, it being used by goldsmiths and bronze-makers etc, for example, to produce accurate replicas of things like plants, animals, people.\nNote that I am thinking of the Shroud having first been produced as a tribute to a Templar martyr, maybe a nuanced tribute but with no overt attempt to hoodwink. If on the other hand it had been a medieval forgery, i.e. intended to be accepted from the word go as Christ’s burial Shroud (which I think improbable in view of the understated Lirey badge) then I doubt that the forger would have been unduly bothered by the charge that he was exhibiting an anachronistic indifference to the cultural or artistic norms of his era … As I say, the death mask was probably just an intermediary stage… with few pilgrims so much as suspecting that it had played a key role…\n","date":"September 1, 2012 at 2:25 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/is-the-man-on-the-turin-shroud-a-pseudo-negative-imprint-from-a-death-mask-could-that-be-why-the-modern-day-photographic-negative-looks-so-much-better-than-the-original/","cat":"corona_discharge","id":"comment-575","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Is the Man on the Turin Shroud a pseudo-negative imprint from a DEATH MASK?
