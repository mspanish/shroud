Mueller's 1982 article in Skeptical Inquirer (without referencing where it came from) which claimed (falsely) that Nickell's bas relief powder rubbing method can duplicate the Shroud!In fact McDowell used the same fallacious having-it-both-ways argument as Nickell, citing approvingly Bishop d'Arcis' claim that the Shroud was \"painted\" and also citing approvingly Nickell's implied claim that the Shroud is a bas relief powder rubbing! >whom is not a scientist or a chemist or physicist or has any training in any fields which would allow him to make any educated remarks about the Shroud. Agreed, but Nickell is a gifted writer, who to the man in the street who doesn't know much about the Shroud, sounds convincing.But Nickell is self-deceived through his mind having being taken captive to the philosophy (Col 2:8) of Naturalism, i.e. the philosophical position that \"nature is all there is: there is no supernatural.\"He is an example of `the blind leading the blind' (Mt 15:14).>Yet people keep quoteing his writings. Again, that's because Nickell tells secular people what they want to hear. Who have neither the time or the inclination to check what he claims.>Maybe if they would just check his credentials against those of authors of dozens of peer-reviewed papers, minds might change a bit about the Shroud's authenticity.Most people, including so-called `skeptics', haven't got the time or inclination to read the Shroud pro-authenticity web articles and books, let alone peer-reviewed journal papers. >It's truly dumbfounding.It is all part of the Plan: Isa 14:26 NIV \"This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations.\"The One whose image is on the Shroud has told us that it is His purpose to let the weeds grow with the wheat until the harvest:Mt 13:27-30. 27 And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, `Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?' 28 He said to them, `An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, `Then do you want us to go and gather them?' 29 But he said, `No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'\"when they will be separated by Him into their respective eternal destinations.The Nickell's of this world think they are destroying Christianity, when all along they are unwittingly obeying it!Stephen E.

There is no blood image. The blood is REAL blood.And as red ochre making up the body image, McCrone COULD NOT have legitimately said that because he only examined STURP's sticky tapes which were taken only from NON-IMAGE areas.McCrone found what he was looking for-isolated particles of red ochre and vermilion on STURP's sticky tapes of NON-IMAGE areas and he UNSCIENTIFICALLY: 1) extrapolated from those isolated red ochre and vermillion particles on sticky tapes from NON-IMAGE areas of the Shroud, that the blood is comprised of vermillion pigment and the body IMAGE must be comprised of red ochre; and 2) did not consider alternative explanations for the red ochre and vermillion that it was left behind on the Shroud when artists pressed their copies of the Shroud to the Shroud to confer a blessing on their copies.>And he found no pigment on the non-image areas. If that were the case then he would have found no pigment AT ALL because McCrone never went to Turin with STURP to examine the Shroud itself. ALL that McCrone had for study was STURP's sticky tapes, and STURP was not permitted to, and did not, press their sticky tapes to image areas of the Shroud. >I realize that these results were not peer reviewed, but if he is wrong, it seems like a rookie mistake...McCrone signed a STURP agreement that he would only publish his findings in peer-reviewed scientfic journals, as other STURP findings were, but he reneged and published them in his own journal, The Microscope and in the media. Why? The answer must be because he knew deep down that his findings would not survive peer-review because they were WRONG.  McCrone was an atheist/agnostic and extremely biased against the Shroud's authenticity. In 1981, AFTER he had examined STURP's sticky tapes and handed them back he made the most unscientific admission: \"I believe the shroud is a fake, but I cannot prove it.\" (McCrone, W.C., in Murphy, C., \"Shreds of Evidence,\" Harper's Magazine, November, 1981, pp.42-65, pp.54-55).So even McCrone admitted that his finding red ochre and vermillion on sticky tapes from NON-IMAGE areas of the Shroud did not prove it was a fake. And HOW then did McCrone KNOW that the Shroud was a fake? >which only leaves the option that he lied, since he was a highly respected microscoptist. Not necessarily. It could mean that he so much WANTED the Shroud to be a fake that he went BEYOND the scientific evidence available to him and AGAINST the scientific evidence of other STURP scientists.>This is certainly possible, but I don't like to make an assumption that a scientist is fabricating data. You are now arguing against a straw man that YOU have created. I do not claim that McCrone \"lied\" just that he was so biased against the Shroud's authenticity that he went beyond the limited evidence available to him and did not consider alternative explanations.[continued]\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"January 9, 2013 at 10:20 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/05/you-state-that-there-is-no-paint-dye-or.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nYou state that `there is no paint, dye or pigment on the Shroud that forms its image' but it is claimed that `the Shroud contains red ochre and other paint pigments'\n","post":"\n\n[continued]>It sounds like STURP scientist are cliaming that yes, there are paint particles, but they don't form the image. Correct.>Are they also claiming that there are only red ochre and red vermillion, or do they claim that multiple pigments are visible? No. STURP found a lot of isolated particles on the Shroud, but they were not more concentrated in the image areas than the non-image areas. And particles that COULD form the image, like a particular paint, pigment or mixture of same, would have to be ONLY, or at least HIGHLY, concentrated in the image area for it to form the image. And they aren't. Proof of that is the Shroud has been in at least two very hot fires in 1532 and 1997 and in both case the image was not chemically changed as it would have been if it was formed by pigments. And in the 1997 fire the Shroud was sprayed with water from firemen's hoses which turned to steam in the Shroud's container, yet the image did not run as it would have if it was a pigment.>If there are only the two, it would seem odd that only two pigments would be found from 'sanctifying' other 'shrouds' against the 'real Shroud'. You would expect multiple pigments, I would imagine.There ARE \"multiple pigments\" on the Shroud, but NONE of them are sufficiently concentrated in the Shroud's image area to form its image.Stephen E.
