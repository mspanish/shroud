[{"title":"Paper Chase:  STURP’s Fascinating 1988 \"Draft Protocol for Future Examinations of the Shroud of Turin\"","post":"Dan, I agree with you only partially. While the two first points of this document, truly look prophetic with what we know in 2012, the recent publication of the detection of a trend, clearly confirms independently and 24 years later that the labs did really implement correctly the C14 test. The question right now is whether this technique is appropiate to date the Shroud. In my view, there is solid evidence that it is not.\n\n","date":"July 17, 2012 at 9:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-sturps-fascinating-1988-draft-protocol-for-future-examinations-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-13916","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  STURP’s Fascinating 1988 \"Draft Protocol for Future Examinations of the Shroud of Turin\"","post":"We have already talked about that subject.  In my mind, C14 dating is just one tool among many other tools that are avalaible to date an object.  And versus the Shroud, it is now clear that the C14 dating was not representative of the main body of the cloth.  Right now, no one can be sure of the true age of the cloth (scientifically speaking), even if we have many good indication that it is a very ancient linen that can well be of the same era than Jesus of Nazareth…\n\n","date":"July 17, 2012 at 4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-sturps-fascinating-1988-draft-protocol-for-future-examinations-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-13926","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  STURP’s Fascinating 1988 \"Draft Protocol for Future Examinations of the Shroud of Turin\"","post":"No doubt STURP should not have been left out considering their scrupulous science, Dan.\n\n","date":"July 17, 2012 at 7:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-sturps-fascinating-1988-draft-protocol-for-future-examinations-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-13931","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  STURP’s Fascinating 1988 \"Draft Protocol for Future Examinations of the Shroud of Turin\"","post":"Everything had been said more than 20 years ago.\nConcerning the C14 datation :\n\nS.
