Among my pursuits is that of amateur actor..\nI suppose by my own values I ought simply to chuckle tolerantly and move on, but, as Thomas More points out in ‘A Man For All Seasons,’ “Qui tacet consentire” so I fear it behoves me to reply to Stephen’s comments.\nFrom the top:\n1) Actually, from revisiting the radiocarbon dates, I am increasingly inclined towards a late 13th century date for the Shroud. It’s to do with the kink in the calibration curve that occurs between about 1325 and 1375, and will be further explored in the next Newsletter.\n2) By “accidentally,” an adverb which has already caused much hilarity in authenticist circles, I do not mean that the image appeared as fortuitously as it has on pieces of toast, pizzas and so on. I think that the image we see now is the inadvertent result of some other intention, not a deliberate attempt to produce the very vague, superficial, scorch-like appearance it has now. Perhaps along the lines of an epitaphios, altar cloth, reredos, or simple object of devotion rather than a deliberate fraud, and the original principle medium has disappeared, leaving what we have now. As to what this medium might have been, I agree that the non-authenticists are no nearer confirming that than the authenticists are with their radiation or vapour hypotheses.\n3) Is it petty of me not to like Stephen’s term ‘anti-authenticist’? It implies an antagonism towards ‘authenticists’ which I simply don’t feel. Although there are extremists on both sides of the debate, I feel that most of the commenters here are respectful of all the evidence for and against, and their convictions one way or the other do not prevent them from admitting that there are objections to them which have not been decisively refuted.\n4) I did not know that Stephen had helped put all the early BSTS Newsletters online as well as the ongoing Shroud Spectrum project. Regardless of his views, this is a tedious and time consuming job which has produced the most enormous benefit to Shroud researchers and will continue to do so as long as the internet exists. I have no hesitation whatever in thanking him sincerely for his achievement.\n5) Stephen denies that he thinks the Shroud is “incontrovertibly authentic” (my words), although he has also claimed that the evidence in favour of it is so “overwhelming” that anyone, including the Catholic Church, who does not accept it is under Satanic influence.\n“If the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!” (October 2013, quoted without permission). I stand by my statement.\n6) I say Stephen discourages comments. He says he only discourages comments which are off-topic, offensive, sub-standard, interminable, time-wasting, getting nowhere or debating. I stand by my statement.\n7) Stephen re-iterates his misunderstanding of Harry Gove’s statistical statement about astronomical odds, and again misapplies his misinterpretation to the inverse of its meaning. I have discussed this in detail elsewhere.\nThe rest of his post is a re-iteration of his hacking ideas which need not concern us until he produces rather more than the loosest of circumstantial evidence.\n\n","date":"August 13, 2014 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-143697","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"“I think that the image we see now is the inadvertent result of some other intention, not a deliberate attempt to produce the very vague, superficial, scorch-like appearance it has now.

I’m sorry, but that remains a massive problem for your theory. There is very little chance that an item for public devotion would have showed the buttocks, rather than the usual modesty protecting loin cloth.\nThirdly, assuming your theory of late 1200s creation, the current image must have faded hugely over just a couple of centuries. Clearly by the time of the Lier copy it was already a shadowy image, although hard to know if it was any ‘firmer’ than it is now.\n\n","date":"August 14, 2014 at 3:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-143839","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"Sorry Colin, our posts must have crossed.

I am more interested in knowing about the looms ,ancient or medieval, that could have produced it and I am aware that this is a highly specialist area and I would defer to expert opinion.\nStill there is much basic work to be done. Contrary to what Ian Wilson tells us ,the Shroud is not a particularly fine linen cloth. Examples of linen with 40 to 70 warp and weft threads per cm are known from Egypt, Palestine and Syria in this period, much greater quality than the Shroud. (See the good article on weaving in the ancient eastern Mediterranean in the Cambridge History of Western textiles ( p, 110 for the figures).\nAgain  if one looks at examples such as the Ramesses Girdle, now in Liverpool, of c. 1200 BC, which, even with computer help, has proved almost impossible to reweave, the Shroud is not especially complicated. \nSo when one says that the Shroud is unique, it does not mean that one should say it is something special as a cloth so long as much finer and more complicated cloths from the ancient Mediterranean are known to exist.\n For me, the key problem is survival. Although I believe that the Shroud is medieval, if a first century date does come up on a radiocarbon redating, I would assume that it was kept somewhere among the large and vibrant early Christian communities of Egypt where the damp would not have got at it. I am frustrated by the way so-called Shroud researchers are not prepared to look outside the Edessa/Constantinople route, when there are so many alternatives to it to explore. The Shroud would not have survived long cooped up in a brick wall in damp 9 even subject to flooding0 Edessa!!\n\n","date":"August 15, 2014 at 5:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-144012","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"“if a first century date does come up on a radiocarbon redating”\nGood luck …\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 7:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-144357","author":"PHPL","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"Well, our friend Gary Habermas seems to have already got a first century radiocarbon dating for the Shroud- see his lecture and the  comments on it.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 1:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-144381","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"Some months ago I wrote in my blog (http://sombraenelsudario.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/hugh-farey-el-sindonista-esceptico/) :\n“I hope that Hugh Farey can stay long time in front of BSTS Newsletter.

I have done many experiments myself to confirm this. When linen is heated at a range of different temperatures it invariably produces bright fluorescence even before any mark is clearly visible by ordinary light. At increasing temperatures the linen turns yellow, but without inhibiting the fluorescence, and then brown, when it stops, although the burns still have a bright fluorescent border. My earlier experiments were based on over-contrasty photos of the Shroud: I heated my linen till it went brown, and sure enough the brown areas did not fluoresce, and I thought the image could therefore be a scorch. When I realised that the image was actually yellow, and therefore equivalent to a lower temperature, fluorescence producing heat, I realised that some other mechanism than simple scorching must be involved, hence my further concentration on chemical rather than thermal degradation of the surface of the linen.\nThere are, however, reasonable objections to claiming that modern experiments disprove the burn hypothesis. For a start, the whole shroud fluoresces quite brightly, even in places where there is neither scorch nor image, and it could be that whatever produced the image inhibited, rather than enhanced this background fluorescence, producing the UV image we see today.

The latter  is rather rare, and often due to polycyclic aromatic compounds with a planar rigid structure, though that’s not necessarily the case for pyrolysis products of linen. So there’s a sense in which one is making oneself a hostage to fortune if using a uv lamp to decide whether one system accurately models another, especially when one was produced a minute ago, and the other many centuries earlier, the latter having endured all kinds of chemical insults – from fires to thymol vapour. (Let’s not forget the phenomenon of fluorescence quenching).\nSo please don’t be offended when I say that I for one cannot get terribly worked up over the non-fluorescence of the TS image. What I would like to do in an ideal world, given the facilities, would be to isolate and identify the chemical species responsible for the fluorescence of a model scorch, and then decide whether the “problem” of the Shroud’s non-fluorescent body image (or loss of an initial fluorescence?) is more apparent than real.\nIncidentally, I wasted the best part of an entire year in Philadelphia, chasing up a yellow-green fluorescent species allegedly specific to phototherapy bile, or so I was told on arrival, which in 1970 was billed as the holy grail of bilirubinology. It turned out to be plain old riboflavin, i.e. Vitamin B2, of which there was just as much in control bile too. And I only discovered that by accident, through noticing yellow-green fluorescent gels in the lab next door, due to its routine use of riboflavin to photo-catalyse the polymerisation of its gels for protein separation.\nNot for nothing is the Royal Society’s motto: “Nullius in verba”.

However, I  hardly think diagrams are needed, given I have supplied step-by-step photos. All I did was to scorch linen by contact with a hot metal template, to pull out individual threads, to ‘unspin’ them by rolling the ends between thumb and finger so as to separate the fibres, then look for scorched and unscorched fibres under the microscope. There were relatively few scorched fibres, even for quite intense scorch imprints. For faint imprints, the scorched fibres were there, but somewhat difficult to find.\nSo how can you maintain that scorching is an all-or-nothing effect at thread level, colouring all its fibres (typically 50-200)? It’s simply not the case. Scorching  by brief contact with a template is or can be a highly superficial process, and I think I now know why (pyrolysis being endothermic, withdrawing substantial amounts of heat from the template, protecting underlying fibres).\nIt’s time to demolish the myth that a contact scorch can never be as superficial as the TS image.

That could have some practical consequences that might require making modifications to one’s imprinting technology, but that shows up the crucial difference between science and technology. Science is governed by immutable laws, whereas technology can generally be altered to fine tune a desired outcome. \nThose who attempt to assume or impose a radiation model are ignoring one of those cussed and immutable law of science – namely the First Law of Photochemistry.  It states that radiation has first to be absorbed before there can be a chemical reaction. How can that be with a white shroud? What kind of radiation is absorbed by white linen that would not be immediately re-radiated, ie. with nett absorption close to zero?

No one had microscopes back then, who would have been able to tell if it was a man-made scorch?”\nImagine if you will that someone has set out to create a whole body version of the Veil of Veronica, i.e. a simulated sweat imprint, and has decided that a faint heat scorch from a 3D template (“statue”) might serve the purpose, especially as scorch and sweat imprints both record prominences only, or what today we would call negative character. How would he set out about the task so as to ensure success on first attempt (linen being expensive). \nThe first thing to realize is that thermometers, microscopes etc are not needed. The aim is simply to produce an image, with no need to submit a write-up to shroudstory.manuscript. In other words. the exercise is entirely empirical, requiring no theoretical knowledge whatsoever.\nModus operandi? Have several small squares of linen available for testing the ability of the template to produce a faint scorch. One heats the template, testing with strips, and removing from heat when scorches are a little more intense than one wishes. One then removes from the heat, and continues testing until after cooling one can be certain of obtaining a scorch of the desired intensity for a given application time, which might be seconds, or even minutes, depending on the technology one has chosen. If pressing hot template down forcibly into linen spread over damp sand, or sacking say, then the chosen application time might be short, say a couple of seconds, due to high impaction pressure. If linen is spread on top of the template, and damp sacking placed on top, with light manual moulding of fabric to 3D relief, ti.e low impaction pressure, hen the application time might be longer, say two minutes or more, given the ability of the damp overlay to act as a heat sink AND to allow temperature sensing through one’s fingertips.\n(I have previously suggested that both LUWU and LOTTO configurations were used  to imprint dorsal and frontal sides in the same session, where LUWU is short for Linen Underneath With Underlay and LOTTO short for Linen On Top Then Overlay.\nOK, so centuries later, scientists come along and discover that the image is highly superficial, confined to the crowns of the threads, and possibly no deeper than the primary cell wall of flax fibres, approx 200nm thickness (or so we are told, though I have yet to see hard data on either that the TS image thickness). Our artisan did  not need to know that, far less need special equipment or skills to follow those specifications. He was content to produce an image of the optimum intensity. The physics and chemistry of carbohydrate pyrolysis did the rest. It doesn’t matter how much complexity there is in the image at the microscopic level, it being something over which the artisan had no control, but more importantly had no need to control.\nThere are different ways of cooking eggs – poaching, frying, boiling, omelettes etc. Nobody planned for those different offerings to look or taste the way they do. Their distinctive characteristics are the result of adopting simple operations with the eggs. Physics and chemistry does the rest.\nThe TS image is likely to be end-result of following a simple routine with prudent use of small scale temperature probes (test strips of linen) to minimise risk of under- or over-scorching. It is NOT the end-result of a controlled laboratory experiment designed to effect certain changes at the microscopic level. To anyone who thinks otherwise I would simply say this.

But it’s odd, don’t you think, that none of the other blood motifs were shown (the small size need not have been an obstacle to showing nail holes, scourge marks etc). Might that not suggest that the badge-maker had interpreted the “blood belt” as something very different, especially as it’s shown as a thick coil. \nSome of us (well, one anyway) see parallels with the potent imagery employed by extanct and earlier artists to depict the sufferings of St.Lawrence of Rome, slow-roasted in 258, with a variety of restraining devices, including a rope or chain around the waist, with the subject spread-eagled over the grid iron, occasionally with crossed hands as per TS. Oh, and there are those images of the Templars at the stake in 1314, some with a securing chain around the waist.\nMethinks it’s somewhat premature to assume that it really is a  Wilsonian “blood belt”, especially as there’s no obvious lance wound on the Lirey badge. Conversely, the Lier copy (1516) of the TS shows a lance wound but NOT a “blood belt”.\nAt the risk of stirring a hornet’s nest, one could be provocative (oh, let’s) and suggest there had been a puzzling feature of the Mark 1 TS, one that resembled a chain or coiled rope (which may or may not have provided a clue as to how the rest of the image was to be interpreted) and that later custodians simply covered up the problematical region with blood (or blood substitute). That would or indeed should be the cue for thinking the unthinkable – or as I maintain eminently thinkable – namely that there might be body image UNDER blood stains that needs to be unmasked, maybe with the kind of X-ray technology that has shown long-lost Rembrandts lurking underneath bucolic 19th century landscapes.\n\n","date":"August 19, 2014 at 5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-144719","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"Mmmm interesting…but still curious don’t you think that none of the depictions from the 1500s – that I know of at least – show the “blood belt”?

But one should not assume that elemental aluminium does not exist anywhere in the Universe. It does – in stars – because it was formed in stars from lighter elements by nuclear capture of protons and electrons. The conditions are those of a high temperature plasma, which allows no chemical combinations, i.e. the aluminium would be present as aluminium atoms or ions, not as ionic associations with other elements, not even ion pairs (the temperature being too high).   What we do with our electric current in aluminium smelters is to reverse the process that led to stellar aluminium atoms cooling by degrees to become chemically-stable aluminium compounds in the Earth’s crust, That process required restoring electrons to aluminum ions, Al +++, converting them to Al atoms. the latter being electrically neutral with equal numbers of protons and electrons.\nIt’s somewhat pointless (at least in the context of the TS) to get too spellbound about an ultra-thin image layer when thin layers are commonplace in the world around us, albeit for very different mechanistic processes. It then becomes equally pointless but additionally tedious if one’s examples are then challenged for being ‘man-made’ rather than natural. That’s especially the case with the example I cited of aluminium, where the distinction between natural and man-made depends on whether one takes a planetary perspective, or that of the entire Universe with most places much hotter than Planet Earth.\nWhat we see here now is opportunist sniping  verging (yet again) on trolling. But there’s some compensation this time, since I never pass up an opportunity to talk about the subject that has given me immense enjoyment for well over half a century – the chemical elements and their compounds –  of which we ourselves are made, and our ability to rearrange atoms to concoct a wealth of fascinating compounds (or return the latter to their separate elements).\nTakeaway message: the thinness of a scorch image is no big deal, but if it were, then take comfort (or alarm) from the fact that there are potentially scores of other big deals around us in the form of ultra-thin layers.\nAs I’ve said before, medieval man was skilfully manipulating an ultra-thin material, comparable to the alleged thickness (200nm) of the TS image layer each time he illuminated a manuscript – with hammered out gold leaf.\n\n","date":"August 19, 2014 at 2:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-144801","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"Ok, so you’ve just stalled on aluminium.\nOr should we interprete the gold leaf as the third candidate to a thin layer “natural of man induced phenomenon” ?\n\n","date":"August 19, 2014 at 2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-144804","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter","post":"Anoxie, you are very good at reading other people’s hands, but never seem to lay your own cards on the table.
