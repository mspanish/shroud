That is someone who claims to be seeking the truth, but is really seeking instead to prove his or her own prejudgment. \nGiven the complexity of the fraud image, you can’t merely be putting up hypotheses with NO factual foundation and satisfy yourself you have succeeded in demonstrating anything.\nThis is a fact: no one has demonstrated the process by which the image was created. No one has explained it scientifically. I expect that someday, long after you and I  have shuffled off this mortal coil it may happen but it will be a process beyond our understanding, because  it will be the Resurrection. I am sure that not only you, but many Christian believers,  will scoff because they want to preserve the mysticism of their faith. \nHowever, let me quote Pierre Teilhard de Chardin again:\n“To outward appearance, the modern world was born of an anti-religious\nmovement: man becoming self-sufficient and reason supplanting belief. Our\ngeneration and the two that preceded it have heard little but talk of the\nconflict between science and faith; indeed it seemed at one moment a\nforegone conclusion that the former was destined to take the place of the\nlatter. But, as the tension is prolonged, the conflict visibly seems to need to be\nresolved in terms of an entirely different form of equilibrium — not in\nelimination, nor duality, but in synthesis. After close on two centuries of\npassionate struggles, neither science nor faith has succeeded in discrediting its\nadversary. On the contrary, it becomes obvious that neither can develop\nnormally without the other. And the reason is simple: the same life animates\nboth. Neither in its impetus nor its achievements can science go to its limits\nwithout becoming tinged with mysticism and charged with faith.” \nTeilhard, Pierre de Chardin; Huxley, Julian; Wall, Bernard (2011-06-21).

In the past two centuries science has pushed it’s knowledge so far and now is theorizing matters which intersect with the issue of the nature of human consciousness. \nOnce again I recommend the Hameroff video who speaks of the quantum knowledge of the universe. I would not claim that Hameroff has everything right. But the implications of his claims which are grounded in science are immense and they are science.

It is the scientists, or self-styled scientists, who use the Shroud as evidence of Resurrection (or even to insist that it merely enveloped a 1st century man).\nI would like to get those same individuals to enter freely into debate here, instead of depositing their ex cathedra findings on this site as pdf documents or guerrilla-raid comments, then retreating back into to the shadows. They know who they are.\nHere’s something that might drew them out. This so-called pseudo-sceptic has now established to his own satisfaction how the Shroud image can be produced in principle. It involves no magic, and is down-to-earth, almost mundane science. It involves combining elements of my own discoveries with thermostencilling and direct thermal imprinting with those of Luigi Garlaschelli, involving powder frottage and oven baking. The end-result is a faint sepia negative image residing primarily (though perhaps not exclusively) on the superficial primary cell wall of linen fibres, and thus approximately 200-600nm thick as proposed for the Shroud image, one that is a negative image, through being an analogue imprint from a 3D subject or object, and not surprisingly is then 3D-enhancible in ImageJ and similar programs that read image intensity as image height. Oh, and let’s not forget that thanks to the some crucial detail of Garlaschelli technology, not presently explained, it would probably be non-fluorescent, which for some at least, for reasons best known to themselves, serves as the ultimate criterion, the make-or-break test.\nThe Shroud is just one of my many interests in science (see my sciencebuzz site), and I have many interest outside of science too, none of them proselytizing or agenda-pushing in any way, so I frankly consider John’s caricature of me laughable, and one that does not help his case (whatever that is) one little bit. \nBut I’m here today, on this thread, on this site, merely to reiterate what I have been saying previously, albeit by a series of small bite-size instalments, namely that there is nothing in the least bit miraculous about the Shroud image – and shame on those who attempt to use the language or technology of science (invariably ill-chosen) to prove otherwise, and who in one instance at least, then ask us to ponder on the theological or philosophical implications.  Science, or rather the scientific method, is not a branch of philosophy (which is not beyond questioning the validity of the scientific method)  and certainly not theology.  Indeed, the findings of science, using its ‘questionable methodology’  may occasionally help to inform those two entirely forms of enquiry, neither of which operates on the basis of framing and testing hypotheses that are in principle testable and indeed need to be tested if they are to gain any traction.  \nThe idea that hypotheses have to pass John Klotz’s tests based on his criteria of support from existing “facts” (a plastic commodity in his hands, see radiocarbon dating) is ridiculous, as is the equating of hypotheses with “prejudgements”. I test my hypotheses experimentally to see if they stand up, so how can they be prejudgements? What about his hypotheses? How many has he tested. If  as one suspects the answer is none, then it is his hypotheses that are prejudgements, and it is John Klotz who is the pot calling the kettle black.\nAs flagged-up earlier,  I intend to post copies of this response to John Klotz’s charge of “pseudo-skeptism” to both my sciencebuzz site and my main shroudie site in due course, unless, that is, anyone, John included,  takes strong objection to anything I have said, and has reasonable grounds for those objections.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2013 at 6:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/meanwhile-part-2-works-for-me/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48654","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Meanwhile, Part 2:  “Works for Me”","post":"The belief that Jesus imprinted his likeness on cloth is ancient, it is part of the Orthodox Church’s liturgy.

That is someone who claims to be seeking the truth, but is really seeking instead to prove his or her own prejudgment.’\nI agree with John (yes,agreement!) that such people exist but it seems to me that you find them across the spectrum of Shroud studies. They are easy to spot because whenever anyone puts in material that challenges them, they get a bit hot under the collar.\n If the Shroud was put into a top conservation laboratory, such as that in the Metropolitan Museum, New York  or, if it is still running, Florence (set up after the 1966 floods), most of its ‘secrets’ would be revealed, or at least the problems clarified, in a couple of weeks with technology that is streets ahead of anything known in 1978 or 1988. Until then we are dealing with a lot of ambiguous evidence much of it produced by people who are working in disciplines that have nothing to do with ancient weaving.  So as far as the Shroud is concerned ‘we see through a glass darkly’ because we do not have enough evidence to do more.\nIn my own work on the medieval church, I frequently come across inventories that talk of collections of linens and silks with images on them. An inventory of the contents of the basilica of Saint-Urbain in Troyes in 1468 listed 26 silk cloths with images on them. Yes, silk here, linen in other cases. Charles V of France (ruled 1364-78) owned 57 chapelles, sets of vestments or altar cloths, some of them, like the only survivor the Parement of Narbonne, painted in grey on silk for use in Lent. That is a thousand objects.\nYet  the mere mention of an image on a cloth is often  taken to refer to the Shroud! (See Ian Wilson’s reference to the veneration of a cloth by the  Templars, for instance.)  We need to be much more critical of such claims until better evidence is found to link them specifically with the Shroud. Until then, I for one, will simply treat them as different cloths as we know that many such existed.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2013 at 12:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/meanwhile-part-2-works-for-me/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48616","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Meanwhile, Part 2:  “Works for Me”","post":"A fair point, Charles, but those thousands of images sound like artworks and I assume those that held them accounted them as such (though they were still considered holy).
