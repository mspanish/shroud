[{"title":"Dissent of the day with a bit of a response","post":"Here we have a very clear example for the reasons why all the C14 issue remains controversial, after 24 years. Dawkins mentions the fire of 1532 as a possible explanation but who knows?…..The true point is that we only have a few vague ideas on how a C14 test will work with ancient linens, touched by millions of persons throughout history, kept in varying conditions of humidity and temperature for centuries and partially burnt 480 years ago. The point is that the Shroud -whatever it is- is a unique piece of linen and using off-the-shelf tests like C14 when we don`t have a background knowledge of what we can expect or how interpretate results, may be highly misleading.\nOne of the areas on the Shroud about which research has progressed most and currently, we have a more solid and conclusive knowledge, is all the forensic/blood aspects. In my opinion, on the contrary of C14 tests on ancient linens, in general, we know virtually everything about dead human corpses and human blood behaviour. Since the researchers had this previous knowledge, the specific tests carried out on the Shroud on these areas, could easily be put into context, correctly understood and represent eda major step forward\nin research. This previous and commonly accepted knowledge is the main difference with the C14 test and allowed much more easily than in other areas of research, an almost general consensus on the forensic aspects of the Shroud.\nFor  this reason, regardless the fact that most probably the test was carried out on a non-representative sample, a new C14 test might not help at all because we don`t know enough on how to put new results in the context on an ancient linen which has gone through such a very particular chain of events. Perhaps, if enough had been known, even the C14 would have been ruled out from the beginning.\nThe same risk may happen if readily available, breaking-edge technologies are blindly applied in the frame of a new set of tests. Again, without a contextual knowledge of these tests when applied to similar cloths, new dissapointing figures may emerge from a computer while a new cycle of discussions starts again for the next years.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2012 at 8:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/21/dissent-of-the-day-with-a-bit-of-a-response/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-7312","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"}]
