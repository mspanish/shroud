There is no burden of proof in science. One simply collects and evaluates data, and if objections are made to one’s interpretation, then one simply addresses those objections, doing further experiments if necessary. (Thus the need to repeat the radiocarbon dating, since objections have been raised, some legitimate, some less so).\nAs regards thymol, it was unfathomable that Raymond Rogers should have claimed it would form strong, irreversible chemical bonds with linen (as distinct from much the weaker reversible physical adsorption that would be nullified in AMS clean-up protocols). \nIt is easy enough to check if thymol can form strong chemical links, simply by doing some preliminary tests with modern linen and radio-labelled thymol. Alternatively, a fragment of Shroud thread can be examined by pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (Rogers’ own chosen instrument!). If there’s thymol there, it should be easy to detect by its aromatic ring and substituent functional groups. \nPlease stop making a roadblock out of thymol.

Specimens of peat, it seems, are both regularly radiocarbon dated and regularly preserved in thymol. What’s more, being ‘whole plant’ based, they can often be dendrochronologically checked for accuracy. A recent paper by Piotr Kolaczek suggests that samples collected some time ago, and reserved in thymol, could nevertheless be accurately dated, provided the thymol is washed away with alcohol. This should be checked out, but if true, implies that thymol is unlikely to be a relevant factor in distorting radiocarbon dates.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2013 at 10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/14/colin-berry-is-writing-to-the-vatican/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-51276","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry is Writing to the Vatican","post":"I’m with you Dan.

They can be generalized as a plea: Pay as much attention to the technology and information model used to identify, preserve, and share scientific data as you do on the methods of collection and analysis.\nThe goal here is to structure information such that it can readily be understood and reused by others.  Much of the web today consists of ‘mashups’ made possible through open APIs.  This enables others to combine and recombine content from multiple sources to deliver new information, adapt existing information to a new purpose, or discover relationships between previously disparate sources.  In other words, it powers everything from serendipitous discovery to cutting edge computer-aided research, but it can only exist when openness and sharing are prioritized rather than grudgingly conceded.  \nAny future investigative project should carefully consider and implement the following:\n1. Transparency.  We live in an age of digital rights management, copyright wars, and efforts to control what can exist and persist on the Internet.  Any future investigation should commit to the release of all images, video, data, analysis, etc. gathered.  In fact, there is no technological impediment to streaming all collection activities to a global audience in real time.  After the fact, data should be similarly public from a single Internet repository.  While I have great respect for scientists, the work they do, and the publishing process, the Shroud belongs to the world.  So should the data.  Wherever possible, authors should request that their published materials be publically available, rather than secreted behind paywalls.  For some publishers, this will be a deviation from preference or procedure; again, the Shroud is different.\n2. Data structure: Wherever possible, identify and structure information according to accepted international standards — not just in terms of file formats, but semantics as well.  For example, the Open Provenance Model (http://openprovenance.org/) provides a framework for explicitly identifying and tracing the nature and sources of scientific data.  BioPortal (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/) is a searchable repository of ontologies for the life sciences.  Semantically-structured data is vital for fruitful communication and collaboration, especially between different communities of interest or scientific specializations.  \n3. Public involvement: While the very thought will rankle some, there needs to be a way for non-professionals to be involved in the preparation, planning, execution, and analysis.  The fact is that important contributions have been made by non-professionals or by scientists working in “home laboratories.”  It is far better to encourage — but also formalize — those contributions than to summarily exclude them.  An example implementation might work something like Reddit.  Allow members of the public to comment or make suggestions, and use a system of weighted comment promotion as a traceable, rigorous way to move information collectively identified as valuable from a comment all the way to the attention of the scientific team.\nOther priorities need to be stressed, but with these three implemented (as well as the existing methods of getting people’s attention such as SHOUTING and comboxes) others will advocate for them more effectively than I.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2013 at 1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/14/colin-berry-is-writing-to-the-vatican/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-51301","author":"Jeffrey Liss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry is Writing to the Vatican","post":"They used to say “two nations divided by a common language”.

As well as the two 40mm pieces, a warp thread 13mm and weft thread 12mm given to Gilbert Raes, several other dorsal threads, most of them “blood-stained” were also taken; To Profs Mari & Rizzati (vice Prof Frache): one 28mm thread no image, ten threads 10mm to 40mm, “blood-stained” (scourge-marks, feet, small of back);  To Profs Filogamo & Zina: one 13mm, one 18mm, “blood-stained” from right foot dorsal. \nThe Italians were unsuccessful at identifying blood, that had to await the work of Heller, Adler & Baima Ballone in 1978. King Umberto had required that on completion of their investigations, the samples were to be returned to their reliquary. Considering the wide-spread distribution over the dorsal image, the samples if still extant might be suitably representative  C-14 candidate samples.
