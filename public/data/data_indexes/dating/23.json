[{"title":"Cotton","post":"The item I forwarded to Dan with highlighting I added is from the September-October 1990 BSTS Journal. It cites an article from Decemmebr 13, 1988 Textile Horizons, a copy of which was sent to me by David Rolfe a few minutes ago.\nI think the inmportance of this is how it ties into the work of Sue Benford Joe Marino and, of course, Ray Rogers a decade later. There was cotton in the samples cut for carbon dating testing that did not exist on other parts of the Shroud. The atypical nature of the sample area was indicated by the blue Quad Mosaic which could not identify the reason for it’s being atypical but just announce it.\nYou can argue with some of Ray Roger’s conclusions but I do not believe you can argue with the fact that the carbon sample was atypical of the shroud and an apparent reason for it being atypical was presence of cotton in a form not found on the rest of the Shroud. That is confirmed by Rogers who had the most complete set of fibers drawn from the Shroud and includes Jumper who also investigated the complete Shroud. There was not cotteon found in  the form it was found on the sample area anywhere else on the Shroud.\nHow it got there and why may be an open question for some, but that the Shroud sample was atypical is a fact.\n\n","date":"June 25, 2013 at 9:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/25/cotton/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-38029","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cotton","post":"So, the high-powered STURP, a group of  largely self-selected US scientists, many past  their prime,  and many disposed towards authenticity, for one reason or another, decides to investigate the most iconic piece of fabric on the planet, supposedly made entirely of 1st century Middle East linen, and, wait for it, decides to wear cotton gloves. \nYes, that made a lot of sense, didn’t it?

Without the bile it would be simply  baloney, although equally indigestible.)\nThis item from a trade textile journal Textile Horizons that did not emanate from any source remotely connected with STURP or even the BSTS. The lab was in fact was contracted for the examination by Oxford (which incidentally was late in reporting its carbon dating results).\nThe only mention of cotton appearing in the samples  simply appears at the end of the Nature article, buried amidst numerous acknowledgements:\n“We thank Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero for allowing us access to the shroud, Professor L. Gonella for his help and support throughout the project and Professor A. Bray for commenting on our statistical assessment of the data. We also thank Miss E. Crowfoot, T. G. H. James, Dr J. Evin, M. Prevost-Macillacy, G. Vial, the Mayor of Saint-Maximin and the Egypt Exploration Society for assistance in obtaining the three knownage control samples. Oxford thank [sic] P. H. South (Precision Process (Textiles) Ltd, Derby) for examining and identifying the cotton found on the shroud sample; . . .” (emphasis my own) http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm\nNote that only Oxford “thank”[sic] and that there is no discussion of the nature of the Precision Process report. Also note that P.H. South is cited by name. Further note that in the Textile Horizon’s article, Mr. South excludes the possibility of what they observed being a casual contamination but hypothesizes that it indicates a repair of the Shroud or a combining of the cotton with linen at the time the linen was spun. And the cotton was yellow,\nAnd the reaction of the Dr. Berry: invective attacking the STURP scientists who had nothing to do with the carbon dating and apparently alleging that with maniacal cleverness they wore cotton gloves so that the Shroud would be contaminated.\nI deeply regret the time I have spent drafting this reply. But history teaches that idiocy and histrionics can not be ignored for as Mark Twain once wrote: A lie travels halfway around the world while truth is putting on its shoes.”  The truth as known in 1988, I submit, is there was cotton in the samples, it was not casual contamination, and a least one of carbon dating laboratories noted that fact but was rushing to complete the testing because they were late.\nThat may not  decide the issue. That was to await the work of Sue Benford, Joe Marino and Ray Rogers, 12 years later.\nJohn C.

Apparently “sloppy science” is not to include dogmatic conclusions from non-representative samples satisfying no formal protocol when it comes to C-14 dating. \nWiki has some interesting observations on cotton. Although used in Mexico from the 5th millemium BCE, in the Old World its origin is in India.  It was unknown to the Greeks and Arabs before Alexander’s excursions took him to the Indus. Subsequently it was used in Iran, but there is little contemporary info on its cultivation there. Even in 1350 AD, it was little understood in northern Europe, and there were preposterous stories even then about lambs growing on trees in India whose branches bent down so they could feed. There was an active cotton trade which seems confined to the Middle East up until roughly the end of the first millenium CE. All this tends to constrain the time and place of cotton contamination on the TS. If the TS were of European medieval origin then the cotton would have had to been added some time well after 1350, as it seems that cotton was virtually unknown there beforehand. This would make it a subsequent contamination. One old suggestion mentioned by Wilson in 1978 is that the linen cloth may have been woven on Middle Eastern looms previously used to weave cotton. However others have claimed that the only cotton present is in the Raes sampling area. All this points to the likelihood that the cotton is a relatively late addition, probably deliberate, in order to effect a repair. It would seem that this repair is what the C-14 laboratories accurately dated to the 14th century. But of course it may have been skewed by the much older linen cloth, lacking vanillin, and the repair could have been much later than the 14th century.\n\n","date":"June 26, 2013 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/25/cotton/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-38095","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cotton","post":"DaveB:  Science.like a river, should be able to clean itself. Rivers do it using dissolved oxygen, which converts the pollutants to detoxified end-products,  Science does it by using the ‘oxygen’ of critical enquiry and constant re-evaluation.\nBut science is no longer working in the case of the TS. The main reason it is not working is down to the malign influence of STURP,  that introduced pollutants into the river of science.\nTwo of them need close scrutiny.  The first was Roger’s starch- coating obsession, based on his slipped-in, shameful  a priori assumption that the Shroud was Pliny-era linen. For that, he had scarcely a shred of evidence. \nSecond , as,  if not more shameless, was Adler’s equally fanciful “bilirubin”-enriched , red cell–depleted blood theory, again with scarcely any evidence. That you will recall was the one that assumed that the Shroud had most definitely enveloped a crucified subject.

We have to speak of cotton fibers which are internal to the threads and interwoven with the linen fibers. An external, superficial presence of cotton may have any origin (and not only the gloves of STURP). As it happens, for the Raes/C14 corner some segments of thread were available and on occasion have been unraveled and examined fiber by fiber under the microscope. I do not remember that a similar examination has been done on segments of thread from other areas of the cloth. Thank you if you can provide references. One has also to consider that the amount of cotton incorporated in a thread during spinning might vary irregularly from thread to thread. Perhaps one thread was spun in a room where also cotton was spun or was anyhow present, while another thread was spun in a room where cotton was absent. Even for spinning within the same room, according to circumstances, two threads (or two segments of the same thread) might contain different amounts of cotton. Therefore it is not sufficient to compare one or a few spots. It is necessary to statistically compare a sufficiently high number of spots. The examination of each segment of thread should be done thoroughly and accurately, possibly in a “blind” condition.\n\n","date":"June 28, 2013 at 7:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/25/cotton/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-38304","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cotton","post":"You need to read Maureen Fennell Mazzaoui’s The Italian Cotton Industry in the Later Middle Ages, Cambridge UP ,1981.
