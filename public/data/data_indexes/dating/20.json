Look at it. From the left, the first white patch is not on an indented region at all, the second patch is on the right hand slope of an indented region, and the third indented region has no white patch at all. It is apparent from the background that the light in the photo is coming from the top left towards the bottom right (the dark shadow under the indented region on the right is actually the shadow of the next one along). The enlarged photo (Figure 2) more clearly shows that the white patches are nothing more than glare. This is confirmed by the complete lack of a white patch in the dark area of the underside of the thread, between the two indentations, where the weft thread passed over three warp threads. If anyone is still in contact with John Brown, it would be good to put these observations to him for comment. He might even have additional photos that are more convincing.\n\n","date":"October 27, 2013 at 2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/26/another-in-case-you-missed-it-on-steras-facebook-page/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48909","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another In Case You Missed it on STERA’s Facebook Page","post":"It’s amazing how much some folk can deduce from white bits (some, perhaps all glare as you say), when you don’t have the weave that you can probe with a needle, especially in and around cross-overs. Amazing, simply amazing, that with just one single thread – one is able to state with 100% confidence that every pale “indentation” is a cross-over that missed getting painted. \nSeems we missed our vocation  Hugh – we should have been microscopists, able to learn and deduce so much from a single thread with no surrounding weave.

Whenever I try to contact one of the original researchers I increasingly find that I’m too late.\nThibault, I’m glad to hear your observations. Can you also say if there were large patches of white, with small orange brown patches, on the other side of R7, where the weft thread passed over three warp threads, and where the viscous madder-laden gum also did not penetrate, presumably?\nIncidentally I have just received some madder root through the post.
