Even the liberal Protestant scholar and pastor Helmut Koester has bluntly stated that the “quests”, including the recent ones, have failed. One could say that if the previous quests were demolished by Schweitzer, Koester did the same in his own way by questioning the recent ones.\nNorman Mailer understood the problem by just reading the New Testament. Jesus hovers over the narratives, the TS image is subtle….. Perhaps this may help.\n\n","date":"May 1, 2014 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/01/comment-promoted-john-klotz-on-how-ray-rogers-gets-critiqued/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-107947","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  John Klotz on How Ray Rogers Gets Critiqued","post":"I can’t see any one more qualified than Rogers on image formation, in Turin or anywhere else, but maybe i’ve missed another Valencia consensus or another urban legend.\n\n","date":"May 1, 2014 at 2:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/01/comment-promoted-john-klotz-on-how-ray-rogers-gets-critiqued/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-108098","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  John Klotz on How Ray Rogers Gets Critiqued","post":"John wrote, “His ideas on image formation were incomplete as even he realized.”\n\n","date":"May 1, 2014 at 2:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/01/comment-promoted-john-klotz-on-how-ray-rogers-gets-critiqued/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-108116","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  John Klotz on How Ray Rogers Gets Critiqued","post":"no (naturalistic) alternative.\n\n","date":"May 1, 2014 at 2:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/01/comment-promoted-john-klotz-on-how-ray-rogers-gets-critiqued/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-108123","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  John Klotz on How Ray Rogers Gets Critiqued","post":"It is evident that no dogmatic assertions can be made at this stage.

The impurity/Maillard\nhypothesis is proposed in an attempt to incorporate more observations into a single,\ncomplex hypothesis for image formation. It is important to recognize that Maillard colors\nwill form every time amines and simple starches and/or sugars come together.”\nI think that the resent state of knowledge is what Rogers ssys”no single, simple hypothesis will be adequate to explain all the observations [of the image] made on the Shroud.\nMy point is that when you factor in the four written accounts of the Resurrection, things begin to fall into place and at some point we shouldn’t be afraid to say so. But that is not proof of the Resurrection. Not yet anyway. That lies just beyond ther horizon, unless you define the Shroud as the horizon .\n\n","date":"May 1, 2014 at 3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/01/comment-promoted-john-klotz-on-how-ray-rogers-gets-critiqued/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-108142","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  John Klotz on How Ray Rogers Gets Critiqued","post":"100% agreed, John.
