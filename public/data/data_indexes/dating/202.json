It is more useful for establishing the twill hop count. The smaller picture is from Jull’s paper. It was important to establish that the news photo was from the same piece of cloth that Jull cites in his paper. That has been done.\n\n","date":"January 6, 2011 at 7:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/05/was-the-sample-used-in-the-jull-paper-not-from-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2143","author":"Episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Was the sample used in the Jull paper NOT from the Shroud of Turin?","post":"1) I think this is the reverse of the sample.\n2) We know that also Zurich laboratory preserved a piece of the sample.\n3) I would remember a previous observation I made about Jull’s sample:\nAnn Hedlund, the textile expert, established that the warp fabric count is 30 yarns per cm  and the weft is 40 yarns per cm.\nBut other experts who studied the textile of the Shroud counted differently:\nTimossi: warp/40 weft/27\nRaes: warp/38,6 weft/25,7\nVial: Warp/37,6 weft/25,8\nVercelli: warp/36 weft/24\nHedlund/Jull: warp/30 weft/40\nVercelli’s count is very important because was made on a c14 sample.\n\n","date":"January 6, 2011 at 6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/05/was-the-sample-used-in-the-jull-paper-not-from-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2141","author":"domenico","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Was the sample used in the Jull paper NOT from the Shroud of Turin?","post":"As to Domenico’s points.\n1) This is the weft face (the weft threads are prominent) and it may be called the reverse because in the Shroud textile the warp face is more “beautiful” and regular. The image of the body is on the warp face.\n2) As to Zurich, it would be interesting to know something more. Can you provide any sources?\n3) In the Radiocarbon paper, Freer is the first author, while Hedlund is only mentioned thus: “[she] was also consulted on the weave structure of the fragment.” In the Acknowledgements her name is mentioned “for helpful discussions”.\nConcerning the wrong data in the paper, I have published a note here, but it is in Italian:\nhttp://sindone.weebly.com/autogoltucson.html\n\n","date":"January 7, 2011 at 9:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/05/was-the-sample-used-in-the-jull-paper-not-from-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2158","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Was the sample used in the Jull paper NOT from the Shroud of Turin?","post":"Dominic, I’m not sure I understand what you mean by the reverse of the sample. Am I not correct in assuming that even on the other side of the sample, the twill (2 or 3 hop) would be obvious.\nThere have been suggestions that Jull confused warp and weft. But even so, Jull’s thread count is high. Thanks for that data. I had some of it but you have rounded it out nicely.\n\n","date":"January 6, 2011 at 7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/05/was-the-sample-used-in-the-jull-paper-not-from-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2142","author":"Episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Was the sample used in the Jull paper NOT from the Shroud of Turin?","post":"Reverse and anverse Zurich\nhttp://lasabanaylosescepticos.blogspot.com/2006/01/zurich-1988-buscad-y-encontrareis.html\n\n","date":"January 7, 2011 at 11:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/05/was-the-sample-used-in-the-jull-paper-not-from-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2162","author":"co","site":"shroudstory"}]
