Now the question is that we know that the shroud was in a fire do we know if any burning wood was around that fire?

Even in the 14th century, there was a significant blip in atmospheric C14 such that an object with a radiocarbon reduction amounting to 600 years could actually date to almost any time in the 14th century.\nBut, no, John, being in a wood fire has no effect on the radiocarbon date of something. Firstly, any CO2 produced by the fire would not be taken up by the artefact (although experiments to try to see if it might have been carried out), but secondly, the wood itself would still have almost all its radiocarbon still intact. The ChemEurope article refers to the burning of fossil fuels, which, having been buried for millions of years, have no residual C14 left.\nParadoxically, so far the decrease in C14 due to fossil fuel burning has just about matched the increase due to nuclear weapons testing, although it seems it will overcome it shortly. Paradoxically also, the bigger the discrepancy the better from a dating point of view; if they carbon dated the same, to distinguish a 2015 shirt from a 1975 shirt could be quite difficult, but to distinguish a 2015 shirt from a 1075 shirt should be considerably easier.\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 7:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/interesting-article-on-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-206314","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Interesting Article on Radiocarbon Dating","post":"Thanks Hugh for clearing that up for me.\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 8:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/interesting-article-on-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-206318","author":"John Green","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Interesting Article on Radiocarbon Dating","post":"The Daily Times Gazette should go back to sleep.\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 7:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/interesting-article-on-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-206344","author":"Dcn Andy","site":"shroudstory"}]
