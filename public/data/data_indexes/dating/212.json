But that is not the only aspect your dealing with here Colin and you know that quite well, don’t you. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again it’s one thing to scorch some linen, it’s another to do so with ALL the attributes accompanying that scorch. And that includes creating a scorch which doesn’t fluoresce, a scorch that will create a detailed image with 3D distance information, a scorch that will not effect the blood covering the shroud or bas-relief/statue, …So not so simple when everything is taken into account is it Colin? Anyways, this is only one aspect of the Shroud, there are numerous others to deal with that when one contemplates all of these aspects (as a whole) which we find on the Shroud, one wonders how anyone can possibly refute it’s authenticity?…That is my stand Colin, in opposition to yours and other skeptics and until someone can refute the Shroud with ‘proven’ scientific and peer-reviewed methods, my mind will not change.\nR\n\n","date":"March 5, 2012 at 4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-8963","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry","post":"Ron, he knows he can’t reproduce it.

As for 3D images, the 1532 burns also show “encoded 3D information”, so did John Jackson’s bas relief , and so has every scorch I have produced on linen. So called 3D encoding is not just a characteristic of scorches – the very act of creating one with a 3D object that has contours and different contact pressure points makes it an ideal subject for that kind of relief imprinting. What do the radiationists have to offer re 3D encoding? Nothing. I repeat – nothing – it’s all empty rhetoric, intellectually bankrupt obscurantism.\nYes, there may be tweaking required here and there to reproduce the precise degree of fidelity v distortion – but why make a fetish of the technical details. What matters are the scientific principles – unless one is using technical perfectionism as a means of obstructing progress and understanding – and it’s now abundantly clear to me that quite a number of so-called scientists have been doing just that.\nWho says the scorch does not, or did not, affect the blood. Rogers’ “data” on that scarcely qualifies for that description, being cobbled- together tendentious ad hoc untried and untested methodology that was presented as if it were the last word on the matter.  Yes, there is every reason to think that haemoglobin will be partially denatured by the temperatures that scorch linen, but centuries of ageing will have the same effect  Kindly tell me how one is supposed to distinguish between the two, especially bearing in mind the  extra heat exposure with the 1532 fire.\nYes, i refute its authenticity, because I accept the C14-dating, regarding Rogers’ claims as scarcely credible, and in any case the campaign to discredit and denigrate the\nthree labs for producing the wrong answer is yet another seedy and despicable aspect of this whole affair.

We have no way of knowing if what we judge as perfect on aesthetic grounds bears any relation to accuravy of imprinting, since we do not know what the subject looked like – or even if it was a cadaver or a bronze statue…\nA cop-our on fluorescence? Maybe you can explain to me why dehydrated/oxidized/crosslinked components on the Shroud are non-fluorescent while similar looking scorches from the 1532 fire are. If you can’t, then I would suggest that it is you who is engaged in a cop out in trying to avoid getting involved at anything more than the most superficial level with something where you don’t have the chemical background .I don’t hold a lack of chemical background against you, but I can’t say as I care for internet dilettantes who take the tools of science and then proceed to crudely weaponise them, turning them on  scientists who dare to question your orthodoxy. I am not at all impressed. In fact, if the truth be told, I am hugely bored and underwhelmed with this kind of ritualistic sniping.that substitutes for genuine open-ended research and scholarship.\nRogers test for heated blood was bizarre in the extreme. It was based on whether the blood lost hydroxyproline on heating. Fact: hydroxyproline is a solid, non-volatile amino acid, so how can it be lost on heating? Fact: there are only traces of hydroxyproline in the blood, this unusual modified amino acid being a breakdown product of connective tissue, mainly collagen. It has been described as a marker in the meat industry for just that – for meat, for heated meat – i.e. muscle/connective tissue –  not heated blood.  Inappropriate off-the-shelf methodology? There is also the small point that the Shroud “blood” is so highly degraded by age that it scarcely qualifies for that description anyway. Rogers few words on that heating test are written in a highly peremptory, some might say tetchy manner. One might suspect he was scraping the barrel for arguments against the image being a scorch, and that the scorch suggestion was not one to which he was enamoured – but had no alternative to offer.  I rather fear that he was getting frustrated and/or losing his scientific objectivity at that point in his career. Indeed, one has to ask what it was that motivated an explosives chemist without clinical pathology experience (that I am aware of) to make so drastic a shift in career focus.\nYou are someone else who likes to bandy around the “peer review” mantra – another example of weaponising the scientific method to attack science. Having myself peer-reviewed scores of papers, and been on the receiving end too naturally, i can tell you that it is generally only the grossest of errors that are detected by a referee, who usually has to take a great deal on trust (like that bizarre hydroxyproline test).  Never could that be truer than a situation in which a handful of individuals have privileged access to a few fragments or threads of material, and who are forced to adopt often unconventional visual micro-spotting techniques which yield little or non quantitative data, and where the reporting  and interpretation of results looks somewhat impressionistic to say the least .\nOK, this is the internet, and I expect the flak as soon as I put my head above the parapet. You may score points with this or that debating point, but you will not undermine the intuition, confidence  and nose for a bum claim that 50 years of study, research and teaching have given me in the chemical and biochemical sciences. Yours and others knocking copy – Dan’s especially (I’ve gone right off Dan) is simply water off a duck’s back. Start making some genuine scientific points and I might feel more inclined to talk to you, rather than at you…\nYou and Dan may be pleased to know that I am fast running out of things to say on this site. It would have been nice to hear back from Dr.Di Lazzaro after I told him what I thought of his heated coin test, and of my own (I consider) better-designed experiments using  a range of temperatures chosen empirically to give light scorching, and latterly with a better heat sink than the initial moist sand, and not forgetting the onion epidermis model etc. And I’d still like to know, before signing off, in what way I have been “misleading” in the few words I have spoken regarding that John Jackson work with the hot metal. .\n\n","date":"March 5, 2012 at 7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-8978","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry","post":"\ncolinsberry :\n . . . and I might feel more inclined to talk to you, rather than at you…\n\nColin, this is what you have done from day 1 here – talk at people.

Perhaps people like Colin resist this stance because it is uncomfortably too close to admitting it is likely genuine.\nBut why waste time with dialogue?   Eventually the “discussion” degenerates to the point where the one who is defending the indefensible pretends that by not changing his/her mind, he actually has a point.

We’re told that only those who reject the Spirit of God are damned.   Though Jesus is the voice and presence of this eternal reality in history, he no doubt knew that people could be honestly mistaken about him as a historical figure (to say nothing about those born before his historical manifestation).

No one really cares about these truths on a personal level.\nBut what if there were certain truths which pertained to relationships?  Certainly “I love you” is a truth, however fleeting, which sometimes exists among people.  This is a truth between two living beings, not something cold and impersonal like 2 and 2 make 4.\nThe JudeoChristian religion is the story of a revelation about the relationship between almighty God and humanity (for those of us who believe it).  Indeed, it is the story of God’s relationship to his entire creation (with mankind as the conscious element of it).  God’s manifestation was born in a manger….but as a man.  And not any man, either.  He was born as a Jew: the people who, however imperfectly, stumbled upon the dichotomy between good and evil, and grounded it in a story of God, and rebellion against him (ie, they had Genesis as their foundational text).  In paganism, even the worst of gods was prayed to.  But for the Jews, the devil would always be the devil, and God would always be God.  For them,  evil will always be evil, and God will always be God.  That’s not something you can say about paganism, can you?  Again, in paganism, even the most vile of gods was to be prayed to.\nDismiss Genesis as Bronze Age superstition all you want, but these Bronze Age people were the ONLY ones to stumble upon the dichotomy of Good and Evil (grounding it in beings known as God, and the devil).  Even the Greeks couldn’t grasp the nature of evil.  They posited ethics, NOT morality.  For them, the law was written in the mind, not the heart.  Transgressions against the law of the cosmos could be due to weakness, ignorance, or stupidity….but never immorality.  Ultimately, immorality was a reality which they knew existed, but which they could never fully explain.  It was the Jews who knew the law existed in the heart.\nWho CARES if Peter and Paul believed in a literal Genesis.  Do you really think God would expect them to tell the heathens of the spiritual foundation of the world, AND tell them that the universe was 13 or so billion years old TOO?\nAs far as I’m concerned, God manifested himself to humanity in Jesus of Nazareth.  It was he who purified and distilled the striking dichotomy found only in the Jewish myths.  Yalweh may have supposedly approved of the bloody conquest of Palestine (while still viewing the Caananites as his children), but it was Jesus who in essence said that violence was never sacred.  The Jews may have been entitled to fight for their lives, but it was for them, not God.   Render unto Caesar…\nThat Jesus of Nazareth quite possibly used the Jewish tradition as a light for mankind, telling us that ALL decent people (those who knowingly or unknowingly listen to the voice of God), will be saved and taken to the TRUE promised land, the kingdom of God (not blood soaked palestine), –that the carpenter from Nazareth ultimately told humanity this message and paid for it with is life, I can’t help but feel is a divine message, applicable to all people at all times.  \nAnd no truth can be destroyed, can it?.  It just IS.  Like the Jewish God, ay?\nWhat was it that God told Moses?  “I am who IS”.  Likewise, Jesus IS, hence his (alleged) victory over death.\nThat Moses was a man of his time, and his “reality” was expressed however imperfectly…..well, what would you expect?   God has a relationship to PEOPLE, not computers.  And if some people lived in the Bronze Age…..well, do you really expect them to express themselves as YOUR contemporary?\nAnyway, Colin.  If you think that belief in Jesus of Nazareth is exemplified in the most provincial and idiotic of beliefs, you really need to get out more.  However clumsily I have tried to clue you in to the fact that “Chrisitianity” goes far deeper than most of its detractors care to admit.  And if you call yourself a thinking person, be honest and address THOUGHTFUL versions of Christianity, not just straw men easily demolished.  You’re an academic aren’t you?  Do your HOMEWORK Colin.\nPerhaps this inexplicable “Image of a serene, bearded man” is a subtle message to you that maybe, juuust maybe, there is something to the ancient yet eternal message from the carpenter from Nazareth.\nall the best.\ntony\n\n","date":"March 6, 2012 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-8991","author":"tony","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry","post":"How could you for a second believe you could understand or question whatsoever, what or how God would or wouldn’t do things? …seriously.\nThe other way of looking at all your questions above Colin is; How did a humble linen cloth with a light scorch: (if thats what you’d like to believe), manage to exist two mellenia thru so much turmoil, catastrophies, (man made or by nature) and persecutions to still be here in 2012 to have a retired sciencebod trying to refute it’s provenance?

My Dad could do much the same thing barbecuing sausages.\n\n","date":"March 6, 2012 at 9:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-9009","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry","post":"Re the number of synoptic Gospels – yes, you are absolutely correct. That was a slip of the memory on my part.\nRe toasting bread, you are again correct, well, sort of,  but only in an exceedingly narrow sense that would seem to have little or no bearing on the nature of the Shroud image (unless you are saying that the emitting body was itself red hot).\n With actual physical contact and conduction there can be an intense scorch, but if one has the slightest air gap there is none whatsoever. \nHowever, it one were to contrive a means of placing some linen into a toaster, e.g. by attaching a square to a slice of white bread, then one would indeed see the linen scorch as well as the bread (I’ve done the experiment). It would be a diffuse scorch, one that was not confined to the thread crowns (as per Shroud) and one would not expect to see any well-defined imaging, e.g. of the red hot electric elements.\nSo why is there radiation scorching under these extreme conditions?   It’s because of the Boltzmann distribution of emitted frequencies. To get enough emission of visible red light for an element to glow red hot, one needs an incandescent element that is at 750 degrees C or higher. But there is so much intense (albeit) invisible infrared radiation accompanying that visible light that even the slightest opacity and absorption by linen (or bread) is enough to cause absorption and scorching. In other words – scorching by radiation is possible in the immediate vicinity of INCANDESCENT bodies, emitting huge amounts of infrared radiation.\nIncidentally, bread in that above experiment produces an attractive golden-bown toast colour, which is primarily a Maillard reaction product between carbohydrate and protein. The scorched linen will be a darker, less attractive colour, since lacking as it does appreciable amounts of protein, the scorching is via pyrolysis of polysaccharides alone, i.e. hemicellulose and cellulose to produce dehydrated, oxidised, cross-linked products.\nThe principle of minor/mimimal absorption of radiation building additively to produce near total absorption is seen in storm clouds. Each individual droplet of water is almost transparent to visible white light. But if sunlight tries to pass through millions of suspended droplets then most of it is finally absorbed so as to make the cloud look grey or black to an observer on the ground. But we would still say that water is transparent to light as a general rule of thumb. There are always exceptions that prove (test) the rule.\nIt is not difficult to see why the miracle school of shroud imagery likes to invoke visible light, ultraviolet or x-rays, studiously ignoring the  copious amounts of infrared radiation that generally accompany them in the real world of conventional physics.  Given the relative proportions of the different wavelengths,it is the infrared component that would be the first to scorch or toast any organic material in sight – with no pretty images being formed…. Scorching by direct contact on the other hands DOES produce images (“branding”), and they are light/dark reversed, and they are superficial,or can be,  and show encoded 3D information, and, as said earlier they are confined initially to the the crowns of the threads. More boring old conventional chemistry and physics… But scorching by direct contact would destroy the mystery, would it not, and Russ Breault would have nothing left for his Magical Mystery Tour road show. which I see has been updated to include the side-splitting media reports from Di Lazzaro and those other ENSA clowns…\n\n","date":"March 7, 2012 at 5:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-9014","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry","post":"Well Colin we have all listened to your Hypothesis here for months now.

If I missed anything here guys don;t be afraid to chime in, but that is all I think is needed to prove your hypothsis atleast making it porbable.\nWhat do you think of that Colin?\nR\n\nThere’s too much there to answer succinctly, and a lot of those points have been addressed before. But to take just three:\nSuperficiality of image: the 200nm thickness corresponds to the outermost primary cell wall (PCW) with loosely packed hemicellulose and cellulose fibrils. There are good theoretical grounds for thinking those exposed and vulnerable polysaccharides can be selectively scorched without affecting the underlying secondary cell wall with its highly ordered chemically-resistant cellulose. One can selectively scorch a sheet of dried onion epidermis – just one cell thick-  two PCWs – with no scorching of underlying linen, as I reported recently.\nOnly the top surface of threads, and of a few fibrils? Yup, that  is the signature of scorching by contact with a hot surface, as in ancient branding technology. It’s scorching by contact/conduction that allows one to achieve that kind of superficiality, which is impossible with any kind of radiation, which gives a more diffuse coloration.\n3D encoding: there is no mystery there. All the scorch images I have produced respond to 3D software. So did the 1532 burns, and so did the bas relief models in Jackson’s experiments. One can quibble about this or that detail, but who is to say that the Shroud image is closer to the appearance of the imaged subject than any other. 3D imaging is simply knob-twiddling. There is no science there whatsoever if you have no definite information as to how the original image was formed. \n3D images can be made to look really seductive in the hands of a true artist. Merely arranging to get an oblique viewing angle as if paying one’s respects to reclining deceased loved one can undermine strict scientific objectivity…\n\n","date":"March 7, 2012 at 4:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-9043","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry","post":"Well Bod enough talk “just do it” as the once very popular slogan goes ;-)\nAnyways about your onion experiment, and your link to a picture in your first post above; Notice anything peculiar in your picture? …No? …Well let me point it out; not only did you scorch thru the single layer onion skin but you actually scorched the linen somewhat, take a good look again.

Does this give you any ideas?”\nI’m not sure how you arrived at that Ron. You are aware, aren’t you, that I left an unpeeled section of the onion epidermis in place, corresponding with the centre screw on the template (an aluminium pencil sharpener)? \nOr as your referring to the exceedingly faint yellow cast on the linen?  I doubt very much if that is a scorch. It is more likely a film of caramelised onion. I could launder that bit of linen to confirm, but is it worth it? Do you not consider it remarkable that one can produce a heavy scorch on something just one cell thick, with virtually no effect on the underlying linen?  Yet a lot of heat transfers through, as i know from using a damp underlay, and seeing the steam coming up. provided one does not overdom the temperature, the bulk of the cellulose survives virtually intact. There is little doubt in my mind that a clear distinction needs to be drawn between cellulose crystallites in the secondary cell walls (highly stable) and more reactive and superficial polysaccharides in the PCW. Rogers to his credit grasped that point through seeing the presence of the image in a detachable film under the microscope. He tried to link it with starch and Saponaria acquired in processing, the latter having pentosan sugars, but it was later authors who realized that the outermost layer of linen fibres is the primary cell wall, and that the latter has very loosely packed hemicellulose (with reactive pentose sugars) and non-crystalline cellulose. There is a clear rationale here for selective scorching of a very thin superficial layer(200nm) as a consequence of both botanical and chemical factors. So it’s pointless arguing that a forger had achieved an impossible degree of precision if it is the layered coaxial structure of each and every linen fibre that gives rise to the phenomenon of highly superficial scorching. It would be like a fireman marvelling that the insulation had been selectively burned off electrical wiring while the copper cores remained intact…\n\n","date":"March 7, 2012 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-9048","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry","post":"Bod why do you always take what I say in a negative sense?
