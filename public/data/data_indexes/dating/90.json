On Shroud Scope, these areas are also wholly lacking in scourge wounds. I can’t see that this is necessarily evidence for a loin cloth – presumably a loincloth required as much paint as anywhere else, and should have left as prominent a stain, or, if the shroud was a painting, was the loin-cloth area simply left blank? – but the “white spot” is certainly there.\n\n","date":"December 3, 2014 at 1:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/03/jerry-coyne-pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-174491","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jerry Coyne:  Pope Francis endorses the fake Shroud of Turin","post":"There are lighter areas all over the image!\nYet another theory, the “patchwork theory”, the shades of whites resulting from different patches of cloth applied all over the body…\nAbsurd, you can’t explain the image without being systematic.\n\n","date":"December 3, 2014 at 1:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/03/jerry-coyne-pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-174495","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jerry Coyne:  Pope Francis endorses the fake Shroud of Turin","post":"I have come to the conclusion that the claim is pure gaslighting.\n\n","date":"December 4, 2014 at 3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/03/jerry-coyne-pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-174652","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jerry Coyne:  Pope Francis endorses the fake Shroud of Turin","post":"The problem with Coyne is that he makes atheism look bad. This is not the first time that he has grasped at straws without really digging into the sudject just for the sake of antagonizing the religious crowds. I for one am surprised that he cites the 2009 copy at all, since we know that one failed to live up to the expectations, it only *looked* the same. Now he sticks to Charles’ hypothesis without even bothering to search for the concerns expressed by his fellow skeptics.\nSimply put, Coyne is not a scientist. He is only peddling his own beliefs. And the irony is that he is doing exactly the same thing that is ever so often critisized of the shroudies, indulging in fields that are far from his expertise.\n\n","date":"December 3, 2014 at 2:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/03/jerry-coyne-pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-174496","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jerry Coyne:  Pope Francis endorses the fake Shroud of Turin","post":"* criticized\n\n","date":"December 3, 2014 at 2:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/03/jerry-coyne-pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-174497","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jerry Coyne:  Pope Francis endorses the fake Shroud of Turin","post":"Coyne does not stick to my hypothesis. He continues to refer to the Shroud is a fake while my argument has always been that it was never intended to deceive anyone but was used in the Easter ceremonies and, as such, would have been treated with great reverence. No forger would ever have produced a cloth with images on it when there was no reference to such images being on the grave clothes in the tomb.\nWhat other people later made of the Shroud is and continues to be another story.\n\n","date":"December 4, 2014 at 2:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/03/jerry-coyne-pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-174576","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jerry Coyne:  Pope Francis endorses the fake Shroud of Turin","post":"Coyne is, at the very least, exploiting your ideas to push his agenda.
