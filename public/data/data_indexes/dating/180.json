[{"title":"Tetherd Cow Ahead has facts on Shroud of Turin all wrong","post":"Oh whatever. The details are trivial – a medieval repair/C02 contamination/incorrect calibration – I’m sure Shroudies could come up with a million reasons why the actual facts don’t fit with your theories. It doesn’t matter if someone dumped a truck full of scientific evidence at your door, you’d still cling to the irrational idea that the Turin Shroud is something other than the most likely explanation suggests, that is, a medieval forgery. I note you didn’t even attempt to address my question about why Christians seem desperate to get scientific proof that Jesus Christ was resurrected. Aren’t you just supposed to have Faith?\n\n","date":"August 26, 2008 at 7:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/08/26/tetherd-cow-ahead-has-facts-on-shroud-of-turin-all-wrong/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-13","author":"anaglyph","site":"shroudstory"}]
