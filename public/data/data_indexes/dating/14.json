Read “The Rape of the Turin Shroud” by William Meacham and you’ll see that I’m right about that.\nIn sum, Gonella, in my book, is the one to blame the most and we must also blame the member of the pontifical academy (Chagas) who was in charge of supervising the building of the protocol and also the C14 labs for having say “yes” to this kind of bad protocol.  They should have said “no way” if at least 3 different samples could have been used.  But, on the other hand, it’s very easy to understand why they all decided to proceed anyway…  It’s because they knew they would get a great publicity and fame (and probably also more contract and money) by doing this kind of mediatised dating test.\nIn the end, the preservation of the relic (it’s “look”) was more important than finding the real age of that cloth and that’s a shame because it would have been certainly easy to take some threads in various places while not really affecting the look of the relic.  In such a bad context, they should have kept the Shroud in his reliquary in 1988 and do nothing at all.

In football terms it almost feels like piling on at this point. The ’88 dating is essentially useless, does it make much difference to know to what degree it was useless?\n\nIt’s a mistake in my opinion to write off the 1988 testing on grounds of sampling deficiencies. Best to regard what we have as a ranging shot, one that gives a high degree of confidence in the analytical procedures per se, given the reasonable degree of concordance achieved between the 3 laboratories, and the different clean-up methods employed.\nWhen different laboratories are approached to collaborate on a particular project, I suspect that a particular kind of modus operandikicks in – the routine inter-laboratory multicentre collaborative study that generally leads to particular variants of analytical protocol being pitched against each other, and one or other being selected finally as having the edge over others chosen as “official” method, i.e. winner. What generally happens is that each lab is given the same sample to analyse (or range of samples) that have been highly homogenized to reduce sample-to-sample variation. Each lab then tries to obtain an answer that is deemed most accurate and most precise.\nSo it’s possible (what follows is pure conjecture) that the three labs did not see their initial role as one of dating the Shroud, but of producing an accurate and precise answer for whatever fragment – or fragments –  of the Shroud that were given to them. That does not seem unreasonable as a first step – with a conservative single sampling site having finally after much wrangling been decided upon (on whose final authority I am still not clear about). After all, anyone with a grain of common sense would know that an artefact like the Shroud cannot be randomly sampled at multiple sites if it leaves it disfigured. Even if more than one sampling site had been permitted, it might seem overkill to have 3 or more labs of (then) uncertain pedigree all tackling the task, needing three times the material that a single lab would have needed. So why not compare the three labs’ performance first on a single inconspicuous sampling site, then select the lab whose data inspires the greatest confidence to tackle the big question – the age of the Shroud from multiple sampling sites? \nOn paper, one would have expected one of the labs to have been invited back for that Phase 2 analysis (or even draw lots if all were deemed equal to the task). Why did it not happen? Shell shock maybe? The Vatican and Turin authorities had been so seduced by the “wealth of historical and other evidence” adduced on sites such as this one in favour of Shroud authenticity that they had largely discounted any possibility of three labs all dating the artefact to the 13th/14th century.\n\n","date":"May 7, 2013 at 5:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/07/an-email-from-professor-christopher-ramsey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-33199","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An email from Professor Christopher Ramsey","post":"Here’s an interesting story reported by William Meacham in his book « The Rape of the Turin Shroud that said a lot about Gonella’s responsibility in the fiasco of the C14 dating » :\nShortly before the C14 dating of the Shroud in 1988, Meacham wrote a letter to Steve Lukasik of the STURP team (the team was still on the line to do a new series of direct tests on the Shroud AFTER the C14 sampling) and to Luigi Gonella.  In this letter, Meacham gave them 2 very important suggestions in order to make sure that the 3 sub-samples used for the dating were truly representative of the main body of the Shroud.  Here’s the 2 suggestions :\n1- That a micro-sample (3 to 5%) be removed from each lifted sample before they are dispatched to the C14 labs, and these tiny pieces be either sent to STURP, or held in Turin, for detailed testing by STURP for contaminants.\n2- That STURP run a specific set of examinations (for example : micro-Raman spectroscopy, an analytical spectrometer, UV fluorescence, etc.) at the points where C14 samples were lifted in order to find if there were any alien organic or inorganic compounds.\nAfter reporting these 2 suggestions that would have make all the difference in the world, here’s what Meacham wrote : “There was no response from either Lukasik or Gonella.  Looking back and knowing what we know now, it was a huge pity that these two suggestions were not taken up.  THE FAULT LIES SQUARELY WITH GONELLA, SINCE, AS HIS POWER CONSOLIDATED, HE RAN (AND SEEMINGLY REVELED IN) A ONE-MAN SHOW FOR THE DECISION-MAKING ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE CARBON DATING ENTERPRISE SAVE THE LABORATORY’S OWN INTERNAL PROCEDURES.  STURP was clearly in disarray, and Gonella probably had to leave them on the sidelines.”\nNow, unless Meacham is an idiot or a very naive man (which I really don’t think he is), I think the story he told us here show with great evidence the very bad job done by Gonella in 1988 as the scientific adviser for the C14 dating.  \nAnd in the very next page of his book, Meacham wrote also this, which speaks very loud too : “(the day of the sampling), Gonella and Riggi finally decided to cut a single strip approximately 1 cm wide by 8 cm long, weighing 300 mg, right next to the small cut that had been made in 1963 at the corner of the cloth to provide the textile expert Raes with a sample.  THE REASON, AS GONELLA TOLD AL ADLER, WAS THAT “THE SHROUD WAS ALREADY CUT THERE”.  Adler called this the worst possible reason.”\nThe simple fact that Gonella told this to Adler prove what I wrote on the blog yesterday concerning the fact that he was much more interested to preserved the visual integrity and “good look” of the Shroud than to learn the true age of that cloth.  And coming from the scientific adviser of the Church for the C14 dating, that’s a real shame.\nLast question to conclude :  If Gonella was so innocent than some want us to believe, then why did he stayed on board of that sad project all the way?  If he was so competent as a scientist and if the decision to go ahead with a so risky protocol was not is own decision (meaning that he would have been forced by the Church to shut his mouth and keep on defending this project), then is only duty would have been to drop out of that sad project before the sampling was done.  The truth is :  HE DID NOT!\n\n","date":"May 8, 2013 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/07/an-email-from-professor-christopher-ramsey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-33226","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An email from Professor Christopher Ramsey","post":"There was no fiasco.

That speaks very loud…  And if Gonella was locked-up by the Church (reading Meacham’s book, this hypothesis doesn’t appear to be realistic at all) and wasn’t able to do his job properly, then he should have step out of this bad project well before the day of the sampling.  That’s how he should have acted.  But instead, he kept silent to Meacham’s critics and very wise suggestions, and in the end, he stayed on board with the very poorly planed protocol he had in hand…  In my mind, that’s not a great sign of profesionalism.  \nThere are only 2 ways to conclude on Gonella’s case :  1- Gonella was an opportunist and wanted to stay on board of that very publicized project.  Or 2- He was totally incompetent to do this kind of supervision job for a C14 dating (remember that Gonella was not even close to have been an expert in C14 dating).\nIf we believe Meacham, the answer #2 is the right one…  In my mind, all this fiasco start right there :  the Church authorities made a very big mistake by choosing someone like Gonella to do the supervision of an important dating project like that.  That’s exactly where the fiasco of 1988 started.  So, we can say that Gonella is the one to blame the most but, in reality, that’s not fair.

Whatever gave you that idea?\n“Radiocarbon dating using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) differs from the\ndecay counting methods in that the amount of 14C in the sample is measured directly, rather than by waiting for the individual radioactive decay events to occur. This makes the technique 1,000 to 10,000 times more sensitive than decay counting. The enhanced sensitivity is achieved by accelerating sample atoms as ions to high energies using\na particle accelerator and using nuclear particle detection techniques. Additionally because of the increased sensitivity, counting times are greatly reduced (minutes to hours, instead of days) and sub-milligram sample sizes can be routinely measured. Because of this, a greatly increased range of sample types and sizes can now be measured that previously gas-proportional or LSC counting techniques could not.” \nhttp://www.radiocarbon.com/PDF/Beta-AMS-Methodology.pdf\nHow can you possibly make claims for the superior accuracy of radioactivity if the amounts needed are too large to be practical?

In other words, it doesn’t matter how many nutrients are in the skin of a potato (say). If folk eat most of their potatoes without their skins, then those (potential) nutrients are not nutritious.\nApplying the same principle, measuring the age of the Shroud by its radioactivity is not accurate if no one can use the procedure on account of its low sensitivity requiring gram quantities of linen. To invoke radioactivity as the gold standard when just one carbon atom in a trillion is C-14 is simply to pull the wool over people’s eyes. It’s got to be AMS of nothing (unless a third method were to be discovered)/ Yes, of course AMS data have to be handled with circumspection, and of course they may not be as accurate as one would wish, but all of that and more is implied in the term ‘state-of-the-art’, the one with which you took issue, seeming to assume it meant superior in all respects. It doesn’t mean that at all – it simply means a refinement of existing technology, or, in this case, a break with it, providing a new approach that may overcome one or more  insuperable drawbacks with what preceded it. In this instance, it is sensitivity that is the crucial factor, but when 3 labs each produce a medieval dating for the Shroud there is little scope for attacking the methodology per se, and claiming it to be less “accurate” than another method that is too insensitive for its accuracy to be assessed, at least with the Shroud.\nAs for the reams of knocking copy on the AMS Shroud dating in general, you do realize, don’t you, that the contamination/reweaving hypothesis is a totally separate issue from how the C-14 was measured, since reweaving (had it occurred) would have given an elevated value for C-14 no matter how measured? Personally, I don’t think it did occur, and I consider Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta paper with the ‘donated’ threads of dubious provenance, with alleged end-to-end splicing, re-dying etc etc to be one of the more bizarre offerings I have encountered in the Shroudology literature. It’s hard to imagine any other mainstream journal accepting that paper (which he submitted to what was essentially his own in-house journal, having helped establish it, while employed inconspicuously as a thermochemist  working for the US Government on safety aspects of chemical explosives, and who served for many years on its editorial board).
