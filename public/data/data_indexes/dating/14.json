[{"title":"Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin Again?","post":"Dan,\nMy gut feeling is that the Vatican  would consent to an valid, open  protocol for testing  the Shroud, the day after they ordain the first woman priest and the pope performs the first marriage of a priest. Recent collateral  events reinforce the proposition that the Vatican is intent on controlling the story. On the other hand, a new pope which seems likely in the not too distant future could change things.\nThe Shroud is a physical Revelation made in our time through science. As that reality grows, I am not sure how Rome will handle that.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2012 at 7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/carbon-dating-the-shroud-of-turin-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-10946","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin Again?","post":"I personally don’t think the Shroud will ever be carbon dated again. I am not even sure any new testing at all will ever be done.  I don’t see that there is a will to undertake all the logisitics necessary to make it acceptable to all parties.  The position of the Church, calling it a “symbol of Christ’s sufferings worthy of veneration” gets them off the hook.  Who can argue with word, “symbol”?  It is a smart position for them to take…not calling it a relic or an icon.  That position however allows them to be perfectly comfortable with the ambiguity regarding the carbon date or any other unanswered questions of science.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2012 at 9:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/carbon-dating-the-shroud-of-turin-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-10949","author":"Shroud Encounter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin Again?","post":"For the Vatican, whether the Shroud is authentic or not is not that important.  The importance is to whom this image refer to !!!  Jesus is much more important than his image (whether it’s real or not) and the Church have understand that perfectly…  Our faith MUST rely on a living person, Jesus-Christ, and not on his burial Shroud or his image.  And we must never forget that the Church position about the authenticity issue is completely link with the scientific research.  So, because it is that way, you can be sure that the Church will NEVER problaim this cloth to be the authentic burial cloth of Jesus since science will NEVER be able to do so !   It’s truly impossible for science to claim, without any doubt at all, that this cloth is really the one of Jesus.  And that fact was clearly stated in many STURP publications.  Of course, with all the circumstantial evidence we know about that cloth, the most likely conclusion, for the moment, is that this cloth is the authentic burial Shroud of Christ.  But it’s just that : Circumstantial evidence.  It’s different from an undeniable scientific proof…  So, forget about a proclamation of the Church who would say : the Shroud is authentic.  That will never come, even if many clergymen believe that this cloth is authentic.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2012 at 6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/carbon-dating-the-shroud-of-turin-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-10967","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin Again?","post":"John and Russ, you are probably right.

Also, in the documentary where we see him speak to Barrie Schwortz, he said that the charred material that was taken off the Shroud during the restoration and kept in Turin ever since would make very good samples because, in his mind, this kind of material could not have been affected at all by the Thymol treatment of the reliquary…  And remember that we speak about a chemical treatment of the reliquary of the Shroud, and not the Shroud itself !!!

It leaves open the possibility that an uncontaminated sample of the shroud could be first century.  Again, to not acknowledge this is just disingenuous. \n3)  If there had been an invisible reweaving, a mixture of 16th century cloth and first century cloth would produce results very close to the mean results of the Oxford lab.  (See http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf.)  Once again, in this scenario, there is real possibility that the shroud could be 1st century.\nAlong these lines,  I just borrowed from my local library Freeman’s book, “Holy Bones, Holy Dust:  How Relics Shaped the History of Medieval Europe”  In a book of over 300 pages, the only thing Freeman says about the Turin shroud is “Calvin also criticizes a shroud in which it is claimed that the body of Christ was wrapped while he was in the sepulchre.  (It seems similar to the shroud then in Chambery, now in Turin, but there were many such shrouds by the sixteenth century.)  However, as Jewish burial custom requires the head to be wrapped separately and John’s Gospel specifically states that ‘a napkin which had been over his head’ is described as lying apart from the other wrappings in the tomb (20:6), then that in itself is enough to destroy the authenticity of the shroud.”\nHow many of those “many such shrouds” have had hundreds of thousands of hours of scientific analysis?  Given the fact that the Turin shroud, even if it is a fake, was significant in both Italian and French medieval history, I find it amazing that less than 100 words were devoted to it.  And for the life of me, I cannot understand the argument that a napkin negates the possibility that the Turin shroud was one of the other wrappings.  To me, to so easily dismiss something that is probably the most studied object in human history, is the height of disingenuousness.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2012 at 4:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/carbon-dating-the-shroud-of-turin-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-15187","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin Again?","post":"For some reason, in my previous email, the quote from Freeman, which was to follow “Freeman wrote,” did not appear.
