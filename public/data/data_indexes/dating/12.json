[{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"So we are being asked to believe that there was just one part of the Shroud – a mended corner – which by pure chance happened to be the area that was selected for C-14 dating, despite any irregularity being noted by the fabric expert Mechthilde Fleury-Lemberg. \nThat sounds statistically improbable, to say the least. If it’s defended by saying that the corners were especially subject to wear and tear, needing occasional repair, nay expert, painstaking invisible reweaving (but with more modern C-14 replete thread, further stretching credulity) then what about the opposite corner on that side?

I’m not sure what is to be gained by retracing the steps. Dan refers to the Marino-Benford paper of 2005. It can be found at the shroud com site under benfordmarino. \nA more recent paper is even more telling. “Chronological History of the Evidence for the Anomalous Nature of the C-14 Sample Area of the Shroud of Turin” by Joseph G. Marino and Edwin J. Prior, 2008.  It lists and discusses some 45 points of evidence over some 27 pages plus an Appendix.  It can be found at:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/chronology.pdf \nIt includes a few web references to houses which specialise in invisible mending of the type. I recall one such is http://www.withoutatrace.com located in Chicago. Their web-site describes their skills and craft. \nUp until about 1842, the usual method of displaying the Shroud was for it to be suspended hand-held by five bishops. There are many contemporary illustrations of this method, clearly most deleterious to the cloth. Only subsequent showings from 1868 had it static in a frame. Although much of the comment postulates a 16th century reweave, it is quite possible that it was actually done as late as 1868 when Princess Clotilde replaced the backing silk lining. That would certainly skew the C14 tests. \nThiebalt Heimburger has written extensively on the absence of cotton contamination elsewhere.  I have recently seen photographs of the STURP team closely examining the Shroud all over in microscopic detail.  They are all insistent that the Raes sample is the only location where there is cotton contamination. \nIt all comes down to the poverty of scientific thought in electing to take non-representative samples, for such an important crucial test. This is quite irrespective of the farcical way in which such decision was made. As for so-called “ranging shots”, no artillery officer would ever depend on one such, as his final attempt to win any battle.\n\n","date":"October 18, 2013 at 7:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-47877","author":"daveb of wellingon nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"When you are one of just three AMS labs invited to test the Shroud, there is no “poverty of scientific thought” in agreeing to the decision (almost certainly not theirs) to test three contiguous strips from the one corner sample (though it may be politically naive). One’s immediate concern would be with how one’s answers  look alongside those of the two other labs. Will the results be reasonably concordant, and help to establish the credibility of some very sophisticated technology, one that sorts atoms by mass, or will the results differ so much as to bring the technique into disrepute, vis-a-vis the alternative but less sensitive method based on counting radioactive disintegrations?\nIn the event the answers from the three labs were reasonably concordant, i.e. 1260-1390, so it’s hard to see where the “poverty of scientific thought” comes into it, except to further beliitle the contributions from the three participating labs. One can only assume that the commentator has no experience of the collaborative inter-laboratory trials that are routine in analytical protocol development. I have experience of several, notably in dietary fibre and resistant starch analysis, where each lab receives samples from a single batch of test material which are then separately analyzed, each lab following its own protocol, and results then displayed and published, warts an’ all. On those results can depend which particular variant is adopted later as the international standard for analysis. So there is absolutely no reason for any of those three labs thinking that they were engaged in a futile exercise, merely because they were all working on the same corner specimen. As I say, it could be regarded as a ‘ranging shot’ exercise, and most folk should appreciate why one of those is needed even in a military context, thus giving rise to the expression. The idea that perfect targeting for a perfect outcome can be achieved in one fell swoop is simply not of this world.\nBut I have a stronger criticism to make of the comment. Why is there no call for a repeat determination, now that we have confirmation that the AMS procedure can give reasonably concordant answers in the hands of different laboratories, using different variants? Suppose the same medieval range of dates were obtained from 5 or 6 different sites chosen at random, making it impossible to sustain the argument that all had been invisibly mended.  Would some new grounds be sought for protesting against a “poverty of scientific thought”? \nThere are times one wonders whether the perceived crime of those analysts was less to do with coming up with the wrong answer, and more to do with coming up with the right one.  ;-)\n\n","date":"October 18, 2013 at 8:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-47881","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Your defense of the labs is so absolute that it weakens your case.

Ltd, world-renowned makers of Double Damask Linen, resulted in their perception\nthat the sample was “touched up to prevent unraveling.” They further observed, “We\nhave to say that we see the twill pattern clearly on both sides, but still there is something\ndifferent left versus right.” (Ferguson & Co., 2000)\nIn a second blinded examination of photographs of both the Zurich and uncut C-14\nsamples, European-trained weaver David Pearson, owner of the French Tailors in\nColumbus, Ohio, immediately recognized the disparate weave pattern and differences in\nthread size, stating “there is no question that there is different material on each side…(B)It is\ndefinitely a patch.(/B)”[(referring to what we have highlighted in Figure 2 as the pink section)] (French Tailors, 2000). He stated that medieval European weavers would typically try to match the original cloth and then hand-stitch approximately ½ inch of\nnew material into the old, such that it was invisible to (B)all but the trained eye(/B). This would ensure the long-term integrity of the material, while maintaining aesthetic consistency\nthroughout the fabric. This type of detail to repairs would be consistent with the wealth\nand devotion of the Savoy family, who owned the Shroud at the time.\nIn a third blinded analysis of the Zurich C-14 sample, by Albany International, Louise\nHarner remarked that “the float is different on either side of the sample” (Albany\nInternational Research Company, 2000). It forms a thick/thin, thick/thin pattern on the\nright side, whereas the left is much more consistent throughout (see Figure 6). This is\nprobably due to the fact that each side of the pattern was woven independently, possibly\ncorroborating Pearson’s belief that part of the sample was a patch.”\nAll boldings mine.\n\n","date":"October 18, 2013 at 2:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-47907","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"So I found that (B) and (/B) (I) doesn’t work (/I), maybe (b) and (/b) ?\n\n","date":"October 18, 2013 at 2:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-47909","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Hugh,\nIt is impossible to exclude a reweaving (particularly if it is based on some kind of splicing technique) just looking at some photos.

It’s the subsequent history of that thread that is also in question, up to it suddenly being conjured up like a rabbit from the hat for Rogers’ microscopy etc. So it’s not “honesty” that is on the line, certainly nobody’s here surely for questioning the propriety of events that were supposed to have been fully in the public domain and on the record. \nNo, it’s not about honesty, so much as transparency.

The names of everyone involved in the decision-making re the radiocarbon dating should have been on the 1989 Nature paper. But important names are missing, meaning that key individuals were unaccountable for their actions and decisions.\nKnowing what we know now, if the full list of names had been on that paper, then a case could have been made for having the paper withdrawn through failure to get straight answers to straight questions- and not, repeat not because of any serious methodological failings on the part of the three radiocarbon laboratories, but because of the murky circumstances surrounding the sampling decisions and procedures and subsequent deployment of undocumented material, the provenance and history of which we are expected to take on trust.

C-14 is only one cog in the wheel.\n\n“Did the image formation process itself (whether it occurred by some bio-process 2000 years ago, or by a yet unknown medieval process) affect the cloth and its carbon reading?”\nNo, not unless there was a  totally unexpected phenomenon beyond the realms of known science, aka a miracle  (like C-14 atoms changing their half-life through faster or slower radioactive decay). But the radiocarbon dating was not intended to prove or disprove a miracle. It was intended simply to date by a known method with its strengths and indeed limitations. \nWhatever your misgivings about the objectivity of science, there is a simple remedy if you doubt the results of any given scientist – or group of scientists –  namely to demand that the findings be confirmed by others, or that modifications be made to the experimental procedures to take account of legitimate objections.\nSo why are you not pressing for a re-dating? Is it because you think it improbable they will come up with what, for you, would be the right answer? If so, one has to ask whose objectivity and bias is most in question – your own or that of those dodgy untrustworthy scientists posturing as if totally infallible – which in my experience wins neither friends nor admirers at scientific congresses, a modest, measured, patient, systematic, occasionally self-critical MO being much better received and indeed expected.\n\n","date":"October 18, 2013 at 10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-47892","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"I’m all for re-testing (with improved protocols and different labs).

No other part of the shroud shows\nsuch a coating. The early thermal evolution of furfural during pyrolysis/ms analyses, the relatively easy water solubility, the yellow color formed with iodine, and the easy hydrolysis\nsuggest gum Arabic. Gum Arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal and is composed of pentose-sugar units. Its presence as a major component in the coatings on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is not a surprise, because it has long been a common vehicle in tempera paints. The radiocarbon sample had been dyed. Dyeing was probably done intentionally on pristine replacement material to match the color of the older, sepia-colored cloth. The gum is probably the same age as the Raes and radiocarbon yarn and should have no effect on the age determination. In any case, this water-soluble, easily-hydrolyzed gum would have been removed completely by the cleaning procedures used on the dated samples[1].\nThe dye found on the radiocarbon sample was not used in Europe before about\na.d.1291 and was not common until more than 100 years later [6]. The combined evi-\ndence from chemical kinetics, analytical chemistry, cotton\ncontent, and pyrolysis/ms proves that the material from\nthe radiocarbon area of the shroud is significantly different from that of the main cloth. The radiocarbon sample was thus not part of the original cloth and is invalid for determining the age of the shroud.

And in fact , laboratories and British Museum have all the cards in their hands, they can give us conflicting accounts how the measures were performed, and samples cut, adjusting them to any proposed patch theory. Maybe this seems a little bit conspiratory, but very likely the statistical analysis of raw data was somehow manipulated. Stephen Jones also thinks so. Gonella and Turin Colonetti’s Institute refused to sign the result of the analysis.\nSee also:\nhttp://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p09.pdf\n“Also in the ventral missing-corner section, which we hypothesize to consist of\nrestorative surface dyes and what was likely an undocumented “invisible” medieval\nrepair, is the section from which the 1973 Raes sample was extracted for analysis. In this\nsample, Raes found that the side seam had been attached to the adjacent main Shroud by\na 2-ply- linen sewing thread (18).By removing the sewing thread, Raes was able to separate his sample into two distinct pieces, which he identified as “Piece 1” and “Piece 2.” Each piece exhibits different characteristics, such as cotton content, lignin content at the growth nodes, and thread size, suggesting two different origins of the yarns.”\n\n","date":"October 19, 2013 at 10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48027","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Also from: http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p09.pdf\nIn terms of the C-14 area in relationship to the water stain, which has been posited to be much older than the 1532 fire and also impacted the sample area (31), photo analysis demonstrates that this latter assertion is incorrect. This photograph, when placed next to an image showing the location of the reserve versus C-14 sample, clearly\ndemonstrates that the entire C-14 sample area was outside the water stain region. The crease can be used as a marker to compare the two photographs and location of the C-14\nsample. Further, it is also notable that the reserve sample does not appear to have any water stain markings. According to the illustration of the water stain area, the stain should have gone directly through the mid-section of the reserve sample forming a distinct marking discoloration. Since the sample does not show any evidence of a water stain marking, this could very well be explained by the later addition of a patch in this area.\nEmphasis mine.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2013 at 10:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48029","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"“Do you really think that they showed to the experts this compressed to minimize its size photo that is included in pdf version?” Yes, OK, I think they might have done. Is there any evidence to the contrary?\n“Arizona did not send in FOUR, but EIGHT ‘paired’ dates, each pair measured the same day, with the same set of standards and blanks. The EIGHT ‘dependent’ dates were combined in FOUR “independent dates.” Arizona seems to have set aside the thinnest piece of the two samples it received, and cut the other one in half. According to Marino and Benford’s patch hypothesis, Figure 2, one of these halves was pure patch, and the other one mostly shroud, with a little bit of patch at the top. One of these halves was set aside (later to be studied by Freer-Waters). The other half was cut into four, and these four samples independently burnt and reduced to little carbon pellets. At least two of these pellets were either pure shroud or pure patch. Each pellet was subjected to two “sputterings.” There were thus eight actual readings from the four samples tested. Each sample had its two readings averaged, to produce the four “independent dates.” Had there been a 16th century patch over a 1st century cloth, as speculated by Benford and Marino, then at lest two of these dates would have been pure 16th century or pure 1st century. This is not borne out by the published dates.\nIncidentally, it was good of the Arizona crowd to submit both their dates for each sample. If the Oxford labs used all their sample for burning, they had enough for about 6 “sputterings” of each of their three divisions of their sample. What a pity we don’t know what they were.\n“it is also notable that the reserve sample does not appear to have any water stain markings.” That’s perfectly true.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2013 at 11:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48034","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nCharles Freeman :\nWho has provided a ratio of old versus new threads in any sample from the Shroud?

My point about Roger’s paper not being secure is that there are too many questions left open and assumptions made without sufficient evidence to evaluate them. Rogers tries to cover a lot of ground but only provides ten references for the whole of his paper. It just left me with questions that are unresolved.\n\nFrom: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part3.pdf\nExcept perhaps the amount of cotton, all that I found is consistent with Raes’ claims: Gossypium herbaceum inside the linen thread. However, given the amount of cotton I found, there is another possible hypothesis: the mixture could have been the result of a willful act. The spinner could have spun together flax fibers with some cotton fibers as it was sometimes carried on in the Middle-Ages (and this is still the case today). This would be consistent with Rogers’ finding of a unique dye on Raes/radiocarbon fibers because cotton is known to retain the colors much more easily than linen.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2013 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48030","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nHugh Farey :\n Arizona seems to have set aside the thinnest piece of the two samples it received, and cut the other one in half.

(emphasize mine)\nWhen, how, who received these samples, the “chain of evidence” etc…\nThe answer could not be found in a single document.\nI had to read many published and unpublished documents (in Italian and English) coming from Gonella, Riggi, Rogers, Adler…comparing them and trying to understand.\nNow I understand why Rogers could write what he wrote.\nI have some evidence that his radiocarbon samples came truly from the CENTER of the radiocarbon sample. I am just waiting for an important testimony.\nEverybody is able to understand that I have to write a comprehensive report, which is not compatible with partial comments on a blog (even on the very interesting Dan’s blog)\n\nMy original question was to with who knew (at the time) that a sample had been covertly removed from the centre, and Thibault’s reply in his earlier comment seemed to imply that he knew at the time, i.e.1988, or shortly thereafter, that he had been privy to matters that have been ‘succesfully’ kept under wraps for a quarter of a century.\nhttps://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/#comment-47917\nThat interpretation was based on his “Who? Me”.\nIt was on the basis that he knew at the time, and had chosen to say nothing all these years while controversy has raged over Rogers’ claims based on that mystery sample that I suggested he should tell us immediately everything he knew, and not keep us in the dark one day longer.  I would not have been so insistent if, as now seems possible, he is saying that his knowledge is derived from second hand literature and document researches that are still ongoing.\nI suppose I should apologize for any misunderstanding, but even allowing for the fact that English is not Thibault’s first language, I do think his rather abrupt “Who? Me” made it seem as if he had known from the start about that entire murky business with the covertly retained sample and its uncertain chain of custody, and that he was being less than helpful in announcing he knew the facts while telling the blogosphere that it would have to be patient a while longer. That did not strike me as good netiquette.  But if he’s only recently formed some tentative conclusions and feels he needs more time to document them to his satisfaction, then fair enough, I withdraw my initial protest.\n\n","date":"October 20, 2013 at 5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48158","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"}]
