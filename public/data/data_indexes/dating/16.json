It is to be hoped that those able to attend will depart better informed as a result.  An inspection of the Program available at: http://www.stlouisshroudconference.com/app-get-involved/program\nwill show that it is full on, with many of the papers only given about 30 or 60 minutes of presentation time.  \nClearly the emphasis has been given to presentation time only, which raises a concern that issues raised by the more contentious papers will not be given the airing needed to explore and argue pros and cons, or how solid is the evidence presented, or to challenge assertions made which some may feel are needed.  \nThe example that Dan gives above would only be one such perhaps of many others that need to be challenged and argued before the informed forum of those attending.  It would seem that presenters will have their way and air their ideas, but will depart without being given the benefit or opportunity of full discussion, which might lead them to improve or refine their ideas, or for that matter adopt an entirely different approach, or even backtrack.   \nI imagine that everyone will have a great time, and I wish the proceedings well.  Doubtless the more contentious items will be discussed during the various social get-togethers, and participants may come to their own conclusions.  But these can hardly form part of the official record of the formal presentations.  At the various conferences that I attended during my professional career, the official record of proceedings always included the record of discussions following each paper, and everyone was all the wiser for it.  I do wonder how much discussion will be possible at St Louis, with such a solid agenda.\n\n","date":"September 16, 2014 at 8:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/16/and-interview-with-lind-and-antonacci/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-151435","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Interview with Lind and Antonacci","post":"We plan to have an online discussion between authors and readers–no requirement to have attended the conference.

That would not be a Resurrection. It would be a “radiating away”. The men/angels at the tomb on the First Easter morning told the first visitors that Jesus had risen, “egerthe” in Greek. When you get out of bed in the morning and go from horizontal to vertical you “egerthe”. Resurrection means the entire body rising. Release of neurons would be radiating away, not resurrecting. If Jesus “radiated away” then HIs post death appearances were apparitions, they were not the same body that was put in the tomb on the first Good Friday. If He radiated away, He is still with us today, His atomic make-up now chemically combined with everything impermeable that got in their way as they were emitted from His body, such as the fibers of the linen cloth, the walls of the tomb, the Sudarium and so forth.\nThe conclusion that Jesus body emitted atomic radiation is a very serious one for it challenges the very heart of Christian doctrine.\n\n","date":"September 16, 2014 at 5:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/16/and-interview-with-lind-and-antonacci/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-151541","author":"tomdevins","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Interview with Lind and Antonacci","post":"Peter Enns in his latest book, ” The Bible Tells Me So…-Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read it” argues that the words in the bible should not always be taken literally.

However, one’s skin (to take an arbitrary example) completely regenerates every month. Over 30 years, that 360 complete skins replaced by new cells created from food. Some of it is recycled internally, some simply flakes off, perhaps 3kg a year. During his life, Jesus, in common with everybody else, lost about 100kg of his skin to the environment.\nThen there’s hair, fingernails, and general proteinacous waste coverted into urea, etc. It is doubtful if any at all of the neutrons Jesus died with, were the same neutrons as had been part of him 10 years previously. Real bodies continuously replace themselves. A hypothesis that the resurrection consisted of a rapid loss and replacement of the material of Jesus’s body need not trouble theologians.\nScientifically, it’s wholly incredible, but that wasn’t your point, I think.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2014 at 3:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/16/and-interview-with-lind-and-antonacci/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-151664","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Interview with Lind and Antonacci","post":"Science doesn’t know everything about creation, and maybe there are some things about creation that it will never know.  Do parallel universes exist, or multi-verses?  We do not know and we may never know.  It is fair to speculate providing we are logically consistent and can agree about semantics.  I might speculate for example that this universe in which we exist is actually a subset of a higher universe.  A goldfish might imagine that his bowl is the entire universe, but we might place him in some other aquarium.  For him, he has moved to a different universe.  An ant on a table may imagine that the universe has only two dimensions, but we say there are actually four which are commonly known, although some would have it there are actually ten or twelve but the others are curled up.  \nAt the Resurrection, the body of Jesus was transformed in a way that we do not understand, except the bounds of our known universe were no longer any constraint for him.  After some forty days of popping in and out of his friends presence to say goodbye, he returned to his Father.  \nTo talk of the emission of neutrons, and other atomic particles, is trite.  These are bounded by this world, in a way in which the resurrected body of Jesus was not.  For Him, this world of ours was merely a subset of a higher universe, and maybe that’s the real secret of the Shroud image.  But of course, that’s only my speculation, and neither I nor anyone else can demonstrate it by any experiment!  But just maybe, it will be revealed to us one day, but probably not in this life!\n\n","date":"September 17, 2014 at 6:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/16/and-interview-with-lind-and-antonacci/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-151790","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Interview with Lind and Antonacci","post":"1. Do parallel universes exist, or multi-verses?\n2. I might speculate for example that this universe in which we exist is actually a subset of a higher universe.\nYes Jesus mentioned about many mansions. So may I speculate that there are material Universes as well as Spiritual Universes. Recent studies in NDE proves this. There is a spiritual body as well as a material body for each human. Even Jesus mentioned that at resurrection we are like angels. So I strongly believe that Jesus resurrected spiritualy rather than materialy. Image on shroud is an evidence for that. So dematerialisation of the material body by emiting radiation seems to be true for me.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2014 at 7:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/16/and-interview-with-lind-and-antonacci/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-152048","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Interview with Lind and Antonacci","post":"“So I strongly believe that Jesus resurrected spiritualy rather than materialy.”\nSorry, Sampath, I disagree.  Jesus’ resurrection was material, but in a way that is beyond our present understanding.  This is demonstrated by: a) Body not found; b) the post-resurrection encounter with Thomas recorded in John;  c) He walked and spoke with apostles on his journey to Emmaus, although it took them some time to recognise him; d) He cooked breakfast for them while they went fishing e) Mary Magdalen mistook him for the gardener.  None of these suggest a ghost, an apparition, or pure spirit, but the manifestation of a corporeal person.     \nHis body was transformed.  It did not perish in the grave.  That is at the heart of Christian belief.  That is why I speculate that this universe is a sub-set of a higher universe.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2014 at 7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/16/and-interview-with-lind-and-antonacci/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-152053","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Interview with Lind and Antonacci","post":"Yes According to Gospels Jesus appeared and then again disapeared.

You are only seeing either spiritual body (whatever that might mean) or material body.  There is more.  When we die, we only survive as spirits and leave our material body behind, and we must await the general resurrection at the end time.  That didn’t happen to Jesus.  After his death, his body was living and  tangible.  A spirit is not tangible.  What did the American bomber pilots see over San Giovanni Rotondo during World War II?  They saw a brown-robed friar appear before their aircraft, and they were unable to release their bombs?  A pilot later visited the friary at Foggia, and identified the friar he had seen as Padre Pio.  How can a spirit prevent pilots releasing their bombs? The friar had been at two places at the same time.  Our universe was no constraint for him.  It is interesting that according to reports, monks of other religions also appear to have remarkable abilities.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2014 at 10:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/16/and-interview-with-lind-and-antonacci/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-152085","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Interview with Lind and Antonacci","post":"Thank you Daveb\nThat didn’t happen to Jesus.

Was it just the empty tomb?  Was it just the burial cloths set aside?  Or did he see the image?  We do not know! \nJohn 20:11-12:  “11 But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping.  And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb 12 and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.”\nDid Mary see two angels, “one at the head and one at the foot where the body of Jesus had been” Or did she interpret the sight of the image as angels?  Again we do not know, but we just might interpret the text that she may have seen the image.  \nVolckringer patterns:  Check the following paper for a comparison of the Shroud image with these patterns:\n“THE IMAGE FORMATION PROCESS OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN AND ITS SIMILARITIES TO VOLCKRINGER PATTERNS”; by JOHN A.
