[{"title":"Should Pope Francis Call for New Test?","post":"The Church has at its disposal many truly scientific minds. The Pope, as a Jesuit, would have likely know and have personal connections to many of them. A qualified appraisal team could be formed to do the heavy lifting on accepting/rejecting proposals. It’s a tender like any other, just based more on scientific process than costs.\nThe great value to the Church would be to demonstrate that faith and reason are not mutually exclusive. What better way to engage in dialogue with a skeptical world than to work together on this project.\nThe whole journey would make for a fascinating documentary….Mr Rolfe?\n\n","date":"January 27, 2014 at 10:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/27/shroud-pope-francis-call-for-new-test/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-74828","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should Pope Francis Call for New Test?","post":"Who is BT Dan?

When you piece together all of the evidence, it becomes obvious.  If you’ve ever taken a walk down a sidewalk in the Fall, you’ve no doubt seen where leaves have fallen onto the sidewalk, then blown away by the wind after a time, they leave a detailed image on the concrete that shows you exactly what that leaf looked like.  Quite simply that’s what has happened to the shroud when it was used to cover Jesus.  A very dim image was left by steam coming up from Jesus to the shroud.  Then, anyone who has taken photography knows exactly what happened, complete with bloodstains that indicate what had been done to him, including the thorny crown.  Earlier efforts to throw people off included sampling patches applied to the shroud to hold it together after the fire that damaged it.  Those patches should not have been used to carbon date the shroud.\n\n","date":"January 27, 2014 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/27/shroud-pope-francis-call-for-new-test/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-74830","author":"William C.

To augment their tests, they also used samples which had been preserved in thymol, and found the dating derived from them to be “reliable.” They suggest a “far reaching possibility of dating profiles investigated in the past, from which macrofossils have already been identified and collected (and thus preserved in glycerine-thymol-ethyl alcohol mixture).”  I agree that confirmatory testing should be carried out, but it looks as if Rogers’s fears may have been unjustified.\n\n","date":"January 27, 2014 at 3:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/27/shroud-pope-francis-call-for-new-test/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-74860","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should Pope Francis Call for New Test?","post":"Don’t be crazy If the pope is the owner of the cloth he has to have influence and responsibility for the cloth and in particular the tests  and if necessary limit tests, other-wise if it was left  to the scientist’s discretion and unbelievers there would be little if any-thing left after they had finished testing.\nHe just cannot relinquish care and responsibility for if he is the owner it is actually the church and he the spokes-person.and care-taker.\n\n","date":"January 27, 2014 at 5:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/27/shroud-pope-francis-call-for-new-test/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-74882","author":"Rob Belz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should Pope Francis Call for New Test?","post":"What’s needed is a highly targeted and accordingly least-damaging approach, restricted to answering crucial questions.

As for me, I’m hung up on demonstrating that the Shroud image is a  simple contact heat scorch before being willing to consider alternative hypotheses (given the all-too-apparent defects in the latter). \nSo far, the heat scorch hypothesis has yielded explanations for most of of the macroscopic properties, uv fluorescence excepted (ageing effect?)  and is making headway on the microscopic one too. The chief problem  has been in separating fact from fancy. One is expected to take so much on trust  e.g that the TS image is confined to a < 200nm coating, based on some poorly documented experiments with sticky tape, tweezers and a light microscope. One feels that there has to be some unexplored middle ground between that and your high tech surface probes – probing for what exactly?\nPersonally, I think the Shroud image affects the entire diameter of the fibre, as I said today on my current posting, addressing the neglected question as to why image fibres are mechanically weaker than non-image ones. That’s probably because the susceptible heat-sensitive hemicelluloses are distributed throughout the entire inner core (SCW) as well as the ultra-thin outer PCW, but they tend to be overlooked on account of the preponderance of heat-resistant crystalline cellulose in the inner core. \nRay Rogers, rest in peace, saw only the cellulose. He appeared to have a blind spot for easily scorched hemicelluloses. Thus the \"starch impurity coatings\", putrefaction amines, \"Maillard reactions \" etc etc. There was a 'cobbled together' look about his dismissal of scorching by plain old heat. But then some of us suspect he was an authenticist at heart. No harm in that, provided one has the mental discipline to preserve objectivity. Sadly, he lost it towards the end, but one makes allowance for long illness. Scientists are only human, after all.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2014 at 2:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/27/shroud-pope-francis-call-for-new-test/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-75187","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"}]
