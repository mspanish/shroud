But ‘IF’ this documentary covers most all that has been found and mentioned before, then it should be quite interesting to view, especially for those who have not taken the time to investigate all the ‘funny stuff’ related to the 1988 radiocarbon dating. I look forward to viewing this documentary in anticipation of possibly any new evidence.\nR\n\n","date":"October 30, 2012 at 3:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/30/another-article-on-francesca-saracinos-la-notte-della-sindone-documentary/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-18613","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another Article on Francesca Saracino’s “La notte della Sindone” Documentary","post":"I had understood that it was supposed to be available in the U.S. around now (it’s already dubbed into English for the Italian parts.

That’s funny. Both Gonella and Riggi were there to decide and have heated arguments about the site from where the samples had to be cut. Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, OCD did not take that much interest, at least in the beginning, apparently because of his “Carmelite spirituality,” but years later he gave an interview to an Italian magazine saying that he had been manipulated and expressing sadness about what had been done. Father Werner Bulst told German TV that there was a “plot”, and I had first-hand confirmation about what he was referring to. So it will be important to see what fresh information Franco Faia brings.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2012 at 8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/30/another-article-on-francesca-saracinos-la-notte-della-sindone-documentary/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-18667","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another Article on Francesca Saracino’s “La notte della Sindone” Documentary","post":"Your not implying that ‘some’ church officials had any dubious dealings with the C14 issues are you? ;-)\nI think it would have been more appropriate to state “Greatest Conspiracy of All Times” then specifically Greatest ‘scientific’ cheat of all times….Can I say conspiracy? LOL. The whole thing was a sham, from the Church’s dealings to the scientific testing to compromised results. It is really truly a wonder, that a documentary of this type has not come to light much much earlier…or maybe one has, but has not been given much press.\nR\n\n","date":"October 31, 2012 at 1:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/30/another-article-on-francesca-saracinos-la-notte-della-sindone-documentary/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-18681","author":"R","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another Article on Francesca Saracino’s “La notte della Sindone” Documentary","post":"Who are you?\n\n","date":"October 31, 2012 at 6:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/30/another-article-on-francesca-saracinos-la-notte-della-sindone-documentary/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-18685","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another Article on Francesca Saracino’s “La notte della Sindone” Documentary","post":"\nLouis : Father Werner Bulst told German TV that there was a “plot”, and I had first-hand confirmation about what he was referring to.

It is the result of people within the Church doubting the authenticity of the relic even before the carbon dating. Curiously, Professor Carlos Chagas, who did not believe in authenticity either, prepared the best protocol, which was thrown by into the dustbin. It seems the co-producer of the documentary is RAI and for that reason something good can be expected. Whatever is said, it better be something really new and convincing because the “plot” does not seem to have affected the decision about the sample and the results.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2012 at 7:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/30/another-article-on-francesca-saracinos-la-notte-della-sindone-documentary/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-18686","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another Article on Francesca Saracino’s “La notte della Sindone” Documentary","post":"OK,  Louis.

The focus should be on what has been called “many questions unanswered.” It could something about what exactly Cardinal Ballestrero was referring to in his interview without going into details and there appears to have been treachery there, treachery coming from those who “manipulated” him. If my guess is correct the document will tell us who the traitors were and, on my part, I wish to see why they acted that way and if it is in agreement with what I was told. Best.\n\n","date":"November 1, 2012 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/30/another-article-on-francesca-saracinos-la-notte-della-sindone-documentary/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-18719","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
