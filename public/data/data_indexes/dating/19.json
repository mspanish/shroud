[{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Clarifying Details on the Reweave Theory Development","post":"Worth throwing these into the discussion in case they get overlooked. \nJohn Jackson, 2008: ‘While this hypothesis [the reweaving theory] has been argued on the basis of indirect chemistry [the Quad Mosaics?], it can be discounted on the basis of evident bandings in the 1978 radiographs and transmitted light images of STURP. These data photographs show clearly that the banding structures (which are in the Shroud) propagate in an uninterrupted fashion through the region that would, ten years later, be where the sample was taken for radiocarbon dating.’ In other words the undisturbed banding showed that this was the original cloth and had not been rewoven.\nFlury-Lemberg, ‘The Invisible Mending of the Shroud, the Theory and the Reality’, 2005.  Having argued  in this paper that invisible reweaving was always detectable by the trained eye, in particular because it could not be concealed at the back of a cloth, Flury-Lemberg noted that the fabric of the Shroud was in a good state of preservation and when she examined the corner where the radiocarbon sample had been taken, she reported that ‘its weaving structure is cohesive and untouched even at the corners. Therefore at no time has the need to reinforce the corner parts arisen!’   Flury-Lemberg concluded that ‘neither on the front nor on the back of the whole cloth is the slightest hint of a mending operation, a patch or some kind of reinforcing darning to be found.’\nIf Lyfe is right in saying that Wilson also rejects the reweaving theory  then there is a lot of evidence against it, among the authenticists as well as sceptics. Hugh seems in good company.\n\n","date":"January 23, 2014 at 4:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/22/comment-promoted-clarifying-details-on-the-reweave-theory-development/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-74204","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"}]
