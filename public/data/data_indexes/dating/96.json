[{"title":"KC’s Science-Based Life and the Shroud of Turin","post":"I fully agree with this reader comment.  And I would like to add this :  I believe the shroud is genuine but I don’t mind at all that there is skeptics out there who challenge his authenticity.  This is healthy for the debate.  At least, I hope those skeptics can be honest and go where the FACTS lead them.  \nAlso, I want to say that it’s not the skeptics I fear the most in the shroud world but what Ray Rogers call “The lunatic fringe” !  Those who want to use the shroud to “prove” the resurrection of Jesus.  They try hard to prove what science will NEVER be able to prove.  Those are the real dangerous people out there…\n\n","date":"May 12, 2011 at 10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/12/kcs-life-based-science-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-3117","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"KC’s Science-Based Life and the Shroud of Turin","post":"I also want to say that honest christian (like I am) can see, with the shroud, a SIGN of the resurrection of Jesus but never a PROOF.  I think it’s really important to understand this distinction…  The shroud to me is a sign of the resurrection, just like the empty tomb was.\n\n","date":"May 12, 2011 at 11:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/12/kcs-life-based-science-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-3118","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"KC’s Science-Based Life and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Thank you for your kind words and criticism. I would say however, that although these kinds of discussions may seem like “preaching to the choir” for those of us who are involved in science and skepticism, I think that a site that promotes science and skepticism towards the general public is valuable. Keep in mind, most of this is unknown or uninteresting to the laity.\n\n","date":"May 12, 2011 at 11:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/12/kcs-life-based-science-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-3123","author":"SciPhile","site":"shroudstory"}]
