[{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"Authenticists are very much divided as to exactly why the radiocarbon date is “wrong.” A number of hypotheses have been suggested, some of them mutually contradictory, and different factions support different ideas. Some ideas have been quietly dropped in the face of   clearer evidence to the contrary. The “bioplastic film” hypothesis of Garza-Valdez and Mattingly was a good idea for its time, but is generally rejected now, and John Jackson’s CO enrichment hypothesis failed in the face of actual experiment. Benford and Marino’s “patch” hypothesis, in its literal meaning, in which one side of a herringbone spine was 1st century and the other side was 14th century, has been modified to the “interweave” or “reweave” hypothesis, although opinion is still divided as to whether this involves the interweaving of new threads alongside old threads for at least a part of the mending and strengthening process (for which there should be, but is not, visible evidence), or whether the old threads have been unravelled for a small length and new threads spliced into them and glued with terpene, and then the whole section rewoven to be truly invisible. In view of the unrealistic intricacy of this work, and the fact that it would be a unique mend in the history of textile repair, and the generally shoddy nature of all the other repair and maintenance of the Shroud, this is also rejected by many, although Rogers, Heimburger and Fanti’s Vanillin and Cotton findings continue to keep the possibility alive.\nJackson is currently wedded to some kind of nuclear enrichment process, and has no need of any interweave or contamination hypothesis, which he rejects on two connected grounds, firstly that photos of the area show uninterrupted threads and groups of threads (bands) extending right through the radiocarbon area, and secondly, that therefore there is no evidence of the 60% or so medieval material necessary to provide the skewed date.\nOne other argument against medieval contamination has also been put forward by various people, which is that the coincidence of having exactly the right amount of contamination to provide a date exactly matching the first undisputed mention of the Shroud’s existence is too great to accept.\nNow, what was the question? Oh yes…..\nGood authenticists, like good non-authenticists, do not “just ignore” evidence which goes against their current thinking. On the contrary, they welcome it, as it provides the “proof of the pudding” which, if they can explain it, strengthens their case, and if they can’t explain it, suggests opportunities for further research.\nOver to you, good authenticists!\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 5:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192768","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"Dear reader.\nThe whole “refutation” by Jackson of the reweave theory is actually one single sentence taken out of the context from the short article  that was written by Jackson on the request of Barrie Schwortz. As Barrie writes on his page:\nDavid Rolfe’s 2008 BBC documentary features physicist John Jackson, co-founder of the 1978 STURP team and founder of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado, and discusses his new hypothesis regarding the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, based on possible c14 enrichment of linen due to the CO (carbon monoxide) in the atmosphere. According to Jackson, a 2% contamination could skew the resulting date by as much as 1400 years. Rather than attempt to describe Jackson’s theory myself, I asked John to write a short article to describe it in his own words.\nThe article can be found there:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/jackson.pdf\nWe read there:\nWhile this hypothesis has been argued on the basis of indirect chemistry, it can be discounted on the basis of evident bandings in the 1978 radiographs and transmitted light images of STURP. These data photographs show clearly that the banding structures (which are in the Shroud) propagate in an uninterrupted fashion through the region that would,\nten years later, be where the sample was taken for radiocarbon dating. \nAside from some personal considerations (reweave theory was rival for his own carbon monoxide theory, and was proposed by Rogers, with whom Jackson was at odds), not everyone agrees with Jackson assesment of those data. Alan and Mary Whangers claimed in their presentation from 3rd International Dallas Conference on the Shroud of Turin (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/whanger.pdf ):\nTo help clarify this issue, we examined in detail the area of the C14 specimen on the\nradiographs. An irregular band of threads with increased radiodensity and extending variably about 5/8 inch (1.7 cm) into the Shroud fabric is noted immediately adjacent to much of the length of the seam that borders the frontal MC. In a close-up view of the area where the Raes sample and the single C14 sample were taken, irregularities in some of the weave pattern can be noted on the Shroud fabric adjacent to the seam. (Figure 18) There is significant variability in the radiodensity of both warp and weft threads in this area. Some of the threads angulate, and the continuity of a few seems to be broken. This area is denser and the 3:1 herringbone weave pattern is much less obvious than in the nearby body of the Shroud fabric. Our conclusion is that the radiographs are strongly suggestive of significant alterations in the threads and weave of the Shroud fabric in the area from which the C14 specimen was taken, thus casting major doubts on the validity of the radiocarbon dating. \nBesides as Hugh described, the patch consist probably of the new threads spliced and glued together with the old. This suggest that repair might have passed unnoticed on the STURP radiographs and transmitted light photographs as there would be (appaerent) continuity of the threads. Beside such continuity is observed also between side strip and main body of the Shroud, even despite we know that they were originally separated (see http://www.shroud.com/adler2.htm ).\n.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192775","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"“even despite we know that they were originally separated.” Actually, both Whanger and Adler conclude that the side-strip was not separated, but is continuous with the rest of the cloth.\nWhanger: “Our conclusion then was that the side strip is continuous with the rest of\nthe Shroud.”\nAdler: “Therefore we conclude that the side strip is actually continuous with the rest of the Shroud.”\nRaes, of course, had a piece that separated into two sections as he investigated it. Whanger explains this quite sensibly by suggesting that when the two corner pieces were cut off, the longitudinal cuts were longer than the lateral cuts, leaving two flaps of cloth whose edges were then were tucked or rolled into the seam.\nHowever, I believe that there is no further evidence for damage and repair, and certainly no suggestion that the radiocarbon corner had each (or even many) of its 70 or so weft threads and 30 or so warp threads unravelled, twisted into new thread, glued and rewoven. The evidence Whanger brings forward for this (particularly Figures 17-20) are X-rays of three or four layers of cloth superimposed, from which no conclusions can, in my opinion, be drawn.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 7:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192778","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"Hugh, is there any evidence of a repair, reweave in the sample area?

The false color photographs are not intended to be interpreted chemically. They are subjective evidence for the non-uniformity of the shroud materials, supported by the findings or cotton in the test area.  The shape or size of a patch is not at issue. Combined with the historical evidence that dates the shroud to before 1260, and valid concerns about dating ancient textiles (e.g. British museum mummies), the point is that the C14 date is now questionable.  More evidence could be found by microscopic study of the sample area, a non-destructive test.  The coincidence of the 14th century date could just as easily be considered a case of selection bias: the labs got the date they were hoping for, so they ignored the obvious gradient in their results.  Any bachelor’s level engineering student could tell us that a gradient means the data is incomplete, and needed information lies outside the test boundaries.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 9:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192859","author":"Matt Kowalski","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"A reasonable point, Matt. However the non-uniformity of the Quad images is, I believe, more a feature of the illumination of at the time rather than anything to do with the Shroud material itself. As you no doubt know, all the Quad images are characterised by bright blue bands across the whole width of the Shroud. I have not read anyone at all, particularly not Quad devotees, attempting to characterise these bands as evidence of non-uniformity of the material. The green corners are evidence of the illumination falling off at the sides, and possibly of the changing angle of the illumination; any possibility of identifying subtle changes in the material is wholly swamped by these illumination variations.\nSecondly, this “the labs got the date they were hoping for” canard is often raised by those who would like to discredit their findings.

Are the 1988 test results reliable? The clear answer is NO, they are not reliable. The statistical considerations (X^2 and other statistical tests, presence of gradient among dates), as well as considerations about the region (various anomalies, compared to the centre of the cloth) clearly show us that the results are unreliable and cannot be trusted.\nBut the next question is:\n2. Are  the 1988 test results wrong? The answer is PROBABLY, based on the tests itself, and Yes based on other considerations. Remember, even badly performed measurements can give true results. To know if the 1988 date is wrong, we need other, historical, chemical etc. data that would prove the Shroud must be older. Here we have those data (Robert the Clari account, Hungarian Pray Manuscript, Rogers’s vanillin) showing that the Shroud must be much older.\nBut the next question is:\n3. Does the Shroud date to the first century?\nThe answer is WE DON’T KNOW.\nThe problem is that most people consider only two options, either the Shroud dates to circa 30 AD, or it dates to circa 1350 AD. \nBut this is oversimplification.\nEven with the wrong results of the 1988 tests, the Shroud could still be a fake from another era, from the 4th, 6th, 8th century.\nSo the next question is \n4. Could the Shroud date to the first century?\nThe answer is also WE DON’T KNOW. To determine that, we should determine whether it is possible to skew the dates from the 1st century to 13th century. \nFor today, given the 66-75 % treshold of the new material introduced, if the 1st century date have to be maintained, and given all the facts we know, the only realistic option for this to be true seems the reweave theory.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2015 at 4:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192882","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"I need no primary school lessons in Shroud 101, Science 101, and certainly not in Sampling Theory 101.

Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years”.[ = Raymond N. Rogers, 2004, Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin, TCA paper]\n>Rogers concluded from this that the Shroud is much older than the earlier purported estimates…\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/page/5/\n>… However, there is another pitfall lurking here if Rogers thought that vanillin was a volatile material, going by the aroma from old wood.  That could conceal a major source of error if his sleeping partner, Dr. S.T.Kosiewicz of the title, was not aware of it. … etc. … etc. …\n>… while the nose can readily detect vanillin at exceedingly low concentrations in air, it’s in fact a white solid with a quite high melting point (82 degrees C).  So when Kosiewicz measured remaining “vanillin” (read coniferaldehyde) at 70 degrees C, he would have been measuring some of the vanillin end product that had failed to vaporise, still being a solid with low surface area.  But when he raised the temperature to 100 degrees, the vanillin would then be liquid, with a larger surface area, larger vapour pressure, and been able to escape more easily causing less interference in the measurement of remaining “lignin”. You see, the exponential nature of the reaction rate means that any small errors at the higher temperatures is likely to translate into major errors in estimating the tiny rates of decay under normal environmental temperature.\n>There’s an “if” here, namely  that Kosiewicz was measuring lignin by disappearance, using the Wiesner test, rather than some more specific test. But we are not told how he did his chemistry. Thus the title (and chief complaint) of this posting.

Des fibres de ce fil s’échappaient, en effet, de sa partie centrale et d’autres fibres situées à ses deux extrémités se trouvaient positionnées en sens inverse. Anomalie qui avait déjà été remarquée en 1988 sur le seul et unique fil qu’examina au microscope le Pr Edward Hall du Laboratoire d’Oxford (Cette anomalie, pourtant elle aussi avérée, n’a pas non plus été évoquée lors de la toute dernière communication de Madame Metchild Flury-Lemberg. On ne peut que le regretter).\nI also wrote about the 1982 unofficial attempt at radiocarbon dating the TS:\n“Comme beaucoup de gens encore aujourd’hui, ils (Tite et al) ignoraient qu’en 1982, un minéralogiste de renommée mondiale, le Pr George R. Rossman du laboratoire de l’Institut Technologique de la Californie (« Caltech ») à Pasa-dena, avait déjà procédé d’une façon non officielle, à un test radiocarbone sur la relique. Le micro-échantillon daté en secret6 avait consisté en un seul et unique fil d’environ 8 cm tiré à partir de la zone de l’échantillon semi triangulaire7 prélevé, en 1973, par le Pr Gilbert Raës ; zone jouxtant celle précisément où avait été extrait l’échantillon C14 officiel.\nLe fil dont une partie était apparue enduite d’une couche superficielle plus sombre avait été coupé en deux. On avait alors abouti, pour le même fil, à une datation à deux extrémités encore plus hétérogènes que celle obtenue en 1988 par les trois autres laboratoires : le IIe siècle pour la partie apparemment non contaminée et le XIIe siècle pour l’autre partie pourtant décontaminée (soit un différentiel de mille années !). Rossman ne publia jamais son résultat.\nEn 1988 tout comme en 1982, le principe même de la datation par la méthode éprouvée du radiocar-bone ne pouvait être mis en cause. Pas plus qu’on ne pouvait douter du sérieux avec lequel furent, à chaque fois, effectuées les mesures de la teneur en radiocarbone surtout lorsqu’on sait qu’en 1988 les diverses phases de la procédure classique de mesure furent doublées voire même triplées pour certains des microéchantillons lors de mesures d’essai. Que des microéchantillons provenant de la même aire du drap puissent refléter cinq points diffé-rents dans le temps (le XVe, XIVe, XIIIe, XIIe et IIe siècle de notre ère), permet de conclure, de toute évidence, non pas à des erreurs aléatoires (hasard statistique ou approximations commises au cours de l’analyse) mais à une erreur systématique due à l’hétérogénéité des échantillons testés. En d’autres termes, cela signifie que toute cette série de datations 14C erratiques du même objet ne pouvaient être dû qu’à un prélèvement d’échantillons de provenance douteuse et à la non élimination de carbones plus récents malgré les traitements physiques et chimiques de nettoyage employés par lesdits laboratoires. En fonction de la valeur réelle du test du khi2 (valeur faussée dans le rapport officiel, 5 pour 1,04), il existe très exactement pas moins de 98,96 chances sur 100 pour que les différences des dates moyennes entre les 3 laboratoires soient dues au manque d’homogénéité du matériel daté en 1988.\nSelon le physicien en radiocarbone français Jacques Évin, pour concilier la date historiquement possible du Ier siècle avec la fameuse datation en âge moyen de 1260-1390, (soit avec la mesure radiocarbone 663 ± 65 années avant la date de référence de 1988), « l’échantillon atypique idéal » devrait avoir été formé, d’un poids de carbone moderne égal au poids de carbone du lin originel ou bien, dit autrement, être composé à 50% de fibres de 1858-1988 et à 50% de fibres du Ier siècle de notre ère parfaitement mêlés. D’après une autre estimation par le physicien américain John Jackson, il était possible que cette proportion fut de deux tiers/un tiers8 (66%-33%).”\n2/Statistical sleigh-of-hand (Reminder)\nAs a foot note: “Annoncé officiellement à 5 % (soit juste le seuil de validité admis), le niveau de signification (ou degré de cohérence) des résultats interlaboratoires, une fois recalculé, s’avéra être totalement faux. Il était, en fait, de 1,04 % c’est-à-dire bien en dessous du seuil critique impliquant, soit qu’une erreur systématique avait été commise au cours de l’analyse (ce qui n’était pas le cas) soit que l’échantillon n’était pas homogène (ce qui était précisément le cas). Ainsi, “par obligation de résultat”, Mme Sheridan Bowman, la responsable de la partie statistique de l’expérience, avait-elle « arrondi » ce chiffre de 1,04% » à 5%. On ne peut que regretter cet excès de zèle par complaisance envers son patron, le Dr Michael Tite. Celui-ci n’avait, en effet, jamais fait mystère qu’il ne croyait pas à l’authenticité du Linceul de Turin.”\nIt just seem the recurrent presence of spliced threads (coton with linen) found in the TS Raes-C14 corner and Tite and Bowman’s gross statistical sleigh-of-hand are just anecdotal pieces of evidence in Hugh’s eyes…\n\n","date":"March 10, 2015 at 5:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-193029","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"Richard:\n– But, doesn’t that contradict the 95% confidence level?\nNo, confidence level is actually entirely different thing:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval\nIt is the probability of the true result being within the mentioned interval (1260-1390 AD in this case), assuming that measurements were performed correctly.\nIf measurement were done incorrectly (which is most likely the case here), 95% confidence level is meaningless then.\n\n","date":"March 10, 2015 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-193050","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"That’s a widespread misunderstanding between confidence interval and significance level.\nLet’s go back to nature’s article:\n“The spread of the measurements for sample 1 [the shroud] is somewhat greater than would be expected from the errors quoted.”\n“somewhat greater”??? that’s the art of British understatement… it is rather the worst scattering acceptable, with a significance level at 5% (according to their own test, chosen a posteriori).\nOnce you’ve accepted this shaky significance level, you can do the math to determine whatever confidence interval.\n\n","date":"March 10, 2015 at 10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-193056","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"Charles Freeman:\nMarch 10, 2015 at 7:18 pm\n“There is explanations consistent with what has been found.\n1) The flax with which the Shroud was woven was spun in a a place where cotton was also being spun -(we know that this happened) and fibres of cotton became embedded in the yarn.

One reason was that the skills required to spun flax and cotton were so similar  that there was one guild of cotton and flax spinners, for instance at Cremona, so that they did not make a rigorous separation of the two materials.  The other was that linen threads and cotton THREADs ( not fibres!) were often woven alternatively in cloths known as fustians.\nRaes who was an expert on this made the same point.\nFirst we need  evidence of a woven part of the Shroud with cotton THREADS in it . Then if that evidence is found we need an explanation of why the threads were woven into the Shroud at all.\nIf the reweave is largely in linen, why would there be any cotton added to it especially as this would make nonsense of an invisible reweave? Then there is the old question of why repair this part of the Shroud and not other areas which actually needed it. ( Remember Flury- Lemberg made the point that she saw no reasons why this corner of the Shroud needed attention.)\nIt makes sense  to stay with the simple explanation that cotton fibres drifted into the Shroud either when the flax was being spun or when the yarn was being woven. I hardly think it is worth doing but if access is even given to the Shroud again, it would be interesting to make a study of the proportions of cotton in the different bands of the weave.  Again I have  never understood how Rogers knew there was no cotton elsewhere on the Shroud – I didn’t realise anyone had actually looked under a microscope to see – it would have been a long job to cover the whole Shroud!\nIt is surely time to see the presence of the cotton fibres as irrelevant in terms of challenging the radiocarbon date.\n\n","date":"March 11, 2015 at 12:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-193132","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?","post":"MPH, You was scathing about Hugh (and the Cotton/Linen fact)…\nBut you have forgotten the past criticism by G.

Cardamone\n(a researcher known to the “Shroudies”), read the Bibliography of the paper related\nto the Historic Artifacts published in 2001… Not the Perkin Elmer paper, 2011] about\na particular version of that technique.\nInstead he sketched a particular perspective about the “poker holes”.\nHe indicated the following techniques :  UV-Vis, IR, Raman, TOF-SIMS …\nas useful methodologies to verify the hypothesis that the origin of that\nfamous “L” is not due to combustion, disregarding the AFM and CFM\n(= Chemical Force Microscopy).\nAnd I say these words taking apart the fact that, after the restoring of the year 2002,\nthe inherent area changed (= it became a big hole instead of a little one)\nif I am right in my remark…\nAfter having indicated the idea of these controls on the reminds of the past “L”\n(= what was the area near the “poker holes”), he suggested the use of\nmass spectrometry on water marks\nin order to compare the results with other sites without waterstains.\nI presume he wanted to indicate the TOF-SIMS controls that (unfortunately)\naren’t “non-destructive controls”…\nIn any case : do you remember the strange question of gamma irradiated samples\n(that I indicated few days ago) and the interesting changes in water adsorption?\nWell… this case is near similar our problem (to solve without destructions) …\nSee also: the possible exact interpretation about the inherent “chromatographies” on linen!\nThe AFM techniques can also be useful in the case of the tests\n“on the Holland cloth and on the patches removed in 2002”.\nBut Barberis indicated only (and vaguely) “spectroscopic tests”…\nSo …\nWhat was the meaning of this particular “smoke on our eyes” of the year 2012?\nHow is possible to show a very good project of SPM (Scanning Probe Microscopy)\nline system on linen without any previous true help from the Laboratories?
