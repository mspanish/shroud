One pair of subsamples from each textile was treated with dilute HCL, dilute NaOH and again in acid, with rinsing in between (method a).  The second pair of subsamples was treated with a commercial detergent (1.5% SDS), distilled water, 0.1% HCL and another detergent (1.5% triton X-100)…”.\nagain: How could prof. Jull have found in his sample wax, spores, iron oxide if the 4 subsamples were treated?\n\n","date":"December 24, 2010 at 9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/12/24/more-about-julls-paper-in-radiocarbon-journal/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2008","author":"domenico","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More About Jull’s Paper in Radiocarbon Journal","post":"Ann Hedlund, the textile expert consulted by Jull, established that the warp fabric count is 30 yarns per cm (76 per inch) and the weft is 40 yarns per cm (102 inch).\nThat is very strange since other experts counted differently:\nTimossi: warp/40 weft/27\nRaes: warp/38,6 weft/25,7\nVial: Warp/37,6 weft/25,8\nVercelli: warp/36  weft/24\nHedlund/Jull: warp/30 weft/40\n\n","date":"December 27, 2010 at 7:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/12/24/more-about-julls-paper-in-radiocarbon-journal/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2028","author":"domenico","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More About Jull’s Paper in Radiocarbon Journal","post":"It’s time for independent observers to examine the hold-back reserve to determine whether there is any support for the Ray Rogers-Joe Marino-Sue Benford thesis (I could add more names but you get the point.)
