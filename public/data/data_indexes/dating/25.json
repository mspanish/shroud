For one thing, it’s unlikely that Rossman would confess to a stranger over the telephone.\n– Secondly, it’s unlikely that he’d say that he didn’t want to discuss the matter any further just after confessing. While people sometimes do things that had seemed unlikely, and the scenario Benford described might have occurred, we’re being asked to accept a sequence of events that’s improbable upfront.\n– Benford made some misleading claims about the 1988 tape of Adler, and she claimed to have had an unlikely telephone conversation with Rossman. Has Rossman similarly been misleading or made unlikely claims in a relevant context? Not that I’m aware of. I see no way to deny that Rossman has more credibility.\nYOU MAKE A BLANKET STATEMENT “Benford made some misleading claims about the 1988 tape of Adler…”  YOU GIVE NO SPECIFICS–WITH ALL THE IN-DEPTH DETAIL YOU HAVE IN THIS ARTICLE YOU GIVE NO DETAILS TO BACK UP THAT STATEMENT.

Is it important to know? And why?","post":"Joe,\nWe’re in a situation in which reputations are at stake on both sides. If you’re going to frame this situation as one involving “casting aspersions”, then there’s no way to take a position on these matters without casting aspersions in one direction or the other. If it’s wrong in principle to do that to your wife, then it’s wrong in principle to do it to somebody on the other side. But that’s what you’ve been doing.\nMy reference to misleading claims was about the distinction between Jerry Wasserman and George Rossman. In your 2002 article that Caltech responded to and your later reply to Caltech, you say that Adler identified the scientist in question as Rossman. That’s misleading. If Adler gives both the first and the last name of the scientist, and both names differ significantly from George Rossman, then making an unqualified statement that Adler identified Rossman is misleading. Your claim could have been made without any intent to deceive, yet still be misleading. (Elsewhere in my article, when discussing whether people like Heller and Adler lied, I refer to “lying”. I deliberately avoided that sort of terminology in the section we’re discussing. I was intentionally leaving the language ambiguous.) For reasons I explained in the article, it’s probable that Adler was referring to Wasserburg. To lead people to the conclusion that Rossman was identified instead is to mislead. Even if the misleading didn’t involve an intent to deceive, it’s still a form of misleading that Rossman hasn’t been guilty of in any relevant context, as far as I know.\nWhen Ray Rogers raised doubts about your wife’s credibility, as described in the Ottawa Citizen article I cited, did you respond to him with the sort of all-caps, “I AM EXTREMELY UPSET” approach you’ve taken here? Rogers’ comments were harsher and more dismissive than mine. I think my comments were more restrained than they needed to be and appropriate for the context.\nYou and your wife significantly mishandled your treatment of the 1982 test, and that mishandling has led a lot of people astray on that issue for more than a decade. But I’m grateful for the many good things you and your wife have done in Shroud research over the years, and I’m sure you’ll do more in the years to come. I hope your future work will include a revisiting of the 1982 test. You have the tape of the 1988 interview with Adler, which gives you a significant advantage that the vast majority of other researchers don’t have. \nI wish you well. I don’t want to be acrimonious.\nI’ll expand on some of these things when I get a chance to respond to your email, probably tonight or sometime tomorrow.\n\n","date":"April 28, 2014 at 8:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/28/did-a-single-thread-get-tested-in-1982-is-it-important-to-know-and-why/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-105285","author":"Jason Engwer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did a single thread get tested in 1982.

Why has that portion of the tape not been posted online as an audio file, posted in transcript form online, described in detail online, or published in a book, for example? Why can we get occasional quotes and descriptions from people who have a copy of the tape, but with the full content withheld? What legal concerns would allow some people to have the tape, allow them to play it for some people, and allow them to discuss portions of the tape with some people (or with the general public, as Joe and his wife did in 2002), but wouldn’t allow them to make the fuller contents of the tape more widely known? Why do we keep getting such highly selective snippets of the tape’s contents after the tape has been in existence for more than a quarter of a century?\nAnd why did Joe and his wife not expand on their comments after their response to Caltech? They had years to describe and document the evidential nature of the phone records they had, explain how much Joe could corroborate the phone call, document that people had heard Rossman’s name circulating in association with the 1982 test prior to 2002, produce a transcript of the relevant portions of the tape, interact with Caltech’s claims about the dating capabilities their staff had in 1982, etc. Instead, it’s been a dozen years since Joe and his wife’s response to Caltech, and there’s been no follow-up. That’s one of the reasons why their side of the dispute has some significant credibility problems.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2014 at 7:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/28/did-a-single-thread-get-tested-in-1982-is-it-important-to-know-and-why/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-106107","author":"Jason Engwer","site":"shroudstory"}]
