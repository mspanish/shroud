Really? Everyone agrees? Anyone agree? \nROFLMAO:  You were thinking of Raymond N.

No? You were thinking of Fanti and yourself. No? Really?

This is where the press release should have started and ended. \n“New technology could demonstrate or refute that this event occurred! Neutron radiation not only creates new C-14 atoms, but also creates Cl-36 and Ca-41 atoms which virtually do not exist in nature. If such an event occurred, these rarest of atoms would still be present within the molecular structures of the linen, blood, or other irradiated material. The presence of these atoms, well above their infinitesimal natural levels, could only result from neutron radiation, which could not be generated by humans until the 20th century.\n“Interestingly, all three atoms (C-14, Cl-36 and Ca-41) are created by neutron radiation at rates that are known to scientists. Thus the amount of neutron radiation received by the Shroud, and the date this miraculous event occurred, can be calculated by scientists with the same accuracy as C-14 or radiocarbon dating. These tests could even be conducted on the original limestone walls of Jesus’ reputed burial tomb(s).”\nOf course, that is assuming that the Resurrection is a neutron radiation event.\n\n","date":"April 18, 2013 at 4:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/18/antonacci-proposing-molecular-and-sub-atomic-testing-to-resolve-disputes-regarding-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-31207","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Antonacci Proposing Molecular and Sub-Atomic Testing To Resolve Disputes Regarding the Shroud","post":"Dan will you sign the petition requesting more testing?
