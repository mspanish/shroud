[{"title":"Paper Chase:  Shroud Material Lost","post":"Don’t you just love the name of the first signatory on that protest re the 2002 vandalism: Philippe Bourcier de Carbon?  I had to google it to be certain it was a real person.\nAs for the vandalism itself – a possibility that needs to be at least briefly considered is that it was done deliberately to forestall a repeat of the radiocarbon dating on ‘dispensable’ charred linen. (Maybe Rogers had been advocating that already, prior to 2002, resulting in a hastily-drawn up defensive strategy?).\nNow why would anyone want to do that I wonder? You know, compromise any Mark 2 C-14 dating? Afraid of it returning the same answer? Remedy: ensure the burned bits get so thoroughly mixed up and contaminated with crud that no self-respecting radiocarbon dating lab would touch it with a bargepole (customised manufacture, non-carbon-based, naturally).\n\n","date":"May 13, 2013 at 7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/13/paper-chase-shroud-material-lost/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-33592","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Shroud Material Lost","post":"Deliberate or not, the fact that carbon dating has been compromised could be a good thing. It forces researchers to consider alternate, read more foolproof, methods (which may or may not be available yet). Fanti’s textile tests, while woeful on proper scientific documentation, are an example of new such methods. Better ones are on the way.\n\n","date":"May 13, 2013 at 9:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/13/paper-chase-shroud-material-lost/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-33595","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Shroud Material Lost","post":"I suspect that the Archdiocese of Turin has already secretly dated the material.

Prof. Jull should disclose how the two original samples received by the lab were cut up, and what was the position of the samples still in his possession with respect to the other samples. Those who think that the results published in 1989 show non-uniformity should be permitted to make  predictions concerning the outcome of the new measurements, and then these measurements should be done. The crucial point is that prof. Jull should make known how the pieces that his lab received were subdivided; he should make known the geometry of the partition of these samples. The prediction will be that the Tucson subsamples that were closer to the Oxford/Zurich samples will tend to show older ages.\n\n","date":"May 13, 2013 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/13/paper-chase-shroud-material-lost/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-33611","author":"Jos Verhulst","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Shroud Material Lost","post":"So … The only solution can be a new 14C test [B.T.W. : in the past I read something about a new and exact 14C test from a researcher of the ENEA.
