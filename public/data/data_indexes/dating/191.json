We had been puzzled by the Raes report at the time of the 1978 STURP observations in Turin. We could not find more than traces of cotton on the Shroud. The cloth appeared to be pure linen.”\n(Rogers, “A Chemist’s Perspective On The Shroud of Turin”, p.66)\n\n","date":"February 12, 2011 at 2:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/11/the-question-of-cotton-in-the-shroud-of-turins-yarn/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-2449","author":"domenico","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Question of Cotton in the Shroud of Turin’s Yarn","post":"Sounds like a stretch of conjecture.
