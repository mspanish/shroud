What I said was: “… in the 1980s university computers were all interconnected by ARPANET, THE PRECURSOR TO THE INTERNET …”. \nJull’s “quite restricted” does not mention that Arpanet was originally restricted but was expanded to universities, and in particular to “research laboratories in the US:\n“ARPANET … was one of the world’s first operational packet switching networks, the first network to implement TCP/IP, and the progenitor of what was to become the global Internet. The network was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) within the U.S. Department of Defense for use by its projects at universities and RESEARCH LABORATORIES IN THE US.” (Wikipedia)\nA Google search of “Arpanet” and “University of Arizona” shows that Arpanet was at the University of Arizona by 1984. \nJull’s “Anyway, the machine we used at that time couldn’t have been attached to it, and that one still isn’t”, is ambiguous. If he means by “machine” the AMS machine itself, I don’t claim that machine was attached to Arpanet. But if Jull means by “machine” the COMPUTER which processed the data coming from the AMS machine, then I doubt that is true, although Jull may believe it to be true. Stoll’s book makes clear that all university computers in the 1980s were connectable to Arpanet, and most were, especially laboratories.\nBut if it can be proven that Arizona, Zurich and Oxford’s AMS control console computers were not ever connected to Arpanet, then that does not mean that a hacker could not have inserted a program into those computers, as he could have done it manually. Stoll’s book (and he did his PhD at the University of Arizona) makes it clear that physical security at universities in the 1980s was also poor. You and your commenters may scoff at the idea that the KGB would have as one of its goals to discredit the Shroud, but you fail to consider what a perceived threat it would be to the Soviet Union if the Shroud was dated to the first or early centuries.\nDan, your commenters, and you, can try to denigrate me personally by calling my proposal a “conspiracy theory” with all its negative connotations. The One whose image is on the Shroud will be my and their Judge (Mt 16:27; 25:31-32; Ac 10:42; 2Cor 5:10; 2Tim 4:1, 1Pet 4:5). But they, and you, are not facing up to the fact that if the Shroud is authentic (as all the evidence apart from the C-14 dating indicates), then it would be “a remarkable coincidence” (to put it mildly) that its C-14 date was 1325 +/- 65 years, just before “the Shroud’s historical debut”, as the agnostic Thomas de Wesselow saw clearly:\n“One important consideration weighs in favour of the possibility of deception. If the carbon-dating error was accidental, then it is A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE that the result tallies so well with the date [of] … the Shroud’s historical debut. But IF FRAUD WAS INVOLVED, THEN IT WOULDN’T BE A COINCIDENCE AT ALL. Had anyone wished to discredit the Shroud, ‘1325 ± 65 years’ is precisely the sort of date they would have looked to achieve.” (de Wesselow, T., 2012, “The Sign: The Shroud of Turin and the Secret of the Resurrection,” p.170).\nMy bottom line is that, since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud to convert a 1st century actual date of the Shroud into the too good to be true 1325 ± 65 years date. Harry Grove’s worries before the test that at least one of the AMS labs would return an outlier date, and the 1989 Intercomparison Test in which the AMS labs fared badly, makes it difficult to believe (again to put it mildly) that all three AMS labs independently dated the Shroud “flawlessly,” as Gove later assumed they would have to have done, to date the Shroud so accurately, to within 25-30 years of the Shroud’s appearance at Lirey in the 1350s.\nMy proposal that the labs were duped by a computer hacker fits all the facts (Jull’s ambiguous email notwithstanding), and it allows for Ian Wilson’s assurance that the lab leaders were basically honest. I am hopeful that now my proposal is in the public domain, it will eventually be confirmed by someone in a position to know.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2014 at 12:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-86593","author":"Stephen E.

I warned Prof. Jull that no amount of contradiction would affect the most hardened conspiracy theorists, but it is clear that the entire AMS unit was not then nor is not now attached to any wider communication device. Its results were connected electronically to a calculator, but not a computer in our sense of the term, and certainly not to the ARPANET or any similar interconnected system.\nJones’s idea that the Soviet Union gave tuppence about the date of the shroud, or that they thought discrediting it would destroy Christianity is absurd. It would appear, after all, that their fiendish plan to affect the AMS machines worked succesfully – and what has been the result? The fall of the Vatican? The end of Christianity? Or the fall of the Berlin Wall (a year later) and the end of Soviet supremacy?\nOnce again, Stephen’s fanaticism is triggered by his amazement that the C-14 date corresponds reasonably accurately to a period shortly before it is first mentioned historically. I’m afraid I believe that this simply means that the shroud was actually manufactured at about that time, in which case, of course, it’s not amazing at all. Even if it were genuine, however, and the C-14 date represents an admixture of contamination, a 14th century date would not be very astonishing. Depending on the amount and the date, and an acceptable range of 100 years or so, the chances of the date matching a predetermined estimate are about 1 in 10, which would be surprising, but hardly breathtaking.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2014 at 2:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-86625","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis","post":"“My bottom line is that, since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud”\nThat’s backward science.

Science in fact DOES start from a previous conclusion, and proposes new hypotheses based on that conclusion. \n>Then you can move to the next level after arriving at the Shroud’s authenticity and attempt to explore how widespread the fraud really is which some don’t want to be discussed it seems. \nYes, slogans like “conspiracy theory” are excuses not to think about the problem: if the Shroud is 1st century, then why did it date to 1325, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s?\n>It’s naturally going to lead into colluding elements if that’s what really happened, possibly strange bed fellows as well, that’s human nature I’m afraid, \nMy `the C-14 labs were duped by a computer hacker’ proposal is an attempt to explain how there could have been fraud, yet the lab leaders were basically honest. \nIf Hugh and his ilk could remove the naturalistic scales from their eyes they would see I am not a conspiracy theorist, because the latter all to date have accused the laboratories leaders of outright fraud in switching samples, etc.\nThe worst that I have in the past proposed is that the C-14 labs were guilty of “making results appear just a little crisper or more definitive than they really are, or selecting just the `best’ data for publication and ignoring those that don’t fit” which respected science journalists Broad and Wade state is “probably far from unusual in science” (Broad, W.A. & Wade, N.J., 1982, “Betrayers of the Truth: Fraud and\nDeceit in the Halls of Science,”  p.20).\nMy new theory is an attempt to explore a way that the labs could be basically honest, yet a fraud did occur, not by the labs but by a computer hacker. \nIf it was confirmed to be what happened, then it would make the laboratories look GULLIBLE, but they would not then be guilty of fraud..   \n>you don’t get to claim it debunked just because it sounds strange, absurd, ridiculous, etc to your (hopefully not closed) mind. Reality is absurd and ridiculous and over the top sometimes. \nAgreed. But it is not even “absurd and ridiculous and over the top” that the Arizona, Zurich and Oxford’s C-14 lab’s computers were hacked into in 1988. The fact is that university computers DID get hacked back in the 1980s. \nThe hacker that Stoll caught DID hack into Berkeley University Livermore Lab’s computer system, so he could from that system hack into about 400 MILITARY computers which were more secure than university computers, the latter which, as Stoll records, were not very secure at all.\n>If hacking the labs is really so off base as some would like to paint it, then it should easily be debunked with verified facts and the world will continue. \nYes. I found Jull’s email curiously ambiguous, and indeed FALSE:\n>>This is impossible. In our case, the software for the calculations is offline. In any case, the calculation does NOT require software, it was done offline and plotted on a graph, as I recall.\nBut Gove and Sox’s accounts show that the results were displayed on Arizona’s AMS computer’ screen, and it was evident from that screen that the Shroud was not first century, even thought the years on the screen needed to be calibrated.\n>>Indeed, in 1988 the internet (as we know it today) didn’t exist – there was a pre-existing network run by the US government which was quite restricted.\nThis is disingenuous. Jull must know that by 1988 Arpanet connected most USA universities, and in particular their research laboratories. \n>>Anyway, the machine we used at that time couldn’t have been attached to it, and that one still isn’t.”. \nAgain ambiguity by Jull. Is “machine” the AMS system or the COMPUTER receiving C-14 dating data from the AMS system and via a program displaying that C-14 data’s uncalibrated dates?\nIf the AMS machines COMPUTER was connected to Arpanet, would Jull be aware of it? It would be convenient for the company which supplied the AMS system to be able to log into the AMS system’s comouter via Arpanet and update its software.\nBut, as I previously wrote, if it could be proved (and I mean independently of the C-14 labs) that the AMS system computers at the three C-14 labs were not online, nevertheless they were still computers which were operated by a program, which in turn could be hacked locally, e.g. by “someone posing as a technician”.\n>So far there seems to be only more questions raised and clarifications needed from the responses from representatives of two of the three labs involved in the 1988 C14 tests.\nAgreed. But of course if it has just now dawned on the labs, after all these years, that they may have been the victim of a hacking, in such an important  C-14 dating as that of the Shroud, they would hardly be likely to welcome investigations into it. Rather they would be defensive as Jull’s email seems to be.  \nI thank Dan for his “Comment Promoted: On the Hacking Hypothesis.” And to Hugh for contacting Jull. No doubt they both thought “this [would] put an end to it, once and for all” but the genie of my proposal is now, thanks to them, out of the bottle.\nAnd as my replies have shown, it is not as simple as they thought, to dismiss my proposal by ad hominems and half-truths. .\n\n","date":"March 11, 2014 at 11:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-87375","author":"Stephen E.

This is repeated nine more times and an average carbon-14/carbon-13 ratio calculated. All this was UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL and the CALCULATIONS PRODUCED BY THE COMPUTER were displayed on a cathode ray screen.” (Gove, H.E., 1996, “Relic, Icon or Hoax?: Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud,” p.264).\nNor according to Sox’s 1988 account, evidently obtained from Gove, since Sox wasn’t there:\n“The CALCULATIONS WERE PRODUCED ON THE COMPUTER, AND DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN. Even the dendrochronological correction was immediately available. All eyes were on the screen. The date would be when the flax used for the linen relic was harvested. Gove would be taking cowboy boots back to Rochester.” (Sox, H.D., 1988, “The Shroud Unmasked,” p.147).\nEven in 1988 a computer was a COMPUTER, not a calculator. I bought my first personal computer in 1980 and it was called a COMPUTER even then, not a calculator.\nDespite the ad hominem personal attacks: “obsession…. hardened conspiracy theorists … fanaticism” of Hugh, I stand by my PROPOSAL that the three AMS radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker, who either remotely via Arpanet, or manually at each laboratory, inserted a program into each of the lab’s COMPUTERS, which received the uncalibrated radiocarbon dates from their AMS radiocarbon dating machines and displayed them upon each of their screens. The inserted program replaced the Shroud’s first century (or early) C-14 dates coming from the labs’ AMS machines with random dates which clustered around 1325, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s. \nI realise that my proposal is unnecessary for those, like Hugh, who believe (against all the other evidence) that the Shroud is a 14th century fake. But I note that none of those who believe the Shroud to be authentic attempt to explain how the Shroud can be 1st century, yet radiocarbon date to 1325 +/- 65. \nAnd indeed the very first run of C-14 dates of the Shroud, displayed on Arizona lab’s computer screen, was “1350 AD … the time its historic record began”:\n“The age of the control sample could have been calculated on a small pocket calculator but was not-everyone was waiting for the next sample-the Shroud of Turin! At 9:50 am 6 May 1988, Arizona time, the first of the ten measurements appeared on the screen. We all waited breathlessly. The ratio was compared with the OX sample and the radiocarbon time scale calibration was applied by Doug Donahue. His face became instantly drawn and pale. At the end of that one minute we knew the age of the Turin Shroud! The next nine numbers confirmed the first. It had taken me eleven years to arrange for a measurement that took only ten minutes to accomplish! Based on these 10 one minute runs, with the calibration correction applied, THE YEAR THE FLAX HAD BEEN HARVESTED THAT FORMED ITS LINEN THREADS WAS 1350 AD-the shroud was only 640 years old! It was certainly not Christ’s burial cloth but DATED FROM THE TIME ITS HISTORIC RECORD BEGAN.” (Gove, 1996, p.264).\nWhat is the likelihood of that? It means the Shroud would have had to be harvested, woven into linen, and the the Shroud’s image added, all in less than 5-10 years. And while the Shroud was owned by the noblest Christian knight in France, Geoffroi de Charny (c.1300-1356).\nEven on Benford & Marino’s theory that the Shroud sample was a mixture of 1st century original linen and 16th century repairs, it would be an AMAZING COINCIDENCE (absent some degree of fraud, i.e. ” making results appear just a little crisper or more definitive than they really are, or selecting just the `best’ data for publication and ignoring those that don’t fit” – Broad & Wade) that the Shroud `just happened’ to C-14 date to just before the Shroud first appeared in undisputed history in c. 1355.\nI note in passing the inconsistency (to put it mildly) of Dan who was worried that the Shroud.com could be hacked by a bogus technician:\n“Barrie Schwortz’ shroud.com is an irreplaceable treasure. Could it disappear tomorrow because of hackers? It deals with a highly controversial topic that is unavoidably an affront to atheists and many religious people. As such it is a natural target for idealists or extremists of all kinds and particularly a group of hackers who call themselves “Anonymous.” They could probably take down the website in a few minutes. Would they also destroy backup copies of the website’s contents? … How much damage could someone posing as Barrie do? I imagine it would be 100%. Only files stored on third party systems or on dismounted DVD media would be safe. And how much damage could someone posing as a technician of the hosting company do in just a few minutes? Just as much.” (“They don’t do it just for the credit card numbers,” January 9, 2014).\nIf “shroud.com is an … an affront to atheists” and so “a natural target for idealists or extremists of all kinds” then why was the 1988 C-14 dating of the Shroud ITSELF not “an affront to atheists,” and “a natural target for” the KGB?\nAnd if in this day and age, a quarter of a century later, when we are much more conscious of computer security than they were in the 1980s, a hacker “posing as a technician of the hosting company” for Shroud.com could “in just a few minutes” destroy Shroud.com, yet in 1988, a  hacker “posing as a technician of the” AMS C-14 dating system company” could not insert a program in the AMS C-14 dating system at each lab, which would replace the Shroud’s dates with 1325 +/- 65 dates? \nIsn’t groupthink interesting? Andy, who “As an IT guy” found my proposal “preposterous” apparently did not find Dan’s proposal also “preposterous”!\nI thank the lone commenter Dover who had the courage to swim against the tide of groupthink on Dan’s blog, for at least applauding me “for intellectual imagination and creativity in trying to find solutions.”\n\n","date":"March 10, 2014 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-86871","author":"Stephen E.

Then followed one of the controls. Each run consisted of a 10 second measurement of the carbon-13 current and a 50 second measurement of the carbon-14 counts.

So all that a hacker would have to do is modify the program which displayed those “counts of 14C” to replace those coming from the Shroud samples with “counts of 14C” which when calibrated, yielded the TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE date of “1350 AD”.\n>I don’t suppose Stephen Jones will accept this as a sensible rebuttal of his claim, \nI do accept it as face value as a rebuttal of my original proposal that the hacker logged in remotely via Arpanet. But it is not a rebuttal of my subsequent proposal that a hacker logged into the three C-14 dating laboratories locally, e.g. “posing as a technician” or after hours.\n>and I’m sorry about that, because his current stance, coupled to his earlier Satanic allegations about Pope Francis, \n`Poisoning the well’ allegation noted:\n“Poisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a rhetorical device where adverse information about a target is pre-emptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say…” (Wikipedia)\nI made NO “Satanic allegations about Pope Francis”. All I wrote in my “2013 Favs: New Tests Date the Shroud from the Time of Christ” post was: \n“But if the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!”\nNote the all-important conditional “IF”. I don’t think that “the Shroud is a deliberate fraud” and my argument is that neither does the Vatican. My point was simply to highlight the inconsistency of the Vatican’s current policy of neither confirming nor denying the Shroud is authentic, yet spending the equivalent of many millions of dollars protecting the Shroud and also of exhibiting it with increasing regularity to millions of people.\n>render his absolutist convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud, which I originally found quite noble (albeit wrong), utterly worthless.\nAnother attempt to `poison the well’ by Prof. Ramsey. I don’t have “absolutist convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud,” As my blog’s masthead states: “I am PERSUADED BY THE EVIDENCE that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Jesus Christ and bears His crucified and resurrected image.” \nOn a previous post several years ago, I wrote something like: `I was a Christian for nearly 40 years before I became persuaded by the evidence that the Shroud is authentic. And if it were proven to be false, I would still be the same Christian that I was before I accepted that the Shroud was authentic.’ \nAnd even if my proposal that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker turns out to be wrong, that does not make my other “convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud … utterly worthless.”\nThe Shroud could still be authentic, as all the evidence except for the C-14 date of 1325 +/- 65 years indicates, and only my above proposal be wrong.\nBut then there still would be the problem of explaining how the Shroud could be 1st century, yet its C-14 date is 1325 +/- 65 years, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s. As the agnostic art historian Thomas de Wesselow pointed out:\n“One important consideration weighs in favour of the possibility of deception. If the carbon-dating error was accidental, then IT IS A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE that the result tallies so well with the date always claimed … as the Shroud’s historical debut. But if fraud was involved, then it wouldn’t be a coincidence at all. Had anyone wished to discredit the Shroud, ‘1325 ± 65 years’ is precisely the sort of date they would have looked to achieve.” e Wesselow, T., 2012, “The Sign: The Shroud of Turin and the Secret of the Resurrection,”, p.170. My emphasis).\nIndeed, I find it strange that a scientist of Prof. Ramsey’s eminence would even THINK, let alone say, such an illogical thing. That if I am wrong on ONE THING in favour of the Shroud’s authenticity, then EVERYTHING ELSE I say in defense of the Shroud’s authenticity is “utterly worthless.”\nProf. Ramsey seems very keen to `poison the well’ against me personally, so no one will take any notice of what I say. That suggests, to me at least, that maybe Prof. Ramsey has something to hide in respect of my proposal that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker?\n\n","date":"March 11, 2014 at 12:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-87389","author":"Stephen E.

But Hugh’s NON-theory, as it presently stands, is “not EVEN wrong”! \nI note that no one has responded to the points I made above, but instead they have repeated ad hominems and/or changed the subject. Therefore I regard my `the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker’ proposal as to date unrefuted. \nI meant to thank Dan for his: “shroud.com [sic] is … an affront to atheists and .. As such it is a natural target for idealists or extremists of all kinds.” And also for his scenario of “someone posing as a technician” obtaining access to the computer where Shroud.com’s is hosted and backed up, and destroying it “100%”. \nSo if that is true of a Shroud WEBSITE, how much more is it true of the Shroud ITSELF? That is, even if it wasn’t the KGB, on Dan’s own reasoning there would have been “ATHEISTS” and “idealists or extremists OF ALL KINDS” to whom a C-14 dating of the Shroud to the 1st, or an early, century, would be “a NATURAL TARGET”.\nAnd in 1988 at a university, it wouldn’t even have to be “someone posing as a technician.” As Stoll (who did his PhD at the University of Arizona) wrote in 1989:\n“Every few months, I’d hear a rumour about someone else’s system being invaded; usually this was at universities, and it was often blamed on students or teenagers. … Sure, it’s EASY TO MUCK AROUND COMPUTERS AT UNIVERSITIES where NO SECURITY WAS NEEDED. After all, colleges SELDOM EVEN LOCK THE DOORS TO THEIR BUILDINGS.” (Stoll, C., 1989, “The Cuckoo’s Egg,” p.12).\nSo, applying what Stoll wrote to the Arizona, Zurich and Oxford universities’ radiocarbon labs in 1988, it would be “easy” to hack into their AMS C-14 dating computers because back then “no security was needed” and the labs may not have even bothered to “lock the doors to their buildings.”\n\n","date":"March 11, 2014 at 9:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-87356","author":"Stephen E.

Entering “cotton” on Dan’s search engine above brings up several separate postings, all hotly discussed.  The latest seems to have been last October 22, which notched up 36 comments including several by both you and Colin.  \nI also searched on shroud.com, also with a large number of results, and I don’t have time to spare on canvassing them all. Barrie Schwortz was of course part of the STURP team and often asserts that there was no other interwoven cotton. The “sticky tapes” are not the only reason for this assertion. The STURP scientists are known to have examined the whole cloth microscopically, there are several photos of their doing so. Cotton was not then the issue it became post-1988, but it is asserted that their examination revealed no interwoven cotton. There are of course traces of cotton as debris, as with several other types of particles.  I’m prepared to accept this assertion as being sufficently authoritative.  \nI note that the final comment on the 22-Oct-13 posting makes the rather telling observation by one “sw”:\n“The average weight of the Shroud linen ranges between 20-25 mg per square centimeter. The weight of the carbon14 sample is 42 mg per square centimeter.”  However the source for this is not stated. Perhaps someone else has the time to be able to corroborate it. \nI also note that I had asserted there that the deliberate mixing of cotton and linen for separate warp and weft threads for making fustian began in Egypt about 200AD, spread through North Africa not reaching Spain until the 13th century. \nIn 1973 Gilbert Raes of course had found cotton in one of his samples (adjacent to the C14 site), but none at all in the other. \nI think I had sufficient grounds for asserting that there was no interwoven cotton found by the STURP team in 1978, even after they had microscopically examined the cloth. \nIf there was a first century Gallic origin for the cloth, as a result of trade or military occupation, there could of course be no cotton at all.\n\n","date":"March 11, 2014 at 6:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-87464","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis","post":"I should make clear that although I asked for an authoritative rebuttal against a hypothesis held by a man of some influence in shroud circles, I did not give Stephen’s name to either Prof. Ramsey or Prof. Jull.

Now let’s see.\n“A KGB agent hacked into the AMS system control console computer at each of the three C-14 labs and inserted a program which … would yield years clustering around AD 1325, just before the Shroud’s appearance in undisputed history in the 1350s.” Response: I consider that any agency capable of doing that was capable of hacking into a great many far more important things than an archaeological dating, and probably extending the cold war far into the 21st century. I think the writing of the ‘fake’ program and its physical replacement in the AMS calculating machine would require a detailed knowledge of the system, and could not be done by somebody popping in one evening. I think the likelihood of this happening three times is, to use a well-worn expression “overwhelmingly” improbable.\n“You fail to consider what a perceived threat it would be to the Soviet Union if the Shroud was dated to the first or early centuries.” I don’t believe the dating of the Shroud was anything but trivial to the Soviet Union. Not only did the announcement of the 14th century date have absolutely no effect on the Catholic or any other Christian Church, if it did anything to the Soviet Union it simply accelerated its downfall, which occurred very soon afterwards.\n“You denigrate me personally by calling my proposal a “conspiracy theory” with all its negative connotations.” A plot by the KGB to subvert workers in three different laboratories in three different countries so that they wrote, taped and replaced a minor calculation program in an archaeological laboratory to attempt to discredit Christianity by misdating one of its relics, without any evidence for such a plot whatever, is a conspiracy theory by any standards. Such theories often have negative connotations because, as there is no evidence for them, the evidence cannot be examined or disproved. A conspiracy theory for which there is some evidence has no negative connotations.\n“My bottom line is that, since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud to convert a 1st century actual date of the Shroud into the too good to be true 1325 ± 65 years date.” Quite. That there is no room for doubt in Stephen’s mind that the shroud is authentic is fair enough, but to claim that a logical consequence of the shroud’s authenticity is that there HAD to be some sort of fraud, is simply non-sense.\n“My proposal that the labs were duped by a computer hacker fits all the facts.” No, it doesn’t. The facts, about the staff at the laboratories, the nature of the calculator program, the plans of the KGB, how the KGB communicated to its agents, the means of replacing the old program with the new and how such a replacement went undetected have not been considered or presented. Your proposal is not contradicted by the very few facts to hand, which is a very different thing. Such facts as have been discovered, by people who have tried to examine the facts supporting your theories rather more than you have yourself, have wholly discredited the ‘single computer hacker’ theory.\n“Yes, slogans like “conspiracy theory” are excuses not to think about the problem.” How I wish that were true. Unlike, I suspect, its author, I have thought about it in detail since it was proposed. I wrote to the laboratories involved for evidence, I considered the effect the successful execution of this theory actually had on Christianity and on the Soviet Union. Did he?\n“I made NO ‘Satanic allegations about Pope Francis’. All I wrote … was:\n“But if the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!” This is disingenuous. the rest of your quote is: “But if the Shroud is authentic (as the evidence is overwhelming that it is), then Jesus whose image would then be on the Shroud, who commanded His followers: ‘Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.” (Mt 5:37) would presumably not be pleased with the Roman Catholic Church’s duplicitous official position on His burial shroud.” As the church refuses to say ‘Yes’ or ‘No,’ then your own quotation declares the church’s attitude to ‘come from evil.’\n“And even if my proposal that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker turns out to be wrong, that does not make my other ‘convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud … utterly worthless.’” Sadly, it does. And I agree that that’s very unfair. But that’s the trouble with extremism. However, toning things down a little may help to re-establish credibility. “I am PERSUADED BY THE EVIDENCE that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Jesus Christ and bears His crucified and resurrected image.” That’s a very good start. “Since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud.” That’s extremism.\n“I note that no one has responded to the points I made above, but instead they have repeated ad hominems and/or changed the subject.” Well I hope that’s all sorted out now.\nBest wishes in Christ.\n\n","date":"March 11, 2014 at 5:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-87455","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis","post":">That last paragraph is close to being an allegation of intellectual dishonesty. \nI did not use the word “dishonest”.
