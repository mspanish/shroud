[{"title":"Paper Chase:  Giulio Fanti’s New Flax Fiber Dating Machine","post":"My reading of the posting only, suggests there must be typos in the various dimensional abbreviations. Flax fibres with diameters in the range 5m to 20m make no sense, even if mm is meant instead of m. I don’t know what to make of the statement “to measure forces up to 0.5 N with a resolution better than 2 N.” Are in fact micro-meters meant, and the Greek ‘mu’ hasn’t transliterated? The release refers to “cyclic loading”; This looks like Prof Fanti is attempting to discover the fibres’ present fatigue characteristics, in the possible hope of making inferences about the age from the number of cycles the cloth may have experienced over the ages. I’m drawing on my early Engineering lab time in “Strength of Materials” classes here.\n\n","date":"September 20, 2013 at 4:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/20/paper-chase-giulio-fantis-new-flax-fiber-dating-machine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-44809","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Giulio Fanti’s New Flax Fiber Dating Machine","post":"Dave, I took the abstract directly out of the back of the paper (copy and paste), which clearly is wrong. That should be μm (Mu) not m. However the main body of the paper seems to be right so I have replaced the abstract in this posting with the initial summary from the opening paragraphs of the paper. You can refer to the pdf to see the abstract as it was. Thanks for bring this to my attention.\n\n","date":"September 20, 2013 at 5:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/20/paper-chase-giulio-fantis-new-flax-fiber-dating-machine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-44813","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Giulio Fanti’s New Flax Fiber Dating Machine","post":"Thanks, Dan.
