[{"title":"Fudged C14 Numbers: Capitoline She Wolf the ‘Shroud of Turin’ of the Classics Set?","post":"The point of datation and C14 is something that from time to time comes up in this blog.\nIt is really important because finding an accurate alternative to the c14 test would mean\nan important step forward.\nIn this line, I have recently come across a peer-reviewed paper (1) by one of the STURP members which to my surprise, has been widely ignored and even in shroud.com is only tangentially commented.\nIt mentions that the ratios of deuterium/hidrogen and two isotopes of of oxigen can contribute to determine the geographical origin of any linen. In combination with the more recent results obtained (2) with trace elements I think it truly represents\na scientifically solid and promising path.\nThis would incorporate to the datation strategy followed so far, the geographical view of determination of linen origin.\n(1) DeNiro, MJ, Sternberg, L.D., Marino, B.D., Druzik, JR.
