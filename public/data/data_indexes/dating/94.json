Maybe others since (Hedge etc.) have made misleading statements in which the 3-lab average is ascribed to just the Oxford’s result.

I know that Jones spits blood re the average of 1260-1390 being 1325, just 30 years or before the Lirey showing, and that he smells a proverbial rat, but that is Jones and his conspiratorial mind.

The 1988 radiocarbon calibration graph was that of Stuiver & Pearson, published in 1986.\nThanks to the genius and generosity of Christopher Ramsey and his team, calibration can be carried out by anyone at all now, using the OxCal Project, available online, using the latest calibration graph (Reimer 2013). As the BP dates are expressed as a distribution curve (a mean and an error), the calendar dates are also expressed similarly. Of the 12 mean calendar dates derived from the 12 BP dates given by the three laboratories, only one lies outside the 1260-1390 range chalked on the board behind Hall, Tite and Hedges, and even so the range of its dates (1044-1298) overlaps the range 1260-1390. Stephen E. Jones is thus wholly incorrect in his statement that “none of the three laboratories dated its sample to between 1260 and 1390” and consequently wholly incorrect in his impugning of Prof. Hedges.\nI think it may be an honest mistake, due to thinking that BP dates are calculable calendar dates, which is not so, but now I have made it clear, an apology might be appropriate.\n\n","date":"October 23, 2013 at 12:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/23/jones-none-of-the-three-laboratories-dated-its-sample-to-between-1260-and-1390/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48519","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jones:  “none of the three laboratories dated its sample to between 1260 and 1390”","post":"See callibration curve:\nhttp://depts.washington.edu/qil/datasets/uwten98_14c.txt\n\n","date":"October 23, 2013 at 12:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/23/jones-none-of-the-three-laboratories-dated-its-sample-to-between-1260-and-1390/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48522","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jones:  “none of the three laboratories dated its sample to between 1260 and 1390”","post":"Why?

In particular, one does not need to be a disciple of Raymond Rogers (RIP) to feel that any anomalous findings on the sampled corner, whether a valid re-analysis or not of covertly pulled threads from the Riggi archive, calls for a re-run to address misgivings.\nBut don’t you find it strange that those who are most voluble in their contempt for the 1988 dating are so silent when it comes to re-testing? Ask them why. Expect to be told that it’s not just the patching, that there are innumerable other reasons why radiocarbon dating can never hope to give the right answer for ancient linen.You see, so many clever people have conjured up scenarios that attempt to invalidate even the best radiocarbon protocol (bioplastics, modern “hot” C-14 monoxide that has hot-footed its way down to Earth from the modern troposphere and attached to ancient linen, exotic features of one-off resurrection physics that would alter isotopic ratios).  They have ways of dossier-drubbing us into submission, and when that does not work, they then tell us more in sadness than anger that it is our “world view” that is basically at fault, or that our formal education missed out on “critical thinking”, or proper appreciation of courtroom procedure and the rules of evidence.\nThe Shroud, with or without its alleged C-14 invalidating patch, is fascinating not only as a unique artefact of mysterious provenance. It’s a microcosm of the human propensity    to argue the hind leg off a donkey – to use my grandmother’s stock expression whenever meeting resistance to her down-to-earth common sense. She was a regular church-going Baptist, and her views on the Shroud would probably have had “they” in the answer, given a little extra emphasis…   ;-)\n\n","date":"October 24, 2013 at 4:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/23/jones-none-of-the-three-laboratories-dated-its-sample-to-between-1260-and-1390/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48583","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jones:  “none of the three laboratories dated its sample to between 1260 and 1390”","post":"“But don’t you find it strange that those who are most voluble in their contempt for the 1988 dating are so silent when it comes to re-testing?

Initially, radiocarbon dates from Egypt that seemed to reflect the layer of destruction came up with c. 1500 BC.

Thera, aka Santorini. Fascinating place. My wife and I were there earlier this year, in a boutique hotel perched right on the edge of the caldera. \nhttp://charioteers.org/2013/06/17/a-caldera-for-christina/\nOne factor that might have caused some variability in radiocarbon dating was whether there was appreciable volcanic activity immediately prior to the big bang. That would have put extra ancient C14-depleted CO2 into the surrounding air, making trees and preserved timber seem a little older than they really are. There’s some support for that view in this link:\nhttp://www.c14dating.com/corr.html\n\n","date":"October 26, 2013 at 5:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/23/jones-none-of-the-three-laboratories-dated-its-sample-to-between-1260-and-1390/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48746","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jones:  “none of the three laboratories dated its sample to between 1260 and 1390”","post":"So let me get this straight: Bla bla, woof woof, “we’re not sure how old it is.” Got it.
