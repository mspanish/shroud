[{"title":"Were both ventral and dorsal corners of the Shroud rewoven?","post":"What an excellent paper. I commend OK for his thoroughness. Although even Durante’s photos are not immune from lighting artifacts (see http://i.imgur.com/TgVMhjg.png), Shroud 2.0 shows that the corners are indeed darker than their surroundings. I don’t think we can interpret this as reweaving however. Common sense, as well as OK’s photo, suggests that there would be more reweaving the closer to the corner, fading to “pure shroud” at some distance from it. It is remarkable therefore that the C14 results show exactly the opposite, with the Oxford sample, closest to the corner, appearing the oldest and least contaminated, and the Arizona sample, furthest from the corner, the youngest and most contaminated. That’s interesting.\n\n","date":"May 31, 2014 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/31/were-both-ventral-and-dorsal-corners-of-the-shroud-rewoven/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-125923","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were both ventral and dorsal corners of the Shroud rewoven?","post":"Hugh, We don’t know the pattern of damage for which the reweaving was done to fix. I know it makes sense that the closer to the corner the more damage but this is just an assumption. We can’t tell if the inside suffered more.\n\n","date":"May 31, 2014 at 11:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/31/were-both-ventral-and-dorsal-corners-of-the-shroud-rewoven/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-125924","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were both ventral and dorsal corners of the Shroud rewoven?","post":"Hugh: I will discuss all those issues later, in more papers when I have more time.

The pictures show discolorations in these areas. This has been the inducement for the hypothesis of the mending in medieval times.[…] Rogers attributed the colour change of the one area of the shroud to medieval repairs to which he was unable to give further indications”.\nI respect Mrs Flury-lemberg but obviously she did not understand Rogers at all.\nInfrared pictures ? No. UV-Vis pictures. Very different. \n“This has been the inducement for the hypothesis of the mending in medieval times”\nNo. Rogers first looked at his Raes threads (and later C14 threads). For Rogers, the UV-Vis pictures were only additional evidence.\nIn my opinion, there is little doubt that the C14 corner is anomalous also with regard to the quad mosaic pictures.\nMore later…\n\n","date":"May 31, 2014 at 3:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/31/were-both-ventral-and-dorsal-corners-of-the-shroud-rewoven/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-125947","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were both ventral and dorsal corners of the Shroud rewoven?","post":"I agree with Hugh and Thibault that this is a very fine paper.  I look forward to additional writings by O.K. on this as well as from Thibault.  I think it’s certainly possible that the other corner was rewoven as well.  Two good sources pertaining to the question are “Some Details About the STURP Quad Mosaic Images” at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf and “Digital image processing techniques demonstrating the anomalous nature of the radiocarbon dating sample area of the Shroud of Turin” at http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380798975_Morgan.pdf.  One of the topics to be discussed at the St. Louis Shroud conference is Future Testing of the Shroud by Prof. Bruno Barberis.  If testing is allowed, the whole question of reweaving and possible locations definitely need to be looked at more closely.\n\n","date":"June 1, 2014 at 2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/31/were-both-ventral-and-dorsal-corners-of-the-shroud-rewoven/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-126117","author":"jmarino240","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were both ventral and dorsal corners of the Shroud rewoven?","post":"When I attended Valencia Shroud Conference two years ago Professor Bruno Barberis has done a lecture with a similar title.\nWhen he was asked when new tests would be done he answered that he hoped the Pope would grant permission in a near future, but  two years have run since and nothing new. emerged.\nI sincerely hope his presentation will bring anything new because the list of new non destructive tests he suggested was impressive.\nMay be as he has privileged relations with Shroud custodians he presents some interesting data from studied  Shroud material removed in 2002 restoration.that would be great.\n                                                                                      regards\n                                                                 Antero de Frias Moreira\n                                                         (Centro Português de Sindonologia)\n\n","date":"June 5, 2014 at 11:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/31/were-both-ventral-and-dorsal-corners-of-the-shroud-rewoven/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-127049","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"}]
