[{"title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?","post":"Amazing.\nKudos to Dan, I adore this site. Everyday I learn something I never knew.\nI’m embarrassed to say this post made me very tense. I can’t imagine what could possibly motivate anyone to withhold something that I believe doesn’t belong to an individual, but to the world. I’m not sure how this happened, but it certainly should have went back to the Vatican.\nIf I took a personal item in for testing, I wouldn’t expect a professional to keep a portion of it for himself. Maybe it was previously arranged and have came to the wrong conclusions, I hope.\n\n","date":"March 16, 2014 at 12:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-89636","author":"jenx","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?","post":"Yes it these types of odd, unprofessional behaviours that give life to the conspiracy theories. The labs have done themselves no favours in failing to be transparent about the surviving samples. Many of these theories could be debunked in a day if the labs responded with the vigour one would expect, given the accusations. The more they do not, the bigger the question mark grows over their heads. Perhaps they do not wish to ‘dignify’ the question with a response…but the question is being asked by some reasonable people just looking for the facts/truth. As such the lack of response is bringing indignity to the labs anyway.\nPerhaps those involved are too ‘retired’ to really care anymore. Who knows.\n\n","date":"March 16, 2014 at 12:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-89642","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?","post":"Unbelievable.\n\n","date":"March 16, 2014 at 1:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-89646","author":"jenx","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?","post":"I have emailed Dr Donahue to inquire.

I am still prepared to photograph it should it be made available.  According to the experts I spoke with, most labs would never destroy or use all of an existing sample but would typically keep some small pieces in reserve. The Zurich and Oxford labs now state that they have no Shroud samples remaining, while Arizona apparently kept substantial portions after their tests. I don’t believe they were required to return them to Turin, much as STURP was not required to return any of the materials they gathered. I am still hopeful that the Donahue sample will be made available at some point in time so it can be photographed and included with the other images I made.\n\n","date":"March 16, 2014 at 3:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-89666","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?","post":"Is there a real possibility (just possibility) that this piece may contain some evidence for the so-called ‘invisible mending’ theory, put forward by Benford & Marino, and supported by Rogers, Villareal and others?

Even Dr. Jull admitted to me that the 1988 tests were rather poorly performed. Arguing over the sample site, leaving the room for 30 minutes and returning with sealed, stainless steel (opaque) containers rather than glass, failure to perform chemical analyses on the samples (required by their own protocol) or release the raw data or explain mathematical inconsistencies in the process, etc., etc., have led to many conspiracy theories. I still personally prefer to look for a credible, scientific answer (like the reweave theory) than to resort to conspiracies.
