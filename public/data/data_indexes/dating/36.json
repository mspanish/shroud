[{"title":"Mixing Up Faith and Science on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"I fully agree with all the points you put forward Dan to show that there is no question about the fact that the C14-Raes region of the Shroud wasn’t the same physically and chemically than the main part of the cloth.  But you forgot 2 very important quotes that shows that the C14 dating is questionable :  Late 2010, Timothy Jull wrote a paper in his own journal Radiocarbon trying to prove that his C14 sample received in 1988 was totally valid for dating.  But at the end of his Paper, M. Jull wrote something incredible :  he said that it would be a very good thing to do another C14 dating !!!  That just prove how much even the C14 labs are not so sure about the result…  \nAnd there is also what Christopher Ramsey said some years ago about the fact that there is an apparent contradiction between the 1988 C14 result and many other data that seem to suggest a much earlier date for the Shroud.  Ramsey is the head of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit which participated in the 1988 Carbon 14 Dating of the Shroud.  So, when the C14 people say things like that, that tells something !\n\n","date":"September 6, 2011 at 9:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/06/mixing-up-faith-and-science-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-3799","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mixing Up Faith and Science on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Let’s agree: If the Shroud of Turin never existed the vast majority of the readers of this blog would still believe that a first century Nazarene named Jesus was Christ – the messiah.  The existence or non-existence of relics imparts no influence on the fundamental foundation of Christianity – namely “faith” in the premise of a messiah.\nTherefore, the scientific principle of observation, hypothesis, and testing toward repeatable results simply has no place in this blog.  The premise that Jesus of Nazareth was the messiah is untestable.  The premise that Jesus rose from the dead is untestable.  The premise that Jesus did  is untestable.  The messiah’s existence is purely a function of faith.   Only YOU know the depth of your beliefs and the best examinations of OTHER people cannot prove whether YOU believe in a god.  Your faith has no manifestation that produces repeatable results in the physical realm…and shouldn’t.\nSome friends recently asked me to explain String Theory – the model used to explain many of the behaviors presented in the science of phenomenology and partical physics.  After a short discussion one of the listeners interrupted me to say they had seen an episode of “Nova” that made String Theory seem very different from my perspective.  I pointed out that “Nova” is designed to entertian the laymen and anyone who knows anything about any topic will always see the flaws in newspapers articles on that topic.  Entertainment and scientific rigor are orthogonal in their goals.  I suggested that two hours of entertaining public televison was not enough training to truly grasp the details and problems in String Theory – a  topic is so obtuse that I can count on two hands the number of people for which it is understandable.  None of them would claim String Theory is intuitive.  \nThe above tale is a long path to this statement: I have never read anything like this blog.  It is very entertaining.  Unfortunately, that which entertains me is the consistent misrepresentation of peer reviewed scientific publications.  I give credit to Dan Porter for being driven and faithful to his search for a relic which proves the existence of the Christ.  But I know bad science when I smell it and this place fairly reeks.\nThe scientific principle is best guided by one goal: Do not strive to win the argument through rhetoric – work to bury one question in a mountain of irrefutable results.  A pile of unrelated tidbits proves nothing but may have the appearence of winning the rhetorical argument.\nYou have faith in Jesus.  Leave it there.  Why soil your very real and personal faith with an unprovable premise that the shroud represents Jesus’s image?  Even If you were able to scientifically prove to me that this artifact was made Easter day I would still argue that it was more likely to belong to someone long forgotten who died the same day.\n\n","date":"September 8, 2011 at 2:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/06/mixing-up-faith-and-science-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-3807","author":"Timothy P.

I base this from your style of writing. I for one may lack the education or the writing skills, but can still see your errors. You go from saying believers (bloggers) here are refutting all ‘perfect’ evidence to the Shroud’s medieval origins, to saying believers are misrepresenting peer reviewed scientific papers!….What a shame you believe these things in your mind. If you want to claim we must stay within scientific boundaries, THEN YOU MUST YOURSELF. Furthermore with this in mind, you must recognize that nothing at this point scientifically points directly to a medieval origin, quite the opposite actually. It is a shame and a huge disservice you pay when you and others would dismiss the hundreds of thousands of hours of scientific study done by dozens of world class scientists, simply due to your bias. The whole C-14 dating has been shown to be a scientific blunder by all involved, so not perfect science.Historically it seems, it’s even worse.Many historical writings, documents and illustrations are simply being ‘dismissed’ which can easily pull the origin of the Shroud back literally to the 4th century…So I ask you, whom is really using rhetoric here?\nRon\n\n","date":"September 14, 2011 at 3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/06/mixing-up-faith-and-science-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-3857","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
