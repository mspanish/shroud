Checking the URL, and his profile says it all.  He’s discovered how to set up a web-site (Wow!) but is just your average wiseass who enjoys making fun of people different from himself.  Profound? Yea right! He even knows how to scribble a few lines of integral calculus. Wow!\n\n","date":"June 19, 2012 at 4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/19/who-is-evolving-into-stupid/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-12725","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Who is Evolving Into Stupid?","post":"Not to mention that there are 2.1 Billion people worldwide who still believe 2000 years later.  The very small minority that abstain are just that.  It’s that they speak louder than we do.  We don’t go after them but they’re on a mission to come after us wherever we happen to be.  As Frank Turek says, “I don’t have enough faith to be an atheist.”\nThat fellow, Thomas, is confused between scientific evidence which has been continuous since the STRP Team went in, and the writings in the Bible.  None of the Scientists’ evidence becomes proof of the Bible.  It’s purely scientific–nothing to do with religion.  That is until you realize the implication of the Shroud.  Scientists do not know how it was imprinted.  They do know it was not painted.  They do know it portrays a man crucified according to the Roman penchant for torture.  Therefore when faced with the “evidence” one must make a decision.  Either believe the science or don’t.  You can’t have it both ways guys!\n\n","date":"June 28, 2012 at 9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/19/who-is-evolving-into-stupid/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-13134","author":"Sheila","site":"shroudstory"}]
