[{"title":"Shroud of Turin Ohio State University Lecture on Carbon Dating Problem","post":"for years I wondered why they carbon-dated the corner of the fabric.  Any IDIOT would know that part had been handled, greased up, rubbed on, sweated into and otherwise contaminated for centuries.\nAnd what about the spores?  Aren’t there microscopic plant spores in the fabric that are only found in the mediterranean coastal region of Palestine?  Isn’t there evidence the cloth comes from that area?\nSome scientist really needs to explain the image.  Is it a result of temperature over a short time?  A flash?  Some kind of radiation?  Is it seeping chemicals from a body?  If so, why is the image so THIN on the cloth?  \nAnd how would medieval types know the design of the Roman flail?  or that we would later know how to prove human blood through analysis, so they needed to use real blood for the ‘fake’ stains?\nit’s all SO hard to rationalize UNLESS you’re so psychologically wedded to it NOT being real that you just ignore all the unlikelihoods.\n\n","date":"June 1, 2010 at 7:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/25/shroud-of-turin-ohio-state-university-lecture-on-carbon-dating-problem/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-1300","author":"dave in dallas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin Ohio State University Lecture on Carbon Dating Problem","post":"The fist article in Analytical Chemistry described the acrual sample testing by 3 different labaoratories aggreed on the results. It was dated somewhere 1350 or so. Look up the exact article to find their date. While Science tells us a story, interpretation is by humans. Faith is human. So, we have to decide who wins –  science or faith. I would bet Faith because it is in us not wanting any verification by science. So, it does not matter what science tells us.  Even if the shroud is not authentic, the belief is biology, again from modern science tells us. Let the faith exist and science do it’s job, unless an Avathaar tells us what is the truth behind this issue?\nIn sharing how to find the truth?\n\n","date":"March 5, 2012 at 6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/25/shroud-of-turin-ohio-state-university-lecture-on-carbon-dating-problem/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-8975","author":"vaidy bala","site":"shroudstory"}]
