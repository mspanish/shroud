Anyone who has read enough about the topic knows that this hypothesis has been dismissed by the topmost scholars. So what did he do? He has appealed to the Patio tomb, twenty metres away, bringing in yet another theory, based on flimsy evidence. He went to the extent of bringing world-renowned epigrapher Father Émile Puech into the scene to show the less accurate of two replicas of the so-called Jonah ossuary leading the priest into a trap, the same thing he did with Professor François Bovon, who died last week. Nothing has been proved, but that does not deter him. He also smiled when Father Puech told him that Jesus was resurrected and so there could be no remains in any ossuary.\nRealising that this second theory is also bound to fall apart, he has now announced a (bombastic) book and documentary to be launched together with Discovery in a few months time. And what is it about? It is about “God’s bride”, that is, Jesus and Mary Magdalene. And what is it based on? A fourth-century, repeat, fourth century, gnostic document. Worse, he has twisted the meaning of one line to suit his fancies. Well, by now he should know that he will not have the success he expects because the flaws have already been shown by some of the world’s best scholars.\nJacobovici is also one-track minded, he has not studied enough, and if he did he would think twice about what he is proposing, realising that he faces the possibility of being swallowed by quicksand in the very beach he is taking us to see some entertainment which he is advertising as serious studies. He who smiles last smiles most.\nWe should avoid extreme positions, whether it comes to the TS or to developments in Biblical Archaeology.\n\n","date":"November 6, 2013 at 5:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/blowing-the-antonacci-proposal-to-bits/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50224","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blowing the Antonacci Proposal to bits","post":"I deliberately omitted a third ingredient from the neutron-generating mixture, needed to make it fit- for-purpose (wouldn’t want to make things too easy for our would-be Resurrection-simulators now, would we?).\nMissing ingredient?

One wonders in fact if everyone is working from the same Mark Evans/Barrie Schwortz photomicrographs that appear in the 2010 Fanti et al paper on microscopic versus macroscopic aspects of the Shroud image (available in open access pdf format on a tab on the following link):\nhttp://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/ist/10623701/v54n4/s1.pdf?expires=1383868381&id=76156936&titleid=72010085&accname=Guest+User&checksum=FE438FED5C0A58ED995D793814E07220\nScroll down to Fig. 7 and read the caption, and try spotting the details that are described. Some might feel, like me, that at least 5 times the magnification is needed to be sure that one is really seeing all those details, that they are consistent features, and that they represent something terribly unexpected and out of the ordinary for an ancient discolored piece of linen. If the high-tech claims by Fazio and Mandaglio for the Shroud image being stochastic and quantized etc (and thus created we are told, first as a latent image with low energy input, and then developed later etc etc,) are also based on these same photographs, at the same inadequate level of magnification, then a healthy degree of scepticism is in order methinks. \nI have another niggle re that Fig 7: the comparison for a “contact-only” image is a rust stain on the Shroud. I would like to have seen what the fainter scorch edges look like too, and, in due course, model scorches alongside the Shroud image before too many castles get built in the sky. Heat scorches do not have to be high localized, i.e. restricted to points of actual contacts, since pyrolysis gases (superheated steam etc with a high thermal energy content)  entering the interstices of the weave may exert effects at a distance, and that’s without considering Garlaschelli-style scenarios with hot adhering particles of ochre or other thermosensitizing pigments that “etch” the fabric after gentle roasting in an oven, maybe in a more subtle fashion than simply pressing a hot bas-relief template directly against the cloth.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 7:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/blowing-the-antonacci-proposal-to-bits/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50369","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blowing the Antonacci Proposal to bits","post":"I always tend to trust more scientists like Pellicori of STURP (a real imagery expert by the way) who was there in Turin in 1978 and saw the Shroud with his own eyes (and through a microscope)…  And since he published his observations in a peer-reviewed journal and said to the world that the Shroud image was extremely superficial (no more than 2 or 3 colored fibers in deep) and that it clearly show a discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area, I have no good reason right now to not trust such observations, especially when I consider the fact that these observations never were put in doubt by any other STURP researchers who were also present on location in Turin.

You and others are far too quick to see mystery, giving your agenda-driven pro-authenticity spiel (plus tirades and personal attacks) a veneer of  superficial plausibility by recourse to second-hand stochastic mumbo jumbo and quantum weirdness without ever stopping to consider the basics of flax botany or the vagaries of retting biotechnology.\nSorry, but I’m not impressed by your MO. But then, I’m just a boring old experimentalist (and hypothesis-tester).\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 12:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/blowing-the-antonacci-proposal-to-bits/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50445","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blowing the Antonacci Proposal to bits","post":"If you’re not willing to listen to me (that can be understandable because I’m no scientist), I think you should start to listen to real experts in radiations like Fazio, Mandaglio and Rogers who worked all their life in this field of science…  And when I hear experts like that telling me that I must forget any image formation mechanism that involved a release of high energetic radiation of any kind (for the simple reason that if this was the case, all the superficial fibers of the colored threads on the Shroud would be colored, which is not the case at all), I LISTEN CAREFULLY AND HAVE NO REASON TO NOT TRUST THEIR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT (at least, until I get some proofs of their intellectual dishonesty versus the Shroud, which I never found in their cases so far).\nIf three well-recognized experts in heart surgery that never have been accused of being intellectually dishonest or of working with an agenda being their back would say to you that, without any doubt, heating carrots cannot gives you a heart attack, why would you not trust their professional judgment?  For me, it’s exactly the same thing for the professional judgment of Fazio, Mandaglio and Rogers regarding the scientific impossibility of high energetic radiations to have produced an image with all the same properties as the one on the Shroud…\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 5:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/blowing-the-antonacci-proposal-to-bits/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50473","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blowing the Antonacci Proposal to bits","post":"Have you consulted any “experts” in acupuncture recently?
