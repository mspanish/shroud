But even so, this is a literal reading of scripture which cannot be deemed scientific. I am a true believer but I don’t take scripture literally in the sense that it is a scientific description or a historical narrative that conforms to modern objective historical standards or even journalistic standards.  Thanks for you opinion. We can both be true believers and still disagree on particulars.\n\n","date":"December 31, 2009 at 8:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/11/23/the-mummy-at-the-georges-labit-museum-in-toulouse/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-908","author":"Episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"}]
