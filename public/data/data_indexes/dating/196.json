[{"title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis","post":"Hi Reader!\n1) Sort of. (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerppt.pdf)\n2) Because he said so.\n3) No.\n4) From examination of photographs.\n5) No.\n(Five questions…)\nA bit of elaboration though. I am not in favour of accusing anybody of fraud without very good reason to do so, and the fact that I disagree with their findings is not a good reason. People do make mistakes, and it is possible that the threads Rogers received from Gonella were misattributed, but again, simply disagreeing with conclusions is not not evidence for such misattribution. If McCrone shows me a slide covered in red dots he calls iron oxide, or Max Frei shows me a slide of a pollen grain he calls Prunus arabica, then I assume that the dots do look like iron oxide, and the grain looks like Prunus arabica, unless somebody can show me that they don’t. I may think that the dots are actually something else similar, or that the pollen grain looks like dozens of similar species, but I do not doubt that the scientists made their identifications in good faith. Naive of me, perhaps, but once you start accusing people of fraud, where can you stop, and why should you have any credibility yourself?\nThe answers to the first two questions, then, are not, to mind, evidence that Rogers did not, in fact, examine fibres from the Shroud.\nThe second two, however, raise corollaries. The photo of a fragment of the radiocarbon sample sent to Thomas Ferguson, David Pearson, Louis Harner and  was not very clear. I do not know what else Benford and Marino asked these experts, or what other information they were given.\nThomas Ferguson was non-committal – the right hand side may have been ” “touched up to prevent unraveling”.\nDavid Pearson was more positive: “there is no question that there is different material on each side… It is definitely a patch.” This, of course, was in the days when Benford and Marino assumed that each radiocarbon piece was dated as a whole, and that the date of the piece reflected the proportions of the two materials. Actually, this piece was cut into five, and if Pearson was correct, some dates would have been all 1st century, some dates would have been 16th or 17th century, and only where the materials merged would the 14th century, mixed, date have been found. That this did not happen is evidence that Pearson was quite simply completely wrong. He also said that “medieval European weavers would … hand-stitch approximately ½ inch of new material into the old, such that it was invisible to all but the trained eye.” This half inch of blended threads is not visible at all to any eye, which suggests that it isn’t there.\nLouis Harmer said “the float is different on either side of the sample.” It is not clear to me if he was making the same mistake as Pearson.\nIt is interesting that a second set of photos – from the Oxford sample this time – has been sent to Thomas Ferguson, and reported on in detail by Donna Campbell. Her comments are considerably more circumspect. “There are signs in the Shroud sample that direct the notion of mending or reweaving of the actual woven fabric.” Directing a notion is hardly a ringing endorsement. (http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Home_files/Updated_report_on_the_Consideration_to_the_Uniformity_and_Effects_of_the_Fabric_in_the_Shroud_of_Turin-5-1.pdf)\nFinally, nobody has refuted Flury-Lemberg’s insistence that “invisible mending” is not invisible. This has become something of an impasse. Devotees insist that there is a style of mending which is completely invisible even under a microscope. The fact that it cannot be seen just shows how invisible it is. They point to French Reweaving, the Frenway Method or Invisible Mending, all of which are commercially available, as evidence that mending can be invisible, but they’re wrong. No actual invisible mender is so foolish as to claim that his mend is actually invisible, even under a microscope. Indeed, as  Flury-Lemberg humourously pointed out, how could you see what you were doing if your work disappeared in front of your eyes! The last resort of the invisible mending faction is to claim that it was carried out in a style since lost to us. So not only is the invisible mending itself invisible, but so is the invisible mending technique!\n\n","date":"November 22, 2015 at 9:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-214969","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis","post":"Quibbling with Donna Campbell cautious statement is not a rebuttal.

If you believe that the different colours on the quad photos represent different materials, then you must believe that the wide blue bands across three of the photos represent a different material from the orangy-yellow field, and that the dark green corners on all four photos represent another, and that the deep pinky-red area of the dorsal legs represents yet another. This is absurd. The similarity between the colour distortions on all four photos suggests that they are due to the similar way each photo was lit, and nothing to do with the composition of the cloth.\nJohn, I read the quotation entirely accurately the first time, thank you, and believe that the ‘darning’ referred to by Delorenzi was that of the repairs to the burn holes, and not to anywhere else. It is apparent from the clumsiness of the patching, and the fact that extra patches of a different material were added to the original ones, and the black stitching that used to be easy to see which was always used by Sebastian Valfré, that several hands, at several different times, contributed to these repairs.

That dark green is a sign of contamination.  The fact that the dark green runs parallel with the weave near left edge and has a sharp end, instead of gradually fading as near the holes, indicates or at least implies a systemic or intentionally man-made contamination, such as possibly a re-weave, though could also be the applying of dyes or colourant to hide a patch, say if at one time the big rectangular hole may have been patched and coloured to hide the ugly hole.

While some evidence has been offered in support of the reweave hypothesis there are important counter arguments.  Among the latter is the fact that the textile experts who were involved in the 2002 Shroud conservation project examined the sample area and reported they could not identify or find explicit evidence of any reweaving.  Also, TSC has carefully studied the X-ray and transmitted light photographs taken by STURP of the sample area and has seen no evidence of reweaving in this type of imagery.  TSC thinks the negative evidence for reweaving is difficult to overcome and that the ultimate answer to the anomalous radiocarbon testing result lies elsewhere.”\nThe conclusion that the Shroud was in Constantinople in 1204 is strongly supported, both historically and empirically.  Such a conclusion means the radiocarbon dating of the sample cut from the Shroud failed to date the Shroud correctly. However, why the radiocarbon dating of the 1988 single sample cut from the Shroud did not properly date the Shroud’s true age remains a valid unresolved question that merits continued research.  TSC is most interested in exploring “enhanced contamination” other than that associated with a reweave.  Others are encouraged to continue to investigate the reweave hypothesis.\n\n","date":"November 22, 2015 at 9:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-214990","author":"Robert W.

These indications may include:  1) Fanti’s mechanical testing suggesting the possibility of a 1st century date;  2) Historic arguments that the Shroud was in Constantinople in 1204;  3) Indications from the Hungarian Pray manuscript that distinctive features of the Shroud were known in 1195, prior to the alleged C14 dating;  4)  Forensic arguments that the image is that of a real crucified person who suffered the punishments reported in the gospels including a crown of thorns and percussio wound to the chest;  5) the otherwise inexplicable cause of the image;  6) the unsmeared blood stains;  5) Presence of Jerusalem limestone;  Etc, etc! \nThe assertion of homogeneity of the cloth remains unproven, in light of reputable assertions of occasional mending, and in that case a single grab sample is insufficient, even though it might be a routine practice for testing of other cloths (e.g. mummy wrappings) for which there would be no cause to presume mending.

So few are left as the surfaces disintegrated with folding and with the wear of time, probably about twelve good ones from the thousands that are recorded in church inventories. The Shroud seems to be a typical linen that was once painted with the linen surface being discoloured by centuries of gesso and paint being placed over it in the way that the medieval manuals laid down. Sadly Charlotte Villiers, an expert on painted linens, who saw the Shroud  as just this, died tragically young- I would have loved to ask her why she came to this conclusion about the Shroud.\nMy own view is that Garlaschelli is being unnecessarily complicated as if the Shroud was somehow unique and not typical of its time when painted originally.\nI am in no rush to have my hypothesis proved as new research is continuing apace and I think that within the next five to ten years the Shroud will fit into the once painted linens category with experts agreeing on this.

The weavers tell me that the Shroud  is a typical  product of a medieval treadle loom as if there was no argument about it- the 113cms width is the give away as this was a common width in medieval cloth – the six linen strips of the Zittau Veil of 1472 sewn alongside each other  come to a total of 6.80 meters!\nAs so often, time , developing technology and expertise will come up with fresh approaches- I think they will end up with a fourteenth century origin but what’s the rush when there is so much new work on ancient linens under way which will probably provide a definitive answer.\n\n","date":"November 23, 2015 at 4:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-215031","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis","post":"Charles, “The Shroud seems to be a typical linen that was once painted with the linen surface being discoloured by centuries of gesso and paint being placed over it in the way that the medieval manuals laid down.”\nNonsense.

One of great scientist Francis S. Collins wrote a book, “The Language of God-A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief.” Oh, and Mr. Collins believes in the God of the Bible. Another great book is, “Quantum Questions-Mystical Writings of the World’s Greatest Physicists.”  It has writings from people like Heisenberg, Schroedinger, Jeans, Pauli and others. I reread this book at least once a year.\nWe had a program on PBS TV called “Closer to Truth” where they looked at questions about the universe, God, consciousness and meaning by interviews with our leading      scientists, philosophers, scholars and theologians. They have a website with all the videos they did and they cover both sides of the issues.\nhttp://www.closertotruth.com\nThe debate of an uncaused event goes back to at least Aristotle and Plato. One side says the Universe is uncaused event, the other sides says no it’s not, God caused it. The other side comes back and ask, “What caused god?” Some accept the idea of a metaphysical necessity the other side rejects it. William Lane Craig defends the kalam cosmological argument the other side claims his reasoning is unsound. It goes on and on.\nPlato’s, “Allegory of the Cave” rings true. I think we are still in the stages where reality is just shadows on the wall. I feel Jesus, Buddha, Lao-tzu and others have tried to bring us out of the shadows.\n\n","date":"November 26, 2015 at 6:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-215129","author":"John Green","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis","post":"PS\nDaniel Dennett also believes the universe had a cause, but it caused itself.

It is a sequence, which will enable you to grasp the approach that is taken. Needless to say, it will be modified as time goes by, because we learn about developments in science and religion almost every,single day.\nI can say something about a few points you have mentioned in your comment. We are indeed in the “shadows”, however there is a clash between Buddha because Buddhism is a negative soteriology and Jesus, linked to the Judaeo-Christian tradition, which does not say the same thing. Actually, in Buddhism some concepts are very vague and, in the end, there is “nothing”. Science tells us that nothing comes from nothing and nothing goes to nothing. Viewed from that angle, the Judaeo-Christian tradition is more convincing.\nSo if there is “something”, What is it? Read the introduction:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJ\nNote that Stephen Hawking keeps on changing his mind. He is a very good scientist, but I have the feeling he is also influenced by biology and this is a kind of guide to the direction he is taking.\nIf we get back to the “shadows” you mentioned, Who created them? It was a problem that C.G. Jung discussed with his closest friend, the American Dominican monk Father Victor White. Their friendship almost came to an end and, yet, the deep spiritual bond was not broken. Evil, in the Swiss psychiatrist’s view, was God’s “shadow”. Really? And why? He based himself on Genesis:\n. https://www.academia.edu/7344691/C._G._Jung_Father_Victor_White_and_privatio_boni\nIt is not that the topic they were discussing was not the object of dispute before them. It was present even in Old Testament times, possibly causing the split between Enochic Judaism and the Essenes:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/12734802/Book_Review_Beyond_the_Essene_Hypothesis_The_Parting_of_the_Ways_between_Qumran_and_Enochic_Judaism\nIn our own days, we are confronted with what happened during the Nazi holocaust, which leads us to the Bible again and to questions that remain unanswered:  https://www.academia.edu/12823419/Book_Review_Jesus_and_Yahveh_the_names_divine\nIf you read what is in the first link you will notice that some things are not compatible with what we learn from biblical archaeology today. William F. Albright is a thing of the past:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/18473226/The_key_role_of_Biblical_Archaeology_in_Exegesis_An_interview_with_Professor_Israel_Finkelstein\nI was able to meet, talk to and interview the prominent archaeologist, part of a project that will later include more studies in science and religion. So, if you have read what is in the link above you are bound to ask, If archaeology cannot give the final verdict and the Bible narratives include some Near Eastern myths where does that get us? Do we (that is, those of us who are Christians) have to become like Heidegger, or, better, like Wittgenstein, and think about becoming monks?:  https://www.academia.edu/6085481/Why_was_Wittgensteins_burial_attended_by_a_religious_ceremony\nOr do we have to toss what we learn from archaeology and Bible aside as unconvincing, leading to blind alleys, and become atheists like Freud?:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds_incomplete_speculation_on_monotheism\nIn my view, none of this needed, we have to wait for more developments in science and religion and both have to be put together:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/14727603/Why_Stephen_Jay_Gould_proposed_the_principle_of_Non-overlapping_Magisteria\nJust too many links had to be posted here, but it was necessary in order to drive my point home. You can always contact me by email if you wish to do so. I will be concentrating on book reviews in the next few days, but I can always make some time for you.\n\n","date":"November 26, 2015 at 11:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-215138","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis","post":"Hello John\nThis is a topic that takes a very long time to discuss.

Yes, he does. The problem is that the God of the Bible took a long time to emerge, if we are to understand the narratives correctly.
