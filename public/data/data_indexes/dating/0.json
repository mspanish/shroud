The problem is that it seems no one has come with a theory about how the results were skewed which is acceptable to all Shroudies or not challenged by non-Shroudies.\nProfessor Ramsey is a practising Christian, his faith does not depend on the TS.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2014 at 6:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/07/1988-pictures-and-details-from-oxford/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-127633","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"1988 Pictures and Details from Oxford","post":"Interesting to learn that Professor Ramsey is a practicing Christian .

First she wrote:\n“Just to say that I applied to Oxford University (under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2007)  to supply the photographs and data surrounding the 1988 tests.\n“Professor Ramsey has put most of it online.  (one of the samples is missing but the Shroud data is there).\nI wrote to her and asked her to explain what she meant when she said a sample was missing. Her next email to me stated:\n“If you look at the whole sample of three of the tested cloths p2574_5;   p2576_5   and p2575_8     you can see the first three samples.  But the last one (I suspect it is Louis’ cloak) is missing.\n“I’m fairly sure the Shroud is p2575  – the only herringbone weave and it looks like other related images we’ve seen of nearby samples.  But on Monday I will go back to the compliance officer and question it.”\n\n","date":"June 8, 2014 at 12:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/07/1988-pictures-and-details-from-oxford/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-127688","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"1988 Pictures and Details from Oxford","post":"“I suspect it is Louis’ cloak”.

(The slight loss is probably due to the pretreatment with petroleum ether.) Therefore all the available textile was used for the dating procedure and no reserve was left.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2014 at 4:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/07/1988-pictures-and-details-from-oxford/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-127722","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"}]
