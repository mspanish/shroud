The papyrus fragment measures 8cm x 4cm, from which enough material for two separate radiocarbon measurements have been taken. In 1988 it would have required about 10% of the entire artifact. It appears that the shred given to the AMS lab in Arizona was actually too small, and, because it was in danger of being reduced to almost nothing, the cleaning procedure wasn’t completed. Presumably the second attempt at Woods Hole used a bigger sample.\nWithout knowing the provenance of the papyrus, the amount tested, or the procedure carried out by Gregory Hodgins, I wouldn’t place a probability on any particular reason for the anomalous dates, but reasonable scenarios can be suggested. One that comes to mind is the possibility of dissolved limestone in the water in which the papyrus grew, or was manufactured. The carbon atoms in limestone can be millions of years old, and contain no C14 at all. Unless they are carefully removed, the papyrus dates much older than it actually is, and if the acid washing required was curtailed or reduced, that may account for the first, anomalous, date.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2014 at 7:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/carbon-dating-problems-with-the-jesus-wife-fragment/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-98190","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating Problems with the “Jesus’ Wife” Fragment","post":"“the cleaning procedure wasn’t completed”, do you have a reference?\n\n","date":"April 10, 2014 at 7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/carbon-dating-problems-with-the-jesus-wife-fragment/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-98193","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating Problems with the “Jesus’ Wife” Fragment","post":"Karen King’s own article in the same edition of the Harvard Theological Revue.\n\n","date":"April 11, 2014 at 3:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/carbon-dating-problems-with-the-jesus-wife-fragment/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-98280","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating Problems with the “Jesus’ Wife” Fragment","post":"I assume the sample cleaning methods are even much updated and improved than what the shroud went through.

Part of the difficulty with C14 dating of the fragment is that the fragment is so small, that the sample taken was likely inadequate for any kind of valid test. A forger can easily obtain ancient papyrus on the black market, so although dating of the papyrus is a necessary indicator it is not a sufficient test. It is however apparently more difficult to forge the ink, and it seems that the ink has passed the necessary tests which were a critical aspect of proof.  It has been asserted that parts of the text are a direct uplift from the Gospel of Thomas, and if true then this would be a valid cause for suspicion. \nIf ever proven to be truly authentic, I see no problems with the content of the text.  A variety of interpretations are possible. Vatican experts have made the point that it may be merely an allusion to the Church as the Bride of Christ.  I would suspect however that all it means was that some Gnostic group were likely debating whether marriage in general was an acceptable state for their followers, where celibacy had previously been a strict rule. The debate is also indicated in Paul’s epistles, which merely show his preference for celibacy. One way the group might have sought to resolve the issue might have been to assert that Christ himself was married.  The absence of any kind of tradition or canonical scripture concerning a wife, persuades most exegegtes that he was not.  However debate within a gnostic group might have been sufficiently robust, for the advocates of a married life-style to dream up a text that he was, regardless.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2014 at 7:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/carbon-dating-problems-with-the-jesus-wife-fragment/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-98200","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating Problems with the “Jesus’ Wife” Fragment","post":"See #6 above\n\n","date":"April 10, 2014 at 8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/carbon-dating-problems-with-the-jesus-wife-fragment/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-98203","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Carbon Dating Problems with the “Jesus’ Wife” Fragment","post":"Sorry, all, it’s been night-time here in the UK! Mike is perfectly correct that airily dismissing a dodgy date as “contamination” is not helpful, and I would like to know how the pre-treatment of Hodgins’ sample went awry. However, by dating the papyrus twice, and comparing it to a known sample, the outlying date was rapidly identified. In the case of the Shroud the sample was dated three times, and compared to three known samples, and no outlier was identified. Furthermore, various different pretreatments were given the Shroud samples, to dispel a suggestion that if they were all treated exactly the same, then they were all equally likely to miss a contaminent.\nNevertheless, a misdating of an 8th century papyrus to the 4th century BC requires a substantial dilution of its C14 content, and if the pretreatment was known to be that inefficient, it is surprising that the AMS procedure was continued.
