[{"title":"Part 3  is up:  Did Stephen Jones make the case?","post":"I personally don’t buy the Hacking claim. Manipulation of the sample would be as far as any one can go if we want to try to discredit the C14 dating. How can you dupe scientists who were there during the counting of the C14 atoms? They can tell before processing the data whether the date would be old or new. I heard one of them on an interview saying that within 5 minutes they knew this was not 2000 years old. If we suspect foul play it’s either the sample was manipulated (before splitting) or nothing. Nothing else makes sense as plausible.\n\n","date":"February 22, 2014 at 8:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/22/part-3-is-up-did-stephen-jones-make-the-case/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-81388","author":"Mike M.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Part 3  is up:  Did Stephen Jones make the case?","post":"Correction (before splitting=before distribution)\n\n","date":"February 22, 2014 at 9:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/22/part-3-is-up-did-stephen-jones-make-the-case/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-81393","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Part 3  is up:  Did Stephen Jones make the case?","post":"Stephen’s last three posts, on the possibility that the radiocarbon results were produced by a hacker, are so preposterous that, like Carpinteri, Ruello and Bruno Bonnet-Eymard, they weaken the overall credibility of the authenticist case to the point of ridicule. There is a lot of good scientific and historical evidence for authenticity, but if it comes in a package with this nonsense it is hardly surprising that Jerry Coyne, Joe Nickell and other critics regard the whole case for authenticity with contempt. With friends like these, as I said yesterday, who needs enemies?\nAs usual Stephen’s basic axiom is that the shroud is genuine. Given that premise as indisputable, it would indeed be surprising that a randomly incorrect radiocarbon age would match the date when the shroud is first mentioned historically. However, in logic, the more improbable a corollary, the less sound is the axiom upon which it depends, and Stephen’s own incredulity actually forces a reconsideration of his basic premise as much as it does an expanation of the corollary.\nBe that as it may, he quotes the unlikeliness of the radiocarbon date matching the historical date as “one in a thousand trillion.” This comes from Harry Gove’s book where it is thrown in at the end of the book with no explanation. It’s nonsense of course. If there is no C-14 in a sample at all, it cannot be dated as older than about a hundred thousand years, and if it contains more C-14 than there is in the atmosphere, it cannot be dated, obviously, to a time in the future. Consequently even if a wholly random date was derived from radiocarbon dating, it would have a one in a hundred thousand chance of being correct. This is ten billion times more likely than Gove’s probability! If a range of a hundred years were acceptable, then the probability that a wholly random C-14 date was co-incidentally correct becomes one in a thousand.\nStill, one in a thousand is pretty unlikely, which is why the 1350 date cannot be dismissed as random, nor, because it conflicts with Stephen’s axiom, can it be dismissed “out of hand.” If it is wrong, it is wrong for a reason. Some sensible reasons have been put forward, more or less credible, but the hacker hypothesis is one of the least.\n\n","date":"February 22, 2014 at 9:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/22/part-3-is-up-did-stephen-jones-make-the-case/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-81394","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Part 3  is up:  Did Stephen Jones make the case?","post":"The first paragraph by Hugh above summarises the problems in the controversy very well.

Why would a forger go to the trouble to make something look 1st century but use ‘fresh’ linen? Wouldn’t you try and obtain older linen?\nColin, if you’re following this, I can see why you have suggested the image was first your Templar, then later revised to be Christ. This hypothesis would explain why the linen was fresh but then needed to be artificially aged to look ancient.\nAnd before John and Yanonymous pipe in about the absurdity of that hypothesis, I’m not promoting it here.

Graduate student Robert T. Morris, Jr. of Cornell University launches a worm on the government’s ARPAnet (precursor to the Internet). The worm spreads to 6,000 networked computers, clogging government and university systems.

It wasn’t hacking. It was ditching of the protocols, unrepresentative sampling, and the unfortunate choice of the sampling site. Nothing to do with the labs at all, except they acquiesced in accepting an unrepresentative sample.\n\n","date":"February 22, 2014 at 11:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/22/part-3-is-up-did-stephen-jones-make-the-case/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-81547","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
