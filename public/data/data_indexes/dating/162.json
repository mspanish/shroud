The first couple of pages deal with the now wholly discredited quad mosaic photos, and the illustrations of the rest of the paper are too blurred to substantiate any of their observations. Using Shroud 2.0 on an iPad the details of the stiching can be seen quite clearly, and there certainly has been a bit of correction around the place where the side seam runs along the edge of the cut out corners. However this is related to the fixing of the shroud to the backing cloth, and has nothing to do with invisible patching.\n\n","date":"February 26, 2014 at 7:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/02/09/scientific-article-on-the-discrepancies-in-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-82856","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
