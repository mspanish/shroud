Racemization is the entropy-driven process that scrambles the two forms, producing finally (be prepared to wait a long time – say centuries)  a 50/50 mixture of the two. Theoretically one might exploit the rate of racemization to make a chemical clock. At least it’s guaranteed to be right twice every 24 hours. Anything else is a bonus.\nWhen can we expect BSTS newsletter 81?

All of the research to date has been pointing to one thing and that is that the Shroud is the cloth that our Lord Jesus Christ was ‘wrapped’ in grave in.  The big question that science has, in my opinion, is how did God do it ??  Science wants to learn the in’s and out’s of the procedure so that they can become as gods.  That is even covered in the Scriptures. The research pointed to the middle age repair work and the fact that the Carbon 14 dating was done on a repaired portion of the cloth.  My main concern is the number of people who do not accept the ‘99%’ that proves what the Shroud is but are die-hards in accepting the ‘1%’ of the what the Shroud isn’t.  It seems to me that the Shroud points to the fact that Jesus Christ arose from the dead and that fact is just too hard for people to accept.  There is a date and time for every living human on the Earth to face the facts.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2015 at 7:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/if-they-had-only-waited-until-2020-or-so/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-206432","author":"ekmcmahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"If They Had Only Waited Until 2020 Or So","post":"You’re absolutely right\n\n","date":"July 24, 2015 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/if-they-had-only-waited-until-2020-or-so/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-206453","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"}]
