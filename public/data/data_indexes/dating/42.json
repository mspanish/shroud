[{"title":"Overheard behind us during Barrie’s Talk: “That’s only Listerine”","post":"There are at least two ways of addressing the possibility of thymol contamination. The first is to buy in some radio-labelled thymol, add it to linen on a sealed container, see how much becomes attached, either physically (by adsorption) or chemically. To check for the latter, one takes the thymol-treated linen through the clean-up procedure used in one’s chosen radiocarbon AMS-dating protocol to see whether or not it detaches.\nWhat if thymol does attach, and does not detach on clean-up?\nIt’s not the end of the world. One coping strategy is to determine what proportion of one’s linen is accountable as carbohydrate. That can be done by acid hydrolysis and glc-mass spectrometry, and measuring all the carbohydrates (glucose, xylose, arabinose etc).\nOne could then calculate the maximum amount of linen that is non-carbohydrate, then assume conservatively that it was all modern carbon (including thymol contaminants), and calculate the maximum reduction in radiocarbon age due to possible/maximal contamination. If that were small, say a few decades, one could stop there. Suppose it were not. Suppose the real age could be centuries older based on possible contamination?\nAgain, it’s not the end of the world. There are ways of dissolving and re-precipitating cellulose, the main constituent of linen, so one does one’s carbon-dating on purified cellulose instead of whole linen. The advantage of that is one can check the purity of the isolated cellulose by its glucose content (100% of its mass should be accountable as glucose, allowing for water), and even if it’s 99.9%, there’s not enough modern carbon there to throw the dating, whether it’s thymol or something else.\nThis should all have been done 20-25 years ago needless to say. If a result is inconclusive one repeats it (and if there are uncertainties re protocol one addresses them, and does not sit wringing one’s hands, or intoning mañana, mañana. There’s an entire industry out there, intent on trashing the 1988 dating, and the reputations of the 3 labs that were commissioned to carry it out. It’s time that nasty little industry was put out of business, even if the result comes back that the Shroud is 1st century AD (or still medieval). If it’s the first, I personally might consider applying for admission to a monastery…\nIf a task is once begun\nNever leave it till it’s done\nBe the labour great or small\nDo it well or not at all.\n\n","date":"November 5, 2013 at 10:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/overheard-behind-us-during-barries-talk-thats-only-listerine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50040","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Overheard behind us during Barrie’s Talk: “That’s only Listerine”","post":"Was anything like thymol around in the 16th century, that without the need for patches and interweaving, or smearing with madder and gum, could have traded carbon atoms with the cellulose of the cloth, thus truly, undetectably, have altered the date?\n\n","date":"November 5, 2013 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/overheard-behind-us-during-barries-talk-thats-only-listerine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50049","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Overheard behind us during Barrie’s Talk: “That’s only Listerine”","post":"You mean like parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme?\n\n","date":"November 5, 2013 at 11:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/overheard-behind-us-during-barries-talk-thats-only-listerine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50051","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Overheard behind us during Barrie’s Talk: “That’s only Listerine”","post":"I’m trying to think where “Scarborough Fair” comes into this (or whether Dan intended this as a response to Anonymous on a different thread re those leaf and other plant imprints).

A close reading of Rogers has him referring mainly to the physical adsorption of thymol to wood initially, then to the cellulose of linen, and only at the end of the passage does he  in passing seem to be implying a chemical bonding to linen. But why? Thymol and other phenols with their aromatic (weakly acidic) OH group should not show a bonding tendency towards other hydroxylic compounds, certainly not cellulose, the major constituent of linen, in which the -OH groups are in any case hydrogen-bonding with one another, explaining the enormous chemical resistance of the cellulose fibres. I for one would have had no hesitation in filtering a reaction mixture with phenols through Whatman filter paper. \nIt would be the easiest thing in the world to take some old linen or paper, treat it with thymol, and see whether the dating is affected. My guess is it will not be appreciably, because thymol will only adsorb physically, and will be removed by the clean up procedures, which is what they are designed for.\nI’m getting increasingly suspicious of these claims that radiocarbon dating is rendered invalid due to the likelihood that X,Y or Z is present and presents an insuperable contamination problem. I would say to those people – consult with chemists before making these ex cathedra pronouncements (and don’t take everything Mr. Raymond Rogers RIP said as Gospel truth either).\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 2:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/overheard-behind-us-during-barries-talk-thats-only-listerine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50458","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Overheard behind us during Barrie’s Talk: “That’s only Listerine”","post":"I’m glad you said that. I’ve come across this: “The Late Glacial and Holocene development of vegetation in the area of a fossil lake in the Skaliska Basin (north-eastern Poland) inferred from pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating,” by Piotr Kolaczek et al, in Acta Palaeobotanica (53(1). The authors find that their radiocarbon dating of old peat bogs was improved by treating their macrofossils in glycerine-thymol-ethyl alcohol mixture, and then rinsing them with alcohol. They say: “The interesting fact is that most of the dates from the Skaliska Basin carried out from macrofossils treated by a mixture of glycerine, thymol and ethyl alcohol (but pretreated by rinsing them in alcohol) reflected a reliable age in comparison with that deduced from palynological analysis. The aforementioned observations give a far-reaching possibility of dating profiles investigated in the past, from which macrofossils have already been identified and collected (and thus preserved in glycerine-thymol-ethyl alcohol mixture).” They clearly do not think that even ancient (3000 BC) material is likely to be ruined from a radiocarbon dating point of view by preserving it in thymol, so 2000 year old material would be even less so.\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/overheard-behind-us-during-barries-talk-thats-only-listerine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50470","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Overheard behind us during Barrie’s Talk: “That’s only Listerine”","post":"Yes, I suspect there’s an assumption that being a powerful germicide, phenol must be chemically reactive, by analogy with bleach etc. But from my limited reading on the subject, phenol and its close relatives like thymol work by an entirely different principle, namely by staying intact and embedding themselves in biological membranes, messing up all the processes that depend on the the correct electrochemical environment for crucial processes like ion transport and uptake, oxidative phosphorylation etc. \nIf it were chemically-reactive it could never have been used in vapour form to fumigate operating theatres etc. prior to antibiotics. Sure, there were side effects (lung irritation) but phenol (and thymol) have never been linked to cancer as far as I’m aware, which would be the case if it chemically modified DNA etc.\nIf someone is to claim that substance X cannot be removed from linen by standard de-contamination procedures, they should provide evidence to back that view.

The clean-up procedures used in sample preparation for AMS-C14 dating should be able to strip off, aka “elute”,substances that are merely physically adsorbed, simply by steeping in acids, alkali, organic solvents etc that alter the polar/apolar balance between cellulose and adsorbed molecules, and, importantly, with little or no risk of degrading cellulose, it being chemically inert towards most molecules (and no more likely to form covalent chemical bonds with thymol than with any other ordinary everyday chemicals, phenols included).\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 8:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/overheard-behind-us-during-barries-talk-thats-only-listerine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-50491","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"}]
