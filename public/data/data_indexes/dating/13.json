Following graduation I followed it up with several supplementary papers in the topic during the following 20 or so years.  My first formal text was by Paul G Hoel, Professor of Mathematics, University of California in L.A. published in 1962,  It was an excellent work, and despite other subsequent texts I often had cause to refer back to it, and occasionally still do.  Towards the end of my career for some ten years during the 1990s I was advising the Internal Audit of a major NZ Corporate on the design of their sampling systems for audit purposes.  \nI believe a scientist seeks to obtain an absolute rigorous truth, which in theory is actually unattainable.  He has to be satisfied with building a theory which is as close to the truth as the evidence will take him at that particular time.  But he knows that ultimately it will be surpassed as new knowledge comes to hand.  The history of scientific progress adequately demonstrates that.  \nIn engineering, the engineer is expected to deliver within an acceptable time frame, he has little time available to him for research, and he has to be content with an acceptable economic solution that his knowledge can take him at that particular time.  In our Law courts the attempt to arrive at the truth is one notch lower than that of the scientist, and persons are condemned or liberated on the balance of reasonable probabilities, and a weight of circumstantial evidence may be sufficient.  In Audit, the quest is one notch lower again, and the auditor is content to give his assurance on such evidence as he may judge is sufficient according to the various tests he can economically apply. \nHoel discusses the question of the validity of sampling tests at length as early as Chapter 3 ‘Nature of Statistical Methods’.  “A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about the frequency function of a random variable.”  “A test of a statistical hypothesis is a procedure for deciding whether to accept or reject the hypothesis.”  \nHe then distinguishes between two types of error.  The Type I Error occurs when the hypothesis is actually true, but the sample falls into the critical area when the hypothesis is therefore falsely rejected.  The Type II Error occurs when the hypothesis is actually false but the sample falls within the true area, and so the hypothesis is falsely accepted.  Sampling therefore does not yield an absolute truth, but only a relative truth, it is no more than one particular method for making a decision.  It is an underlying assumption of course that the samples will also pass standard tests for being adequately representative, and there must be a sufficient number of samples which adequately demonstrate the amount of dispersion.  \nIn the case of the 1988 C-14 samples on the Shroud, there was in fact only one small sample taken, and there have been several valid questions raised that it was not in fact truly representative of the whole.  This single sample was split three ways, and the individual laboratories split their shares of the sample again so they could each run three individual tests on their share.  The control pieces have been criticised as inadequate, and of a different type from the sample and not comparable to the parent cloth.  Their results have been reported as apparently failing even a standard chi square test.  Even so, it might be asserted that the tests could be a valid result as far as the original sample was concerned.  However it cannot be asserted that the tests have been sufficiently rigorous to make any definitive statement about the age of the original cloth.  It is certainly not an absolute truth, it hardly passes as any kind of relative truth, I would not pass it even as an adequate audit test, and scientists ought not to hang on to it as passing any kind of worthwhile authentic scientific test!\n\n","date":"October 4, 2014 at 4:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/04/an-abstract-for-today/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-159294","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Abstract for Today","post":"How very complicated. In practice, you find an artifact which has a historical provenance to the middle of the 14th century, snip off an inconspicuous corner, and find that it dates to about 50 years before its provenance. Not a big surprise. Of course it may be wrong, but so far, inadequate evidence has been provided to convince me that it is, in spite of my earnest attempts to discover some. Neither Remi van Haelst’s or Riani & Atkinson’s statistical analysis detract from the overall medieval date, and nor do Garza-Valdez’s bioplastic coating nor Marino & Benford’s invisible patch stand up to investigation.

I was fascinated with the way in which a number of ‘ respectable ‘papers published the Fanti ratings, cleverly placed to appear before Easter, without checking them and then the story faded completely as soon as everyone realised he had three different dates, of which only one at  the most may have been correct, adjusted one but not the two others and then averaged them to produce his answer. The radiocarbon date wins out over this any day.\nBut I agree that we must build a raft of other evidence if we wish to support a medieval date. The earliest documentation is certainly helpful as I know a number of other cases where the earliest documentation and the date of the object concerned are similar. There is still a mountain of work to be done on the earliest descriptions and depictions of the Shroud and for conservationists to see whether what we are actually looking at is an image that has now faded from what it was originally.\nThe sceptics have the immense advantage in that ANY date other than between,say BC 20 and AD 33, means that the Shroud is not the authentic burial cloth.\n\n","date":"October 5, 2014 at 3:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/04/an-abstract-for-today/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-159431","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Abstract for Today","post":"The Fanti methods are as yet in their infancy, and probably need more refinement.
