[{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"The ignorance of the Professor Goodacre about the validity of the carbon dating is in proportion to the ignorance of the interlocutor and those on this blog who will defend carbon dating to the end. The following is an excerpt from my book that cites an item by Ian Wilson from the BSTS Newsletter published in 1990.\n“The first intimation of the dangling cotton thread came to the Shroud world in an article by Ian Wilson in the September-October 1990 issue of the BSTS Newsletter entitled “Cotton On The Oxford Carbon Dating Sample:\n“Kindly brought to our attention by the Revd. Kim Dreisbach of Atlanta is a hitherto unnoticed report in the journal Textile Horizons of December 1988 concerning the Shroud sample supplied to the Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratory. Apparently the British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd of Ambergate, Derbyshire was asked by the Oxford laboratory to help identify certain ‘foreign’ fibres observed, isolated and extracted from the Shroud sample prior to its destruction during the carbon dating process. \n“According to Precision Processes managing director, Peter South:\n“‘It was while the sample was undergoing tests at the radiocarbon acceleration unit in Oxford that Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place. He mentioned this to his friend Sir James Spooner, chairman of Coats Viyella, to which our firm belongs. Consequently, after several telephone calls, the minute samples, which looked like human hair, were sent to us.’ \n“Magnified two hundred times by a Precision Processes microscope the fibres became immediately identified as cotton. This might have been explicable as merely from the cotton gloves worn by members of the STURP team in 1978, but for the subsequent information imparted by Peter South:”\n‘The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old. Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ \n“This is not the first time that cotton strands have been identified on a Shroud sample. The Belgian Professor Gilbert Raes observed the same on the sample he studied in 1973, and he deduced that this was a strong indication of Middle Eastern manufacture. Clearly it could be of great interest to learn more both of the age of this cotton, and of the exact reason for its presence on the Shroud.”\n“BSTS Newsletter No. 26 – September/October 1990 (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n26part6.pdf)”\nPlease note the phrase “bound-in.”\nThis was not random surface contamination. And please note that Oxford knew this before the release of the carbon dating results. The red lights were flashing and the siren was blaring. For the labs to have stepped back a bit and dealt with this in their report would have resulted not only in a delay in a releasing their results and probably required a whole new sampling, something that would have virtually impossible to happen.\nIn The Sign, de Wesselow wrote:\n“The carbon dating of the Shroud will probably go down in history as one of the greatest fiascos in the history of science. It would make an excellent case study for any sociologist interested in exploring the ways in which science is affected by professional biases, prejudices and ambitions, not to mention religious (and irreligious) beliefs.”\n“Fiasco” was a gross understatement. \nhttp://johnklotz.blogspot.com\n\n","date":"March 5, 2015 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192478","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"John.\nWhy don’t you try to educate the CNN “expert” yourself on his own profile?

It is not even sure that cotton was known in Egypt at the time of Christ. Possibly cotton was introduced to low Egypt only centuries later.\n“Gilbert Raes … deduced that this was a strong indication of Middle Eastern manufacture.” Raes did not state exactly this, and if he did he would have been wrong. Cotton was surely used in Europe in the 14th century. Was it used in the Palestine of 1st century? Orit Shamir, in a 2015 paper from the Bari conference, has given a tabulation of the type of fiber for 1635 textile specimens of the Roman period from 23 sites in Israel:\nhttp://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2015/02/shsconf_atsi2014_00010.pdf\nThere is a lot of wool and linen, some goat hair and just three camel hair, but there is not one example of cotton.\nIt may also be useful to quote the final conclusion of Shamir:\n “The Turin Shroud was probably not manufactured in the Land of Israel neither in the Roman nor in the Medevial period. It may not have been imported in none of these periods because not one textile with the above weaving technique was found in the Land of Israel.”\n\n","date":"March 5, 2015 at 10:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192508","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Klotz will educate the expert.\n\n","date":"March 5, 2015 at 7:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-192481","author":"PHPL","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"I would point out the Professor Goodacre is a theologian not a scientist and swallows whole the carbon dating.

Caution!!! \nThe only value of the chi square test in this particular case, is a test within the single sample tested by the three separate laboratories.  It cannot be interpreted outside that single sample as being representative of the entire Shroud cloth.  \nIf the test failed (as it seems to have done), then there are two possibilities:  Either a) this sample was not homogeneous as divided among the three laboratories; Or b) the testing methods between the three laboratories have an intrinsic systematic error, yielding different ages for a homogeneous sample.  Given what is now known of the sample, then a) would seem to be the more likely. \nIf on the other hand, the chi test had succeeded, it could only be interpreted as: Both c) the sample, and only this sample, was adequately homogeneous within normal limits of error; And d) the methods used by the three laboratories could be asserted as evidently mutually consistent.  But e) it could not be asserted that the results are adequately representative of the entire cloth, as representative samples were not taken. \nThe more usual and conventional use of a chi square test, is to apply it to a full range of samples, alleged to be representative.

What happened to the rest of the mustache/beard on the veil relative to the Shroud?\nWho knows? ;-)\nGenerally one should stress out, that although the faces on both Shroud and Manoppello are supposed to be the same, and represent the same person, they are not identical in every detail. Contrary to popularised phrase, Manoppello is not a positive of the negative image on the Shroud, not in technical sense. There are some differences, notably the open/closed eyes, the more prominent beard and mustache on the Shroud image (although this still may be illusion, as the imaging mechanism on the Shroud depends on body cloth distance, also modulated in masterful way by several lighter and darked bands across the cloth -so the initial visual impression may be misleading, and one should not trust it too much), as well as slightly different position of lips and opened mouth. \nYet this does not undermine the conclusion The hypothesis (whether realistic or not) is that those are two images taken at disitnct time moments, just before (the Shroud) and just after the Resurrection (Manoppello). The key is to determine whether those faces actually are meant to represent the same person, and it seems yes.\n3. For me, the main things with overlays is what about control images, i.e. doing the same analysis on 3 unrelated bearded men-there has to be a certain amount of overlap between all of them-how much, I think, can be relatively subjective. The cloning enthusiasts show a pretty reasonable morphing/overlay of Prince William & the Shroud, including bearded & clean shaven PW versions.\nThe cloning enthusiast rarely (in fact never) work so methodically as I do. Their morphing presentations may be visually stunning, but they are most likely erronous – which can be shown, if studied carefully, point by point. As far as I remember, I cannot recall any morphing experiment that used marked features of the face (like I presented above) to show whether the positions of common details on both images actually correspond with each other, whether the proportions are actually the same etc. And absolutely no callibration.\nWhen you look at one face at one moment, and on another next moment, you may be visually deceived, and suppose they are the same, even if they are entirely different. And in another way, even if the two faces are actually the same, if overlay is performed badly, you can be under impression that they are different. So the need for as much clarity as possible and objective criteria is evident.\nHere you have my callibration images. I based my measuremnts on both Shroud Scope and Sister Blandina atlas, which contains live-size images with callibration distances. Even then, the actual size of both these images remained uncertain and there is still a possibility of a few % margin of error.\n\nGenerally, the most important criterion, is not the perfect overlay of images (which may give false positive results sometimes), but the correspondence of wound marks. In my previosu presnetation I have shown a dozen or so congruence points, showing that those two faces are actually related to each other beyond coincidence:\n\nWith the knew, better and more detailed overlay their number will likely grow.\n Do the front & back images of the veil superimpose/overlay precisely or is there some drift?\nAs I have only obverse side of the Manoppelo, I can’t directly answer that. Yet as the differences between obverse and reverse sides of Manoppello concern only minor details (and even that cannot be taken as proven, as much depends on light conditions when pictures were taken -it has been observed that different conditions led to different details perceived, more details in Treppa-Aszyk book), I suppose that yes.\n\n","date":"March 12, 2015 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-193252","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Hello Mr. Kelly Kearse:   There is very little drift in doing the overlay of the Manoppello Image over the positive Shroud Image. That is even a bit of understatement.  Almost a dead on match.  I flipped the Manoppello image horizontally and overlaid it both ways. There is one way where it matches better in my opinion for whatever that is worth.  I took 15 second frames of each image and then slowly bleed them in together so the effect of the 2 images coming together can be seen slowly  When the Manoppello cloth is seen from back side rights and lefts are reversed.  I’ve seen it displayed both ways. A subtle difference, not major\n When overlaying The Manoppello on the Shroud image that is on linen, that is where there is drift, because the image on linen gives a false impression that there are high set eyebrows.  All the frescoes copy this style.  The Manoppello image does not.   There is what appears as drift in overlaying the 2 shroud images together because of the color reversal.  I put those together as well, horizontally flipping the images so they match.   Very interesting to see slow color reversal on Shroud images.

I did a overlay.  I suggest putting it up on a big screen so you can see it in the best quality.\n\nNo one can accuse me of manipulating evidence in this, because I did a fair, honest, straightforward overlay.  Aspect ratio of the image used were not altered in any way.   I used what I believe are the top 3 images in the world that match to the face of Man in Shroud. \nI have heard it said how any face can be put in here and it match just as well.\n It is flat out not true.   That is why I did a slow motion overlay so any drift can be seen and I went in and did close up shots.  Some of things being replicated are forked beards, crooked noses, high eyebrows and owl eyes.  Bizarre match points that go beyond coincidence. \nWhat is really amazing that I did not notice before was my overlay with the Pantocrator,  look at the circles around the eyes the artist adds.   Real interesting.   Note how they match the negative image.  Whenever the Pantocrator is overlayed the same mistake is always made.\n1. Using the positive image\nThe artist used the negative image as a role model to do the fresco, not the positive.  There is a BIG difference between the 2.\nEspecially where the eyebrows are placed and how the eyes are placed.\nThe color reversal changes the look of the face. \nI saw the Pantocrator image overlayed with  the Shroud negative image for the 1st time.  I was amazed how well it fell into place.   I never really thought much of it until recently. \nLook at the circles around the eyes that are illustrated.  Look how they match to the negative image.   The artist saw the version with the “falsely perceived” high eye brows and the big white spots for eyes.  He replicates them in the fresco.  Look at it closely.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind the Shroud was the role model for this.\nThat takes out the carbon dating.\nThe Manoppello image as well is a incredible match.\n\nThere is discussion about the #3 bloodstain after viewing the overlays.  You will likely not want to discuss that.  I think it is better left not discussed, this was a post in regards to carbon dating, not blood stain messages or lack there of  on the Shroud.\nI do not normally get into looking for messages in the Shroud type research.\n\n","date":"March 23, 2015 at 10:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-194205","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Directed to Sampath Fernando:\nSampath, there is nothing to thank me for, I’m just doing some work.\nAs an environmental engineer perhaps you get into a time machine and try to find out what the environmental conditions were like in Jerusalem in AD 33.\n\n","date":"March 12, 2015 at 5:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-193238","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"O.K.,\nThanks very much for the answers/additional scans.

The controls:\nOne should be careful with controls and interpret them carefully. Of course it is entirely possible to find a face with similar proportions, but one should think about what it means. For example Roberto Falcinelli wrote a paper sceptical about Manoppello, arguing that it was painted by Durer, due to some ambiguos phrases in some old art history books and visual similarity with his famous Christ-like self-portrait. I responded to him and compared his self portait with Manoppello (see https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/02/manoppello-shroud-and-durer-a-short-presentation-by-o-k/ ). The match is perfect, but it does not mean that Manoppello was painted by Durer (which is as likely as the theory that Leonardo faked the Shroud) -rather the other way around, that Durer was influenced by Manoppello.\nOn the contrary, the similarity of wounds is very significant -showing that both images (Shroud and the Veil) are intended to represent the same person. The question is: why?\n1. The banding issues on both the Shroud and the Veil are entirely different things, as image mechanisms on both cloths seems to be entirely different.\nThe Shroud is monochromatic image, in which the intensity of coloration depends on body-cloth distance (the 3D effect). There is also some influence of lighter/darker bands which modulate the intensity. \nOn the contrary, the Veil is polychromatic, and does not include the 3D effect similar to that of the Shroud. There are other issues like the transparency and the alleged presence of multiple images encoded in it, which are visible under different lighting conditions.\nThere are of course bandings on Manoppello, yet their relation with the images have not been explored yet, as far as i know:\n\n2. See above. The issues regarding the Veil are entirely differnt then that of the Shroud. On the Veil we don’t have the real bloodstains (probably) but rather images of bloodstains.\n3.

I’m now looking at “Textile Questions that Remain Following the Carbon Dating Test”, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi2829part4.pdf.\nTyrer ponders two contaminants; firstly later organic remains such as “fungi, insect debris and pollens”, and “deposits of smoke from the fire, and hydrocarbons from the vapours of candles”, and “perspiration and greases.” As I described above, this kind of contamination was specifically looked for and removed, and, even if it wasn’t could not possibly have amounted to three-quarters of the mass of the sample. He also mentions that contaminants may have been washed in with the water used to put out a fire, without imagining the possibility that they may have been washed out again by the water used to clean the sample.\nSecondly, he ponders the possibilities of superheated steam at temperatures of 900°C. “Any contaminants on, or embedded in, the fabric structure would be dissolved by this steam and forced into the weave and yarn construction, and would react chemically with the molecular structure of the fibres of the flax.” This is pure guesswork. My guess is that any flax in contact with steam at 900°C would immediately be reduced to ashes. The difference between my guess and Tyrer’s? Well, I’ve put linen into an oven at 350°C, and seen it char to ashes in a very short time. I have no doubt that at 900°C there would be nothing left. What experiments has Tyler carried out?\nBut above all, even if all this steam pressure had contaminated the Shroud – there still wouldn’t be three-quarters modern and one quarter old.\nOver the last few days both OK (authenticist) and I (non-authenticist) have come to an agreement regarding the massive amount of contamination required to make a 1st century date appear 14th century. Anybody who thinks any form of contamination such as black or yellow threads of cotton, insect remains or superheated steam pressure has to explain this quantitively rather than qualitatively, or airy dismissals such as John’s above are nothing but head-in-the-sand ostrich-posing.\nAuthenticists who claim that the basic linen of the radiocarbon samples is different from that of the rest of the Shroud have at least got the proportion problem solved. However they still have to demonstrate how such massive interpolation is so wholly invisible, which, especially since we seem to have discredited the Quad Mosaics and the Morgan’s alleged UV-F manipulation as irrelevant surface contamination only, has become considerably more difficult.\n\n","date":"March 25, 2015 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-194385","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Hugh,\nperhaps I missed something but when you wrote: “Authenticists who claim that the basic linen of the radiocarbon samples is different from that of the rest of the Shroud have at least got the proportion problem solved.

He mentions all he usual suspects, from wax to cigarette ash, without seriously wondering if it could amount to enough contamination to have any serious effect on the radiocarbon date.\nWilson says, of the radiocarbon scientists: “Where, in all the hype put out by the AMS scientists in 1988 about ‘astronomical’ odds was there even the slightest word of caution that contamination might have affected the dating result?” and “But surely the radiocarbon dating laboratories would have made some preliminary check of their samples to make sure that no contamination of any kind was present? The straight answer is no.” Is this fair. This is what the Nature paper says: “Because it was not known to what degree dirt, smoke or other contaminants might affect the linen samples, all three laboratories subdivided the samples, and subjected the pieces to several different mechanical and chemical cleaning procedures.\nAll laboratories examined the textile samples microscopically to identify and remove any foreign material.” And this before the paper goes on to list the various procedures carried out.\nHe also, remarkably, dismisses the interweaving theory, which I think is the only route now open to authenticists. However he does put some credence in the bioplastic coating hypothesis, saying that some sample pieces which had been reserved by Riggi could be seen to be contaminated by a microbiological coating in 1994, and that Prof. Mattingly had sent Harry Gove some samples of such contamination to show that even a 60% contamination was invisible. I find all this rather difficult to accept at face value. If the bioplastic coating was evident to the scientists in 1994, then why should it not have been spotted by the radiocarbon labs in 1988, and how could Mattingly could make it invisible when he sent a sample to Gove?\nA fibre evenly coated with something twice its mass becomes twice as thick.

It is a piece of imaging software which self-organises areas of similar data into areas of the same colour. In this case gradually increasing density of colour has been organised into stripes, rather like coloured contours on relief maps. Wikipedia explains k-means clustering quite well.\nFurthermore, I dispute that the density of colour is directly related to contamination density. It is at least partly, and perhaps mainly, related to the intensity of the light shining on that area, and probably also to the angle at which the light is reflecting.\nFinally, if these photos do in fact indicate contamination, then the more the contamination, the older the Shroud appears. This could perhaps be due to a mineral oil being an important part of it: mineral oil has a C14 content of zero, and I understand is particularly difficult to remove from radiocarbon samples. If Rogers’s dye, which I think was actually smeared onto the Holland cloth and only incidentally spread over onto the Shroud, contained a mineral oil component, that might explain the anomaly. Although it might explain the chronological gradient across the samples, it can have had no significant effect on measurement of the date of the Shroud.\n\n","date":"March 27, 2015 at 5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-194645","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Hugh wrote: “In my hypothesis the contamination does not amount to more than two thirds.”\nWell, that’s splendid, Max.

I am no more nor less committed to non-authenticity than before, and anyway for me, the question of authenticity or not is not very important. The Church is littered with relics which may or not be authentic, such as the nails, the thorns or the robes, and it makes no difference to her whether or not they are genuine, or whether they are as the Pope so eloquently put it ‘icons’ which encourage deeper involvement with the life of Christ.\nSo why have I suddenly come across all aggressive? It is because although I have a great respect for real evidence for authenticity, it does the authenticist case no good when they promote evidence which is clearly wrong, or says the opposite of that intended. Ray says the observed contamination in Morgan’s paper affects the age of the Shroud. Well, if that’s true then the contamination makes the Shroud older, not younger. Max says all his contamination does not amount to twice the mass of the substrate. Well if that’s true then the medieval date is correct. Fortunately, Ray has now rephrased his remark ideas, and Max will come up with some explanation soon, I’ve no doubt.\nIf you read my comment above you will find that I am not rejecting the possibility of the radiocarbon date being wrong, but trying to find a way in which it might be so. I have even tried to explain how the surface contamination might have been responsible for the age/contamination gradient being the “wrong way round.” Nobody else has. The Quad Mosaics, UV-F photos and surface contamination all being rejected, what are you left with? Substantial replacement of material. Now I must try to find evidence for that, since it is clear that few actual authenticists (Thibault perhaps being a notable exception) will.

It is basically a “ask and you shall receive” type approach method which involves measuring the response of the person contacted by monitoring changes in the AC Voltage and also measuring the HZ frequency of that AC voltage source on a ELF Sensor. A numerical response.

I will not use the word “proves”\n I have been doing this type of research on and off for 5 years. I knew someday it would get connected into Shroud Research.\n In the same way someone who is blind cannot see someone or be able to read by sight, they can read by touch. Receive info using a different method. This type of communication is reliant upon the Sender controlling the number of times an electrical signal oscillates in one second into specific number sequences that “spell a word” Because we cannot see something does not mean it is not there. But we can measure it on a scientific instrument and prove that the “unseen thing” does indeed exist and is a genuine demonstrated reality. Presence of the Spirit of God can take form of electricity and that electric presence will have a AC voltage and Hz Frequency that can be detected and measured on a scientific instrument, only if The Spirit of God allows that to happen.

No.\n4) Is there any evidence of substantial interweaving within the radiocarbon sample?

Raes, Rogers, and now Heimburger, have been able to identify or verify it.  It demonstrates that the sample was not representative of the whole, but we do not know the extent of this interference.  It is significant that Rogers found vanillin in the area, whereas none was apparent in other threads examined.  The whole exercise is an object lesson in the need for representative sampling.  The choice of site was unhappily influenced by the understandable concerns to conserve the integrity of the relic. \nIt is interesting that Fanti’s mechanical dating tests indicated a much earlier age, even though with a much greater range of error.  However I note from Colin’s recent tests, that sulphuric acid has the effect of weakening linen but not cotton.  It would seem a remote but real possibility therefore that if the image was produced by an acid process that Fanti’s results may have been skewed by this factor. \nI have been doing a little reading up on aragonite.  It has exactly the same chemical formula as calcite, CaCO3.  However common calcite occurs in a rhombohedral form with Ca surrounded by six closest oxygen atoms, and generally seems to be produced by sea calcium combining with dissolved CO2.  Aragonite is orthorhombic in structure with Ca surrounded by nine closest O atoms.  Another associate mineral is dolomite, nominally CaMg(CO3)2, similar to the calcite structure but with Mg and Ca occupying the metal cation sites in alternative layers.  Other dolomite associates occur with manganese and iron substituting for the magnesium. \nAragonite is the form that occurs in mollusc shells and in pearls.  It can degenerate to calcite over the course of geological time, but is stable in cool environments, and so occurs in the limestones of caves and other cool locations.  Aragonite is much less common than calcite, but is certainly common enough, and hardly as rare as suggested by some writers.  \nWhat is significant is that a few of the Ca atoms in aragonite can be substituted by barium, strontium and lead, but occur in various proportions at different locations.  Kohlbeck’s Shroud and Jerusalem tomb samples of aragonite included traces of iron and strontium but no lead.  Clearly there ought to be the potential of quantifying the iron and strontium as markers in these samples to determine a match.  If there were a match, then it would seem fairly conclusive, that despite the general prevalence of aragonite, that the Shroud aragonite could then be definitely associated with the Jerusalem aragonite.  The tests could be corroborated by control samples of aragonite from other locations. \nUnfortunately the aragonite dust on the Shroud was removed along with other debris by the notorious 2002 restoration.  It is rumoured that such debris is stored and catalogued somewhere in Turin.  If it were made available, it might just be possible to test the strontium iron and any other markers to see if they do indeed match the content of Jerusalem aragonite.  \nThe history of Shroud research seems to be fraught with the well-meaning incompetence of those in ill-advised authority.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2015 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-195207","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Excellent post.

Now just guess what was observed in the Raes-C14 corner sample?\n– Swiss textile expert Metchild Flury-Lemberg NEVER examined in situ textilis the very core of the C14 sample of which about 90% was used for C14 dating the TS. Besides she NEVER had direct access niether to the 1988 official C14 sample riserva nor the two pieces of the Arizona sample that were not used.\n– Thrice already I posted the following excerpt from my 2007 paper entitled “LINCEUL DE TURIN : FAUSSE RELIQUE OU FAUSSE DATATION Carbone 14 ?” and subtitled: “(Contre-enquête sur un fiasco scientifique)”. Here is the relevant excerpt re Mme Metchild Flury-Lemberg’s opinion, I commented in a note (10):\n” 10. – Lorsque l’on sait que de petites reconstructions invisibles à l’œil nu et à la lumière naturelle du jour pouvaient se trouver très circonscrites au cœur même du site de l’échantillon carbone 14 daté, on est pour le moins étonné qu’une experte textile de la valeur de Mme Metchild Flury-Lemberg, sans même avoir JAMAIS examiné de visu ledit cœur de l’échantillon in situ textilis ni avoir pris connaissance de la photographie précise et contrastée d’Enrié ni des radiophotographies de la relique de Miller, puisse affirmer sans ambages que la texture dudit échantillon était uniforme et intacte. Partant du principe qu’un expert textile se devait d’être très attentif à l’origine (et à la représentativité) des fils qu’il observe, de toute évidence, il semblerait qu’il demeure difficile pour Mme Metchild Flury-Lemberg d’accepter un seul instant l’idée que des confrères (Prs Testore et Vial) aient pu, juste avant la découpe de l’échantillon brut, ne pas procéder, à l’aide de loupes, compte-fils et binoculaires, à l’examen des fils de chaîne et de trame au cœur même du site de prélèvement. Pourtant, et à preuve du contraire, ceux-ci n’examinèrent que la bord externe de l’échantillon qui venait d’être découpé par Riggi”\n– Re the TWO different types of microreconstructions that could mainly account for the linen to appear medieval, I wrote (my 2007 paper on the TS 1988 C14 dating fiasco):\n“(…) NON-DETECTION D’UNE ZONE (SION DEUX) AYANT SUBI DES REPARATIONS INVISIBLES A L’OEIL NU\nTout cet ensemble d’éléments directs et indirects constitue un faisceau d’indices concordants : il tend à témoigner, dans ladite zone plus raide et plus sombre, d’une intervention selon une technique bien particulière inspirée de la technique du « retissage à la française » (bien connue des maîtres-tapissiers ainsi que des experts en histoire de la tapisserie) ; technique qu’il ne faut cependant pas confondre avec celle d’un simple « entissage » d’un patch médiéval, repérable, quant à lui, à l’œil nu et à la lumière naturelle du jour par un spécialiste.\nLa technique dont il s’agit ici s’avère plus précisément celle d’un « retissage par épissures », sans coutures ni nœuds, effectuée, semble-t-il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement. Elle demande beaucoup de patience et une grande dextérité des doigts. Elle consiste à mettre, tout d’abord, en place les fondations de base et la chaîne. Pour ce faire, soit le tisserand commence par identifier la matière des fibres constituant les fils de chaîne puis se les procure soit il utilise systématiquement des fibres de coton. Ensuite ces fibres sont filées afin d’obtenir l’épaisseur des fils originels puis entortillées avec précaution sur elles-mêmes et sur place aux fibres des fils de chaîne extraites de la partie cachée du tissu à réparer. Des fils de remplacement de la trame sont alors placés par-dessus et par-dessous les fils de chaîne reconstitués puis les fibres sont entortillées sur elles-mêmes, là encore avec précaution, aux fibres des fils de trame originels de façon à reproduire très exactement la texture ou le motif du tissu et refermer ainsi, sans faire de nœuds, le trou ou la zone sévèrement cisaillée. Pour finir de rendre cette restauration fil à fil tout à fait invisible et consolider les épissures, une teinture à base de gomme résineuse est appliquée localement sur la trame ainsi reconstruite pour que celle-ci, d’où provient l’effet de texture ou de motif, se fonde dans l’original (en l’occurrence la toile jaunie par la patine ivoire des siècles). Cette intervention sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe, si elle est bien réalisée et bien dissimulée, peut réellement être invisible sur les deux faces d’une pièce d’étoffe au point d’échapper parfois même à la main et à l’œil exercés d’une personne du métier qui, à l’œil nu et sous une lumière inadéquate, a tendance à confondre ces reconstructions avec des irrégularités apparues au cours du tissage. De fait, la structure artisanale du lin originel du Linceul, son calibre assez fort ainsi que son tissage serré en chevron sont de nature à parfaitement intégrer ce type d’intervention.\nQuant à l’échantillon de Zurich (et partant « l’échantillon 1 d’Arizona ») tiré de la partie claire de la bande C14 officielle du Linceul, celui-ci bien que ne présentant apparemment pas ou très peu de trace de contamination par une quelconque teinture14, n’en devait pas moins être recouvert d’une patine de microorganismes. De par l’aspect anormale de la zone où il fut prélevé, il suggère fortement, en tout cas, un second type d’intervention indétectable à l’œil nu car effectuée, elle aussi semble-t-il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement : « un raccommodage à perte ». Cette technique consiste très précisément à insérer, entre les fils de trame et de chaîne, des fils (ici de coton) qui, à chaque fois, sont coupés à leurs deux extrémités sans faire de nœuds, les laissant ainsi littéralement se perdre dans le tissu de lin existant.\nCes deux types spécifiques d’intervention (l’une dans le sens d’un remplacement de matière carbonée, l’autre dans celui à la fois d’un remplacement et d’un léger apport) permettraient de rendre compte de la grande dispersion des résultats observée (1238-1407) sur une si petite distance (à peine quatre centimètres de tissu).\nL’enduit de gomme arabique étant soluble dans l’eau et présent dans cette zone du coin supérieur gauche, il ne pouvait avoir été appliqué sur les fils superficiels des échantillons Raës et C14 qu’après l’incendie de la Sainte Chapelle de Chambéry de 1532. La teinture l’eût-elle été avant, celle-ci n’aurait pas dissimulé l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole dentelée car l’eau de l’incendie eût entraîné les produits de la pyrolyse locale au cœur des fils. Ce revêtement coloré ajouté tardivement explique l’absence de fluorescence aux UV observée dans cette aire particulière du drap. L’histoire de la conservation du Linceul après 1532 permet donc de dater, d’une manière très précise, au moins une sinon les deux interventions. Seules, en effet, les quatre sœurs clarisses, en 1534, et la princesse Clothilde de Savoie-Bonaparte, en 1863, qui intervinrent de façon étendue sur la relique, auraient pu effectuer ce type de réparations invisibles de mains aussi expertes. Les sœurs clarisses s’étant vues confiée la tache bien spécifique de réparer et de consolider la pièce d’étoffe endommagée lors de l’incendie de 1532, la princesse de Savoie-Bonaparte s’avère donc être, pour ces travaux délicats de restauration, la candidate la plus hautement probable (aidée ou non en cela du maître tapissier de la cour royale d’alors). Ce d’autant qu’en 1863, cela faisait déjà plus de cinq siècles qu’à chaque ostension à mains nues, la relique se retrouvait être tendue à l’horizontale.” (to be continued)\n– Vial and Testore just examined the ‘outside edge’ of the untrimmed sample. They didn’t examine the very core of it i.e. the parent sample that was to be incinerated, UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE.\n(Continuation) “Tout ceci explique (ou expliquerait) pourquoi, lors de la découpe de l’échantillon et faute d’un éclairage adéquat (en lumière UV ou rasante), ces deux variantes locales passèrent totalement inaperçues aux yeux des experts textiles chargés de superviser le prélèvement pour la datation officielle de 1988. Toute leur attention était alors absorbée soit par l’étude technique du drap (qu’ils voyaient pour la toute première fois) soit par la présence gênante des fils de la couture épaisse qui liaient un résidu de la partie supérieure du Linceul au tissu à découper. Ainsi en oublièrent-ils de procéder à un examen minutieux du cœur même du site textile à prélever. L’eurent-ils examiné, ils n’auraient pu manquer, en effet, d’y repérer la petite reconstruction de forme serpentine, la teinture dissimulant l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole d’eau dentelée ainsi que le caractère plus raide et plus sombre de la zone. En principe, une restauration « invisible » ne saurait échapper au compte-fil et a fortiori à la binoculaire lorsque l’œil derrière est compétent. Les photos qui montrent les Prs Francesco Testoré et Gabriel Vial († 2005) s’affairant avec divers instruments sont, cependant, on ne peu plus trompeuses en ce qu’elles laissent croire que lesdits experts étaient occupés à des vérifications préliminaires de l’intégrité de ladite zone quand, de fait, leurs vérifications ne furent pas étendues au cœur de l’échantillon mais se bornèrent à la seule lisière du drap.\nAinsi croyant avoir libéré l’échantillon aux bords effilochés de tout fil étranger, laissèrent-ils à l’opérateur, Giovanni Riggi di Numana († 2008), « le soin » de réduire à une bande rectangulaire un peu plus régulière le rectangle grossier que celui-ci, à l’aide de ciseaux de chirurgien, venait d’extraire sans gants protecteurs et plus ou moins malhabilement à la pièce principale.\nDe toute évidence, ce technicien (à qui échut la responsabilité et du choix de l’emplacement et de la prise d’échantillon !) n’était pas expert textile pas plus qu’il n’était carbonologue ou bien archéologue15. Il semblait en effet ignorer à quel point, en matière de radiodatation, la haute technologie de l’Accélérateur Spectromètre de Masse (adaptée pour les mesures sur des microéchantillons) s’avère être sensible aux contaminations y compris à celle du sébum humain. Ce choix d’une zone qui avait fait l’objet, au cours des siècles, de nombreuses manipulations à mains nues lors des ostensions, était donc déjà, de ce seul point de vue, tout sauf judicieux.”\n\n","date":"April 3, 2015 at 4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-195246","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Typo: SINON (SION) 1863/1868 (1863)\n\n","date":"April 3, 2015 at 4:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-195247","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"From the top…\n“What [I] don’t understand, or ignore..”  You’re missing the point, John. So Rogers found ‘new linen.’ Leaving aside how much new linen he found, I would like to know how the new linen was attached to the old linen. There is no evidence for any attachment, and there should be. I said nothing about cotton in my comments above – if the cotton is a straw man, then it is one of your making, not mine. You didn’t really read my comment, did you?\n“The cotton was part of new fibers used to reweave and repair damaged parts of the Shroud.” I dare say. But how were these ‘new fibres’ attached to the old fibres? That’s what I was discussing above. I’m sorry if it wasn’t clear.\nThe rest of your post is incomprehensible. A crucifix fell on the floor? The cotton was spliced with new fibres? Where does Rogers say this or that? Stop! Take some deep breaths; type “Rogers” into the ‘find’ function and read whatever I have said about Rogers on this page. Then reply, if you need, to what I wrote, not to what you think I meant.\nNow, Max. “Splicing, glueing and dying are part and parcel of invisible/hidden microrecontructions.” Well, no, they’re not. At least not generally, and nor is there any evidence that any reconstruction technique of the “French invisible reweaving” kind has involved any kind of splicing. Interweaving, certainly, and possibly the twisting together of threads, but not splicing of the kind I described above. As far as I know – and Thibault will probably be able to verify or amend this – only one single piece of thread, and that a weft thread of about 10mm long, has been observed to be made of two separate pieces. The two pieces were not spliced but simply glued together, and could not have had any structural integrity. Furthermore, the two pieces were both found to have been made of cotton, not linen.\nNow for all I know, as I said before, you may be correct, but so far there is insufficient evidence to assume that. Merely re-posting something does not make it any more convincing than it was the first time.

Pam explains their cognizance.\nYour first reference to Flury-Lemberg is sufficient to justify my critique. But you did repeatedly refer to her in the thread. I have recounted the number of times you referred to Flury-Lemberg in this context. The recount shows six times. Given the factual claim you made which was false, I do not believe that is a significant fact. It is, as they say, “de minimus.” \nMy book has over 500 footnotes. The review of “Finding Jesus” published on Shroud.com is 14 pages with 31 footnotes. Included as to point in question is a reference to harry Gove’s memoir and an E-Mail from Prof. William Meacham responding to an inquiry whether he recalled Fleury-Lemberg making her statement in 1986 at the conference referenced by Gove. He confirmed that and then added his interchange with Al Adler.\nNow its time for me to compliment Professor Goodacre and I sent him a copy of it. I believed, that in fairness, I should inform him of my critique. His response – given my turgid review – was very professional and in good humor. He suggested that I comment on another blog which advocates the Shroud’s medieval fabrication. I checked the site and it appears that the author relied upon the claims of Walter McCrone. The blogger is ludicrous. If you would like, E-Mail me and I would be send you a copy of my Chapter 9 (free of charge) which demonstrates that. The offer is open to anyone.\nI begin the Chapter 9 with a quotation from Revelations:\n“These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have\nwashed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”\nBuried in the chapter is a description drawn from Heller’s memoir of his actions upon returning from first post-Turin STURP conference:\n“Saturday, he returned to work, put on his white lab coat and went down the hall to the microscope lab and repeated the examinations, this time using his favorite Leitz microscope.”\nI didn’t emphasize the relationship of that comment to the initial quote from Revelations hoping that readers would discover it for themselves. As far as I am concerned, the entire STURP team “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”\n\n","date":"April 4, 2015 at 7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-195347","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"John. In her article that you continue to ignore, Flury-Lemberg sensibly asks where the reweave was. It clearly was not in the section that she examined that was left after the radiocarbon sample was removed or she and the other experts who examined the Shroud at this point would have spotted it.(And John Jackson specifically asserts that there was no reweaving from his own photographs of the banding.) \nSo, leaving aside Jackson’s pre-1988 evidence for a moment, it must have been WITHIN the radiocarbon sample but no one has spotted it there.The only other alternative is that the sample team cut out the reweave section so cleverly that no one could see the original joins of old and new on either side of the cut.\nThe basic point is that from Jackson onwards, no one has actually been able to spot and show with any kind of photographic evidence that there was a reweave.\nEven if there was one, which clearly there was not, there would be no reason why a fourteenth century weave might not have needed to be patched up in the sixteenth century. It is a logical absurdity to suggest that if there was a sixteenth century reweave it would necessarily have been of a first century cloth.\n\n","date":"April 6, 2015 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-195482","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Charles,\nHave you bothered to examine the sources I have cited to you which included an in depth examination of the photograph of Oxford sample BEFORE  it was destroyed in the carbon dating process and an explanation of the history of Shroud repairs.\nHere they are again:\n27http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Thomas_Ferguson_files/Updated_report_on\n_the_Consideration_to_the_Uniformity_and_Effects_of_the_Fabric_in_the_Shroud_of_Turin-5-1.pdf\n28http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Three_threads_files/BL%20Sebastian%20for%2\n0website%201.pdf\nI have also cited two sources for the fact that in 1986, Flury-Lemberg stated that the Shroud was “all the same in composition.” One was Harry Gove’s memoir on the Shroud and the other was  E-Mail correspondence with Prof. William Meacham who suffers from a disability that both you and I lack: He was actually at the protocol 1986 protocol conference when she made the statement. He also added an additional bon mot: that Adler at the same conference remarked to him that Flury-Lemberg “obviously knew nothing about chemistry of the cloth.”\nAdler, incidentally, unlike you or I, actually had the opportunity to inspect an analyze fiber from the carbon sample area that had been held back by Turin when the carbon sample was cut and were supplied to him through the good graces of Prof. Gonella, the scientific advisor of the Turin Archbishop. That were later supplied to Ray Rogers. See http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerpaper.pdf\nI have challenged you or anybody else to tell me when Flury-Lemberg had an opportunity to physically examine the Shroud BEFORE the carbon samples were removed and destroyed and you haven’t done that. The evidence is she would have had no such opportunity. Also, I sincerely doubt she, unlike Pam Moon and linen expert Donna Campbell of the Thomas Ferguson firm, does not appear to have ever examined Oxford photograph. In fact, I am informed, and could be corrected, that Ms. Moon had to pry the photograph away from Oxford by the British equivalent of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.\nI will concede one point right now: the Campbell analysis does not state that repairs were made before 1355. For the existence of the Shroud before than we have to look for other sources. One of them is Flury-Lemberg because I assume that you did not in any of your effusive praise for her intentionally overlook the fact that she asserts the authenticity of the Shroud. In fact she has identified stitching of the side seam of the Shroud as reflective of stitching seen in remnants from the Masada which would perforce be evidence of its existence circa 74 CE. \nIn my CNN review, I also cite the evidence of the Shroud’s existence circa 500 CE; in exposition in Constantinople circa 1200 CE and its “fingerprints” seen in the Pray Manuscript circa 1200 CE. \nIs the evidence circumstantial, of course. However, Richard Dawkins, himself a Shroud skeptic, argues that circumstantial evidence is often more reliable than eyewitness accounts. Dawkins, Richard , pp. 15-16, 106, “Greatest Show on Earth,” Free Press. Kindle Edition. In fact. in my discussion in Chapter 1 of “Quantum Christ” (Rules of the Road) I demonstrated that from just two facts in the third verse of the Ira Gershwin lyrics to “I Can’t Get Started,” Gershwin was twitting i.e. “jerking the chain”  of Joseph Kennedy, whose son John was later elected President of the United States.\nFinally, there is the excellent presentation in de Wesselow’s “The Sign.” As an agnostic he refuses to concede the realty of the Resurrection but as to authenticity of the Shroud, he has no doubt.\nI understand that you have differences with de Wesselow who had the temerity to write his book without consulting you. Or did he?\n\n","date":"April 6, 2015 at 6:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-195486","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website","post":"Hugh, you wrote: “Chemist Robert Villarreal who headed a team of nine scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, examined material from the carbon 14 sampling region and  stated: \n“The age-dating process in 1988 failed to recognize one of the first rules of analytical chemistry, that any sample taken for characterization of an area or population must necessarily be representative of the whole.

I am not interested in what Flury-Lemberg did or did not say way back in 1986. I am interested in what she did say in 2007, after her close-up examination of the Shroud, when she confirmed that there was no reweave  in the area where the sample was taken from and she then asked the question: where was the reweave, how far did it extend,etc? No answer to her question has,so far as I know,ever come. \nFlury-Lemberg does not need effusive praise from me- she has got it from her colleagues in the world of ancient textiles (see Wikipedia biography). \nIt is hard to imagine,how  those who have read/seen the evidence  of John Jackson from his own photographs of 1978, could argue  that there was a reweave, so the onus is on you to show where it was. Perhaps you can start with Jackson’s 1978  photos of the banding and mark in where you can see the signs of the reweave.\nI cannot find any reference in Donna Campbell’s very careful examination that she saw any reweaving in the Oxford sample- please quote where she did say that there was.\nFibres are not enough- reweaving is, by definition, about woven cloth, not fibres.\nThe stitch issue was sorted out on this very blog where it was shown that the stitch in question is a common one used throughout history and to this day.\nI see absolutely no reason to believe that there ever was a reweave- not a single expert who has dealt directly with the Shroud or woven samples from it has ever seen it.
