It is done all the time by individual archeologists.

But I am just plain Mr. Jones.\nI don’t think we need to be worried about this at all. Apart from it being Jesus’ Shroud, who has all power and authority in heaven and earth (Mt 28:18; Eph 1:21), and who has protected His burial sheet down through the ages as a witness to His suffering, death and resurrection; there is effectively zero probability that the Pope would allow the whole Shroud to be put in a chamber of gas which was then electrically charged up to a plasma state.\nPerhaps the most important part of the article is Dr Rowe’s statement:\n“In theory, it could even be used to date the Shroud of Turin.”\nBecause that is a tacit admission of what is probably now widely accepted in the radiocarbon-dating community, that the 1988 carbon-14 dating of the Shroud as “AD 1260-1390 … mediaeval”:\n“The results of radiocarbon measurements at Arizona, Oxford and Zurich yield a calibrated calendar age range with at least 95% confidence for the linen of the Shroud of Turin of AD 1260 – 1390 (rounded down/up to nearest 10 yr). These results therefore provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval.” (Damon, P.E., et al., “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” Nature, Vol. 337, 16 February, 1989, pp.611-615, p.614).\nwas flawed, otherwise why bother proposing to radiocarbon-date the Shroud again?\nStephen\n\n","date":"March 30, 2010 at 6:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/24/new-dating-technique-might-help-with-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-1196","author":"Stephen E.

In 1981 I was very privileged to have had a vision of our lord Jesus Christ in a historic church that was dedicated to St.Peter and St.Paul, I saw our Lords face, so sad.And the crown of thorns on his head so clear was this vision i could see the string of thorns encircled many times and the thorns so clear as if one would be pricked by them, I was totally awestruck and as you can imagine this vision took me from being a christian with many question marks to a fervent believer, after the vision i went to my mothers home when i went in to her living room i told my mother of my wonderful vision and was overwhelmed to discover that my mother had a copy of the shroud of Turin on her wall.I immediately said to my mother, this is Jesus Christ, this is who i saw actually as he is. It is him. The holy shroud image is that of Jesus Christ, I can’t prove it but i would lay my life on this because it is true. I have since 1981 had many other experiences which have also confirmed to me the authenticity of the holy shroud and that it is of our Lord Jesus Christ. One day it will be recognised as true and venerated as the wonderful relic that it is, and i look forward to that day.

Pope Benedict xv1 recently in Turin stated himself that the holy shroud of turin is like a photograph,positive and negative, he also said it is a burial cloth which enshrouded the corpse of a crusified man, and corresponds to what the gospels tell us about Jesus. I personaly believe that there is a whole stack of evidence to back up the holy shroud of turins true authentisity , but the real problem is that one still needs to look at the whole situation with the eyes of faith ,through an open mind,which is where most non believers stumble because they then have to accept that the God they dont believe in might actualy exist, which totaly contradicts there views, and puts there non beliefe to the test. In my view the real problem is that when true authentisity is being debated with those who dont believe in the existance of God, they inevitably wont take into consideration anything that might oppose there views, so in reality there is a stalemate, they then base there whole analysis on desisions they have made according to there own human ability to judge which is prone to error, using no more than tests to detemine age, carbon dating which has been proven unreliable, in the tests that have been carried out on the holy shroud of turin, so i ask those scientists lets look at this with an open mind, with a full compleate and unbiased analysis of all the evidence without exeption, then a true and fare conclusion can start to take place, if only for the sake of common sence…YOURS IN CHRIST…FRED…\n\n","date":"June 5, 2010 at 8:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/24/new-dating-technique-might-help-with-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-1340","author":"Fred","site":"shroudstory"}]
