[{"title":"Video Posted by Rome Reports: Questions Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Interesting! It would be nice to be able to watch the whole documentary. It’s also very interesting how much about the 1988 C-14 fiasco is coming to light as of late, but I am sure most of the information has already been published with many people not being aware of it. Many will claim the tests were in error without blaming any of the ‘tester labs’, which to me is a blind statement to the truth. All the labs as well as the Vatican were at fault for a bumbled testing, right from the start. The fact that all protocols were dropped for the choice of samples by the Vatican to the fact that no chemical analysis were done on the samples by any of the labs, too the huge discrepencies found in the final numbers. Not to mention an anonymous donation to one lab of 1.5 million pounds! It (the 1988 c-14 dating) has all the attributes of a true conspiracy. The questions are WHY? and conspired by WHOM?\nPersonally back in ’88 when the test results were splattered all over the media, I did not believe the results, as too much evidence pointed to ‘authenticity’. I could only feel at the time that something wrong had been done, but unfortunately many important people in the study of the Shroud lost interest, which to me was also unbelievable. How could so many put so much faith in a single carbon dating? Especially when anyone with half a brain understood that carbon dating methods are not infallible, even novices as myself understood that! Personaly I don’t believe any further carbon dating will bring us to any certain conclusions as the cloth as been tampered with way too much (2002 restoration) and is far too contaminated to ever get a true date. The only thing we can hope for, as our friend Yannick states is far more chemical and optical studies must be sanctioned by the Vatican and performed completely in the OPEN.\nRon\n\n","date":"October 15, 2011 at 6:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/15/video-posted-by-rome-reports-questions-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-4196","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
