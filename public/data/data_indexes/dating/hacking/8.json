Positively explain WHO was the faker; HOW it was faked; WHEN was it faked; WHY was it faked; and REPLICATE the fake (the entire Shroud with all its major features) EXACTLY using medieval knowledge and technology.and2. Negatively explain away ALL the evidence for the Shroud having existed since the 1st century. No Shroud anti-authenticist has even ATTEMPTED that. Or if they had attempted it, they quietly gave up on it, when they realised the magnitude of the problems of the Shroud anti-authenticist position.>OrangeYour trying to win by default using such fallacious verbal trickery only reinforces how BANKRUPT the Shroud anti-authenticity position is.Stephen E.

No. My theory was not a theory until my post, \"My theory that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker #1\" which was on 24 May 2014.Before that it was just a \"proposal\". The headings of my posts on the topic from 18 February - 18 May 2014 were in the form of a QUESTION: \"Were the radiocarbon dating laboratories duped by a computer hacker?\">You were still a member of Porter's blog at that time No. I left Porter's blog in April 2014 and ceased reading his blog's posts and comments, on 8 May 2014.>and we all remember that it was severely criticized There were some MINOR criticisms of my hacker proposal before I finally left Porter's blog on 8 May 2014, but nothing that I had any problems with, and I have since addressed those criticisms in my subsequent \"My theory ...\" posts.>and that you replied to your theory's detractors in an attempt to defend it.See above. First, while I was on Porter's blog before 8 May it was just a \"proposal\", not a theory.Second, I did not \"ATTEMPT to defend\" my proposal. I DID successfully defend it.Even on your own account you have failed to make your case: \"severely criticized\" is NOT \"REFUTED\".>OrangeI invite anyone (except Colin Berry who is banned) to comment on my blog, listing the major criticisms of my theory and I will respond to them.But they must do it in accordance with my policies below. That is, make it ONE first and final complete, well-thought out, comment by each person, which is not offensive or sub-standard. To avoid interminable debates, I won't normally allow a commenter to post more than one comment under each post.I will allow you, Orange, to make as your last comment under this post such a ONE first and final complete, well-thought out, not offensive or sub-standard comment outlining your major criticisms of my theory and I will respond to those criticisms. Otherwise this was your last comment under this post.Stephen E. Jones----------------------------------MY POLICIES Comments are moderated. Those I consider off-topic, offensive or sub-standard will not appear. Except that comments under my latest post can be on any Shroud-related topic without being off-topic. I normally allow only one comment per individual under each one of my posts.\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"April 5, 2015 at 11:48 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2015/03/my-theory-that-radiocarbon-dating_31.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nMy theory that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker #10: Summary (7)\n","post":"\n\n>You were by verbal trickery trying to convert my CONDITIONAL (\"may\") statement:>>\"Being a theory, not a fact, I may need to modify my theory (including abandoning it altogether as false) as new information comes to light.\"Correction: \"CONDITIONAL (`may')\" above should have been \"HYPOTHETICAL\".Stephen E.
