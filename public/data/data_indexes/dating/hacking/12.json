[{"title":"I Tried to Ignore the Carbon Dating Computer Hacking Conspiracy Theory","post":"You know this is not as far fetched as it sounds.   When I was in college back in 1978, there was a computer program stored on punch cards that assigned dorm rooms based on random priority numbers assigned to each student.   I inserted a line of code that assigned a high random number to my student id, increasing the odds that I would get the dorm room that I wanted.   I found out before the program was to be executed that I already had a high priority number, so I removed the punch card before the program ran.\n\n","date":"May 18, 2015 at 9:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/18/i-tried-to-ignore-the-carbon-dating-computer-hacking-conspiracy-theory/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","id":"comment-199478","author":"Randy Schreiner","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I Tried to Ignore the Carbon Dating Computer Hacking Conspiracy Theory","post":"“So those who continue to dismiss my theory as merely a “conspiracy theory,” in the full knowledge of my above disclaimers, do so dishonestly.”\nDan is dishonest.\nPHPL is dishonest.\nHugh Farey is dishonest.\nEt cetera \nThanks God, Stephen E.

It is the complete lack of evidence for the involvement of the KGB, the idea that two suicides at the same time must be connected, and the mysterious way in which the same program alteration came to be affected at three different laboratories that send this idea into Conspiracy Theory territory, and the vilification of one man based on a single throwaway remark that makes it highly distasteful.\nSure, unlikely and distasteful things happen, but there must be some evidence for them before they are to be taken seriously. Conspiracy Theories often include the idea that the lack of evidence in itself is actually some kind of support for the theory, in showing how well the secret agency works, and also that some relatively isolated event is part of some global plan which will change the course of humanity. Not impossible, but, in this case, wholly without justification.\n\n","date":"May 19, 2015 at 1:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/18/i-tried-to-ignore-the-carbon-dating-computer-hacking-conspiracy-theory/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","id":"comment-199492","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I Tried to Ignore the Carbon Dating Computer Hacking Conspiracy Theory","post":"As Monty Python would say, a complete waste of time.\n\n","date":"May 19, 2015 at 6:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/18/i-tried-to-ignore-the-carbon-dating-computer-hacking-conspiracy-theory/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","id":"comment-199589","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"}]
