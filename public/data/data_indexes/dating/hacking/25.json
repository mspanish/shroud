It then looks like there is a depiction of the reversed 3 bloodstain on Jesus' forehead.But I was sent by Ian Wilson a 1374 x 738 pixels photo of just the Edessa cloth. When everything else is cropped out but Jesus face, it is 458 x 472 pixels. But then the reversed 3 bloodstain looks like it could be wax that has oozed out or is behind a crack in this encaustic (hot wax) painting. It still could be the reversed 3 bloodstain but is impossible for me to be sure. So I deleted my claim that it was.Jesus' face has, by my count, at least 12 of the Vignon markings, but because it is so small it is difficult to be sure. And there are other 10th century icons which have that many Vignon markings.It would have been the greatest discovery since the Pray manuscript (in my opinion) if it did have both the reversed 3 bloodstain (depicted as blood) and the Vignon markings.>Carlos>webmaster de http://lasabanaylosescepticos.blogspot.com/ \"The Shroud and the Skeptics\" (Google translate).Thanks again Carlos.Stephen E.
