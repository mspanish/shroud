We have to look for other more credible reasons why the alleged dating is in error.  Eventually the matter will be resolved, and we will all become a lot wiser as a result.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2015 at 6:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/07/the-hacking-of-the-carbon-dating-wikipedia-and-the-media/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","id":"comment-204834","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Hacking of the Carbon Dating, Wikipedia and the Media","post":"Jones has posted more since you posted.

This appears from depictions of the Shroud to have taken place in the nineteenth century when, for the first time in 1868, the Shroud had to be placed in a frame as well as the images being shown, in alithograph of this same exposition to be partially faded- the frontal image from the shoulders down.. What we have left, under the remnants of gesso- calcium carbonate as discovered by STURP- is the discoloration of the surface of the linen after centuries of being underneath the paint and gesso. This original thickness of the pigments  inevitably discoloured the linen in different shades that gives the impression of a three dimensional image.\nSo please no repetition of I think it IS a painting. Rather I think it WAS a painting.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2015 at 8:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/07/the-hacking-of-the-carbon-dating-wikipedia-and-the-media/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","id":"comment-204843","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Hacking of the Carbon Dating, Wikipedia and the Media","post":"look…I don’t really believe it either…however, remember the soviets did try to infiltrate the Vatican….they did have soviet trained priests….\n\n","date":"July 7, 2015 at 9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/07/the-hacking-of-the-carbon-dating-wikipedia-and-the-media/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","id":"comment-204848","author":"rick","site":"shroudstory"}]
