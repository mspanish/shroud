From 24-May-14 I started to call my proposal a \"theory,\" as I became increasingly persuaded by the evidence that the radiocarbon dating laboratories had been duped by a computer hacker. >now an evidence.No. Since 23-Jul-15 I have been using the phrase: \"... my concluding summary of the evidence that the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin as `mediaeval ... AD 1260-1390' was the result of a computer hacking ... \" But it is still evidence supporting my theory that the 1260-1390 radiocarbon date of the Turin Shroud was the result of a computer hacking.Stephen E.
