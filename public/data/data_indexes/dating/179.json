Nevertheless we can´t be absolutely sure because the only clues we have is the Mozarabic rite intoduced in religious practices in sixth century visigothic Spain by St. Leander bishop of Seville  who travelled to East and probably saw the Shroud with the body imprints and so added that to the gospel of John stating « Peter and John ran to the tomb and saw the linen cloths with the imprints of the dead and risen Man »\nNobody knows exactly how the Shroud was when the disciples entered the empty tomb that Sunday morning nonetheless we surely know that the Shroud was folded that way by the people who buried Jesus .\nWe cannot say that folding means He will return but we certainly can infer that the image left on the Shroud of Turin is the absolute proof of His Resurrection\n best regards\n          Maria da Glória\nCENTRO PORTUGUÊS DE SINDONOLOGIA\n\n","date":"February 19, 2009 at 10:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/01/30/tv-alert-unwrapping-the-shroud-new-evidence-to-be-rebroadcast/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-274","author":"maria da glória gonçalves barroso","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Television Special Feb 1: Unwrapping the Shroud: New Evidence","post":"You’re never too old to learn something stupid.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2010 at 11:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/01/30/tv-alert-unwrapping-the-shroud-new-evidence-to-be-rebroadcast/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-1192","author":"Richard Jan Mortgage","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Television Special Feb 1: Unwrapping the Shroud: New Evidence","post":"You know Richard….Jesus loves you too!!
