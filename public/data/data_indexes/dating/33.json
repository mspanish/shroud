But it’s worthwhile checking out the PDF paper in Meccanica.  The paper itself contains a fair amount of speculation and reliance on dubious records of earthquakes around 33AD. Difficult to guess how they assessed the crucifixion/resurrection earthquakes to within one decimal place of 8.2! \nThe one interesting fact(?) to come out of the paper is that large earthquakes may apparently generate neutron emission from crushed rock, and they cite some experimental evidence for this.  It is possible that this may have been a factor in creating the image, if indeed the neutron emission actually occurred. However as for it skewing the C-14 dating of 1988, Christopher Ramsey’s comment is most relevant.  To paraphrase, “Why in this case only, and in no other?” \nIt would seem that the Torino School of Engineering is still adhering to the myth of the validity of the 1988 dating. I would suggest that they might consult with their colleagues in the Statistical Maths department there, and get a handle on how representative the sampling regime for these specimens may or, more likely, may not have been! \nI note that at the very end of the paper, Giovanna De Liso’s paper happens to be cited. Her work represents some 12 years of experimental field study in the seismically active area of Piedmont.  She mentions there the stringent conditions required for the production of Shroud-like images during earthquakes. They required aloe inhibition, concurrent variations in the geo-magnetic and electric fields, presence of iron-bearing geology, and the release of radon gas (common during earthquakes). One problem would seem to be that the decay of Radon releases not so many neutrons, as it does gamma radiation, an entirely different matter.  \nWhile one may applaud the various attempts to discover the secret of the imaging process, it seems to me that an unduly large amount of research effort is being expended at this institute in pursuit of an agenda-driven presumption, that the image was the result of some kind of radiation emanation, while other possible, even more probable causes seem not to be pursued at all.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-78609","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating","post":"This is one more example of why the words “peer reviewed” mean nothing anymore when discussing shroud science.

I believe that in one of the singular events of human history, about 30CE (30AD) Jesus Christ rose from the dead.  (this 33AD stuff makes Christ 36+ years old  and we know that he wasn’t born in 0 AD) I call it a “singular” event as a double entendre relating to the physic’s concept of a singularity which has as many definitions as there are physicists.

I think we may be getting closer to the truth.

The only astronomy event I can recall in the gospels is the Star of Bethlehem in Matthew, which might have been any one of a number of such events, or it may only be a literary device. \nJohn’s gospel records that the Friday of the crucifixion occurred on Preparation Day, the day before Passover.  This could only have occurred in the years AD30 & AD33, and so would exclude AD29.   John P Meier in his “A Marginal Jew” opts for AD30.  He bases this on the sequence that: Jesus was born towards the closing years of Herod the Great, 7-4BC; John the Baptiser began his ministry AD27-28;  Soon after Jesus began his ministry, “then aged about 30”; Jesus’ ministry lasted no more than about two years and a few months.  Consequently Meier opts for the year AD30, as AD33 would have him closer to age 40.  \n“Pilate quickly condemned him to death by crucifixion.  After being scourged and mocked, Jesus was crucified outside Jerusalem on the same day.  He was dead by the evening of Friday, April 7, 30.  He was about thirty-six years old.” \nThe authors of the Meccanica paper refer to major Middle East earthquakes, said to have occurred in year AD33.  They might have cast their net a little further, but are silent on any seismic events in year AD30.  Possibly they are drawing on a hearsay tradition that he died at about age 33, and so derived the AD33 date.  Perhaps they should have researched the death date a little more. \nI take Hugh F’s point about the geological distinctions between sedimentary and igneous rocks, which may be relevant.  De Liso’s Piedmont site refers to the presence of gneiss, a metamorphic rock, whereas the Jerusalem site is essentially sedimentary aragonite  limestone.  I am unaware of the possible presence of iron-bearing strata at the Jerusalem site, which seems to bear most significantly on her findings.  \nDespite correspondents’  reluctance to admit radiation as the primary cause of  the TS image, the seismic events of the gospel narratives may yet prove to have been a significant factor.  It is known that Ray Rogers was not entirely happy about Maillard reaction being the exclusive cause, and felt that there had to be something else as well.  The release of radon commonly occurring during  earthquakes may have been an essential factor and been that “something else”.  \nThe crucifixion / resurrection earthquakes are mentioned in all four gospels, and cannot be easily dismissed as a literary add-on.  However the idea that radiation was the primary cause of the image has yet to win any other support among those beyond the Torino School of Engineering.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-78785","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating","post":"Professor Giulio Fanti wrote about the earthquake in connection with his image-formation hypothesis, not as something to do with how the 1988 CD results were skewed.

The peer review system is not perfect, it never will be.

It’s part of the system-you just deal with it.\nRealize though, that having a paper accepted/published is really only the beginning-what’s going to matter most is how well it stands up-what contribution does it make to the field-is it mainly a lateral or forward move?  Both have their own importance.  Like a group that lands a recording contract and “publishes” an album, time will tell if the record is considered a contemporary hit, a classic, or a who cares.\n\n","date":"February 14, 2014 at 10:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-79354","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating","post":"\nLouis :\nKelly # 40:\n“I don’t think he’s omitting clinical death or the typical crucifixion, death, resurrection sequence-my take on it was that he was saying that when Christ’s dead body came back to life, the heart was restarted as part of the process, hence some bleeding occurred.”\nThis doesn’t sound convincing. How did the bleeding stop? Did Jesus go to a doctor before he allowed doubting Thomas to feel his resurrected body?\n\nJust a hypothesis Louis, it doesn’t deny Christ’s death. Developing it a little further, I envisage the body was washed and placed in a clean Shroud. It assumes the resurrection consists firstly of the heart beginning to beat, and open wounds would cause blood to flow out of them onto the Shroud (Jesus would still be lying in situ). Then after a short while, the ‘Light of God’ if you will, caused the resurrection proper, fixing the image, blood and wounds.\n\n","date":"February 14, 2014 at 1:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-79386","author":"ChrisB","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating","post":"Chris, in that sense it is really worthwhile pondering what you wrote.

This is the only known text concerning this period of time. I interpret the text as meaning that Jesus left his dead body behind, and in the spirit visited the souls “in prison” (outside of time and space), and then returned to resurrect his body. Whether I Peter is pseudonymous or not, it evidently reflects early Christian belief, and is included in the scriptural canon. Thomas saw and touched the wounds of the Risen Lord, but in all the manifestations, there are no suggestions of bleeding or a bloodied appearance. We do not know or understand anything about the “physiology” or “anatonomy” of a resurrected body, whether resurrection is an instantaneous or time dependent process, or whether or not it requires the heart to start beating. The scriptures describe the resurrected Jesus as eating so there seems to be some normal physiology about it. A mystery! The Shroud image itself is of a very dead corpse!\n\n","date":"February 14, 2014 at 3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-79407","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating","post":"Daveb, you raised some important points. I believe that the Incarnation means that the divine Jesus took human form and left our world in this form and how that was done is a mystery. \nThere are non-Christians who don’t bother about the mystery, either saying that he was just “pure spirit” like the Yezidis or judging that it is not essential that it has to be understood, as was the case with the Hindus Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi, for whom Jesus was “avatar”, incarnation of God.\nMany Catholics opt to be cremated and the curious are told that it is allowed by the Church as long as belief in the after-life is not denied. Of course, they believe that the living will pray for them. How that after-life will be and what the judgment will be like troubled even a genius like Ludwig Wittgenstein:\n     https://www.academia.edu/5569992/Why_was_Wittgensteins_burial_attended_by_a_religious_ceremony\nIf the Catholic Church allows cremation, surely it does not expect the faithful to believe that everyone will be resurrected like Jesus?\n\n","date":"February 14, 2014 at 4:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-79424","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating","post":"It wasn’t clear in my earlier post, but I envisage that the blood would be fixed on the Shroud, and that the risen Lord would no longer be bloodied.\n\n","date":"February 14, 2014 at 3:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-79412","author":"ChrisB","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating","post":"Louis, Dave, thanks for your comments.
