[{"title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers","post":"Eye on the Prize.\nRay Rogers isn’t here to defend is work, and “frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn [about his inability to defend his work].” There are a number of subsidiary facts pointing to the invisible reweaving. That’s because as things now stand the creation of the image is  subsidiary issue to the issue of authenticity of the Shroud. That, in my very humble opinion, has been demonstrated. The issue of its history in the lost years is also a subsidiary issue. The Shroud itself is proof of it’s authenticity. The fact that no one can replicate the image doesn’t detract from that and the fact that one theory or another about image creation is proven or dis-proven EXCEPT to the extent that failure to account for it by known science or artistry supports the uniqueness and supernatural aura of the Shroud.\nThe DEMONSTRATED physical facts of the Shroud support one rational conclusion: that it is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. No alternative has been proposed except that there might have been some other individual crowned with thorns and crucified, his body was removed from his burial cloth with three days of his death. The probability of that the facts apply to someone else is so remote I can not count the zeros.\nThe reason that probability is so small is that we have four accounts of Christ’s death based on oral and written traditions that state the facts of his death and none of anyone else dying in a like manner. His death was important enough to be noted by the Roman historian Tacitus who was aghast that Pontius Pilate had failed to eradicate the Christus superstition. However, the letters of St. Paul pre-date Tacitus’ Annals of Ancient Rome.\nWe now have three highly regarded scientists or academics trumpeting the need for no God and professing their belief that nothing preceded the Universe: Dawkins, Hawking and Krauss.\nAm I misquoting them? Sort of. Actually they do not so much as proclaim that “nothing” preceded the universe as proclaiming they don’t care  about that “nothing.”\nMaybe I shouldn’t quote Martin Luther King but Bill Clinton: “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.”  It  depends on what the meaning of “nothing” is. Defining “nothing” isn’t so simple and they don’t even try.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2012 at 11:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-10998","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers","post":"Thank you, John.\nAnother reason why the probability of a pseudo-Christ’s shroud is so small, is that the threads’ S-twist, the asymmetrically cut off corners, the image of a high priestly breastplate and perhaps seal indicate the Shroud was actually John Mark’s temple mantle, and noone elses.\nSee my articles on John Mark and the Shroud on http://www.JesusKing.info :\nhttp://jesusking.info/John%20Mark.pdf and\nhttp://jesusking.info/The%20seam%20and%20corners.pdf \nAnd who else than Christ would produce an irreproducible image, with no signs of putrefaction, but with blood stains that show no signs of removal of the corpse either: they are unaltered (without smears, and unbroken) and were in the right places before the image was.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2012 at 2:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-11010","author":"Adrie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers","post":"Sorry, I meant the threads’ Z-twist.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2012 at 3:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-11012","author":"Adrie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers","post":"WHAT?

They fail to understand that theology is a continuum of science…it picks up where science leave off. For instance, Hebrews 11:3 says, ” By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.”  That is a big clue: “WHAT IS SEEN WAS NOT MADE OUT OF WHAT WAS VISIBLE.” But if all you are looking for is what is visible, you will totally miss it.  I don’t know where the realm of the spirit is, it is probably parallel to our own physical world. Yet the scripture tells us that the spirit is eternal and the physical world is temporal.  Ironically, the atheists of our day are consumed with what is temporary while denying that which is eternal.  Scripture declares that Jesus is the image of the invisible God (Col 1:15).  He came from the spirit realm, became physical for 33 years and returned to the spirit realm. Did the Shroud capture that split second in time when the physical body of Jesus returned to spirit (light)?\n\n","date":"April 30, 2012 at 12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-11002","author":"Shroud Encounter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers","post":"Why in the world a return to the spiritual realm would have to be accompanied with some kind of energy release like light, nuclear energy, electric discharge, thunder, drumbeat, sounds, angels signing, etc. ???\nHave you ever thought about the real simple possibility (like the God I know is simple) of just a disappearing of the physical body of Jesus from this material world ?

From reading the paper, she seems to be a competent experimental physicist.  \nShe claims some success at image formation under particular conditions of seismic activity, which seem to involve proximity to gneiss, the typical release of radon (a radioactive inert gas) that occurs during fault-plane activity, and seismic variations in the magnetic field.  The gospels of course record that earthquakes occurred following the crucifixion, and were probably more than just a dramatic literary device.  But I’m not sure whether gneiss is present in the Jerusalem geology, I thought it was mostly limestone. There may be some gneiss in the general proximity of Jerusalem but I was unable to get a good fix on detailed Jerusalem geology.

One example of that :  If I was a biochemist, a medical expert or a forensic expert, I would try to verify if it is possible to recreate perfectly in laboratory (using a linen cloth, a real human body and real blood clots) the physical aspect of the bloodstains we see on the Shroud, i.e. the “undisturbed” nature of those bloodstains and the linen fibrils under it.  In other word, that would be great if some expert can confirm Pierre Barbet’s opinion that this undisturbed nature of the bloodstains and the linen fibrils under it is scientifically impossible to obtain in the context of the removal a dead body from a linen shroud when that body is covered with lots of dried blood clots that have stuck to the linen surface.  \nI would love to know if there’s any possible condition in which  the removal of a dead body from a linen shroud could leave bloodstains with the same physical nature than those on the Shroud.

I think everyone respects R.Rogers work immensely, but his Milliard hypothesis doesn’t seem to work, but that is an hypothesis. Some or most of his other work/findings, such as finding a thin layer of impurities, whatever covering the fibrels or his lignin findings I think cannot be refuted. Thats my take on it anyways.\nR\n\n","date":"May 8, 2012 at 9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-11214","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
