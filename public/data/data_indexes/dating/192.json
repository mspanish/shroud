Google reported your pages. I found out about them when I turned my phone on after landing in Savannah Airport last night and I got a tweet from Yahoo News before the plane even got to the gate. I did not put it out there. I can only imagine that Google found out about the pages because you notified them or you linked to the pages from other indexed pages.  There is no way that I would have even known the URLs if they were not indexed in the search engines. Hundreds of email copies of this post went out after I made this posting. It’s been tweeted on Twitter. Facebook has it in full. Attempting to remove the post would only draw more attention to it, I’m afraid. I’m sorry; I post when I see things in public. Otherwise I ask for permission. Think about what you want to do and write to me offline if you want (danielrobertporter@gmail.com).\n\n","date":"November 30, 2014 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/30/the-raes-samples-that-rogers-used-had-been-switched/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-173833","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Raes samples that Rogers used had been switched?","post":"It’s best that we leave it as it is.

I’m submitting the survey to two cluster groups, One group such as the Shroudies, the second who are knowledgeable with GMO’s.\nThis assignment is in preparation for my master degree in business. Nothing more should be read into this. This assignment will require individuals to  answer according to the readings. (yet to be approved by my two mentors) I picked these two subjects because I had already done research on them and it saved me five weeks of journal entry and I have only 15 weeks to compile my data and write the research paper. I would really appreciate that anyone interested in taking the survey wait until it is ready and answer according to the readings.\n\n","date":"November 30, 2014 at 11:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/30/the-raes-samples-that-rogers-used-had-been-switched/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-173829","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Raes samples that Rogers used had been switched?","post":"Thanks, Giorgio.
