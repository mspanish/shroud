[{"title":"A modest inquiry from John Klotz","post":"There is  a lot of background material in Maureen Fennell Mazzaoui’s The Italian Cotton Industry in the Later Middle Ages 1100-1600, Cambridge University Press, 1981.  She makes the point, p. 80, that cotton and linen fibres were never woven together to make yarn but separate linen and cotton threads were used in a variety of cloths (detailed pp.166-7). Also there were times when the linen and cotton weavers formed a common guild. The book is valuable in that it takes the story back much earlier -to Roman times (Chapter One). Despite there being no reference to the Shroud there might be material here that is relevant to your researches.\n\n","date":"June 28, 2013 at 4:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/27/an-modest-inquiry-from-john-klotz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-38284","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A modest inquiry from John Klotz","post":"Charles,\nThank you for your suggestion.
