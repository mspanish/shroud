[{"title":"Bad Shroud of Turin Errors Spread and LiveÂ On","post":"With respect to the erroneous C14 dating results of 1988, I, for one, was surprised to learn the cloth sample tested for Carbon 14 dating was not placed under the Electron microscope prior to Carbon 14 dating.  \nWhen a scientist has a small amount of sample to be tested, other non-destructive chemical physical or biological type tests should be done before using his or her precious sample.  Had this small amount of cloth been placed under the Electron microscope initially, it would have been obvious that the particular linen sample was contaminated with the cotton fibers.\nAt that point, the sample should NOT have been C14 dated.  Ultimately, the testing done in 1988 was nothing more than a waste of sample, time, money and a clear disappointment for many around the world, including the Vatican, who truly believe the Shroud is the actual burial cloth of Christ.  \nTo my mind, it is amazing that six different labs had access to the cloth samples and all six labs destroyed what little they were given without so much as placing the small piece of cloth under a microscope first.  \nBest,\nTamara Beryl Latham\n\n","date":"January 22, 2012 at 2:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/27/bad-shroud-of-turin-errors-spread-and-live-on/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-7370","author":"Tamara","site":"shroudstory"}]
