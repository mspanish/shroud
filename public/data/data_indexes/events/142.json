How much do politicos  lobby the church in Turin? We know that in the U.S. the bishops are lobbied by the K Street crowd and the bishops turn around and lobby the government.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2013 at 10:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/the-shroud-of-turins-chamber-of-commerce/","cat":"event","id":"comment-57101","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin’s Chamber of Commerce","post":"Father Duncan has not gone through enough material. Does he know about how many people gathered near the cathedral when it caught fire? Does he knew about how fireman Trematore acted? Did that have something to do with the financial situation in the region? There is, of course, always interest in expositions because of the tourism it generates, but let us not forget that the Italians are proud when it comes to Don Bosco and many people in the Turin/Piedmont region are happy that the relic is preserved there.\n\n","date":"December 9, 2013 at 9:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/the-shroud-of-turins-chamber-of-commerce/","cat":"event","id":"comment-57417","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
