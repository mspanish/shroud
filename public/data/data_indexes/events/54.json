[{"title":"Ideas for conferences","post":"Brace your self Mr. Freeman, I agree with much of what you have written. However, I don’t think an Oxford style debate is appropriate, I think a lively two or three sided panel discussion with contrasting views would be. However, I am not planning the St. Louis Conference.\nI think you haven’t been acquainted withe the  “debates” that have occurred and whose evidence is on Shroud.com. I believe that Dan Porter could point out the number of posts from individuals who reject the early Edessa scenario espoused by Ian Wilson and supported by many.and dismissed by some. As far as the Knights Templar are concerned, I am uneasy that hey have  the “usual suspects” of history.\nI think Wilson  deserves an immense amount of honor for the pioneering work he has done on the Shroud.   Have you seen the 1978 award winning documentary by David Rolfe. It originated with an concept submitted by Wilson to  Rolfe in circa 1975. . \nAs an historian, you could have much to contribute and I think in explaining your proposal you have already made a contribution. I can assure you that are ideas which will be presented at this conference that are in fact controversial among Shroud advocates and some of them can be very dogmatic and/or heated  in making their arguments.\nI’ll go you one further in the science field. If a participant in the C14 carbon dating would make an appearance for a free wheeling discussion of the findings of Rogers et al, that would be really a plus. I don’t think any would accept the challenge to participate in an open forum although Charles Ramsey of Oxford has been the most open. I would love to see Richard Dawkins participate in a conference. He might learn something. Maybe that the C14 dating isn’t “rock solid.”\nJohn Klotz\nklotzlaw@gmail.com\nhttp://johnklotz.blogpsot.com\nhttp://quantumchrist-jck.blogspot.com/\n\n","date":"October 30, 2013 at 5:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","id":"comment-49174","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ideas for conferences","post":"Why should it come down to Raymond Rogers, and what he learned from one or two threads of dubious provenance? Why was he resorting anyway to stray threads,  when there is/was a retained strip of intact fabric available for precisely this purpose?\nAs for his chemical re-dating via lignin degradation and vanillin, which we’re asked to believe  trumps radiocarbon dating, here’s a comment that has just appeared on the Randi site:\n“I’m a chemist. Five or 6 days a week for 30 years. Ive been called as an expert witness in court cases several times. Tell me about these other tests and instruments. That vanillin test of Roger’s is worthless, in my expert opinion.” \nI for one would not waste a second of my time in constantly debating that 1988 testing, one that I see as a ranging shot exercise. Repeat the testing. Or are some of us happy with a messy status quo that is happy to trash the existing data, but does not admit the need for experimental repetition –  the hallmark of good science – whether or not it confirms the medieval date?\nNo more sterile and futile debate please.

It’s not about Raymond Rogers,  far less about cotton (who said anything today about cotton?). It’s about data that derives from a single site that has been challenged on the grounds of being unrepresentative. The answer should be self-evident. One does not need another conference to discuss the radiocarbon dating. One needs more radiocarbon data! \nLet’s discuss the sampling frame, shall we?

The first URL refers to the Shroud.

In fact, we could probably suit up multiple serious teams and deal with multiple narrow sub-issues at the same time.

No other skeptic submitted a paper.   When I produced a print Shroud newsletter and then later a Shroud email   bulletin, I used to get a lot of grief from people for publishing views of   various skeptics as well as theories outside the mainstream.  I personally   welcome and I welcome as spokesman for the committee putting together the St.   Louis conference any submissions for papers with opposing views of   authenticity.  You have my word that those papers would not be  discriminated  against because it opposes authenticity.  We would also  welcome a debate and/or  roundtable. In 2008, we had an open discussion  about the C-14 that included  all of the attendees, not just those who had  presented papers.

I do not believe that your concept of a single lab no matter how well qualified taking possession of the Shroud for testing would fly. Although the sample selection for the carbon testing was flawed, the fact is that the three labs were supposed to test there samples and not consult about their results. \nThat simplest part of the protocol was not honored, but the concept  having three independent tests as a check on  each other was a valid one.\n A single commercial investigator isn’t likely, particularly when the advocate of that approach  can’t fit the conferences into his schedule. We all have choices to make. This summer, I put aside most of the time I intended to spend on Shroud because I had an eight year defamation case to try. My obligation to my client had to come first. (Incidentally, we won).\nTo study the issues raised by the Shroud is a time consuming process. Maybe a book at the end of the trail may pay some compensation but that can be a long shot gamble. Very long.\nBut I believe the mystery of the Shroud is worth the extraordinary time and effort it takes. I am reminded of the parable of the wealthy young man who approached Christ and said that he had been faithful to the commandments all his life. What more should he do to obtain salvation? Christ replied, “If you would be perfect, sell every thing you have, give the money to the poor and come and follow me.” The young man turned away, for he was very wealthy. [Quoted from memory.]  \nI believe that the scientific study of the Shroud has been a revelation and the challenge of the Shroud compels something more than tea-kettle experiments. The dialogue on this blog can be pretty contentious but I have to credit Colin Berry bringing something to my attention that I had over-looked. That forensic pathologist  Zugibe concluded among very many other things that the image showed sign that Christ may have  suffered from Marfen’s syndrome. \nActually, that was in an earlier work by Zugibe published in 1981 and his last work that I had did not discuss Marfan but cited two books that did in the bibliography. However, I now think it may be worth a deeper analysis. As noted by some, it might explain the fact that Christ’s relative quick expiration on the cross surprised Pilate. [The husband of my wife’s cousin died unexpectedly and it was suspected that he may have suffered from Marfan’s.] There is a comment in Martin Kemp’s “Christ to Coke” book on icons that comes to mind.\nI have to travel out the Mineola courthouse today, and I am, of course way behind on my manuscript, but I felt this digression is necessary.\nI wish you well, but a single commercial provider taking possession of the Shroud for tests isn’t going to happen. Right or wrong, that is a fact of life and history.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2013 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","id":"comment-49298","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ideas for conferences","post":"John, I agree that this testing is not likely to happen but , while labs such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, would presumably charge for their experts to fully examine the Shroud, they are not primarily commercial. The simply point remains is that we have the Shroud and we have technology that is vastly more sophisticated than anything yet used to assess the Shroud and I shall be interested to see the results if the two get together as there will be a wealth of new data for everyone to work on. At present, there is a tedious reworking of old material and old debates based on out-dated technology. I hope the conference organisers make a real effort to get some new ideas in while we are waiting for further testing on the Shroud by the relevant experts- if that does ever take place!\nInterestingly when i was leading a tour of Tuscany that included several relic shrines two years ago, my local Italian guide told me of several examples where the Vatican or local bishops had allowed a full scientific, no strings attached analysis of certain relics.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2013 at 10:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","id":"comment-49326","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ideas for conferences","post":"Charles,\nI wish you well. The Shroud is unlike any other relic because if it is authentic it is both an artifact of Christ himself and a possible witness to the Resurrection. Unlike many people of a religious bent, I do not believe there is a distinct line between faith and religion. I take my guidance from Teillhard in that regard who wrote that there is an inevitable conjunction of the two. Science has explained so much of what was once considered the province  religion. It has now come to the edge of some intrinsically, cosmic, religious questions. I believe that science attempting to define human  consciousness is  science defining the soul. I do not think that it a bad thing.\nBy the way, the working title of my work in progress (about 75% complete is: The Coming of the Quantum Christ: the Shroud of Turin and the future of Science and Humanity. It’s a “take” on something Isabel Pizcek said at a  Shroud conference: the Shroud reveals the future of science.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2013 at 6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","id":"comment-49373","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ideas for conferences","post":"I only wish that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it were true. Therefore, those who want to get forget STURP and its accomplishment might repeat them. Unfortunately, forgetting STURP which was successful is not   a productive pathway to the future. I do not know what I wrote that would engender a snide remark from you. But dare I say it’s tiring. I know this may seem like nonsense to you, but maybe if you put away the snide and the quick retort you might learn something, even from me. \nWould you like to take dueling IQ tests? Once when I was a little discouraged and wondered if I had “lost” it, I took the MENSA test. I passed it. I assume you would too. Point is you should open your mind to the experiences of the past that worked. Whatever you may think, as a scientific collaborative studying the Shroud,  STURP was a singular accomplishment. John Heller, who did the later blood work was advised as an undergraduate at Yale  by Einstein. If you want to know how a student at Yale was advised by Einstein at Princeton? Buy his book on Amazon and read it. In the past two years  I have obtained about eighty or so related books because I had a lot to learn. How many books on the Shroud have you read? Are you too proud to learn? Are you just faking it? Anyone in your past equal to Einstein?\nShow some respect for everybody on this blog, not just me. You want to slam the door on my ideas, go ahead. But you may just be missing a chance for some sage consultation. As Lee said after Pickett’s charge failed: “Oh too bad, too bad.”\n\n","date":"October 30, 2013 at 5:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","id":"comment-49265","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ideas for conferences","post":"This message was meant for Colin\n\n","date":"October 30, 2013 at 5:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","id":"comment-49266","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
