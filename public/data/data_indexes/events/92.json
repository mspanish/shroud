But my faith tells me it is authentic and I “venerate” it as such. Skepticism is good to a point, but too much of it could rob you of the simplicity of faith.  This is exactly why Jesus said unless we have the faith of a little child we cannot enter the Kingdom. There is enough evidence to indicate the Shroud COULD be authentic.

It’s about what reliability we can take from newspaper reporting.  The press, and media generally, like to posture about the high ideals of the Fourth Estate and demand a licence to publish what they will under the slogan of the “freedom of the press”.  In reality most media outlets in the western world exist for one purpose only, to return a dividend to their shareholders.  Their employees climb onto this bandwagon knowing full well that in order to feed themselves and their families, they are expected to present their stories in as sensational way as they can, for this will sell their employer’s products and please the shareholders. \nNotice how this Associated Press reporter first creates the impression of report authenticity by commencing her report with factual quotations, which can be easily checked and confirmed, and consolidates this with a few paragraphs of objective factual commentary.  Then comes the creative part.  “A Vatican researcher [unnamed] said late last year (writing on the cloth…)”,  “But experts [again unnamed] stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth …”.  Further waffly commentary about “Some (who??) have suggested contamination skewed the results”.  No mention of the real reason – the failure to take a representative sample which just happened to be a patch!  The effect is to create a doubt in the mind of the reader as to what the Pope and Shroud authenticists believe or have to say on the topic, they are in fact evidently in “cloud-cuckoo land”.  Bring in a bit of sensationalism – recycle the sex-abuse scandal, which has nothing at all to do with the subject in hand, and that, my friends, is how you compose a newspaper report! \nMany years ago, we had a regular weekly radio programme in NZ, called “Fourth Estate”, a media watch-dog programme which provided objective commentary on the failures and successes of media reporting.  I guess other jurisdictions probably had similar versions of it.  Now the lobbyists of the press conglomerates have seen the dispatch of such useful critical programmes, and we must be our own critics.  One enlightening way is to read carefully the stories where we have our own inside information, and to compare the report with what we know are indeed the facts.  Similar comments apply to the other reports. Note the Christian Monitor headline “Pope Benedict says Shroud of Turin authentic burial robe of Jesus”. Pope Benedict did not specifically say that at all!\n\n","date":"March 8, 2013 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/08/pope-benedict-says-shroud-of-turin-authentic-burial-robe-of-jesus-it-doesnt-matter-what-science-says-about-its-authenticity/","cat":"event","id":"comment-26854","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Pope Benedict says Shroud of Turin authentic burial robe of Jesus & it doesn’t matter what science says about its authenticity","post":"I agree.\nReading Reuters, AFP or AP stories i’m waiting for factual, objective information.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2013 at 6:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/08/pope-benedict-says-shroud-of-turin-authentic-burial-robe-of-jesus-it-doesnt-matter-what-science-says-about-its-authenticity/","cat":"event","id":"comment-26887","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Pope Benedict says Shroud of Turin authentic burial robe of Jesus & it doesn’t matter what science says about its authenticity","post":"This is old news, Dan.
