That is more appropriate than ShroudNM.com since they are the granddaddy of all Shroud sites and we are substantially smaller.  I look forward to reading the papers.

Thanks guys, this move will be so much appreciated.  Will Russ Breault have the videos posted on Shroud.com as well or will they be sold individually on the WWW?\nWishing there could be another Shroud Convention next September/October in a vacation spot such as Cape Cod or Martha’s Vineyard but that might require a time period of more than four jam-packed days!\n\n","date":"October 25, 2014 at 4:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/24/st-louis-papers-to-be-archived-at-shroud-com/","cat":"conference","id":"comment-165375","author":"clublu22014","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Papers to be Archived at shroud.com","post":"It is my understanding that the videos will be hosted on YouTube.

Even the Vatican has a YouTube channel.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2014 at 4:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/24/st-louis-papers-to-be-archived-at-shroud-com/","cat":"conference","id":"comment-165382","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"}]
