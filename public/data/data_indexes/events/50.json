[{"title":"Happy Feast of the Holy Shroud Day","post":"I can vouch for September 14 being the feast-day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, for it is my brother’s birthday, and I have known of the feast-day for at least 60 years.  My own birthday occurs on December 25, another significant date in the western church calendar.  My sister’s occurs on August 15, the feast of the Assumption, and the anniversary of the mandylion’s arrival in Constantinople in 944.  Both my father and father-in-law shared the same birthday on August 17, within a day after Constantine Porphyrogenitus set the feast-day of the mandylion. My wife, my mother and my sister-in-law also shared the same birthday, March 26, the day after the feast of the Annunciation. Our family has always considered this concurrence of birth-dates a remarkable set of coincidences, and hopefully propitious.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2014 at 7:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/04/happy-feast-of-the-holy-shroud-day/","cat":"event","id":"comment-110661","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Happy Feast of the Holy Shroud Day","post":"Interesting.
