That really makes me tingle.\nMy problem is that the third week in September is an annual “retreat” for a group of married couples sans children (and grandchildren) at a beach house in Delaware. We’re old enough that the numbers are beginning to dwindle. My wife and I go back 43 years with one couple. \nMaybe, someone might suggest to the IEEE a simulcast on the web.

Can a real-time video-conferencing session be embedded in a blog site?

His research group at Uppsala University has initiated a collaboration with scientists from three South Asian educational institutes, namely, the University of Colombo (UC), and the University of Peradeniya (UP), both in Sri Lanka, and the prestigeous Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore, India.\n>The research will be specialized on lightning and electrical transients in tropical environments, in order to facilitate postgraduate education and strengthen the research activities related to the lightning and its effects, with power and telecommunication systems as the target.\n>Both India and Sri Lanka are countries located in the tropical regions with high thunderstorm activity and this gives an excellent opportunity to carry out all the required field measurements with real lightning strikes. Also both UU and IISc have excellent high voltage laboratory facilities for testing of equipments and protection devices using lightning voltage and current sources representative of real lightning.\n>In October 2007, Prof. Cooray received SEK 450 000 as a three-years grant (2008-10) from the Swedish Research Links programme (funded by Sida and the Swedish Research Council) for this South Asia related project titled ”A collaborative research and education program between Sweden, India and Sri Lanka on the effects of tropical lightning flashes on power and telecommunication systems”\n— — —\nLast week I visited an exposition (in Biella) and then (during that visit) …\nI have seen the project of an artist (who is also an electric engineer)\nand I have read  the claims about the Poggendorff’s motors\n(1870) : using the helium-filled balloon and a wire\nis possible to use the electric charge (Earth’s field) for the motor.\nTo understand the question, see also, for example under :\nhttp://blog.modernmechanix.com/the-amazing-motor-that-draws-power-from-the-air/\nor\nhttp://www.meridian-int-res.com/Energy/ESMotors.pdf\nNow … I want to ask :\nIs it possible to use that source of energy\n(used for corona-discharge motors) in order to show\nwhat are the results obtained on linen sheet\nfollowing the system by Giulio Fanti = CD (= corona discharge) ?\nI asked to prof.
