It’s also a shame that Rogers sent 3 letters to the Cardinal of Turin about the problem and never received the courtesy of a reply.\n\n","date":"March 5, 2013 at 9:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/down-loadable-apps-books-holy-saturday-exhibition/","cat":"event","id":"comment-26504","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Down-loadable apps, books:  Holy Saturday Exhibition","post":"I agree Joe, it’s a shame. But, there is alot more then Roger’s ‘findings’ when it comes to the C14 tests done in ’88. The simple fact that people believe that C14 testing is infalible, and do not bother to educate themselfs in the truth about carbon-dating and it’s shortcomings, is just as shameful. Especially with testing materials such as linen and more importantly the KNOWN issue of contamination…They just don’t WANT to see the truth.\nR\n\n","date":"March 11, 2013 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/down-loadable-apps-books-holy-saturday-exhibition/","cat":"event","id":"comment-27090","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
