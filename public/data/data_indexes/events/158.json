It might be a nice idea to explain what VVVP is about. The 35 second video is a bit short of details. An abstract might do. A CV from you might be appreciated by anyone thinking of partnering with you. Go ahead, you can post that here, as long as you keep it to a couple of pages.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2013 at 7:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/14/update-on-the-st-louis-conference-october-9-12-2014/","cat":"event","id":"comment-59814","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update on the St. Louis Conference, October 9-12, 2014","post":"No wont have time to submit a paper and unless it is submitted by qualified scientists why bother have been there done that have noticed you have qualified scientists on your site who are your friends.

The other half can be seen in the introduction and last paragraph in the interview-article “Science and religion meet in Shroud research” posted on the Holy Shroud Guild website.\nWhy crucify Professor Giulio Fanti? Ian Wilson reached a somewhat similar conclusion at the end of his 1978 Shroud book and does not appear to have changed his position. All of us are racked by doubts about almost everything under the sun and IW clearly stated the reason why he is a Christian (RC) in the postscript of his book “Jesus: the evidence”. It has nothing to do with the Turin Shroud and corresponds to what all believing Christians, and their respective churches, think. In a nutshell: first Jesus, then the Turin Shroud, not the other way round.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2013 at 10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/14/update-on-the-st-louis-conference-october-9-12-2014/","cat":"event","id":"comment-59862","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update on the St. Louis Conference, October 9-12, 2014","post":"Louis, I think it’s a counsel of perfection, but it’s not how 21st century minds work any more. First the evidence, then comes faith. In the beginning, Christianity had its roots in the Torah. But the eventual discovery that the Torah had much of mythic content, changes nothing.  We are discovering that many of our preconceptions of the Shroud might not be sustained, but it changes nothing.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2013 at 3:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/14/update-on-the-st-louis-conference-october-9-12-2014/","cat":"event","id":"comment-59930","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update on the St. Louis Conference, October 9-12, 2014","post":"David I agree with you when it comes to evidence and how the 21st century mind works. In the 20th century Husserl had his own interpretation of evidence:\nhttp://www.ajol.info/index.php/ipjp/article/viewFile/61104/49289\nAs you know, in the realm of Shroud studies we have scientists and scholars saying that the image demonstrates the Resurrection, others (not scientists) saying that it shows he was alive when the image was formed and yet others using the image to say that not only was he alive but went to India and lies buried in Kashmir!\nIt seems that Christianity had its beginning in the risen Christ, who appeared to James (who believed in the Torah) and Paul (for whom the Torah was secondary).\nIt is not at all difficult to agree with your last line.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2013 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/14/update-on-the-st-louis-conference-october-9-12-2014/","cat":"event","id":"comment-59944","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
