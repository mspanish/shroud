[{"title":"Review of the Holy Shroud Exhibition in Seville","post":"Lord save You (and me) from your friends.\nOne of the peersistent aspects of the Shroud controversy since the time of Pia has been over-reaching which is totally unnecessary. Speculation that strays from the known facts is fodder for those who reject the Shroud.\nThere is miracle enough in the facts. There is no need to extemporize and go off the page.\n\n","date":"May 15, 2013 at 6:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/15/review-of-the-holy-shroud-exhibition-in-seville/","cat":"event","id":"comment-33704","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Review of the Holy Shroud Exhibition in Seville","post":"She was in the wrong exhibit – she must have walked into the one with Superman’s cape.\n\n","date":"May 15, 2013 at 6:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/15/review-of-the-holy-shroud-exhibition-in-seville/","cat":"event","id":"comment-33705","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Review of the Holy Shroud Exhibition in Seville","post":"C-14 atoms in the linen also fail to deteriorate at the expected rate – yet another sign.   ;-)\n\n","date":"May 15, 2013 at 6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/15/review-of-the-holy-shroud-exhibition-in-seville/","cat":"event","id":"comment-33706","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Review of the Holy Shroud Exhibition in Seville","post":"They deteriorated at a pace which is expected for a medieval patch.

The word “impervious” is not appropriate but the water stain over the knees showed us the image is not water soluble–an important clue since many artistic substances are water soluble. The image does not seem to be effected by heat…other than the burns or charred areas, the image does not seem to be effected by the heat of the 1532 fire.  Medieval descriptions such as, “barely able to make out an outline” would also suggest the image was faint and hard to discern over 500 years ago.  So perhaps these things are over stated but they are also based on observations made by the STURP team and historical references.\n\n","date":"May 15, 2013 at 10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/15/review-of-the-holy-shroud-exhibition-in-seville/","cat":"event","id":"comment-33711","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Review of the Holy Shroud Exhibition in Seville","post":"Even old fogies should rejoice in the presence of youthful enthusiasm, even it is ooffee-fueled.

I am not saying the information is exact and precise. The ending is interesting by itself as she describes that she was disappointed by the whole exposition. That shows that many misunderstanding can occur when describing the Shroud to the general public. \nShe could have misunderstood the descriptions in the exposition or the descriptions were indeed not precise enough. That I do not know. But, it sends a message to anyone organizing such an exposition.\nI think it also points out at the difficulty of precisely describing the Shroud for the general public and doing so in a honest manner. \nAs an anecdotal note:\nWhen the subject of the Shroud comes up casually with friends and people I know or meet for the first time, the majority think that the Shroud has *only* a face image impressed on it. The majority. This is anecdotal and certainly not a well established statistical analysis. And, I do not remember one that knew that a dorsal image existed on it.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2013 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/15/review-of-the-holy-shroud-exhibition-in-seville/","cat":"event","id":"comment-33783","author":"latendre","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Review of the Holy Shroud Exhibition in Seville","post":"Thanks, Mario.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2013 at 11:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/15/review-of-the-holy-shroud-exhibition-in-seville/","cat":"event","id":"comment-33778","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"}]
