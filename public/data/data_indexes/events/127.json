Before that time, I don’t think there was too many scientists who proposed a supernatural hypothesis and Jackson was truly the first one from STURP to do so.  \nSo, for the history, I think we can say that the release of his hypothesis was a landmark, because it has contributed to open largely the gate to all the pseudo-science that you can imagine.  I don’t say that Jackson is responsible of all the pseudo-science that have follow after his hypothesis was made public, but I think he has encourage some people from the lunatic fringe to come out of the shadow.\n\n","date":"May 8, 2012 at 4:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/08/spreading-rumors-another-u-s-shroud-of-turin-conference/","cat":"event","id":"comment-11227","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
