BSTS seems to have two home pages, one at Dave’s blog and another one at shroud.com. If I visit the BSTS home page at http://shroud.com/bstsmain.htm I see that the President and Patron is the Baroness Ryder of Warsaw and the Chairman is Rodney Hoare,  Isn’t that a bit out of date?\n\n","date":"October 3, 2012 at 12:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/01/davor-aslanovski-to-attend-b-s-t-s-british-society-for-the-turin-shroud-meeting/","cat":"event","id":"comment-17178","author":"Jesse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski to attend B.S.T.S. (British Society for the Turin Shroud) Meeting","post":"Good catch!  The page you referenced was scheduled to be updated in our January 21, 2013 17th anniversary update. It was one of the original html pages provided to us by BSTS member Chris Jones back in 1996 and has never been updated. Our primary focus over the past year or two has been to complete the scanning and ocr of all the back BSTS issues, and the last of these will go online in January. We will also be adding pdf versions of all the old, html-only issues (#43 through #48) at that time.  But since you brought it up, the page in question has now been updated.\nAs for the confusion over the “home page,” I believe David’s page is an excellent means of the BSTS getting news out quickly and serves a very good purpose in giving people advance notice on things like meetings and lectures. However, shroud.com is more of a permanent archive and long term reference library and does not try to be a “daily news blog.” We have been providing an internet presence for the BSTS since 1996. Try searching for “British Society for the Turin Shroud” on Google.\n\n","date":"October 3, 2012 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/01/davor-aslanovski-to-attend-b-s-t-s-british-society-for-the-turin-shroud-meeting/","cat":"event","id":"comment-17197","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"}]
