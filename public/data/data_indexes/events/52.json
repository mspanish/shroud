[{"title":"How many strange statements can you count?","post":"John Iannone is listed on Shroud-com as a recognised Shroud speaker and has written several works on the subject. The article appears on ‘Coach Kevin Collins” blog site [sub-title “Coach is Right” should be read as a political position not a truth statement].

Outside USA, it’s generally considered that USA has the worst health-care system of any country in the western world.  Other countries less well-endowed with economic resources succeed in good publlic health-care programmes.
