[{"title":"TED Comes to the Vatican with Gloria Estefan and BarrieÂ Schwortz","post":"In the past two years, I have been fortunate to have had the friendship, and tutelage, of Barrie Schwortz. His is one of the most remarkable stories of our time and the world has been blessed not only with his talents but his heart. Were it not for Barrie, and Shroud.com, Sue Benford and Joe marino would not have gotten the hearing their work deserved. \nBut it was his friendship with Ray Rogers who initially challenged Benford-Marino that was a pivotal moment of the 2000 year old history of the Shroud. Rogers tests of their theory transformed him  from skeptic to advocate. Were it not for Barrie Schwortz it is doubtful we would be where we are today where all but militant atheists realize the carbon dating of the Shroud was not the answer but a question.\n\n","date":"April 17, 2013 at 7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/17/ted-comes-to-the-vatican-with-gloria-estefan-and-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"event","id":"comment-31059","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
