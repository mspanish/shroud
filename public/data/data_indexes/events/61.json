[{"title":"If you will be in the Cleveland area on January 25th","post":"Very interesting. Slides 25, 26 and 27 of David Onysko’s slideshow presentation show parts of microscope slides captioned “Sticky tape sample taken by Dr. Max Frei showing pollen fibrils and red silk.” Does anyone know the provenance of these photos? Mr Onysko doesn’t give an email address, so I can’t easily contact him. The first slide (25) shows not only what appears to be a broken end of brown linen thread, a length of red silk and a single pollen grain, but a very large quantity of single cotton fibres. I could speculate at some length about these, but would like to know if the photo is genuine first.\n\n","date":"January 11, 2014 at 11:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/11/if-you-will-be-in-the-cleveland-area-on-january-25th/","cat":"event","id":"comment-73050","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"If you will be in the Cleveland area on January 25th","post":"Hugh, you may try with this address of Onysko, hoping that it is still operative:\ndlonysko@integrityonline13.com\nIndeed it would be interesting to have a number of such photos published or somehow available. Those who might provide them are Alan Whanger and Paul Maloney, as far as I can tell.\n\n","date":"January 11, 2014 at 6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/11/if-you-will-be-in-the-cleveland-area-on-january-25th/","cat":"event","id":"comment-73092","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"}]
