Bob clearly reported that Rogers maintained a strict chain of custody on everything he had.\nIn my paper, I have shown that there is little doubt that the Raes and radiocarbon Rogers’ samples are both genuine Shroud samples. And more…\nFirst, we can conclude that the 2008 Bob Villareal paper concluding that the Raes threads are made of cotton (and not linen) is no longer reliable. At the time, they had no ancient/processed linen for comparison.\n“However ageing/processing of linen can dramatically change the spectral characteristics. This make it very difficult to conclusively identify an unknown sample”.\nThis explains the discrepancies between Bob’s 2008 paper and my own findings: the large majority of Raes 7 (one of the threads studied by Bob) is made of linen fibers although 10-20% of the fibers are cotton.  \nBob’s problem is that the properties of the threads/fibers analysed by FTIR etc. seem to be very different from of piece to another.\nSo, he is very “confused”.\nBob: “The Shroud data were highly variable. Some fibers appeared very similar to the ancient linen standards. Other were (more ?) similar to modern cotton or processed linen ..”\nIs it not what is expected from a “mixture” of threads in this area?\nI am waiting for the precise data of Bob’s paper.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2014 at 2:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/26/st-louis-videos/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-173639","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Videos","post":"“… You don’t know where it comes from, you don’t know what the history of it is, you don’t know who has had this sample… It’s a mystery how we can get anything to agree with these samples if we don’t have of those parameters…”\nYou’ve pointed the problem came from the composite nature of the threads.\nHave they tried to analyse individual fibers since 2008?\nBecause it looks like he is reinterpreting his 2008 paper wihtout new analyses.\n\n","date":"November 30, 2014 at 5:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/26/st-louis-videos/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-173758","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Videos","post":"Bob:”You don’t know where it comes from, you don’t know what the history of it is, you don’t know who has had this sample… It’s a mystery how we can get anything to agree with these samples if we don’t have of those parameters…”\nWell, I think the answers are in my paper.\n“Have they tried to analyse individual fibers since 2008?\nBecause it looks like he is reinterpreting his 2008 paper without new analyses.”\nThat’s why I wish to look at his paper.\nI was there during Bob’s presentation but I must confess that many things were not clear for me because of my poor understanding of spoken English …\n\n","date":"November 30, 2014 at 5:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/26/st-louis-videos/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-173763","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Videos","post":"Thibault, unfortunately I had a tape failure with your talk.
