This was his first book and the Association of American Publishers named it the Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990…\n>Kurzweil surveys the philosophical, mathematical and technological roots of artificial intelligence, starting with the assumption that a sufficiently advanced computer program could exhibit human-level intelligence. Kurzweil argues the creation of humans through evolution suggests that humans should be able to build something more intelligent than themselves …\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Intelligent_Machines\n>The Age of Spiritual Machines is a non-fiction book by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil about artificial intelligence and the future course of humanity. First published in hardcover on January 1, 1999 …\n>Kurzweil predicts machines with human-level intelligence will be available from affordable computing devices within a couple of decades, revolutionizing most aspects of life …\n>To build an artificial brain requires formulas, knowledge and sufficient computational power, explains Kurzweil. He says “by around the year 2020” a $1,000 personal computer will have enough speed and memory to match the human brain, based on the law of accelerating returns and his own estimates of the computational speed and memory capacity of the brain…\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#The_Age_of_Intelligent_Machines_.281990.29\n>How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed is a non-fiction book about brains, both human and artificial, by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. First published in hardcover on November 13, 2012\n>Kurzweil writes that the neocortex contains about 300 million very general pattern recognizers, arranged in a hierarchy…\n>A digital brain with human-level intelligence raises many philosophical questions, the first of which is whether it is conscious. Kurzweil feels that consciousness is “an emergent property of a complex physical system”, such that a computer emulating a brain would have the same emergent consciousness as the real brain… \nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_Mind\n— —\nKurzweil spends most of his time thinking about the inevitable unification of man’s brain and computers, an event he described in detail in his 2005 book, The Singularity is Near.\nThe Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology is a 2005 non-fiction book about artificial intelligence and the future of humanity by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil.\nLink: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near\nSo…\nHow To Create a Mind: Can a marriage between man and machine solve the Shroud Enigma ?\nPerhaps with the artificial consciousness will be solved the Enigma.\nWhat is your opinion ?\nI want to understand your ideas about the future. Please, explain…\n— — —\nSorry,\nhere I want to add few lines :\nDear Charles Freeman\n(reference: the message of October 14, 2014 at 12:30),\nPlease, explain us what are the exact reasons for “the lack of validity in his methods”. IMHO that message (of October 14, 2014) was an attack too hard against a researcher who has spent years trying to do something…\nI am not a fanatic of the work of the Engineer Fanti and I can agree about the “manifest problems over his dating methods” (by Fanti), if you are able to explain where are the exact pitfalls (for example : bacterial and fungal attacks, degradation of the areas affected by the heat during the fire of 1532, etc. , etc.). In any case he published two books…    and is not the first comer in the field of studies on the Shroud!\n\n","date":"October 15, 2014 at 9:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-162590","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"It is not so much myself you must question, Piero. The publication of Fanti’s dates was a classic case of how news operates today. ( See Nick Davies’ book Bad News.)  A story is released – in this case just before Easter. Newspapers reprint it in order not to miss out without doing any research on Fanti, or the mathematics and science behind the story. Then they do the sums, realise that you cannot have three such different dates from a credible method of dating, that changing one date but not the others doss not work, and that it is meaningless  to average three dates when only one at the most ( and maybe none of them)   Is valid. So the story is no longer taken seriously but no one apologises for printing it without checking it first.\nIt is then not surprising that Fanti can find no supporters in the mainstream academic world  and rude people called him Professor Fantasy.\nThere is a real problem about Shroud research in general.  It is very isolated from the real world . Was there any attempt at the St. Louis conference to invite a wider sceptical audience or was there just the assumption that the case for authenticity was so obvious there was no need to bother?\nJack M. whose paper I look forward to reading does seem to have realised that much of the history of the Shroud does need to be rethought even if he has to frighten the audience by posting up a ten foot picture of me!\n\n","date":"October 15, 2014 at 12:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-162635","author":"Charles Freemam","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"Excuse me for my two posts … maybe my poor style of intervention has been affected in some way of my health problems.

I understand the volume of papers presented wouldn’t allow for that but I think the presentations could’ve been bundled together by subject (e.g. history of the shroud/Mandylion) then followed by a Q&A that covered those presentation. There was some repetition to the extent that some speakers just had to jump over a lot of slides knowing this has been discussed many times before.

Not even Jesus’ nudity. I think this is a question of social convention and taboo. I haven’t quantified this, but I guess that a naked Jesus occurs more often in books than it does in public display. The biggest taboo, however, was (is) not nudity but genitalia, and with few, perhaps deliberately provocative, exceptions (eg Michelangelo), even when Jesus is clearly nude, some diaphanous wisp of material, or the angle of his legs, or his hands, preserve his modesty. Buttocks, I think, were not a problem, but rarely appear – on anybody – because a picture of someone shows his front, not his back. Obviously, if a decision were taken to have a front-and-back portrait (which is, I agree, probably unique in early art) of a naked man, then buttocks would be inevitable.\n2) I see no kink. I see what I would expect if somebody wanted to show one foot placed over another, and the shroud wrapped up over the heel of the lower foot.\n3) The blood chain is, I agree, an oddity. It was often supoosed in earlier times to represent the chain or rope with which Jesus was tied to the pillar. I wonder what its ends looked like before the 1532 fire (if it was there then). However it makes no sense from an authenticist point of view either; dribbles of blood trickling from one side of the cloth to the other – where from, and how?\nWhen something seem to me to be better explained by a 13th century origin than a 1st (such as the heads meeting in the middle), or by a 1st century origin than a 13th (such as fragments of the pollen data), then I place that bit of evidence on the relevant side of the balance.

This was done to respect their liberty and that’s in sync with the God jésus revealed through his ministry and particularly during his Passion.  It’s interesting that, in order to recognize him, they always had to see some sign, whether it was his voice (which probably was the same as it was before his death), his stigmatas of the Passion, the breaking of the bread or the miraculous fishing…  This particular fact shows how different he surely was!  Personally, I think that, along with his voice, he probably only kept the same eyes he had before his death and all the rest was different.  After all, the eyes are the mirror of the soul!\nAnd when we push the reflection further, we came to understand that this particular fact that the Resurrected Christ changed his appearence so much that his closest friends were not able to recognize him without any signs is a great indication that these account are historically accurate and true, because if the story of the Resurrection was a hoax done by some disciples, they would have make believe that they had absolutely no problem to recognize him and that they had no boubt about it.  The fact that this is precisely the opposite that happen is a great sign of truth. And this particular fact is also a great piece of evidence to reject the idea of a mass hallucination, because the imagination of people would have lead them to see Jesus just like he was before his death.\nWhen we reflect upon these accounts with logic while taking into account all the known data, we end-up thinking that the most probable answer is to believe they’re true.

Daniel 10:6 supports this. All of this suggests that they were extraordinarily luminous, blindingly so. There is not way to misidentify and angel with something earthly, thus why she easily recognized the angel. So then.. Why didn’t she know her own teacher? My guess would be that her eyes were still adjusting to the shade following the encounter with the angel. And when Jesus appeared she was still unable to clearly discern his features, which combined with the clothing, could explain the confusion. After all, the duration of flash blindness has been associated with the intensity of the light source.\nOther options may be that he was standing in an angle where his face may have been obscured or was maybe wearing something that cloaked his face (if he was found alive, I guess that he may have been considered a fugitive; although I am not personally by this one) or that MM, completely shocked by the absence of a body  dismissed the angel as a grief induced hallucination and tried to rationalize his presence by identifying him as someone that she would expect: a gardener.\n\n","date":"October 18, 2014 at 7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-163610","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"* There is no way to misidentify an angel with something earthly\n\n","date":"October 18, 2014 at 7:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-163611","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"In another occasion Jesus told like this –Matthew 22:30 – At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.\nThat is why I support Mr. Rucker’s hypothesis about the disappearance of the body.\n\n","date":"October 16, 2014 at 10:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-163001","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"The TRUE fact in John’s Gospel is Mary of Magdalene is reported to have seen an angel already in the tomb AND a gardener coming from outside.

In other words, this was a sign given to them to understand that Jesus (God) is hidden in the heart (or the soul or whatever the word you want to call it) of every person and lives there spiritualy (which is the most profound meaning of Matthew 25).\nTo me, along with the fact that God never want to force faith, that’s the main reason for why Jesus had a new appearence (still human, but different) when he encountered his disciples after his Resurrection.\nI also want to say that when we consider the facts globally (including the probable fact that some disciples decided to take Jesus’ burial shroud from the tomb and preserved it), we’re lead to conclude 2 important things : 1- The empty tomb is an historical fact (because even Jesus’ ennemy never denied that his tomb was empty on Easter morning and, obviously, no one ever found out the missing corpse afterward) and 2- Right after Jesus’ death and burial, there were many of his disciples who were totally convinced that he was still alive, but in a different way. Here, the probable fact that they kept and perserved carefully his burial cloth covered with bloodstains (even though it was a legal impurity for a Jew to touch a cloth that had been in contact with a dead) is a great piece of evidence (at least for me) of the fact that they must have been highly convinced of his Resurrection on Easter day.\nNote : These 2 important conclusions don’t mean that Jesus’ Resurrection is, in itself, an historical fact, but these conclusions are great indicators for us to undertstand that the apostolic testimony concerning Jesus’ death, burial and Resurrection must be consider very serious and as having a potentially high value. In other words, this post-Resurrection testimony is surely not a joke, not a hoax, but on the contrary, came from men and women who were totally convinced that what they said was true. \nNow, is it possible that an unknown person stole the body of Jesus from the tomb (while leaving his burial shroud there) and make them believe he was still alive (maybe by using someone who looked a bit like Jesus and by making him appear to them on some occasions)? Yes, it is possible to think that. But that’s surely not the most probable conclusion to draw in face of all the facts and pieces of evidence we got…  \nHere, it’s a bit like the image on the Shroud, which we can still think that it came from a « natural » forgery where the forger would have used a real crucified body to make a false Christian relic, even though the corpus of facts and data leads us to conclude that such a scenario is far-fetched (even if it is theoretically possible) and there’s another scenario that really seems to be much more probable, i.e. that the image on the cloth came from a natural interraction between the real crucified body of Jesus of Nazareth and his own burial cloth…  \nIn sum, I think that if we analyze the situation without bias or preconcieve notions, while taking account of all the pertinent data and observations, we can say that, in the case of the Resurrection of Jesus as well as in the case of the Shroud, it is much more easy to conclude that these are just what it was reported to be (i.e. the Resurrection of Jesus is a true event and the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus) than to start building far-fetched scenarios, just to contradict the official claims that were made…\nWhile reading this previous paragraph, some people (those who don’t know me that much) could find strange that I consider the Resurrection of Jesus to be « probable » in face of all the data, observations and testimonies we have and, at the same time, that I don’t make a direct link between the formation of the body image on the Shroud and this supernatural event. First, I would say that there is nothing in the corpus of data coming from the Shroud that leads me to believe in such a direct link. We don’t find anything in all the STURP papers that have been published in peer-reviewed journals that suggest such a thing and there is nothing also in all the later analyses done by Ray Rogers and Alan Adler afterward.  And secondly, this is important to remember (and I think most people here are completely unaware of this) that, historically, what have been officially reported in the case of the Shroud is that it was the authentic burial cloth of Jesus showing the image of his dead body at the time he was placed inside it. Effectively, the belief that the image was caused directly by some burst of energy coming from Jesus’ corpse at the exact moment of his Resurrection is a real modern heresy, which originates from the unability of the STURP team to find one clear and definitive solution for the image formation, as well as the very curious C14 results published in 1989 (the « scientific journey » of John Jackson is the most obvious example that illustrate this), while all the other data were pointing in direction of authenticity. Look, you just need to read papers or books that were written about the Shroud before that era to understand easily that the body image formation was almost never associated directly with the Resurrection of Christ, even by the researchers (like Vignon and Barbet for example) who concluded, just like me, that this Shroud is authentic. When you read these « ancient » publications about the Shroud (you can also read an article of Peter Rinaldi, which have been published on this blog last year), you note easily that it was evident for these writers that the image on the Shroud was directly related to the dead body of Christ and not to his « glorious body »! After having studied carefully all the pertinent data and observations related to the cloth and the image, I came out convinced that their conclusion about that was good and that the scenario of an image directly caused by the Resurrection event was an Hollywoodish and heretic idea.\nOne last thing I would like to say about Jesus’ Resurrection is this : I think the error would be to focus on the own personal Resurrection of Jesus, while forgetting (or not understanding) that, in the most profound way, these appearance of the Resurrected Christ were mainly intended to make us understand that his Resurrection is ours too! In other words, I truly believe that the best way to look at Christ’s Resurrection is to see in this event an insurance of our own personal Resurrection that will come for sure at the « end of our time » here on earth!  In sum, it is the « heritage » that God saved for us from all eternity… And I think we must do the same kind of « reading » for all the important events in the life of Christ that we find in the Gospels, whether it be his transfiguration, his baptism, his suffering passion, etc. In other words, in these events, we must see our own transfiguration that will surely come after our physical death, our own baptism that has been done a first time by God at the moment he created us and which will be redone in a more complete way at the time of our physical death, our own suffering passion here on earth, which will eventually be transfigured into eternal life and hapinness after our physical death, etc.  It’s like Jesus is saying to us : Stop looking at me personally and look at what has been lovingly prepared by God for YOU from all eternity!  I think that’s one of the main reason why Christ didn’t appeared to his disciples for a long period of time after his Resurrection and choosed to disappear completely to their eyes after that short period of time. Or else, they would have been even more tempted to only watch the Resurrected Christ without thinking that his own Resurrection was also ours!\n\n","date":"October 18, 2014 at 4:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-163568","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"Eric, relying mostly and too much methinks on Daniel’s (Daniel 10:5-6) vivid description of an angel: “I looked up and there before me was A MAN DRESSED IN LINEN (my upper cases), with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.

And I was quite clear that it was speculation, which I decided to elaborate on your request while we were discussing what I can actually debate, the pathology of trauma related hairloss and the speed of its onset. But since you insist…\nMPH: “Eric, relying mostly and too much methinks on Daniel’s (Daniel 10:5-6) vivid description of an angel: “I looked up and there before me was A MAN DRESSED IN LINEN (my upper cases), with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude””\nA: I’m not exactly sure why you are emphasizing the clothing, when the obvious characteristics that would support a luminous being are his description of the face and eyes, which are associated with lightning and fire. Daniel provides a fancy, yet detailed description of an angel, and implies that it was luminous. Matthew 28:3 provides a very similar description of the very being that appeared to the guards and women: “His appearance (face in some translations) was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.” Implying that both were allegorizing the “lightning” part is a worst defiance to logic than taking it to literally mean that angels emit an intense luminosity akin to lightning.\nMPH: “(…) you wrote (re the angels at and in Yeshu’a’s tomb: “They were extraordinarily luminous, blindingly so” and Mary was so much bedazzled she just could not even recognize her own master AND YET mistook him for the gardener implying she could not mistook him for any of Yeshua’s disciples who might have come over as well to the tomb (besides John and Peter). You explanation neither fits logic and John’s gospel narrative.”\nA: I did not say “bedazzled”, which implies disorientation and impairment of several senses. No, I said that she would have been experiencing “flash blindness” of the kind that people adjusting to a sudden change in lighting experience. The effect can last several days, and no, in most cases it does not mean that the person is entirely blind but rather just visually impaired. Why not mistake him for an apostle? The clothing. I already noted my agreement on this point.\nMPH: “When Mary Magdalene saw Yeshu’a on that early morning, most likely she was sitting on her knees still weeping at the low cave-tomb opening and looking in. She turned her head as Yeshu’a’s body draped in a sindon was silhouetted against the rising sun between two columns with two more pillars projecting from either side of the monumental/main entrance. She could have mistaken him for a divine messenger too according to ‘your speculation’, which is definitely not the case: she mistook him for a gardener implying ‘the man she saw’ looked an everyday man weaing a red earth stained sindon draped as workwear and his face was hairless (if not to say bald or nearly bald).”\nA: Again, I agree on the clothing. Not the baldness. My speculation does not say or imply that she would mistake somebody wearing that, with the divine messenger that the women had seen and who is described as wearing clothing that was “white as snow” (Matt. 28:3).\nMPH: “Besides the word for angels can refer here either to divine messengers or mere human messengers (e.g. Yeshu’a’s secret disciples from Essenean background) or else divine messengers resembling human form.”\nA: Are you completely ignoring Matthew 28:3? Just like Daniel’s, this angel had an appearance (or face, depending on the translation) “like lightning”. Clearly not adopting an human facade. Furthermore, he made his supernatural nature very obvious when he appeared following a quake, moved the heavy stone by himself and sat on it. No one present would mistake it for a human, ever.\nMPH: “Indeed if in in Heb. 1:14, we are told angels are not composed of physical matter but are spirit beings created by G-od; the true fact remains angels can resemble human form when G-od permits or wills it (see Gen. 19) and when they appear in a human form in the Bible, they are always a man even if angels are neither male of female and they appear as such NOT TO FRIGHTEN real human beings, which is in drastic contrast with ‘your speculation’. Reminder the angel’s word in the tomb: “Don’t be afraid!”.”\nA: Max, you are contradicting both the physical description given in Matthew 28:3 and the fact that Matthew 28:4 states that the guards were horribly scared: “The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.” Clearly the reason why he had to say “Do not be afraid” to the women was due to his supernatural appearance and actions, both of which would have been fiercely intimidating.\n“Thus what do you make of the fact Second Temple period gardeners’ face was hairless? NOTHING!”\nA: Of course not, you requested me to bring up an alternative answer to the baldness issue and I did.\n“What do you make of the fact the resurrected/glorified Christ Late Antique and Medieval iconography depicts him with no hair and no moustache at times while depicting him with a beard and moustache before resurrection and glorification ON THE SAME iconographic program (see e.g. the famous Hungarian Pray Ms bifolium)? NOTHING!”\nA: You of all people should be aware of the identifications with pagan deities and the influence that could have on the way that people that never saw him visualized him. Just take Sol Invictus’ classical appearance, remember the Mausoleum M depiction of Christ as a fusion of himself and the pagan deity, Dies Natalis Solis Invicti and Christmas… And voila, a perfect recipe for people depicting Jesus the as the clean shaven Sol Invictus during those early centuries. The human Jesus would be depicted as your “average” Jewish man, while the Resurrected form would resemble the “divine” look of Sol Invictus. The example of Sol Invictus is the most obvious due to the known interaction between his cult and early Christianity, but the same could be said for Apollo and several of the Hellenistic/Roman deities.\n“This is not serious refutation.”\nA: It was meant to be speculation, I went on the tangent on your request. I was perfectly comfortable trying to explain why hair loss would not have been evident in the short time between the Resurrection and MM seeing him.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2014 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-163754","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"Typo: most likely she (Mary Magdalene) was sitting on her knees OR SQUATTING\n\n","date":"October 19, 2014 at 5:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-163719","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"More typo: she could not HAVE MISTAKEN him for any of Yeshua’s disciples etc.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2014 at 6:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-163726","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"Eric ,\nThen again you explanation does not fit the reported facts (see the Four Gospels) and facts of experience.\n1/- Had Mary Magdalene really seen an angel in its heavenly form i.e. as described in Daniel’s ‘fancy description’  (Daniel 10:5-6) and not in a human form AND IN THE TOMB:\n– firstly she would have fallen on her face instantly\n– secondly she should have not even noticed “the gardener” looming behind her in the rising sun (most likely between two monumental cave-tomb entrance columns) as she was squatting at the low tomb opening looking in and consequently she should not have had to adjust to a sudden change in lighting experience since lighting was both within (an alleged “luminous angel” in the tomb) and without (Mary Magdalene turning her head and facing the rising sun).\n2/ Re Matt 28: 1-4 we read: “Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 4 And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.\n– firstly you most misleadingly mix up THREE DIFFERENT EPISODES as Matthew (for dramatic emphasis’ sake) mixes two episodes into one namely the resurrection per se that occurred in the middle of the night (AND NOT at dawn!) with an angel descending from heaven (that is from outside the tomb AND NOT from the inside!) and Mary Magdalene coming at the tomb toward dawn first WITH OTHER WOMEN AND THEN with Mary Magdalene’s RETURN to the empty tomb by herself and seeing an angel IN the tomb.\n– Besides ‘the Archangel of Lightning’ as Anthropomorphic Personification trope was currently used in popular ancient Jewish culture for literary dramatic emphasis.

Not only that, but simply a glimpse of such an extreme form of light would suffice (Did you know that temporary blindness is seen commonly in those adjacent to actual lightning strikes, even when they never “saw” the actual bolt? Also, abolt only lasts a few milliseconds.) and we know that Daniel was able to see him and did not fall until spoken to. Also, Ezekiel 1:28 states that he was permitted a glimpse of The Lord himself before falling down. In any case, I don’t think that she would have continued to look at it for long, just enough to identify it as an angel (a glimpse of the divine). Lastly, even if the angel was disguised, it is still highly likely that she would have fallen to the floor in reverence as soon as she realized who he was and would have been instructed to stand up, so it would still play out the same way.\nUm, No. The rising sun hardly illuminates to the extent that the eyes would not need to adjust if suddenly faced with something that irradiated “like lightning”.  Lightning is several times more radiant than the actual sun, and hotter as well. Lightning may cause instantaneous damage to the retina, which is something that the sun will take its sweet time to do. If you were struck by a freak bolt in the middle of the day with the sun shining at its max, you would still experience flash blinding. Finally, I don’t think that the need to explain atmospheric scattering is relevant here, but there is a *reason* why we can enjoy sunrise and sunset.\nMPH: “2/ Re Matt 28: 1-4 we read: “Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 4 And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.\n– firstly you most misleadingly mix up THREE DIFFERENT EPISODES as Matthew (for dramatic emphasis’ sake) mixes two episodes into one namely the resurrection per se that occurred in the middle of the night (AND NOT at dawn!) with an angel descending from heaven (that is from outside the tomb AND NOT from the inside!) and Mary Magdalene coming at the tomb toward dawn first WITH OTHER WOMEN AND THEN with Mary Magdalene’s RETURN to the empty tomb by herself and seeing an angel IN the tomb.”\nA: First, I did not “mix up” anything, these are different scenes of the same sequence and thus relevant to each other. The difference is only a few hours, Max. Second, there is no reason to assume that this was not the same being, since the women left, it would be most ineffective to return and then come back without delivering his message (and complete his divine mission). Simply remaining in the vicinity was more likely. Third, as explained above, the time of the day would make no difference in regards to flash blindness, as explained in the reply above.\nMPH: “Besides ‘the Archangel of Lightning’ as Anthropomorphic Personification trope was currently used in popular ancient Jewish culture for literary dramatic emphasis. To mistake literary device for fact is just naive.”\nA: “Currently” as in “first century current” is completely besides the point, since the description matches that of Daniel ages before. Allegorizing that may be a mistake on your behalf, especially since we are simply told that this was a messenger and is not identified as somebody higher up in hierarchy like say, Michael (who may warrant a “trope”).\nMPH: “(…) thirdly, shall I endlessly repeat, in the Bible and Rabbinic literature, angels are spiritual beings without bodies of flesh and bones THOUGH they apparently have the ability to appear in human form (Gen. 19:1-22). Reminder: physical Matter is the lowest vibration of spiritual Energy (or Spirit) and spiritual Energy (or Spirit) is the highest vibration of physical Matter”\nA: Perhaps you could clarify this argument, because I am sure that this was addressed in my last reply. And not only that, I used the term “human facade” well aware that they are not made out of flesh and blood. The fact of the matter is that the only description of the being adjacent to the tomb near the time of the Resurrection is describing a supernatural appearance.\nMPH: “3/ you wrote: “it is unlikely that he (=Yeshu’a) would have experienced extreme hairloss in a couple of days -especially localized hair loss- and that diffuse hair loss is not enough to make somebody a “complete stranger”.”\nA: Now this I can debate!\nMPH: “Question one: when was it last you medically studied or hear of a moustached, bearded and long-haird man returned to life/resurrected after experiencing a very traumatic/violent death to totally rule out the possibility of a case of ‘post-oppressaem-et-ad-vitam-reditum’ quick extreme alopecia (loss of beard and moustache and partial loss of Yeshu’a’s long hair blood encrusted hair)?”\nA: I already answered that no body has ever attended or studied any case of actual resurrection. However, let’s assume that it was so. Did you know that a good portion of your hair is already ready to fall? This is called the telogen phase and throughout it this hair is essentially just resting there, it could fall out at any moment, yet it generally does when the cycle is either ready to restart and go back to the anagen (growth) phase or when it is interrupted, as you are implying. Well now, when trauma interrupts the cycle and sends most of the hairs into a premature telogen phase, this means that these hairs are left without “replacements” and hair loss becomes apparent. However, the problem with that is -as mentioned above- that regardless of the reason for the interruption of the cycle (and death followed by Resurrection would be just that, a prolonged interruption of all body functions) said hair loss is systematic and will not become apparent until *at least* a few days after. You are suggesting that the sheer trauma would accelerate this to a few hours, but can’t provide any example of this happening either.\nMPH: “Had you ever gotten long hair and worn a moustache and beard and one day had to have all your hair shaved on the head and all around the mouth in a place with no mirror and all of a sudden, while passing from a place with no mirror to a place with a mirror, been brought face to face with your own new reflection in the mirror, you could have not even recognized yourself at first sight and should have needed a time to adapt and become familiar with your new face image! Even a very good friend from childhood could not have recognized you unless you would have addressed him using his surname. Once I made this very disturbing experiment. I could not even recognize a very good friend of mine from childhood just standing in front me as he had no moustache no beard any longer and wear very short hair, which I was not familiar with!”\nA: Well, of course. Had he actually *shaved* his face/head clean this could be easily explained. But this was one of the very first things that I addressed. Culturally this was unlikely, to this day the Halakha addresses shaving in a particular manner. Then there is the Nazarite Vow, but also the drinking of wine to consider.\nMPH: “Most likely, this could explain why Mary Magdalene was unable to recognize her own master as she mistook him for a hairless-faced, sparse-haired and red-earth encrusted bare-footed gardener draped in his red earthstained sindon used as workwear.”\nA: …\nMPH: “You also wrote: “You of all people should be aware of the identifications with pagan deities and the influence that could have on the way that people that never saw him visualized him.”\nIn the specific case of the Hungarian Pray Ms bifolium I gave as an example, most likely the illustrator did SEE the crucifixion victim image on the Constantinople Sindon. Still it is reported by eyewitnesses “the ‘not-made-by-hand’ image of Christ and G-od, draped with a white/pure linen cloth he had worn, was sufficiently in lieu of the vision of the Lord coming into the flesh to those who had not corporally seen him”. Too bad you of all people are amazingly unaware of the corroborating 944-1207 CE testimonies and eyewitness descriptions of the TS image.”\nA: Not at all, I am well aware of the parallels to the shroud in the Codex since it has been discussed here time after time. I never denied that the author saw the shroud, as a matter of fact I assume that he did. What *I did* imply is that the reason why his hair would be depicted differently afterwards is because the author would feel the need to illustrate the divinity of the Resurrection by replacing the bearded, “traditional” Jewish man, depicted in the shroud with something that reflected a known pagan deity as a metaphor of ascension, from man to God. Pagan influence lingered way after the cults disappeared, the author of the codex should have been well aware of these earlier depictions and hence why he choose them to illustrate this metaphor. \nRegardless, in either case a few things are certain: \nI- No first century artist is known to have painted an image of Christ after seeing him Resurrected first hand. This entire debate would be settled if such a piece emerged.\nII- No oral tradition has been recorded directly stating that the change involved Jesus’ hair.\nIII- There is no way that the Codex’s author saw the Resurrected Christ in person and if he actually saw the shroud, then that would actually put more weight on the theory that the variation in the depictions was either metaphorical or represented something that is not to be taken literally.\nMPH: “Your refutation is still not serious and does not fit with the Gospels, the known (in terms of facts of experience) and the most comprehensive and logical explanation for Mary Magdalene mistaking her own master for the gardener.”\nA: Has it occurred to you that maybe we just have different interpretations of the gospels? So far I have not found any trouble rebuffing your arguments back, if mine were so flawed it would not have been this easy. And again, your own comprehensive explanation is still speculative, just like mine.\n\n","date":"October 20, 2014 at 8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-164160","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"Eric, you wrote:\n“So far I have not found any trouble rebuffing your arguments back”. \nMethinks the main flaw in your argument is encapsulated in the very fact you STILL can mistake lightning for an angel.

I state numerous times that the flash blindness scenario is speculation, a tought exercise. I do not believe in it, and I most certainly do not want anybody to believe it either, that is not the idea. The point of the exercise was to help illustrate just how far someone could take a single reference, mix it up with supporting sources, create a fringe hypothesis and debate it coherently. The fact that you keep gravitating towards it and trying to put me on the defensive actually proves that you are aware that the only thing supporting the “instant baldness” is your association of an image (the way gardeners looked) with an account that does not go into further detail in order to explain why that happened.\nThe irony of the issue is that you claim that I take the bible “to literally”, yet you have created a medically unsound hypothesis based on an event depicted only by John. You know that gospel has several contrasts with the synoptic gospels; some even suggest that John 21 implies that it was written from a second hand account. So, maybe you are placing all of your eggs in a single basket. I would not let my interpretation of the other -congruent- gospels waver due to it and would most certainly not risk my reputation like you are.\nBTW, I am not arguing about the way that Temple gardeners dressed… I am arguing that you believe that for someone to mistake somebody else that person must look *exactly* the same way.\nAnd finally, I think that if you wanted somebody to take this idea seriously, you should have contacted somebody qualified to provide an expert’s assessment. Your hypothesis fails on medical grounds and hence, it is not a “serious argument”. I know that you know this, but you clearly dislike criticsm of your ideas. Maybe that is why you have so many “unpublished” papers? You don’t like peer reviews? Only you can answer that. The fact of the matter is that your hypothesis is unsustained, pure speculation that directly contradicts medical literature and until you can prove otherwise, I am no longer interested in more mumbo jumbo about a mysterious new form of alopecia.\nThis will be my last post discussing the matter until you can cite me (any!) medical literature supporting your hypothesis. Only then we can get “serious” about this topic.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2014 at 12:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-166224","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"* rhetoric\n\n","date":"October 25, 2014 at 2:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-165491","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"As a real possibility and in light of the post-resurrectionem Gospels’ narratives, methinks along with moustache and beard total alopecia and spot baldness on the brow (through systematic rubbing), partial or total eyebrow alopecia could have resulted  from extremely stressing violent death followed by return to physical life + tugging, pulling and friction of removing the encrusted blood from the hair.\n\n","date":"October 20, 2014 at 10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-164040","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"Reminder: when I mean alopecia here, I mean post-oppressaem-et-ad-vitam-reditum quick extreme alopecia PLUS (NOT ONLY) tugging, pulling and friction of removing the encrusted blood from the hair (with or without water).\n\n","date":"October 28, 2014 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-166219","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thanks All Around","post":"Eric,\nYou wrote:”This will be my last post discussing the matter until you can cite me (any!) medical literature supporting your hypothesis.
