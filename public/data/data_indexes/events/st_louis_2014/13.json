[{"title":"It may well be the best publicized conference yet","post":"If anyone’s wondering why St.Louis was chosen as the venue, here’s a possible clue from the wiki entry (under ‘People’):\nThe perception of Louis IX  (ed. St.Louis) as the exemplary Christian prince was reinforced by his religious zeal. Louis was a devout Catholic, and he built the Sainte-Chapelle (“Holy Chapel”), located within the royal palace complex (now the Paris Hall of Justice), on the Île de la Cité in the centre of Paris. The Sainte Chapelle, a perfect example of the Rayonnant style of Gothic architecture, was erected as a shrine for the Crown of Thorns and a fragment of the True Cross, precious relics of the Passion of Jesus. Louis purchased these in 1239–41 from Emperor Baldwin II of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, for the exorbitant sum of 135,000 livres* (the chapel, however, cost only 60,000 livres to build).\n*That was more than 10% of France’s then current national income, according to information elsewhere in the same wiki article. Oh, and St.Louis won’t be Barrie Schwortz’s favourite Roman Catholic saint, assuming he has one, as the rest of the article makes painfully all too clear.\n\n","date":"October 10, 2014 at 4:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/09/it-may-well-be-the-best-publicized-conference-yet/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-160938","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"It may well be the best publicized conference yet","post":"Every one knows they picked St. Louis because of the great barbecue joints.\n\n","date":"October 10, 2014 at 9:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/09/it-may-well-be-the-best-publicized-conference-yet/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-161012","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"It may well be the best publicized conference yet","post":"Would that be after one has feasted on the “soda/popcorn daily in (hotel) lobby, 3-10pm daily”?\nhttp://www.stlouisshroudconference.com/updates/recent-post-one\nPersonally, I attend conferences to expand my horizons – not waistline.\n\n","date":"October 10, 2014 at 9:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/09/it-may-well-be-the-best-publicized-conference-yet/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-161022","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"It may well be the best publicized conference yet","post":"It might have something to do with the fact that the sponsors live in St. Louis and Joe Marino once lived in St. Louis.
