[{"title":"Spreading the Word on the St. Louis Conference","post":"NOTE:  There are errors of fact in the quoted text below, that I copied directly from the church bulletin published on e-churchbulletins.com and reported out by Yahoo News, Google, and other search engines. I spoke to John Jackson this morning. He never was a lapsed Catholic, as Mons. Mitas wrote. I’m not sure that what is written about Barrie Schwortz (misspelled by Mons. Mitas) is correct either. I’m sure, as I read, the text, that the parish pastor intended to be laudatory.\n\n","date":"September 30, 2014 at 11:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/30/spreading-the-word-on-the-st-louis-conference/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-158012","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Spreading the Word on the St. Louis Conference","post":"John Jackson has subsequently written to me so that I may post the following:\n“I have been a Catholic man all of my life and am proud to be so.   I, therefore,  do not understand why I was characterized as a “lapsed Catholic” on this blog and personally reject such a characterization.”\nI have removed the factually incorrect text from the second paragraph and inserted ellipsis. I am unable to correct the source document and I would hope that it will be corrected by an official of St Angela Merici Church in Florissant. Otherwise it remains on the Internet, as is. When I read the words of a parish priest in a church bulleting who also writes that he has known John Jackson for several years, I took him at his word and assumed that he knew the facts. Moreover, I am certain he DID NOT mean to sound derogatory. And I don’t think he does.\n\n","date":"September 30, 2014 at 7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/30/spreading-the-word-on-the-st-louis-conference/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-158166","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"}]
