[{"title":"St. Louis Conference News","post":"The papers are timely, the Western world is getting to be more sceptical, belief in God is less, as time passes by, and it is natural that many will slowly begin to look to the TS to try and find some kind of prop for their faith. \nLet us hope the conference brings good news for Shroud researchers, scholars and scientists as there is a lot Turin can do and Professor Barberis is their representative.\nThe Bible, particularly the New Testament and belief in Jesus’ Resurrection is being questioned, not only by people in general but by some biblical scholars as well. These doubts gained impetus with the “Jesus family tomb” film and book, which led to a Princeton Conference in Jerusalem and papers. It is not that the book proclaimed gospel truth, but the debate is heated. Here is my review of the book “The Tomb of Jesus and His Family?”:\n https://www.academia.edu/6932873/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_Parts_I_II_and_III\nThe two previous parts of the article were written and posted a long time ago and there is need to put things in a better perspective in another book.\n\n","date":"May 2, 2014 at 9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-108834","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Conference News","post":"@Louis: I read your essay “God, science and religion” and found the fundamental error advocates of the authenticity of the Holy Shroud make. You referred to the “materialist paradigm of science.” This implies that so-called “materialists” fail at the level of reflective judgment. In other words, materialists are not good at evaluating the evidence against materialism. Materialists fail at the level of intelligence. The only theories they grasp are dualism and materialism. If someone only understands two theories of the mind, you should not treat their drivel with respect.\n\n","date":"May 3, 2014 at 5:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-109634","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Conference News","post":"Good morning, David\nYou have made a link between the “materialist paradigm of science” I mentioned in connection with Jaspers in the article you cited. That was a simple statement, and, yes, it could apply to those in favour of the authenticity of the Shroud, with supernatural production of the image. Recent studies have shown that there are not just “two theories of the mind”, dualism and materialism, as you say, there are many schools and research is being conducted by psychologists, philosophers and scientists.\nSince you insist that gnostics created the Shroud, may I ask which group of gnostics you refer to and what was the intention? The introduction of gnostics in the realm of Shroud studies is not new, as a matter of fact one paper was refuted by me years ago:   \nhttps://www.academia.edu/6568383/Does_the_Shroud_show_a_Mandaean_burial\nMay I suggest a solution to what you wrote about the rejection of the abstract of the paper you intended to present at the Saint Louis conference? I have seen well-known shroudies have their abstracts rejected at Shroud conferences. It has nothing to do with salvation history, both pro- and anti-authenticity papers are presented at such meetings. So why don’t you write a pdf and post it on some Shroud website or publish it somewhere?\n\n","date":"May 3, 2014 at 12:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-109887","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Conference News","post":"My explanation of why the Shroud is not authentic was published by Spero News on Jan. 18, 2008, and is currently on my website (http://www.newevangelization.info). My slideshow is at http:www.holyshroud.info. The relevance of the mind-body problem is that non-believers do not understand it. You should not even talk about the existence of God to such people. You should first explain why the human mind is a mystery. There is no evidence supporting dualism and very little supporting materialism.There is more evidence for idealism than for materialism and dualism.The evidence that Gnostics did it, which ever sect, is that images are always created by humans.  If you think the Shroud is authentic, you should keep it to yourself.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2014 at 12:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-110438","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Conference News","post":"I offered to be a presenter at the conference and submitted an abstract. My application has been rejected. However, I am appealing to the conference’s committee and sponsors to reconsider the decision. History and science are two different methods of inquiry. Asking whether or not Jesus really cured sick people is not a good question because there are no before-and-after medical records. Asking where the Holy Shroud came from is a necessary science question because the Shroud exists. It is an artifact. The best theory is that it was created by Gnostics in the 1st or 2nd century using a crucified victim and methods that have been lost to history. If this theory is not presented at the conference, the committee will be guilty of misrepresenting our salvation history.\n\n","date":"May 2, 2014 at 1:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-108981","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Conference News","post":"Re: Your comment of May 4th, 12.36 AM.

White or Carl Jung know what they are talking about. Metaphysics is a method of inquiry that stands alongside science.  Scientific questions arise from our five senses, and metaphysical questions arise from our ability to make ourselves the subject of our own knowledge. Metaphysics is based on the insight that goodness and unity are properties of being. Finitude, class membership, and changing in time give rise to the concepts of essence/existence, form/matter, and substance/accidents. It is only important to understand metaphysics and to understand that it leads to the existence of a pure act of existence, which the Western religions call God.  Discussing whether or not metaphysics has any truth content or the correctness of metaphysical theorems is like arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. More to the point, it is like arguing whether or not the Shroud of Turin is authentic.  Gnostics thought that Jesus had wisdom and created the Shroud to tell the story of His passion and to have something to venerate.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2014 at 1:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-110884","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"St. Louis Conference News","post":"You should not present at the St. Louis conference.
