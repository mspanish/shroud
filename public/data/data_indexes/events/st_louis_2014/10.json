The oil must be deep, hot (not smoky) and vegetable (not animal).  There are still a few Greek & Croatian takeaways in Wellington, but most have now been taken over by Chinese chefs.  My wife and I have excellently cooked crumbed cod, chips, with seafood oyster sauce once a week, an ideal combination.  An annual competition is held for the best served Fish and Chips among restaurateurs of the genre throughout New Zealand.\n\n","date":"June 11, 2014 at 4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/11/will-the-english-show-up-in-st-louis/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-128584","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Will the English Show Up in St. Louis?","post":"I am a proud kiwi but have to confess that the best fish and chips I have had in recent memory was Golden Union in London last year\n\n","date":"June 12, 2014 at 2:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/11/will-the-english-show-up-in-st-louis/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-128709","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Will the English Show Up in St. Louis?","post":"Dave …  always some strange remarks regarding the British …\n\n","date":"June 15, 2014 at 2:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/11/will-the-english-show-up-in-st-louis/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-129696","author":"PHPL","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Will the English Show Up in St. Louis?","post":"I have forbears from Britain (arrived ~1850), from Ireland via Australia, from Jersey,also from Alsace-Lorraine, from Hesse-Nassau, and one British settler took a Ngapuhi lady to wife.
