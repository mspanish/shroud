[{"title":"Another St. Louis Conference Paper Available","post":"This is a very contentious topic, and I shall look forward to reading the paper in due course.  I hope it becomes available on Barrie’s shroud.com web-site.  At present I’m unaware of Emanuela’s conclusions in her paper.  It seems she is addressing the question of whether the Mandylion was or was not the Shroud.  I note her use of the term ‘mediated’ as the source of the various iconic depictions, to bloodstains seen on the cloth, and to the opposing schools of thought.  I see that she actually attended the St Louis conference, and so she would be aware of other related papers, including those that do not equate the Shroud with the Mandylion.  Time will tell, but I guess we can all expect a fairly bumpy ride over the next few months as the various papers come to light!\n\n","date":"November 3, 2014 at 5:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/another-st-louis-conference-paper-available/","cat":"st_louis_2014","id":"comment-168155","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
