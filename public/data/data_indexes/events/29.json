Dawkins made the same kind of quibble his book “The God Delusion.’ We are losing thousand of Christians by the day. Those who believe that the “gift” of faith is what matters can sniff at them and they, like the Pharisee” in the parable, thank God they are not like others. \nI believe the Shroud is more than an relic or artifact, it is a revelation for our time that as been waiting two millennia for science to reveal its mysteries. In ancient times, some found faith through he preaching St. Paul. In our times, science may in fact be delivering the gift of faith to a faithless age. \nIt is my opinion, it is not sufficient to sit back and tut tut all the faithless when there is at hand a miracle, but a miracle that is being revealed by science. \nThat’s appropriate, because at the very beginning of human history, there was no dividing line between religion and science. The first scientists were the priests. Witness for example the complex, but brutal civilization of Maya’s which practiced human sacrifice. We may abhor their practices, but the same priests who offered-up the sacrifices where the “scientists” who studied the stars and made incredible discoveries and predictions. Some the greatest “scientists” of medieval and Renaissance times were in fact priests and ministers.\nOn my manuscript, I will give Teilhard a go. He was a Jesuit priest who was and anthropologist who foretold a convergence of science and religion. Do I think the Shroud is authentic? Yes. My belief and the Shroud are what we call a positive feed back. The Gospels, much maligned by Dawkins et al demonstrate the authenticity of the Shroud and the Shroud demonstrates the authenticity of the Gospels.\nThe mystery of faith in Catholic Church until the recent, scatter-brained change of it was : Christ has died, Christ has risen; Christ will come again. The Shroud authenticates the first two items, and be in at least a metaphorical or allegorical sense, the fullfilment of the final item.

He completely demolishes the mythology theories, prevalent at the start of the 20th century and prompting Pius X’s condemnation of Modernism. The mythological approach appears to have been behind the efforts of Herbert Thurston and Ulysse Chevalier to discredit the Shroud, as Secondo Pia’s photographs, tended to support the traditional beliefs of the Church. These two gentlemen hoped to take the Church in a different direction, and so conspired to present Bishop D’Arcis’ so-called memorandum to Clement VII in a more persuasive way than could be justified by their improper exercise of scholarship. \n2) The traditional association of religion and science is an interesting one. In primal societies, it is the shaman who has all the arcane wisdom; it is evident in the Pacifica and Maori peoples for example where the schools of learning, including astronomy, navigation and other techical skills were taught by various tohunga with specialist expertise, frequently involving chants to be learnt by rote for the actual practioners. \nIn Ancient Egypt the mathematical and science skills for the various civil works were taught by skilled scribes in their schools, refer Rhind papyrus, copied by scribe Ahmes 1650BCE. In Babylon, however, mathematics and science remained the domain of a priestly caste. The Babylonians were extremely skilled, knowing at least 15 Pythagorean triples 1000 years before the time of Pythagoras, had calculated the square root of 2 to seven decimal places, had developed a base 60 place-holder system with a zero, and which was still used in astronomy up to medieval times until it was supplanted by the Indo-Arab denary system. \nIt was the Jewish exiles’ exposure to Babylonian science which resulted in their supplanting the Genesis anthropic Creation myth of Chapter 2, with the more elevated and scientific approach of Chapter 1. \n3) Pope Francis certainly seems to have the charisma and knows how to touch the hearts of the present age. But yet he is only another Apollos, Paul or Silas. He is not Christ, the person that we see in the image of the Shroud, the evidential sign for our present skeptical age.\n\n","date":"November 13, 2013 at 6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/12/of-enchiladas-listerine-and-dont-mess-with-texas/","cat":"event","id":"comment-51055","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Enchiladas, Listerine and Don’t Mess with Texas","post":"Dave,\nThe depth of our knowledge is truly amazing.

Being ‘insulted’ for being a Christian is going to happen. But leaving yourself wide-open for paint spraying, screaming, belligerent ( and often dangerous) people is inexcusable.

If a Texas Ranger is a deterrent to these maniacs than I thank God for them.  Maybe the organizers would be happier to plan their next seminar at Brown University. Students refused to allow the police chief of NYC to speak, by screaming, throwing garbage and scrawling obscenities, and calling it a ‘victory for free speech everywhere.’  Maybe Dan would feel more comfortable in an environment where anyone could just bust down the door and spray the congregated intelligentsia with gasoline, or a Molotov cocktail?  By the sound of it, there were some definite organizational SNAFUs that turned out to be embarrassing, but providing adequate security was not one of them. We are not scared of firearms in Texas. We believe they should be in the right hands, to protect the innocent from those who would deprive them of their rights to speak and be heard.

I wonder how ‘corny’ Dan would feel if he had to jump behind a Texas lawman with some Christian hating nut coming at him with a knife. We know something in Texas: how many rights to you really have?

For example, our universe from cosmic chaos which suddenly produced an ordered event. I find an allegorical “truth” in the words of opening words of Genesis:\n“GENESIS 1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. 2The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 3And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. 5God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.”\nBefore the Big Bang there was no organization and the principal forms of existence and the laws of physics  evolved in an incredibly brief instant, I have difficulty finding the definition of what existed prior to the Big Bang. I would call it cosmic chaos unless there is already a definition of that which would exclude the state from which a singularity came to be which caused the creation of our universe.\nThe state by definition is timeless but things happened.\n\n","date":"November 13, 2013 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/12/of-enchiladas-listerine-and-dont-mess-with-texas/","cat":"event","id":"comment-51122","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Enchiladas, Listerine and Don’t Mess with Texas","post":"As far as the snake and all that, the ancients were grappling with the innate selfishness of humanity that was at war with the instinct to love.

That power “made us like God” but only a shadow of him. “Let us create man in our own image and likeness.”\nOf course, the most relevant story in Genesis in my humble opinion is the story of Cain and Abel.

The definition of what existed prior to the Big Bang proposed by the priest-scientist Father Georges Lemaitre is a very difficult point There are scientists who say that there were quantums fluctuating in a vacuum and that is because in science nothing comes from nothing. If there was cosmic chaos, where did it come from? So there is no creatio ex nihilo? Is chaos being converted into order and, if so, why is it taking such a long time? Is it as slow as the evolutionary process? A lot of suffering has gone on, be it due to processes relating to physics or to others relating to biology, that is, in the evolutionary process. And what can be said if both physics and biology are linked more deeply?\nThis is a problem in the Judaeo-Christian context, but it is not so in religions that believe in a cyclic process. In Buddhism the ultimate end is nirvana, which is “nothing”. Who can imagine nothingness? What is the meaning of it all? Is it some kind of joke coming from a cosmic magician? Buddha is said to have dodged questions he could not answer posed to him by followers by telling them that they were wasting time with speculation instead of concentrating on how to get out of the karmic ladder. It is a negative soteriology, with no room for a deity. True Buddhism can only be practiced in a monastery and even that can be difficult. We have had Rupert Murdoch accusing the Dalai Lama of being a shrewd politician, walking around wearing Gucci shoes. Is Richard Gere truly a Buddhist? He can only be believed if he gives away his millions. As Jesus said, “Where is your treasure, there is your heart also.”\nI take comfort in the fact that Christianity is not the religion of the book, it is the religion of the person, and that person is Jesus.
