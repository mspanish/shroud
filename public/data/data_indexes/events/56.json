A Mechanical Response Tissue Analyzer (MRTA), one of only a limited number of such machines in the world, will be used to gauge the stiffness of the arm and leg bones as the experiment progresses. The MRTA is loaded with software and algorithms specifically designed for this study. This machine painlessly measures the entire tibia or ulna using vibrations and sensors. The shape of a bone may be subject to change through the exercise training, and the reorganization of the bone matrix affects its overall strength. Participants will also have bone density and lean/fat mass measured by a DXA machine, a high-tech body scanner.  …\nLink :\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2000-08/VT-VTtw-0808100.php\n\n","date":"February 28, 2014 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/28/if-you-will-be-in-and-around-el-paso-on-march-8/","cat":"event","id":"comment-83437","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"If you will be in and around El Paso on March 8","post":"Here the last address found about\nthe mechanical response tissue analyzer :\nhttp://www.springerimages.com/Images/LifeSciences/1-10.1007_s00421-005-1351-2-1\n\n","date":"February 28, 2014 at 11:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/28/if-you-will-be-in-and-around-el-paso-on-march-8/","cat":"event","id":"comment-83440","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"}]
