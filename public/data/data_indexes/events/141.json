Would you like to explain why you think it? It may be that Cesare Nosiglia was never a Monsignor as such, as it seems to be a normal way of describing any bishop in some languages, whether he was previously a monsignor or not, but if he was, I do not think that the honorific lapses just because of one’s elevation to episcopacy.\n\n","date":"April 19, 2015 at 11:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/19/the-shroud-of-turin-exposition-on-social-media/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-196835","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin Exposition on Social Media","post":"Andy, look at the Monsignor bishop’s official page on the diocesan website at http://www.diocesitorino.it/diocesi_di_torino/arcivescovo/00024135_Arcivescovo.html.
