[{"title":"The Official Site Wants You to Come to the Exhibition in 2010","post":"If you translate the current Italian language web page into English you will find, among other notices about the 2015 Exposition, the following statement:  \nReservations\nAt the moment you can not book any pilgrimage to the exposition in 2015. Reservations will be carried out, however, from this site, http://www.sindone.org . All information will be soon available on the net.\nIn 2010 the reservation system went online about 9 months before the exposition. It is obvious they have not yet updated the page completely.
