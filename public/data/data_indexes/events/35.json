As there is not the slightest piece of evidence that any of the jealously guarded relics in the imperial palace were transferred outside the palace, surely it is futile to speculate why such a transfer might have taken place. Let’s just accept the de Clari saw a cloth with perhaps only a single image of Christ on it (cf. the Besancon Shroud) in the Shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary, theotokos in the Orthodox tradition, in the Blachernae district of Constantinople. There is absolutely no reason to link it with any relic in the imperial collection.\nCharles, it is futile only for the convinced sceptics. There is one very valid reason why the shroud might have left his well guarded home at Bucoleon: the newly installed by the crusaders young emperor Alexios IV. Here is the translation of the key paragraph from my article:\nAnd then the shroud with image of Christ appears in Blachernae. In the same temple, where Byzantines in the year 860 were praying before the veil of Virgin Mary for the repulse of the Rus. Now, every Friday there is raised (Robert de Clari literally writes that it “raises”) a shroud with a visible figure of Christ – that is, someone greater than even the Mother of God. Had this show been performed there for a long time? Nothing indicates that, although it is known that during the Kommen period emperors started to prefer Blachernae Palace instead of the Great Palace, or the Bucoleon Palace. But in 1203 Constantinople, everything was possible. For example, that Alexios exhibited previosuly carefully hidden from the eyes of the common people burial linens; to calm down the people and convince them about divine support for his rule. The same people who could at any moment throw him out of throne -which eventually happened.\n\n","date":"June 3, 2014 at 11:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/01/program-and-presenters-for-the-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference/","cat":"event","id":"comment-126519","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Program and Presenters for the St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference","post":"Sorry,OK ,nothing that would convince a historian.

He is not an expert, is an author of popular books based on secondary sources. A sort of populariser. So, he read this false statement about Kallistos in a book of sindonology, he did not check any primary source and just copied it. O.K read the book of Centini and copied it. And so on, from one to another book, without end. As I have just written, I found this error the first time in a book of sindonology in 1910 and now we, in 2014, are still here at the same point. 2) My 99% comes from my experience, because I have read several hundred books and articles about Shroud, and 99% are written with the same technique: repetition, recopying and guessing. 3) You ask me if I have any primary source. Obviously yes. But your question is misleading. OK wrote a statement based on a byzantine source, I asked the source and he admitted that never saw the source. You must ask him or Centini the source, not me. I am not the author of the statement. 4) My problem is not O.K. or Centini or any other person, is all the method sinonologists use 5) “Gibberish” means “unintelligible or meaningless language”. But my language is very intelligible: if you are not able to read a language, do not speak about this language. If you are not able to find a document, do not quote that document. If you have not seen it, do not speak about it. Very clear. Not gibberish, nor ad hominem attack. A simple rule of historical method. Rule number one. If you want to learn German, and your teacher does not speak German, you can tell him that if the wants to be a teacher of German, he must know German. It is not gibberish, nor ad hominem attack.

Also the page you linked (https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/burial-linens-of-constantinople.pdf) is constructed with the same method, without serious quotations, without checking the texts, without any knowledge of the scientifical literature. Sindonologists and internet are the only source for you, it seems. The few texts quoted in Greek and Latin sometimes are wrong, sometimes the translation does not correspond to the original. It seems that you have no idea about this matter. And also, there is lack of critical approach to the texts. It seems that you are like me, if I try to write a paper on astrophysics….  obviously, all people sometimes is wrong, and I am too… but this is not question of oversights…\nAt the end, you can do what you want, but when I see that this is the normal standard for sindonologists, in the last century, I can say and repeat that 99% of sindonology is detrimental.\nP.S. what Kallistos said is not so important, because if we have not other earlier sources, his statements about what Pulcheria did nine centuries before are very questionable\n\n","date":"June 5, 2014 at 4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/01/program-and-presenters-for-the-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference/","cat":"event","id":"comment-127113","author":"Andrea Nicolotti","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Program and Presenters for the St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference","post":"Thanks, Andrea.

And I am not saying that you DELIBERATELY falsifies the texts. It is not question of volition. The “critical analysys” of historical sources is not something you can “try” to do. It is the result of long academical studies and practice, everyday. If we (historians, philologians) exist, there is a reason, or not? Or if we have not reason to exist, and all people can do what we do with succes, this could be applied also to ALL professions: doctors, engineers, physicists, chemists …\n2) Yes, I refer to your paper.

Because I am a little brusque, and English is not my language, nor my preferred language. But if you want to believe me, I assure you that I am a very peaceful and understanding.. not on blogs, perhaps. But prejudiced, NEVER. What I say is not fruit of prejudice, is fruit of years passed studying and reading sindonological literature. I am post-judiced, not pre-juidiced.
