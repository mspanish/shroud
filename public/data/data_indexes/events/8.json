Perhaps he is the right person to tell “Shroudies” how to make rules in the Shroud media. A lot of improvement is needed to make Rome budge and I do think that Pope Francis’ attitude at the Exposition can also be interpreted as meaning that “Shroudies” havê fallen short of the mark.\nPeople at Rome and Turin do read what is being saíd in the Shroud media. Improvements can lead to minds being changed, perhaps some doors will even be thrown open.If that happens there will be many concrete things to say at any new conference in Saint Louis.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2015 at 9:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/another-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference-in-2018/","cat":"conference","id":"comment-208489","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference in 2018?","post":"I think you have it right, Louis.\n\n","date":"August 23, 2015 at 2:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/another-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference-in-2018/","cat":"conference","id":"comment-208797","author":"Dcn Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference in 2018?","post":"Andy, I spent many years in school and college studying with Jesuits, American, German and five other nationalities. One strong experience came through learning with German Jesuit priests and lay brothers, very tough World War II veterans, who knew what was discipline and sense of mission, and could be very exacting.\nPope Francis is a Jesuit, and tougher than his Bavarian predecessor.\nHe has sent an indirect message to Shroudies, having ignored the petition.\nBoth Rome and Turin read what is being said in the Shroud media. Either things change now or never. There is no point in having Saint Louis 2018 with rehashed material.\n\n","date":"August 23, 2015 at 3:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/another-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference-in-2018/","cat":"conference","id":"comment-208803","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
