[{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"I will continue to assert that Dawkins is merely an adequate academic, not a brilliant one by any stretch of the imagination.  He has latched on to this money maker of an idea and has become the champion of a rhetoric that has little value.  He is no fool though, and knows which side his bread is buttered on.  If he continues to debate truly brilliant minds he will lose the most significant part of his income, and that’s all there is to that.  Still, I pray for the guy every day, and so should we all.\n\n","date":"March 31, 2012 at 7:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","id":"comment-9815","author":"Susana","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"OMG faith is on the march. “God Delusion” was full of rhetorical tricks that passed as reasoned analysis. For example:\n:\n“It is even possible to mount a serious, though not widely supported, historical case that Jesus never lived at all, as has been done by, among others, Professor G. A. Wells of the University of London in a number of books, including Did Jesus Exist?\n“Although Jesus probably” existed, reputable biblical scholars do not in general regard the New Testament (and obviously not the Old Testament) as a reliable record of what actually happened in history, and I shall not consider the Bible further as evidence for any kind of deity.”  \nNotice that there is no logical flow to this at all, only the slick spiel of a used car salesman.\nHis use of “probably” to modify existed means that there is doubt and he then jumps to a complete rejection of  the Bible as any kind of deity. Why the tortured logic and why the increasing cowardice to confrontation? I have a simple suggestion: the Shroud of Turin. At the very least Shroud science removes doubt about the existence of Jesus Christ.\nThe science of the the Shroud is finally recovering from the flawed carbon dating analysis. Atheists like Dawkins are now in a bind. Given the fact that there are resources now to debunk the carbon dating available universally on the Internet, it’s impossible for them to assume a dismissive air.\nThe issue of the Shroud’s authenticity is now again on the table. Some have called the Shroud the Fifth Gospel. It’s that and more. It is a Revelation. It is the resurrection of the Resurrection. Courtesy of Science, it is a second coming in the information age.\nHappy Easter.\n\n","date":"March 31, 2012 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","id":"comment-9816","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"I am in almost total agreement with the last two comments.

To this she smiled and answered quite calmly and emphatically,while looking him straight in the eye,she said,I AM a prayer”.\nShe went on to explain in greater detail,but the gest of what she wanted to convey,was how everything we do,whether it’s housework,garden work,what have you,,,also becomes a prayer when done in the right spirit and offered to God.Yes,Susanna,I agree,that we should pray for Richard Dawkins whatever form our prayers should take.\n\n","date":"March 31, 2012 at 11:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","id":"comment-9823","author":"john","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"Read this, please: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/20/richard-dawkins-william-lane-craig .\nDo you support Mr. Craig’s fundamentalism?

Nor do I support Craig’s assertion that Dawkins, as an Atheist, has no basis for objective moral judgment. And I do not support Dawkin’s fundamentalism of another kind, either (I subscribe to McGrath’s views on this). Craig’s fundamentalism is not the point. \nHitchens, Harris and many other Atheists of high moral character were well aware of Craig’s somewhat strange views on a specific biblical moral  dilemma. Were they less honorable for debating Craig? Were not fellow Atheists urging Dawkins to debate Craig? Could he have not used the issue of the Canaanite slaughter in debate? Of course. \nShould all people who debate others first consider their views on moral issues? Perhaps a scale of acceptability is needed. Should Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury,  perhaps not have debated Dawkins because of his Atheism or his beliefs about Christianity? Has not Dawkins said that raising children as Christians was a form of child abuse?\nThe real point about the fist part of the posting was not about Craig’s views regarding the Canaanite slaughter as wrong. It was about the silly excuses that Dawkins gave, particularly the one in which he said he would not debate “a religious person less senior than a cardinal or a bishop.” He wasn’t standing on principle. He was standing on a self-made pedestal of arrogance.\n\n","date":"April 1, 2012 at 5:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","id":"comment-9834","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"I think Dawkins has anointed himself as the “Atheist Pope.” The jacket for God Delusion modestly described Dawkins as “the world’s most prominent atheist.” “The world numbers about eight billion individuals and climbing. What a terrible burden it is for Dawkins to be the foremost atheist among the eight billion.\nThat being said, when it comes to the slaughter of innocents in Canaan, I tend to agree with Dawkins that this was inexcusable barbarity. I remember watching a History Channel program on ancient generals two  or three years ago which recorded Joshua’s slaughter of women and children in Jericho after “the walls came tumbling down.” I was appalled. When I discovered that Joshua was acting on a divine command, I decided that I could not worship such a God. I was deeply saddened when a Jewish friend of mine gave the human reasoning behind that. Leaving the women and children alive would have resulted in the leaving the seeds of idolatry to blossom and grow. That came to mind a year or so later, when on another History (or Military Channel rebroadcast) I heard a Himmler speech to the German Generals as the WWII ground to its close and the Third Reich was collapsing. “We had to kill the children,” he said, “because they would grow-up to seek revenge upom us killing their parents.”\nMuch of  Bible is rationalization for human endeavors. Of course, that argues against it not being history. Some of its history is sad. \nBut I highly recommend the direction of religions which is the basis of Richard Wright’s “The Evolution of God.” Jesus challenged the Pharisees” “What do you think of the Messiah [Christ}, whose son is he?” Wright is somewhat dismissive of the universality of Jesus message adopting the “Paul did it view.” But I think the last paragraph of his book sums up not only the direction of religious thought, but of Christianity itself:\n“Though we can no more conceive of God than we can conceive of an electron, believers can ascribe properties to God, somewhat as physicists ascribe properties to electrons. One of the more plausible such properties is love. And maybe, in this light, the argument for God is strengthened by love’s organic association with truth—by the fact, indeed, that at times these two properties almost blend into one. You might say that love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake, and that by partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine. Then again, you might not say that. The point is just you wouldn’t have to be crazy to say it.” *\nAmen, Mr. Wright, amen.\n*(Wright, Robert (2009-05-20). The Evolution of God . Little, Brown and Company)\n\n","date":"April 1, 2012 at 7:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","id":"comment-9835","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"“When I discovered that Joshua was acting on a divine command, I decided that I could not worship such a God.”\nAs people of faith, we accept that God is infinitely more intelligent, wiser, more just and more trustworthy than any human.  Yes, there are times when what He does escapes our logic and we may even shake our fist at him.  I have.  But only for a moment.  Then we remind ourselves that we trust Him with all our heart and soul.  We have to believe that His reasoning is far superior to ours and encompasses knowledge that we don’t possess.  \nI have also struggled with that passage, and many others (from my 21st century sensibilities, I can’t even stand the passages about animal sacrifice), but then I remind myself that I firmly believe that God not only has all the attributes that I just listed, but I also believe that He exists in the eternal present and has knowledge of what has happened and what will happen at any point in history.  As such, I believe His decisions are always wise and correct, though I may not understand them or agree with them.\nAnother aspect of this we have to remember as people of faith is that we are not to put so much stock in this earthly life.  We get all tied up in a knot because people lost their lives and normally we would do anything to preserve life, but according to God’s plan as I understand it, this is not the life we’re supposed to value.  Just because many innocents died that day, it doesn’t mean they were obliterated.  I trust in a God of infinite justice who will ultimately save all the innocents who have died to this life, throughout history.  They will have eternal life.\nIt’s like I said; you can choose to believe or not believe, you can choose to trust or not to trust, but if you do believe, and if you do trust, then believe and trust wholeheartedly.  Trust that God knows what He’s doing.  Dawkins wouldn’t understand that because he doesn’t believe in God, but those of us who do can’t resort to the same kind of materialistic reasoning that Dawkins uses.  If we do that, then really, what’s the difference between us?\n\n","date":"April 1, 2012 at 3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","id":"comment-9838","author":"Susana","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"Susana,\nI think you and I would have a profound agreement on the two issues that concern this blog: (1) the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ and (2) It offers some proof of his Resurrection.\nAs to the rest, many theologians, both Catholic and Protestant have views on scripture that may differ from you and me. St. John wrote that God is love and that is good enough for me. The generation before Christ, Rabbi Hillel was challenged by a gentile that he were convert to Judaism if Hillel could teach him all he needed to know about the Torah in the time Hillel could stand on one leg. Hillel replied: “Do not do unto others that which is distasteful to yourself.  All the rest is commentary.” That was a very controversial statement by Hillel. His rivals claimed that there were 613 commandments of God, each one of which had to be obeyed to the letter, all were equally important.\nChrist was challenged by one of those who sought to trap Him by asking him “Which was the greatest commandment?” He replied (in words from the Torah) “to love God with your whole heart, mind and soul.” and then continued: “And the second is like unto this: To love your neighbor as yourself. Upon these two is are based all the law and the prophets.” In the parable of the Last Judgment (parable is Pope Benedict’s word) Christ tells us that the only measure is what we do for the least of God’s brethern.” It’s the one commandment of love.\nThat’s a pretty big agenda right there. I believe that Science is not only proving the authenticity of the Shroud, but through quantum mechanics we are seeing the reality of love. I am sure that  to some that may appear to be out there. But to me it’s in here. We are on the verge of a new Revelation through Science. \nFor those who have no interest of such, God Bless.\n\n","date":"April 1, 2012 at 5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","id":"comment-9839","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins","post":"Susana, you said; ” this is not the life we’re supposed to value.
