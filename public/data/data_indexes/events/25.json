[{"title":"Meet me in Saint Louie, Louie. Meet me at the fair.","post":"Dan,\nI’m glad you’ve seen the light on this. I have never met Mark Anatonocci but I heard reports about his conduct at Jumper’s Notre Dame seminar that were quite disturbing in that he hectored Jumper who was had in fact retracted his previous acceptance of the C14 results. The reason Jumper  now accepted authenticity as reported to me was the work of Ray Rogers. That apparently was anathema to Antonocci.\nConfession: I am a 50% Rogers fan and have problem with him his work on image formation. But nobody has solved image formation yet although there are many theories. The ability to produce an image using modern techniques doesn’t decide the issue of what happened in that carved rock tomb 1,983 years ago.\nI may be a newcomer, but that my way or the high way attitude towards individuals seeking he same truth but by a different path in the Shroud community is more than unacceptable, it’s boorish.\nThat being said, I’d be interested in what he has to say. I’d even be interested in the what Colin Berry would have to say.\nThe only caution to the more strident (and I have been that occasion): If you’re going to give it, you have to take it.\n\n","date":"October 27, 2013 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/27/meet-me-in-saint-louie-louie-meet-me-at-the-fair/","cat":"event","id":"comment-48880","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Meet me in Saint Louie, Louie.
