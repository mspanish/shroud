[{"title":"Battle of the Chemists","post":"“It compares McCrone’s findings and methodology with that of Heller and Adler.”\nNo it doesn’t.\nIt gives a masterly summary of Heller and Adler’s work, findings and conclusions. It barely mentions McCrone, gives no indication whatever of his methodology and only the barest summary of his findings. It is emphatically not a comparison. It is a curt dismissal. As such, it does not demonstrate where McCrone went wrong, which would have been helpful, and demonstrates an unscientific partiality.\nFor instance, McCrone examined 10 more slides than Heller and Adler, and found red ochre adhering to fibres on 18 of them, all those which corresponded to image or blood areas, and none on non-image areas. He illustrates his findings on page 105 of ‘Judgment Day for the Turin Shroud.’ This was the foundation of his ‘painting’ hypothesis.\nWell, did he or didn’t he? Are the photos falsified fabrications? Are all those red particles not iron oxide at all? If they are related to the retting procedure, they would be found on non-image as well as image fibres, and if they are related to the blood, they would be found on blood areas but not image areas.\nMcCrone may have been completely wrong, and he was certainly somewhat abrasive, but simply to ignore his work does not enhance the credibility of authenticist commenters.\n\n","date":"October 29, 2015 at 10:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/29/battle-of-the-chemists/","cat":"presentation","id":"comment-213827","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Battle of the Chemists","post":"I suspect that perhaps Heller, Adler and other scientists who had studied the Shroud, came to a conclusion that McCrone’s work lacked credibility because he only ever relied on his overly self-confident knowledge of microscopy, seemingly shunning other more recent methods of analysis such as spectrography.  In one reported interview when asked why he thought that red ochre was present, he fundamentally attributed the conclusion to his own experience of microscopy, virtually saying “Because I said so”.

The methodology I mentioned in the PPT slides is primarily related to how McCrone analyzed the particles on the mylar tape without removing them from the tape.  McCrone only found particles that were birefringent–two indexes of refraction indicated the substance was iron oxide.  Adler and Heller removed all the particles from the tape fearing the tape would interfere.  They found both blood which is non-birefringent and they also found  iron oxide.  Why didn’t McCrone find the blood that Heller and Adler found?  Because he was sloppy in his methodology.  My contention therefore is that Heller and Adler used a much more careful approach resulting in more accurate data.\n\n","date":"October 29, 2015 at 9:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/29/battle-of-the-chemists/","cat":"presentation","id":"comment-213877","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"}]
