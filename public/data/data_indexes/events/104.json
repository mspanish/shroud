[{"title":"Russ Breault to Speak at First Baptist Church of Matthews","post":"Cool, but that’s a long drive from New Mexico.  I would love to be able to hear Russ make his presentation some time.  But we will be in Silver City, NM on Sept 29th where Deacon Pete Schumacher will be giving a talk on New Mexico History and the Shroud since many of the STURP researchers came from this state and we are celebrating our centenary as a state.  Anyone who is out West may want to check out ShroudNM.com for more information.\n\n","date":"September 9, 2012 at 9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/09/russ-breault-to-speak-at-first-baptist-church-of-matthews/","cat":"event","id":"comment-16056","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Russ Breault to Speak at First Baptist Church of Matthews","post":"Sorry for you, Andy, but I’m saying “Yahoo!

They’re not making money on it, just covering the costs of getting Russ Breault to the church.  No advance ticket sales to put on credit card or such, so just get there if you’re close by!  It’s a two-hour presentation, btw.  You can talk to David Witz by calling the number for the church.\nI’m so happy, I have the giggles!\n\n","date":"September 10, 2012 at 11:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/09/russ-breault-to-speak-at-first-baptist-church-of-matthews/","cat":"event","id":"comment-16102","author":"Sheila","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Russ Breault to Speak at First Baptist Church of Matthews","post":"Congratulations Sheila.
