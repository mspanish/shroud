[{"title":"The Wabash Museum of the Holy Shroud","post":"To all you Shroudies out there, it would be worth your effort to visit Richard’s museum in Wabash.   The building it is housed in is of a ‘grand’ design and the artifacts on display are as vast in number as they are unique in the world of Sindonology.  With the Honeywell Golf Course next door, a warm weather trip would enable you to get in a quick round while at the same time immersing yourself with Richard’s very extensive Shroud collection.  Do yourself a favor.  You WON’T be disappointed!\n\n","date":"January 1, 2015 at 10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/the-wabash-museum-of-the-holy-shroud/","cat":"exhibition","id":"comment-180550","author":"David O.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Wabash Museum of the Holy Shroud","post":"You can also visit Richard’s website at http://www.museumoftheholyshroud.net/index.htm and see photos of many of the items on display at the museum.\n\n","date":"January 2, 2015 at 2:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/the-wabash-museum-of-the-holy-shroud/","cat":"exhibition","id":"comment-180817","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"}]
