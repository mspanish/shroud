So, just take my comment as a friendly advice.  Noticed that I used the words “I hope you will” and not something like “You must”…  Hope you will take good note of this comment and, why not, I suggest you to read again my paper about the bloodstains evidence in which I describe the 4 scenarios that, in the light of all the data we know about the Shroud, can still be possible to explain this relic (link: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf).\nHave a nice trip and I hope there will be alot of people at your lectures.\n\n","date":"March 6, 2014 at 5:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/06/russ-breault-on-the-road-again/","cat":"event","id":"comment-85631","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Russ Breault on the Road Again","post":"Thanks Yannick!
