As others have commented, it is the collective evidence that I find the most convincing, but if I had to choose one in particular, it would involve the bloodstains.  Particularly the details-I am unsure that a medieval artist would have the foresight to include everything to be analyzed by scientists 700 years or so in the future.  For example, why not just use the blood of an animal, who would know the difference?  The serum halo rings on the wrist & side wounds, visible under uv light, how does an artist effectively create these using clotted blood? or how could they anticipate their detection, if added around the edges at a separate time, after “painting” the bloodstains?  The directional flow of the blood, such as off of the elbow and the back of the foot (which aligns with a blood mark of similar size & shape next to the foot on the front side).  Together, details such as these help to convince me that the cloth once wrapped a human body.  I am not entirely convinced that it was Jesus’ body, although I think that it probably was. For me, I still keep open the possibility that it could have been artificially created-although I am unsure exactly how.\n\n","date":"January 4, 2014 at 11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/04/what-one-single-characteristic-about-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-72183","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What one single characteristic about the shroud  . . . ?","post":"My number one reason is the extreme superficiality of the image effecting only the top two microfibers or approximately 1% of a single thread.

The peace that is present on that face, despite the most humiliating tortures the man who was buried in the Shroud endured. This convinces me that it’s Jesus Christ.\nThe real reasons: what everyone else has said. How can this be a product of human artifice? Who did it? Why don’t more examples of this kind of artwork exist? How could the image be superficial and not penetrate the fibrils? Why is it a negative?\nAlso, this will probably cause some ridicule(I hope Joe Nickell isn’t reading this!), but I’m convinced that the Shroud is authentic even if it does come from the 14th century. As someone who comes from the Catholic tradition, I believe that the one Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross is made present daily on the altars of the Catholic Church,the  Orthodox Church, and every ecclesial communion with a valid priesthood. As such, I do believe that a miracle could have occurred in the Middle Ages that made the miraculous image of Christ appear on a cloth through some divine intervention. Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich does talk about miraculous, not made by hand copies of the Shroud being created in the Middle Ages through some paranormal occurrence. I believe it’s much more likely that this is the Shroud that wrapped Christ in the tomb, but the medieval date doesn’t mean it didn’t come from the Hand of God, at least for me. \n“Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.”-Revelation 5:12\n\n","date":"January 4, 2014 at 7:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/04/what-one-single-characteristic-about-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-72222","author":"Chesterbelloc","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What one single characteristic about the shroud  . . . ?","post":"life on earth whose beginning is a mystery and is explained as happening  over millions of years but  cannot be replicated today, The shroud was made over a period of three days but still can not be cannot be duplicated today.

His back shows the beating by the Romans, but it also shows that He bore the Cross for some period of time across his shoulders and his knee shows that the Cross was much to bear in His weakened state. Small details that I don’t think you’d fake.\nAnd all this sits somewhat superficially on the top most fibers of the Shroud. \nI believe when you look at the Shroud, you are looking at the image of Christ at the moment of His Resurrection.
