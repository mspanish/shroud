[{"title":"Interpretive Literalism","post":"I also believe that the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years old and yes that is consistent with scripture because the word for day used in genesis is YOM which could mean day or period of time. This is why knowing the bible in English just isn’t good enoigh to fully understand the context and full meaning of some parts of the bible.\nAs as man evolving , I’m not convinced of that. I just don’t see it in the transitional chart.\nI believe information was either front loaded or added at certain time intervals by God, but then again we will probably never have the full answers.
