How can people accept a ‘single’ 14C test as being ‘conclusive’ evidence? Do people not understand 14C testing? …from the very type of ‘same’ comments made by the likes of Cranky Catholic and many, many others…I would answer that, most emphatically, as NO!\nI think people have been ‘duped’ in the promise of radiocarbon dating and it’s relevance to ‘PROOF’ of anything.\nThe conclusions reached in 1988 by the people involved in the 14C dating and of it’s conclusive evidence was a STRAIGHTOUT LIE! and misconception…and they knew it. But a gullible world accepted it freely and still do.\nIt’s a shame really.\nRon\n\n","date":"March 29, 2012 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/29/the-cranky-catholic-this-shrouded-season/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9770","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
