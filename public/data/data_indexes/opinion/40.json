[{"title":"Does Pope Francis Believe the Shroud is Real?","post":"I believe that the statement has also been made by his predecessors that the question of authenticity is not a matter of faith but science. \nI believe, and I don’t want to start the debate all over, that science has demonstrated its authenticity. Some may disagree. That debate on this blog has been endless.\nBut if you can accept the authenticity there is a deeper question: What is the meaning of its image and blood? \nThe word “icon” has more than one meaning and does not necessarily in its mean a work of art.\nHere’s one multiple definition from the web:\nnoun\n1.a. an image; figure; representation\n    b, any of various stylized figures, as displayed on a microcomputer screen, representing available functions or resources\n2. EASTERN ORTHODOX CH. an image or picture of Jesus, Mary, a saint, etc., venerated as sacred\n3, any person or thing that is revered\n4. someone or something regarded as embodying the essential characteristics of an era, group, etc.\nhttp://www.yourdictionary.com/icon\nI think it is fair to say that calling something an “icon” does not necessarily mean it is an artistic representation. Take the numbers “3” and  “4” meaning\nFor example:\nAlec Guinness is an icon of movie comedy\nLaurence Olivier is an icon of acting\nChrist is an icon of personal sacrifice\nChrist is an icon of love.\nEach of those statements is fair and depending on your view, all  may be true.\n\n","date":"August 12, 2015 at 5:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/12/does-pope-francis-believe-the-shroud-is-real/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-208031","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Does Pope Francis Believe the Shroud is Real?","post":"I agree with John!\nAnd I’m always a bit suspicious of those who attribute beliefs to an institution.

Or was it both a spiritual and physical act?  [Yes]. In other words, it was necessary that His blood had also to be physically spilled.  \nBecause His sacrifice extends from the Cross infinitely in both directions, Past and Future, the Blood on the Shroud has special significance.

It is true of the Amazon hunter, the college undergraduate, the doctoral specialist, and for the great many of humankind.  It is true for each one of us as we make our own journey through life, from infancy, through childhood, the time when we are know-all teenagers, through to adult life and into our senior years.  At first we are served milk and only later can we manage meat and potatoes. \nIt is certainly true in matters of religion.  It was true for the ancient Israelites journeying through the desert, for the primal Christian community, and through the subsequent years of history, but often with diversions into error or unjustified dogmatism.  We are all at different places in our journey towards God.  Those working in the mission fields understand this, and they know that God’s truth must be presented in a way that their target culture can understand and accept the realities which are only dimly perceived, otherwise they are wasting their time even trying. \nFor many, specific relics, tokens and cultural practices are their way of coming to know God, and of worshiping the One who is ineffable.  \nThe “Vatican” does not need to give its imprimatur to this relic or that.  It is generally sufficient for an alleged relic to have a reasonable record of provenance.  Certain icons have been hallowed by centuries, or even millenia, of veneration by a countless number of faithful worshippers.  Others more recent can uplift by presenting a fresh insight.  Doubtless some alleged Passion relics may be of dubious authenticity.  Their value is in what is called to mind by their particular form rather than by their substance.  For those relics that are truly genuine, they must be considered especially sanctified by their contact with the truly holy.   \nWe are not angels of pure spirit but are of flesh and blood, and have a need to understand things in terms of a material reality, in order to reach a higher truth.\n\n","date":"August 12, 2015 at 8:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/12/does-pope-francis-believe-the-shroud-is-real/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-208110","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Does Pope Francis Believe the Shroud is Real?","post":"What is the meaning of relics without\nthe study of the inherent miracles?\nHere what I have read:\n>One of the many beautiful gifts of Medjugorje,\nstanding a few yards behind St. James Church,\nis a statue of the crucified Christ, which has been\nexuding a special oil from its right knee,\ncontinuously for many years now.\n>Healings have been attributed to this oil…\nLink:\nhttp://www.ministryvalues.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1475&Itemid=99999999\n— —\nBut I think that the important need of serious\nscientific controls is still dimly perceived…\nB.T.W.:\nHave you studied the following argument:\n“Cult and Theft of Relics in the Middle Ages” ?\n\n","date":"August 13, 2015 at 3:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/12/does-pope-francis-believe-the-shroud-is-real/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-208131","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Does Pope Francis Believe the Shroud is Real?","post":"Miracles and wonders are not the essence of religion, they are merely signs of a spiritual force.
