[{"title":"Apollonius of Tyana:  Proof or Doom for Christianity?","post":"Yeah right, And I am the queen of England. Dan you made me laugh. Even Dan Brown made more sense than this. So apparently the proof is in comparing the faces of Apollonius and the man in the shroud. There is a funny comparison on the website between the Vignon markings and the face of Apollonius. The numbers are placed on the statue but I can’t see any similarities, anyone can put numbers on a face but does it proove anything? And apparently this Apollonius lived to be a 100 years old, does the Man in the shroud look that old? I know the hair and beard are white but that’s because they were close to the cloth not because they were really white.\n\n","date":"February 27, 2014 at 7:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/27/apollonius-of-tyana-proof-or-doom-for-christianity/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-83021","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Apollonius of Tyana:  Proof or Doom for Christianity?","post":"In these types of facial comparisons, an irrelevant control image is typically absent, i.e. a negative control.  For example, how well would a bust of Abe Lincoln match up?  A similar morphing into the Shroud image? or even between Abe & Appollonius?  Or Tom Hanks (Castaway mode)?\n\n","date":"February 27, 2014 at 7:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/27/apollonius-of-tyana-proof-or-doom-for-christianity/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-83023","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Apollonius of Tyana:  Proof or Doom for Christianity?","post":"Kelly, you are right. But even if the faces match, that doesn’t prove anything. does the shroud belong to the actor who played Jesus in one of the movies portraying his life. A lot of people look like this.

I’m not getting this one… Is the theory that Apollonius of Tyana  migrated to Jerusalem when he was a relatively young man, become badly scourged, crowned with thorns, crucified, speared, buried in a (Jewish) linen cloth, and then somehow rise again to live a ripe old age of 100?  That could have converted the world, then and now!
