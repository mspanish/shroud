[{"title":"More on Political Pistachio: Some Scientists Claim Shroud of Turin is Authentic","post":"Hummm, after reading so many theories, I think I am going to put forward a theory by myself also. To be succesful it must involve Templars, middle age sects and unknown mysteries…….I will use some of Scavone’s, Ian Wilson’s theories and….. Google Earth.\nYou can connect Lirey in France (where the Shroud once was) , Athens (when Scavone says it also once was) and Jerusalem (where for sure it was once)  with a straight line of 3200 km with an error of approximately 60 km (5%) on both sides of the line to effectively touch Lirey, Athens and Jerusalem. Furthermore, the distance betwen Lirey and AThens (1975 km) follows the aurean proportion since 3200/1975=1.62. Just the same proportion than the ratio  (Lirey_Athens)/ (Athens-Jerusalem distance)=1.62.\nEverybody can check it by himself on Google Earth!. No lie. It cannot be by chance!. The golden number, the Shroud and if I incorporate the templars……….it could make a good best-seller for next Easter! :-))\n\n","date":"December 31, 2011 at 3:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/31/more-on-political-pistachio-some-scientists-claim-shroud-of-turin-is-authentic/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-6379","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"}]
