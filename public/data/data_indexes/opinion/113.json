There do appear to be places where the blood has worn off, and the colour of the shroud in those places is not noticeably paler than adjacent non-blood areas, imaged or not. Early examination suggested that the image was formed by corrosion of the upper surfaces of fibres, and that no corrosion was observed under the bloodstains. This might be compelling if it was quantified, and the places where the various corroded/non-corroded fibres were taken from was clear, or even if clear comparison photographs were available. I have not seen any such evidence myself. Later, it was suggested that the image was not formed on the fibres of the shroud at all, but on an impurity layer which covered the whole shroud.

Although all the names appearing there were common in 1st century Palestine, I consider that the fact that all the names may be associated with one specific family are highly significant, despite arguments to the contrary and denials by the I.A.A.

We might easily guess as to the reason for the carpal bone.  The linen fragments might have come from the TS, or else from some other cloth used as part of the burial. As to other outrageous claims made particularly by Jacobovici, they may be dismissed as absurd, and of a Dan Brown character. It will never be known if Talpiot was the Jesus family tomb or not, because all the material found in the ossuaries were buried in a common grave, and the ossuaries cleaned, in accordance with the lack of any scientific interest in possibly early Christian sites, typical of the I.A.A.\nMme Claude cites J P Meier’s “Marginal Jew” in discussing the paternity of Jesus, but Meier clearly dismisses the allegation of bastardy as a 2nd century myth invented by those hostile to Christianity. \nWhatever Talpiot is, it has to be no later than 70 AD, when the Jewish practice of placing remains in ossuaries suddenly ceased.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2013 at 12:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46344","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"I would assert without fear of contradiction, that the I.A.A. has never found a set of ossuaries from any single family tomb with the same set of names as those found at Talpiot!

Forensically, however, one must not begin with that assumption, and Heller & Adler do not make such as assumption in the paper “A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin.” Their contention there can be simplified (fairly drastically) as follows: There are three colours of fibre on the shroud, white, yellow and red, corresponding to non-image, image, and blood. When these three colours of fibre are tested with protease (to dissolve any animal trace), the white remains unchanged, the yellow remains unchanged, and the red disappears and becomes white. This implies that only the red derives from animals, and that there is no yellow underneath it. So far, so good.\nHowever, observing the shroud in close up, one can see that on the whole image fibres are on the top of the middle of each exposed thread, while the most bloodstained fibres are found most heavily down the sides of the same thread. In other words, image fibres and bloodstain fibres do not closely coincide, even on quite heavily bloodstained patches. The reason for this is that the blood has mostly eroded away, leaving the image behind. It seems to me quite probable that, in selecting well-blood-stained fibres for testing, Heller and Adler unwittingly selected fibres that, although they came from an image-bearing part of the shroud, actually bore no image.\nLook, for example, at the bloodstains over the right eye (on shroudscope, for example). There is the famous epsilon, and further to the side a single dark smudge. Between these two are a couple of rather poorly defined bloodmarks. All of them are characterised by pale diagonal stripes, which represent the tops of the threads running through them. The blood is clearly found mainly in the cracks down the side. Are we to understand that all these threads running right through the bloodstains actually contain no image?  I don’t think there is any evidence for that.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2013 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46394","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"Hugh: such examinatons using Shroud Scope can be misleading, as there are no white and yellow colors on the Shroud, the color of image and background is the same, the only difference is its intensity.

It would be reasonable to assert that from all the cases where fibres were exposed from under blood stains, then no image was found. The question would then have to be if sufficient fibres were exposed to make such a definitive assertion.  We might ask if any of the blood flowed from the body after the image had been formed. Then the only other way that there could be image under blood stains is if some person added any blood to the cloth over any image fibres. However there is much more in Rogers’ paper which I think could rouse your interest.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2013 at 11:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46435","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"The degraded ancient blood on the shroud is not painted at all.

A wide variety of themes to address while I’ve been off the air. Let’s see…\n1) I’m very familiar with Rogers’s FAQ paper. It is deliberately fairly simplistic in tone, and addressed to people who want to understand his conclusions rather than to people who already understand them and don’t necessarily agree. Nearly every question, beginning “How do you know…” would be better begun with “Why do you think…” Many of his own beliefs are presented as fact with little or no corroboration, and several diagrams presented as if what they showed was obvious, when in fact it isn’t. For example the reflectance spectrograph labelled “image”,  “blood” and “Fe2O3” shows a reflectance spectrum for blood that only barely resembles it, and the photo purporting to be a UV image of the sample area shows a bright spot for the Raes area which appears to be a retouching and looks nothing like any of the UV photos of Miller and Pellicori. While I agree with many of Rogers’s ideas, there are many I do not agree with, and none that are wholly uncontentious.\n2) There are no Roman flagra in existence for us to copy, and the only two (quite different) examples used to verify the whip marks of the shroud were modelled using those very whip marks. Hardly surprising they match. Remarkably, the only reference to an archaeological find shows a flagrum made entirely, handle, thongs and plumbata, of metal. This find no longer seems to be in existence. There are a few illustrations, on coins and such, but they only go to demonstrate that there was a wide variety of designs. To claim that the shroud matches any of them is mere speculation. The only actual whippings with which one might compare the Shroud are carried out annually in Mexico and the Philippines, and they look nothing like the Shroud.\n3) Do I think the Shroud was modelled on the Pray manuscript? No.\n4) The Stuttgart Psalter is wonderful and I’m so glad Max mentioned it. It can be found in its entirety at http://digital.wlb-stuttgart.de/digitale-sammlungen/seitenansicht/?no_cache=1&tx_dlf%5Bid%5D=1517&tx_dlf%5Bpage%5D=1 and does indeed have a picture of a naked Christ being flogged.

As there is no evidence as to the precise nature of either the instrument which made them or the injuries it inflicted, artists can do more or less what they like. For all anyone knows the marks on the shroud look nothing like genuine flagrum marks, and were dabbed on with a piece of sponge. If we must speculate about either the instrument or the injuries, then it is relevant that the only flagrum ever found, and the only wounds due to flagellation we can examine, bear no relation to the marks on the shroud. Wilson’s flagrum was made specifically to fit the injuries on the shroud, and has no archaeological justification. William Smith’s illustration would not produce the marks, nor would the knucklebones he also mentions. He derives his information about the flagrum found in Herculaneum from Rich’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, where it is illustrated. Of course all these genuine classical descriptions predate the popularity of the shroud – that’s why they didn’t feel any urge to conform to it, unlike most descriptions of flagra since.

I respectfully suggest he may like to refresh his youthful memory, by reference to Ch 4. “The Preliminary Sufferings”, p.92 of the 1963 Image edition. \nThe Roman coin I mentioned at #58 above had four lashes to its flagrum, Ian Wilson’s reconstruction has three lashes; William Smith apparently has other versions, so that clearly flagra were constructed as personal weapons, their design being merely limited according to the morbid imagination of their owners.  HF claims that Wilson’s flagrum was designed merely to fit the case of the TS, but this is in fact not so, if he would reread Barbet.  \nBarbet asserts that all these wounds have the SAME shape (difficult with only a blood-soaked sponge), he likens them to a halter some 3cm long, the two circles representing balls of lead, the line joining them being the mark of the thong.  They occur in PAIRS of TWO (not three) parallel wounds, and he deduces that each flagrum had TWO thongs, laid out in the form of a fan, the centre being the executioner’s hand. On the thorax they are oblique, horizontal on the loins, and oblique once more on the legs. He comments that on the FRONTAL image, there are long oblique furrows which must have been produced by the ends of the thongs. Having struck the calves of the legs with their leaden balls, they have turned around the outer edge of the leg and lashed the front with their points (a skill easily acquired by a sadistic executioner). Barbet has previously commented from his knowledge of the classics, that scourging commonly occurred with the prisoner facing the pillar to which he was bound, with his arms being bound above his head. There are no scourge marks on the arms!\nBarbet deduces that there must have been two executioners, likely of different heights, for the obliqueness differs on each side. He finally notes that painters have been content at most, with vague formless excoriations, and none have ever attempted such minute details.\nHowever if we are to follow the logic of Hugh Farey’s argument, then not only does the TS also have all its other highly unlikely properties devised by his entirely notional forger, but this genius also had the perspicacity to paint the image with identical scourge marks, apparently radiating from the hands of two executioners of different heights, either side of the prisoner, but with no marks on the arms.  I wonder if Hugh has ever heard of Occam’s razor, for there is a simpler solution than the one he has to devise, and that is that the TS is in fact what it appears to be! \nBarbet was of course an experienced forensic pathologist, who experimented with cadavers and amputee’s limbs, and was also extremely knowledgeable in the Greek and Roman classics.  I am unaware of any credentials he may have had in teaching science at a boys’ secondary school, but this is perhaps not so relevant to the case.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2013 at 9:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46573","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"Great comment Dave.

The differences in opinion held by Fred Zubige are well-known and remain contentious. I do not see that the paper by Faccini and Fanti rewrites Barbet. If at all, their experimental work with a cardboard carton provides additional elaborative detail of Barbet’s basic findings. Hugh Farey may if he so wishes continue with his damp sponge hypothesis, or any other highly unlikely scenario, but I see little point in continuing the discussion further.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2013 at 3:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46686","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"That’s fine; each to his own.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2013 at 6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46711","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"There seems to be no difficulty in agreeing with Daveb because Barbet’s study remains a classic in Shroud studies.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2013 at 3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46690","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"\nHugh Farey :\n no artist could have matched the injuries due to a Roman flagrum\n\nActually, no artist could have matched the injuries (adding blood) to image pattern.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2013 at 4:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-46693","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture","post":"I really love this blog.  Unless we know HOW the image was formed, the rest is a whole lot of who-shot-John.  I mean, intellectual, highly educated who-shot-John, but that is it.  Conjecture. Was blood added or not, etc. The plain facts are, and to this day, NO ONE KNOWS.  In the words of B.Shwartz, “We can tell you what it is not.” UNTILL we know what the image is, (I am convinced we never will, but to keep looking is only right and human) you cannot add or take away from its total construction. What I mean is, it was either a contrived artifact, or it is not. I don’t think somebody found the SOT and added any adornments or additional visual info.  When (and if) we figure out how the image was made, the question of the bloodstains will pretty much answer itself, won’t it? The question of where the blood came from, at least as I see it, is inextricable from the question of how the S. was formed, simple as that.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2013 at 1:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-48808","author":"Josie L.
