Treadle looms can still be bought in a standard size of 45 inches. The six linen strips that make up the Zittau Veil, 1462, averaged 113 cms in width. This has always been one of the strongest pieces of evidence for a medieval weave.\n\n","date":"July 16, 2015 at 5:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/maybe-a-not-so-startling-coincidence-of-something-that-is-approximate-and-presumably-averaged/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205929","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Maybe a Not So Startling Coincidence of Something that is Approximate and Presumably Averaged","post":"Charles is perfectly correct. There is very little evidence for any standards of length anywhere in the 1st century, and none whatever for 1st century Middle Eastern weaving looms. Such definite evidence as there is – some Roman, some Herodian – does not support the contention that the Shroud was made to a definite size, although I agree that its proportions of 8 x 2 do seem deliberate. If anything, 1st century cubits were considerably smaller than Assyrian ones. Jones, quoting Dickinson, says “a particular cubit of the market place that is connected with the Shroud, the cubit that is known as the Assyrian cubit: the widely used, indeed, international standard of that time for merchants of the Near East, and had been so for centuries.” I can find no evidence for this at all. I did ask for it the last couple of times this topic was raised, but nobody suggested anything.\n\n","date":"July 16, 2015 at 9:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/maybe-a-not-so-startling-coincidence-of-something-that-is-approximate-and-presumably-averaged/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205941","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
