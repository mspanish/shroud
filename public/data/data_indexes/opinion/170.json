[{"title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello","post":"Angular filming magnification is a simple process which we can begin to understand by this clip showing the front of the Shroud filmed live being tilted back from the lcd screen then before your eyes turning into a positive\n\nThe technique converts negative film to positive and positive to negative when seen by the camera eye lense and even a human eye. In AFM yes there is a distortion rate of about 10% in length and width of created image but there is no visual noise. It is not correct to say I am overlaying images upon each other. The truth is when an image is processed revealing the positive aspects it is photographed or filmed. The second stage uses this image again tilted to an optimum degree to avoid length width distortion and filmed revealing more of the positive nature. A complete processing is difficult in one stage as AFM only works on sections at a time hence 2-4 separate processings. The illumination of the screen is what reveals the hidden elements and 3D hidden characteristics. The process has also been used for many years in astronomical photography, I recently learnt this where they photograph stars and distant bodies from separate angles and compile them to create the image so my filming technique has a foundation. I am the first to use this technique in the second face and all of my Shroud research and for this reason I have found misunderstanding and hostility. The face of the lion cannot be denied nor the alive face of Christ from the back\n\n","date":"May 20, 2013 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/20/the-worldwide-conspiracy-to-ignore-vincenzo-giovanni-ruello/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-34125","author":"vincenzogiovanni","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello","post":"This is NOT SCIENCE.

However, the question ought to be “Can I accept that they are indeed there or not?” The problem I have with this is that neurosurgeon specialists will tell us that the brain is wired to see patterns. So that what we may at first interpret as a visual pattern may have no substantive reality.\nAs an impressionable child, I still vividly recall being frightened in the dark by the patterns of light I perceived as various threatening faces or animals, which even entered my nightmares. My mother was an expert teller of imaginative stories, particularly of the ghostly kind, and perhaps these helped me to lay my childish fears to rest, and I came to rationalise my spectres as no more than tricks of the light, which indeed they were.  \nI am minded of the lines in Shakespeare’s play, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” having often taken part in several group readings. At its conclusion, King Theseus has the lines: “Or in the night, imagining some fear, / How easy is a bush supposed a bear!” In fact the whole play deals with questions of reality and perception in a way that only Shakespeare is capable of doing.   \nThis whole question of reality and perception in AMND is dealt with in an intriguing essay, “A Bush or a Bear?” by Cory Akin and can be found at: http://www.nwc.cc.wy.us/waw/essays/Essay54.pdf \nI have no objection to Vincenzo and Max continuing to have their party, atributing a reality to the resemblances they see, where the rest of us cannot. I am also familiar with the fact that primal peoples, Pacifica, Maori and African, will also attribute a reality to visual patterns which a modern rational mind may scorn. However if a substantive reality is to be attributed to patterns which some claim to see on the Shroud cloth, then I think it requires at least a level of reasonable consensus that such patterns are in fact perceived by more than a few. Otherwise it becomes too difficult to take these claims more seriously than perhaps we might. Even so, the question must remain as to whether they are merely tricks of the light, a trick in the weave, a pattern which are no more than a perception of our neurologically wired brains.\n\n","date":"May 22, 2013 at 7:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/20/the-worldwide-conspiracy-to-ignore-vincenzo-giovanni-ruello/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-34311","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello","post":"I need to tread carefully ,I mean we need to.
