One step I do believe is proven beyond the a reasonable doubt. The other is so far consistent but not proven\nI do believe for reasons many have stated that the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of the historical figure, Jesus of Nazareth. To say something is true beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that there is no doubt. But it is the  doubt that comes in the middle of the night at two  o’clock in the morning that we must reject. We need Napoleon referred to as two o’clock in the morning courage. Sunrise is a curative of doubt.\nBut what of the Resurrection? Does the Shroud “prove” the Resurrection. I do believe that it is consistent with Resurrection. That is it does not disprove the Resurrection. But the great unknown s the process of image formation. I think there are twp poles here. One is represented by Jackson, Fanti et al who argue that the process involved in the creation points towards Resurrection and the other by the late Ray Rogers who insisted that he didn’t believe in miracles and searched, fruitlessly for a natural explanation he never successfully articulated (as he himself admitted).\nSo we are at an impasse. But that is not to say the impasse that will never be broken. Science has shed light  much of what humanity used to be believe was a miracle. Indeed, Science may in fact be doing God’s handiwork in revealing the true majesty and glory of existence. As Science opens avenues of existence to explore, we should not be too surprised if at the one of those avenues we glimpse the Creator. In Shroud, I think I spy him already.\n\n","date":"December 22, 2013 at 11:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-65045","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam","post":"From being unable to explain the images to assuming that they are miraculous evidence of Christ’s resurrection is too far a leap for me without supporting evidence that I am happy to listen to. \n. ‘The “skeptics” (who are themselves “believers” in the Shroud’s non-authenticity)’ should be rewritten as ‘The ‘skeptics’ (who are themselves sceptical of the Shroud’s authenticity)’ .

Well that’s nonsense, as has been demonstrated many times on this blog. From the accidental product of an unconnected burial in the 1st century to a devout attempt to represent Christ’s passion for the reverence of believers in the 14th century, there is ‘middle ground’ in abundance, and I have wandered about in it with fascination for months.\nThen we have the “scientists have tried to manufacture the shroud…..” as if failure was evidence for authenticity. My guess is that most of the scientists trying to explain how the image was formed, by quite a large margin, were in fact trying to show how it was formed by the body of Christ, not by a medieval forger. From Paul Vignon, through Ray Rogers and John Jackson to Giulio Fanti, via the vaporograph, Maillard reaction, and all the radiation, laser and plasma theories, not to mention those on the very fringe of scientific credibility, such as quantum dissapearance or biophotonics, pro-authenticity scientists have not only failed to expain how a body could produce an image, but cannot even agree about the actual configuration of either the body or the shroud required to produce one. In the face of this utter inability to produce a shroud by natural means, then obviously it must be….. Ah, but I don’t use arguments from ignorance, so I don’t go down that road!\nIn that context, let’s rewrite Stephen Jones’s paragraph above, shall we…\n“The “authenticists” (who are themselves “believers” in the Shroud’s authenticity) have no evidence that the Shroud was “a product of a dead man in Jerusalem”. They cannot cogently explain: Who conjured it up? [Well, I suppose we must grant them them the who and when, although they are matters of faith rather than evidence] How was it conjured up? When was it conjured up? Why can’t they conjure it up (i.e. make a convincing replicate copy of the whole Shroud)? The “authenticists” (so-called) cannot even agree on how the Shroud was “conjured up”.\nNot such a bold argument for authenticity now, is it? Now let’s have a look at his quotation from Ian Wilson:\n“Yet ingenious as so many of these ideas are, the plain fact is that they are extremely varied and from not one of them has come sufficient of a groundswell of support to suggest that it truly convincingly might hold the key to how the Shroud was…” the end of this quotation could just as easily read “naturally made” as “forged.”\nOne more? Stephen Jones again:\n“Similarly, if the Shroud were [1st century / 14th century], the science of the 20th-21st century should have discovered that by now. So that absence of proof by modern science that the Shroud is [1st century / 14th century], after 35 plus years of intensive scientific study of the Shroud, is positive proof that the Shroud is  [fake / real]!” [Delete at whim.]\nAnd then I’m told my doubts are unreasonable!\nWe end with the most unreasonable, irrational, merely emotional appeal of all, that the Shroud is scientific proof that Christianity is true.

Emanuela Marinelli, I thank her, writes as a scientist. She has this to say regarding the possibility that the radiocarbon-dating laboratories produced their 13th century result from a mixture of 1st and 16th century material:\nSindonologist Maria Grazia Siliato, considering the abnormal weight of the Shroud sample used for the radiocarbon dating, suggested the presence of a mending instead. Sindonologists Joseph Mario and M. Sue Benford provided some evidence of the existence of an “invisible” mending dating to the sixteeth century in the area where the sample for radiocarbon analysis was taken, including differences in thread colour and size and weave pattern. Flury-Lemberg denies the existence of such a darn, but, according to Savarino “the sampling site does not exclude this hypothesis.”\nLater, perhaps, I may demonstrate reasons for doubting “the abnormal weight of the Shroud sample,” as well as the “differences in thread colour and size and weave pattern” but my point here is to show that scientists do not “prove” things, such that anybody who denies them is an idiot. Scientists, humbly, “suggest” things. They “provide some evidence for” things. They find evidence which “does not exclude a hypothesis.”\nHowever fanatical one may be emotionally in support of a hypothesis, one seldom supports one’s case by insulting those who find faults in it, and one definitely weakens one’s case by attributing motives for their doubts for which one has no evidence at all.\nBut then, I can only speak for science.

This blog has demonstrated that there are many opinions about many things, but that’s all-in a sense the Shroud is independent of what anyone thinks-t’s either real or it’s not-there is no in-between, while opinions may run the spectrum, swayed (or not)by certain emotional or scientific arguments.\n2. I think “35 plus years of intensive study” is not the best of phrases to accurate describe this.  It’s not as though large groups of scientists are examining and re-examining the cloth in situ daily.  And again, the notion of proof by default is misguided.  Perhaps that experiment just hasn’t been done yet.  Heller & Adler once said (paraphrased), No amount of experiments can “prove” that the Shroud is authentic, but a single experiment could disprove it.  Science is best at telling us what the Shroud isn’t, not at what it is.\n3. The strongest proofs that Christianity is true are the transformations and fruits in the lives of individuals who have opened their lives to fellowship with Jesus Christ.  JP II said (paraphrasing) that the most important thing about the cloth is that it connects one in a unique way to the sufferings of Christ.  How ironic would it be if  a forger with mischievous or malevolent intentions had the end result of drawing even greater attention to God’s limitless love and mercy-whether the Shroud is evidence of Jesus’ physical suffering or just a representation of it-those things remain\n\n","date":"December 22, 2013 at 2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-65109","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam","post":"Kelly, your point 3 refers to what theologians and philosophers call “the argument from experience”.

If we use traditional criteria of historical assessment, we can be pretty sure that the Turin shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth.

My original comment was sparked by another relating to arm length which now seems to have disappeared, and whatever Fr Duncan wrote in response I can’t now find. Never mind! \nWhat I had written now appears under its own posting (I agree [x 3] Mostly!], but I don’t see Fr Dunk’s response there. It was certainly not intended to set off a debate on Argumentum ad Ignorantium, but as a brief summary of a few enigmatic properties, particularly the orthogonality of the image, which suggests to me some kind of vertically directed action. That some observe minor distortions, suggests to me minor random fluctuations in a type of naturalistic process, whereas we might expect a degree of absolute perfection if it were the result of a kind of divine intervention. \nI make little secret of my pro-authenticity preference, but cheerfully admit that I am no wiser about whatever process was involved than any other as-well-informed correspondent. \nWhile I might admire Hugh Farey’s attempts at scientific rigour, I tend to the view that such rigour has yet to demonstrate that it can enlighten, I suspect because his science seems to prefer a deductive approach, whereas there is an insuffient factual basis for a deductive approach to bear useful fruit. An inductive approach, making what appear to be reasonable inferences seems to me to offer better chances of a degree of success. \nFurthermore, in the deductive approach, I believe salient observations and inferences can be missed. For example, Hugh seems reluctant to accept that there is adequate evidence that the image is that of Jesus Christ. He does not seem ready to accept this as a reasonable conclusion, notwithstanding the evidence of a “cap of thorns” for example. And yet there is only one reason why Jesus was so capped, it was modelled on the crown of Eastern kings, and lampooned the charge of claiming to be “King of the Jews”.  A reasonable inference surely, but it is apparently not good enough for Hugh!  \nIt is the reluctance to accept what to reasonable people seems to be a reasonable inference, that is tending me to the conclusion to wonder just what useful conclusions, such a rigorous approach can in fact yield, and I fear that the answer might be in fact “very little”!

That is, Christ’s body dematerialised, and in the event of dematerialising the body left the image behind. So, under this theory, the image does not have to be perfect, as it resulted from a naturalistic process caused by a divine event. Under this theory I have no idea what that naturalistic process could be – obviously bodies do not dematerialise (with the possible exception of Christ) so we can’t measure the naturalistic side effects of that process. I don’t necessarily buy radiation theories.\nI’ve provided an analogy before, I’ll provide it again. A couple of months ago my wife’s close friend passed away in the middle of the night in New Zealand. At almost exactly the same time, the dishes in one of our cupboards here in Adelaide started rattling strangely. One  dish fell on another and created a small crack on one of the dishes.\nNow, if this really was a spiritual event then one can say that the rattling of the dishes was caused by a spiritual event, but the crack in the dish was explained naturalistically by one dish hitting another.

If we are to insist on a “strictly scientific” approach, then accuracy in expressing ideas is essential. It is quite clear from the blood flows around the head, that the cap at least pretty well covered most of the head, if not indeed all of it. From the various ancient authors who give some details about particular crucifixions, none mention that any were so capped, but it is specifically mentioned in the case of Jesus, and the reason for it easily inferred. None of the others so capped, if indeed there were any, left behind any evidence of it. \nNevertheless I can find a point of agreement with Hugh, that there is little room for dogmatism if there are credible alternative different views about conclusions, but not so much if they rely entirely on idle speculations or fantasy. However one can be dogmatic about the very existence of the TS, and on whatever agreement there might be about what it shows.\nThe question “Do we need more?”: Maybe not, if you’re only a dabbler. But others might feel it is something more substantial and worth taking a little more seriously!\n\n","date":"December 22, 2013 at 6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-65186","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam","post":"Hugh: You can always perform an estimate, a calculation similar to that one  preformed to Baberis, to check what is a chance that TS Man is not Jesus, but someone else.\nTo remind you: Barberis assumed:\n1.

If it is a powerful argument for yourself (unless and until you have a good\nreason for thinking you are deluded), it is not an argument based on a logical reasoning, it is not an argument that can convince even an unbeliever. And muslims or hindus can describe the same kind of fruitful transformations.\nLook at an argument from history. If we use traditional criteria of historical assessment, we can be pretty sure that the Turin shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. But much more that that, the probability that the image is the consequence of the bodily resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth is very high.\nAn extract of the conclusion of my article published this year in the Heythrop Journal:\n “As judged by our current knowledge, [the Resurrection Hypothesis] is the most likely of the three hypotheses that have come under scrutiny [Garlaschelli Hypothesis and Natural Hypothesis]. Its level of plausibility is high, which is not the case for the other two hypotheses. Its explanatory scope does not constitute a major obstacle, although its explanatory power could be improved. It is less ad hoc than its rivals and offers the possibility of a substantive illumination on related fields of research. This does not mean, however, that the RH is proven to be historical; it is simply the most likely hypothesis when we adopt a Minimal Facts approach to test for the best explanation.”\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/heyj.12014/abstract\n\nOf course point 3 isn’t based on logical reasoning, that’s exactly why I think it could convince certain unbelievers (in Christianity or other faiths).  A changed life is a powerful witness, much more so than hearing someone just recite words or certain facts. That’s the main point I was trying to make, along with that the Shroud can be a part of the Christian faith, certainly, but faith is much bigger than just the cloth.  I am certain that those of other faiths can describe similar fruitful transformations, I personally have no problem with that.\n\n","date":"December 22, 2013 at 6:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-65187","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam","post":"\nHugh Farey :\nYes indeed.

Not only that, but this Greek fellow actually left behind a burial shroud with his image on it, which actually survives to this very day, and doubtless formed during one of his Homeric metamorphoses, possibly even into a swan prior to his seduction of the virgin Leda.

Assuming these three treatments were independent, then 1 in every 8000 crucifixions had injuries similar to those on the shroud. Let us suppose that the Romans crucified Jews for about 400 years, at a rate of 1 a day except during rebellions when the number rose to 500 a day according to Josephus.
