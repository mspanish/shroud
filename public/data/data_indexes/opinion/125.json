[{"title":"Quite simply scandalous","post":"Well this just goes to show how timely Thiebault Heimburger’s paper is, despite one silly adverse comment.  Thiebault seems to have expressed somewhat similar reservations about the STURP conclusions as has CB, but has put in the hard yards himself in an effort to resolve these reservations.  I wonder if CB is aware of Thiebault’s paper, or perhaps if he is, no doubt he would run true to form in dismissing anything hostile to his pet theory as pseudo-science, regardless of its true merits.\nThere can be, I suppose a “Magnificent Obsession” in pursuing one’s own pet scientific theories, even about the scorching of fabric, but there comes a time to look outside the box, and consider other alternatives, like maybe authenticity!\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 5:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/quite-simply-scandalous/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-18174","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Quite simply scandalous","post":"I guess any scientist that disagrees with him is guilty of being not that great a scientist.
