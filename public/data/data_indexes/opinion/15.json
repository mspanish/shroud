Looks like I am actually going to finally have the time to fully read it and absorb it.  I am in Central America taking care of some old business involving some “green” owed to me.\n(Shroud Research Money)\nAnyways, This is one definition of intuition I found\n“the way our higher power communicates with us with a “inner knowing” or “inner voice”   The book you mentioned, “Blink”  I read it.  Very interesting.\nIt is very noteworthy to make known the Shroud of Turin case file is the only case in history where the conclusions drawn by 3 different forensic pathologists who were in agreement that a genuine dead body made contact with the Shroud was not accepted.  1st time in the history of forensic science.\nI have never seen another case where this has occurred.  I wonder if that has anything to do with the name Jesus being involved with it?\nI have also never seen a case file where if an ancient relic was authenticated it could disrupt the balance of power and change the flow of where billions of dollars would wind up.\nI wonder if that has anything to do with the authenticity debate?   Sorry about the sarcasm.  We all get the point. \nAnyways, If the conclusions drawn by\n1. Dr. Pierre Barbet\n2. Dr. Robert Bucklin\n3. Dr. Frederick Zugibe\nWho all agreed a man in his 30’s, long hair, beard and mustache, appx, 5′ 11″ 175 lbs was\n1. Beaten\n2. Cap/crown of thorns placed around head\n3. Scourged\n4. Crucified\n5. Legs Not Fractured\n6. Side Pierced\n7. Wrapped In The Shroud\n8. Body Removed from linen before decay\n(No other person in History we know of  other than Jesus underwent those sequence of events)\nThe only note able disagreement in the pathologists report was cause of death, but still dead, yes a dead body made contact with the cloth.\nAll in agreement on that very important point.  Dead. \nTake the name of Jesus out of this and not one person on this Earth would be debating the credibility of the pathologists report,  It would be accepted as it would in any unsolved murder case. 3 separate forensic pathologists all in agreement, in a court of law it would be indisputable. Rock Solid. If another forensic pathologist came to different conclusions after examining the linen that would be a different story.  But that is not the case with the Shroud.  \n  Based on the pathologists report the calculated odds the man in the Shroud is not Jesus is one in a 82 Million, 944 Thousand.  82,944,000\n That is not taking into account any of the match points between the Sudarium and the Shroud.  That is also not taking into account over 40 names & phrases relating to Jesus and the Shroud of Turin that all equal the same number in English Gematria.   If we calculate those factors in one would have to conclude it is not unreasonable to believe if one opened their window they might see a dodo bird flying by and/or be struck in the head with space debris, that would be a reasonable possibility    If one thinks that is a probable scenario, a probable scenario that is not unreasonable to believe could take place then that person could also have reasonable doubt The Man in The Shroud is not Jesus.  That is how heavy the odds are stacked against the shroud not being the linen that wrapped Jesus.\nYes, many have doubt the Shroud is genuine,\nBut is it reasonable doubt? \nBased purely on math it is not reasonable.  Man in the Shroud is Jesus, in the words of Dr. Robert Bucklin  “Indisputable”\n\n","date":"July 28, 2015 at 1:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-206716","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"“Take the name of Jesus out of this and not one person on this Earth would be debating the credibility of the pathologists report”\nCorrection. At least one person would (me). For a start, it’s hard enough drawing conclusions re 3D anatomy, injuries etc from observing a faint and fuzzy 2D image. When you don’t know how the image was formed, why are you even inviting pathologists to comment, given their training and experience is with real cadavers on mortuary slabs?\nThat’s not including another overlooked detail – namely that Robert Buckley, while described as a member of STURP, did not make the trip to Turin, so did not see the “Shroud” with his own eyes. That so-called autopsy report of his must have been based on one or more photographs, though you wouldn’t know that from reading it.  Whose photographs? They certainly weren’t those of Durante (2002) which we can all of us view on Shroud Scope. Had they been, Buckley could not have got away with stating there were no scourge marks on the arms, and making deductions that assumed authenticity re biblical-era scourging (arms above head).\n I despair of this travesty of science, brought to us by Robert Buckley (and others!)  who time and again were prepared to abandon scientific objectivity in their attempts to fill in for us the details of the biblical narrative.\n\n","date":"July 28, 2015 at 1:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-206721","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"This is a complete list of all image possibilities.

It does not matter which side one is on, being pro or against authenticity it is going to happen regardless of your credentials or lack there of.

I do not want to become a angry, hostile, rude and spiteful person.  I am talking about myself not anyone else.

As a result of Shroud research we should be becoming more loving, more caring, more good humored, more thoughtful, more forgiving,  if not it shows something is wrong.  “Success is about who we become as a person”\nIn the program of AA, there is thing called a Step 10  “We continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it”   That said,  I am going to take a Step 10 on this comment section and apologize to anyone I was hostile, rude or spiteful toward.

Imprint & Ammonia (A Gas) Combo.  I like how passionate you are about explaining your image theory.   Very detailed descriptions.  I found this written about the Shroud, I am sure at some point you have already seen it and has already been discussed on this Blog Site.  Perhaps a good time for you to look at it again.  Forensic evidence that supports your image theory.   This is in regards to the Texas pediatrician/scientist Garza-Valdes who was involved in the book “The DNA of God”\nI do not know if his work is viewed on this Blog Site as being credible or not, but here are some things he found that relate to what you are saying. \n1.First, he found that the cloth itself was covered in an organic “”bioplastic coating, a type of clear encasing invisible to the naked eye but composed over time of millions of living microbial organisms.”” Such a coating, which he had first witnessed in his study of ancient Mayan artifacts\n2.This finding, coupled with “”infinitesimal splinters of hard wood found near the wound areas,”” and the human male DNA found in the blood stains, led the to ask whether this cloth was indeed the burial shroud of Jesus\n 3. Also through tests upon bacteria found in the blood stains found on the Shroud’s fibers, Garza-Valdes discovered that they contained acetic acid, or vinegar. This evidence indicates that the person buried in the shroud would have been exposed to vinegar, much like Jesus at his crucifixion, his death.  Human sweat also contains acetic acid as does myrrh resin.  The acetic acid could have gotten on the cloth by more than one method.  Myrrh resin is cellulose from wood pulp.  When mixed with acetic acid will become cellulose acetate.\nThe main ingredients to make cellulose acetate are\n1. Cellulose From Wood Pulp\n2. Acetic Acid\n3. A  Catalyst would also be needed for hydrolysis to take place, such as sulfuric acid. A very small amount.\n(I am by no means some kind of chemistry expert\n Collin Berry  would be the person to ask about this process)\nWhen cellulose acetate is exposed to heat or moisture,it begins to deteriorate to an unusable state, releasing acetic acid with a characteristic vinegary smell, causing the process to be known as “vinegar syndrome.”   Do the Shroud fibers have this “vinegar syndrome” going on?   Note worthy also is cellulose acetate was used to coat holographic film plates.\nJust a coincidence. \nRay Rodgers believed the image resides in that layer and not really on the fabric.   Perhaps it is a combo of both \nMax you seem to have great insight/intuition on these matters, what do you think?\n\n","date":"July 29, 2015 at 10:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-206918","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"Hello Dave,\nYou are right about “Human sweat also contain(ing) acetic acid (a weak acid that can act as colour intensifier, comment mine) as does myrrh resin” and “The acetic acid could have gotten on the cloth by more than one method.”\nActually I usually refer either to “myrrhic aloetic fumigation” or “(myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation” see my 2011-2012-2013-2014-2015 CE posts as far as my image formation mechanism theory is concerned. It was just a typo in my previous comment on this thread not to mention myrrh. \nThe fact is, besides light or pre-mordanting and maybe “trapped biluribin”, carbon monoxide present in myrrhic aloetic fumes –acting as an archaeological blood intensifier– could account for the TS man’s archaeological red (carmin mauve) blood looking as if it had just been shed the day before. \nRe the “infinitesimal splinters of hard wood found near the wound areas”, oak particles were found in the Turin Shroud fibres and the occcipital area. In the present state of Shroud research, it is difficult to say whether the micro-fragments come from the wood caskets in which the Shroud has been kept for many centuries. E.g. those from the occipital area of the Man on the Shroud should be compared to a micro-fragment of (a relatively large piece of) the True Cross housed at Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, France.

My approach leaves open the door to a return to life first in flesh and bones, whether miraculous or not.\nIndeed it is too bad for the archaeological and scientific truth the Shroud literature mostly if not solely highlights the (arch-)fraudulists’ and (arch-)miraculists’ totally biased opinions.”\nThe fact is I first had “an inspired guess” just the night just after reading the Heller report late in 1988 CE (I had only very remotely heard of the TS until then). Not until 1994 CE I really put my TS image formation fumigation/pre- or light mordant theory pen to paper based on my first attempt to reconstruct Yeshua’s tetanised body/stiff rigid corpse wrapping in shrouds in light of Christolipsology (studies and research on Christ’s contact relics).  My two research paper resumes (“La Soluzione Archeologica Dell’Enigma O Verso Una Nuova Orientazione Delle Ricerche Sulla Generazioe Dell’Imagine Sul Lenzuolo Mortuario Di Torino” and “Decriptazione Ex-Novo Delle Tace D’Iscrizioni Sul Lenzuolo Mortuario Di Torino E Messa In cCorrelazione Col Frammento Del “Titulus Damnationis” Conservato In Roma”). Unfortunately, the day before the presentation of my oral papers, I was told I would be allowed only seven minutes to present my findings because they were too many orators. Overnight I rewrote a paper in French “En Vue De La Solution Archéologique De l’Egnime” and only tackled the Yeshua’s burial time-frame issue. \nNot until 2010 CE, I very succintly presented my fumigation/pre-/light mordant theory in a paper I addressed to Lazzaro after the International Workshop on the Scientific Approach to the Acheiropoietos Images held in Frascati Italy. Since I had no time to British English edit the paper in wrote in haste while working on my profesional files and the three referees (Lazzaro, Murra and Albright) were arch-miraculists and had not the foggiest notion about the possible use of the Red Heifer ashes to purify shed innocent blood (Yeshua’s) and could not really discriminate between falsely positive optical illusion (or “I think I see what it not really there”) and falsely negative optical illusion (or “I think I don’t see what is really there”) (A real shame!) my paper “Does the Shroud of Turin Really Bear the Image of a Man Crucified “Under Pontius Pilate””? was rejected.\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 4:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-207000","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"Typo: a (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation to TEMPORARILY make up for the anointing procedure that could not be performed on that very shabbat eve\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 4:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-207002","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"BTW, Most likely Yeshua’s disciples could keep the latter’s sindon  because his shed innocent  blood was purified via the use of the Red Heifer ashes and/or he returned to life first in flesh and bones (whether miraculously or not) and handed it over to one of his disciples on one of his apparitions or bilocations.\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 4:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-207003","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"Most likely his burial sindon was no longer in the empty tomb since Yeshu’a worn it draped about his body from head to knees when he appeared to Mary Magdalene.\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 4:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-207004","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"Typo: “Decriptazione Ex-Novo Delle Tace D’Iscrizioni Sul Lenzuolo Mortuario Di Torino E Messa In cCorrelazione Col Frammento Del “Titulus Damnationis” Conservato A Roma”\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 7:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-207027","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"Most lilkey too the Johannine “soudarion” is neither the Oviedo Sudarium (pre-burial face cloth) nor the Cahors Headdress (burial skull cap) or the Manoppello Veil (burial face cloth now reduced to more than half its size and touched up) but the Kornelimünster Sudarium (all envelopping burial wrap, Hebrew sovev, Aramaic soudara).\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 5:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-207006","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"Typo: the Kornelimünster Sudarium (all envelopping burial wrap –6×3.50m–, Hebrew sovev, Aramaic soudara).\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 5:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-207007","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It","post":"Why not send your 2010 paper, ‘Does the Shroud of Turin Really Bear the Image of a Man Crucified “Under Pontius Pilate” ‘ to Dan?
