[{"title":"Nailed or Tied to theÂ Cross?","post":"Some points made are erroneous, first the archaelogists did find signs on the forearms bones which were possibly from nails driven between and scoring the bones. As for the nail thru the ankle; How does this refute the typical view of both feet together being nailed? or show that the feet were nailed to the sides of the beams? Place one foot flat on the floor, place your other foot across the top of the flat foot angled so one side of the foot points up, the nail could have been driven thru the ankle of the top foor and thru the top of the bottom foot into the beam easily.The spikes/nails were said to be approx 6 inchs in length.\nR\n\n","date":"July 2, 2011 at 8:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/19/nailed-or-tied-to-the-cross/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-3294","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
