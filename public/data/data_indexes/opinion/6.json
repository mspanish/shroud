The classical example of clutching at straws and looking for any alleged problem, just to  undermine the credibility of religious tradition.\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel#Domestication \nDromedaries may have first been domesticated by humans in Somalia and southern Arabia, around 3,000 BC, the Bactrian in central Asia around 2,500 BC,[14][62][63][64] as at Shar-i Sokhta (also known as the Burnt City), Iran.[65]\nAbraham lived circa 2000-1800 BC -so he could have possessed camels. The only problems are those the sceptics have with religion.\nI am not Biblical literalist, but I believe that Biblical stories from Abraham onwards are essentially historical.\n\n","date":"February 11, 2014 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/abraham-and-his-camels-the-shroud-of-turin-how-did-we-get-here/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-78322","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Abraham and His Camels & The Shroud of Turin.

The world lost an eminent biblical scholar and the author of many good books, this week, books that can be very helpful in biblical interpretation. A few minutes of talking with Father Daniel J. Harrington, SJ convinced me that was worthwhile reading what he had written, whether on OT, NT, Qumran,Christianity/Judaism/Faith:\n   http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/offices/pubaf/news/2014-jan-feb/fr_harrington-obit1.html\n\n","date":"February 11, 2014 at 10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/abraham-and-his-camels-the-shroud-of-turin-how-did-we-get-here/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-78323","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Abraham and His Camels & The Shroud of Turin.

There are also cosmic truths contained in the tales of the Grimm brothers.

How did we get here?","post":"Hark! The sound of a fool rushing in where angels fear to tread. Yes, ’tis I, not wholly ignorant of biblical archaeology, who finds nothing remarkable in the findings of Sapir-Hen and Ben-Josef, whose camel dating only confirms what had already been well established anyway, that domesticated camels only arrived in the mines of the lower Levant (south of the Dead Sea) round about 1000 years BC.\nJones is wrong about the “argument from ignorance” and the “if we haven’t found it, therefore it doesn’t exist” suggestion. The site described was in continuous occupation since the late 14th century BC, and layer after layer of faunal studies show what animals were present at the site. Camels are conspicuously absent before the late 10th century, and conspicuously present after it. This is definitely suggestive of their introduction at about that time.\nIt is perhaps worth mentioning here that Abraham is not mentioned in Sapir-Hen and Ben-Josef’s paper, nor is there any discussion of biblical chronology at all, but they do mention the rock-art conveniently omitted from the Huffington post article. It is apparent that Jones hasn’t read their paper, although it is freely available by clicking their names on the first line of the article.\nIt is not impossible that the story of Abraham is based on truth, but there is no archaeological consnsus about him. Some think he is wholly legendary, and others that he may represent an actual migration, but there is little suggestion that this occurred long before the first millennium BC, in spite of literal biblical chronology. The idea that the biblical contemporary of Abraham called Amraphel is to be identified with Hammurabi of Babylon in about 1750 BC is much disputed.\nDr. Robert Harris, an eminent Jew, said to the Huffington Post: “This is just one of many anachronisms in the Bible, but these do not detract from its sanctity, because it is a spiritual source, not a historical one.” Jones boldly announces that this may be a Jewish view, but it is not a Christian one. Well, wrong again. There is no “Christian” position about the historical veracity of the bible. It is perfectly true that individual Christians may hold sincere beliefs, but they are only individuals, and cannot speak for Christianity as a whole. If anybody needs some kind of Christian consensus, they will have to have recourse to that massive collection of Christians, the Catholic Church (1.1 billion), or one of the larger alternatives if they can’t agree with Rome. It turns out that for the vast majority of Christians, Robert Harris’s views are wholly acceptable.\n\n","date":"February 11, 2014 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/abraham-and-his-camels-the-shroud-of-turin-how-did-we-get-here/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-78438","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Abraham and His Camels & The Shroud of Turin.
