The literalists bring true religion into so much disrepute, that they themselves inadvertently create the myth of implausible religion, with the result that guys like this think they’re doing a world a service in lampooning it.  I note his emphasis on “dinosaurs on the Ark and the myth of the Great Flood” – this is the natural fruit of the creationists’ doctrine.  I bet he’s never heard of the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Babylonian survivor of the Great Flood, Utnapishtim.  I don’t know that any rational person believes in the God that Krisetc doesn’t believe in.  “Faith without Rationality is Fanaticism” and maybe deserves lampooning!  Unfortunately, he’s spreading his net too wide.  Probably from a natural inborn ignorance!\n\n","date":"August 2, 2012 at 12:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/da-udder-athiewst-muss-be-soo-proud-a-him/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-14401","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Da Udder Athiewst Muss Be Soo Proud a him","post":"I love that picture of “The Fool” all decked out in his pretty best, complete with swag over his shoulder, (no doubt he’s remembered to bring his toothbrush).
