[{"title":"So Long As There Are Questions","post":"Jesus Christ is not just in our Christian hearts, but think about the Muslims who have had dreams about Jesus talking to them and then they convert to Christianity, you know the risk they are taking to do that. How about the folks who have been in a hospital, have died in the bed or wherever, seen the nurses and doctors working on them and then during the NDE went through some type of tunnel? and ended up in Heaven and meet Jesus Christ and then being told they had to go back and finish their life here.  Later explaining to those nurses and doctors what they observed and finding out that they had died and were brought back to life during that period of their ‘trip’.  There are actual documented cases in NDERF files and some are most current.  Look them up on the internet and you can make phone calls to verify the info in the data.\n\n","date":"July 24, 2015 at 3:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/24/so-long-as-there-are-questions/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-206450","author":"ekmcmahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So Long As There Are Questions","post":"Thank you, Fr. Paul, for the post. For more on Charles Wesley, please visit the website for the book series, The Asbury Triptych Series. The trilogy based on the life of Francis Asbury opens with the book, Black Country. Black Country details the religious climate experienced by Francis Asbury in mid to late 18th-century England. The book also brings to light the many influences on this young man who eventually leaves for the American colonies in 1771. Again, thank you for the post. The evidence of changed lives, myself included, is the evidence of Christ.\n\n","date":"July 25, 2015 at 10:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/24/so-long-as-there-are-questions/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-206521","author":"Al DeFilippo","site":"shroudstory"}]
