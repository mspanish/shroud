However, the pace of science today and the necessity of collaboration, makes peer-review the end of the process, not its beginning. The history of Science is replete with examples of important advances that were ridiculed and rejected by “scientific peers.” If we are to wait for peer-reviewed journal articles before examining theories and the facts underlying them, we will seldom advance our knowledge into new theories or unexplained mysteries.\nOne of the errors of the Vatican, was its repression of ideas deemed threatening to orthodoxy. I believe that the biggest tragedy of the Vatican’s forbidding Teilhard de Chardin to publish was a limitation on his ability to fully vet his ideas and through vigorous dialogue harmonize  them more completely.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is reviewing its own peer review process. Obviously a peer-reviewed journal article has more authority than research results published on the Internet. However, it is important to both the researcher and and those interested in his research to be informed at in early stage. Critiques addressed to the specific findings or procedures are important and can be very helpful.\nWhether I agree with all the conclusions of the French researchers or not, I appreciate learning of their work and having an opportunity to examine it now, instead of months if not years down the line. After all, it was “peer review” of  by the French Academy of Science, of the work of Yves Delage and his protege Paul Vignon that sunk initial scientific investigation of the Shroud of Turin for for decades. They had to wait three decades until 1930 for their vindication. For Delage, it came a decade too late.

Sorry again for the length of this comment but I think it could help some to understand better what’s at the heart of Alonso’s opinion…\nIn fact, never mind if Alonso’s interpretation is right or wrong on this particular characteristic of the image (concerning the numeric treatment that didn’t produce any deformation of the image), I think the FACT that there is a strong correlation between the intensity of the image and the intensity of the bands on the Shroud is well enough to understand that Rogers conclusion about the banding effect is PROBABLY CORRECT.  And if it’s right, then that mean that his hypothesis concerning the thin layer of impurities is PROBABLY CORRECT TOO.  \nFirstly, let’s remind people of the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the bands : For him, the banding effect is directly related to a thin layer of impurities of variable thickness found on the top-surface of the cloth (on both sides).  In Rogers mind, it is those impurities that were colored during the image formation process (most probably by one or many chemical mechanisms).  For Rogers, these impurities were left there after the washing and drying of the cloth and, because this ancient cloth was probably bleached prior to the weaving (bleaching done by batches of threads instead of one global bleaching of the whole cloth), this can account for a difference in the amount of impurities that had been left on the fibers and that’s why we see a banding effect on the Shroud.  For Rogers, the more impurities are present on top of the fibers, the more the color of the cloth is dark and inversely, on threads bleached more vigorously, there should be less impurities present and that can account for the fact these threads are more white than the others.  And, because there’s a difference in the amount of impurities found on each thread (a difference that can be really different at time), that’s why the intensity of the bands is directly connected to the intensity of the body image on the Shroud.  \nNever mind what can think all his detractors, I really think this hypothesis of Rogers offers the best explanation for this unusual property of the Shroud named “the banding effect”.  Recently, here on the blog, Thibault Heimburger said that this banding effect and his relationship with the image COULD well be explained by a difference in the density of the threads.  I even read the same possibility in a STURP paper, but with a small difference, i.e. that it concerned uniquely the question of the banding effect on the Shroud, without trying to explain the correlation between the intensity of the bands and the intensity of the image…  This hypothesis can be found in the STURP paper “Radiographic examination of the Shroud of Turin – a Preliminary Report” (written by Mottern, London and Morris).  \nHere, I want to state that I don’t think every single threads used to make the Shroud were of the same exact density.  In fact, I agree with what Thibault said the other day, when he said that it is common to see some changes in the density of the threads used to make ancient fabrics like the Shroud.  So, I don’t have too much doubt that this is also probably true for the Shroud.  But nevertheless, it is very interesting to note one particular finding we can see in the STURP paper of Mottern, London and Morris, that really seem to go against the hypothesis that was bring forward by Thibault the other day.  Here’s what they wrote in page 43 of their paper : “In constrast (meaning : in contrast to their hypothesis concerning the differences of density that can explain the banding effect), from a limited number of measurements, the linen threads (of the Shroud) are more uniform in diameter.”  Of course, this cannot be taken as a proof that every threads used to make the cloth present the same density, but this particular finding from these researchers is very interesting because, at first sight, it really seem to contradict their hypothesis concerning the banding effect, and at the same time, it look like a contradiction with the hypothesis mentioned by Thibault the other day. \nAnd more than that, when we put together all the observations and facts we now know about the Shroud and his image (the probable use of a bleaching technique done batch of threads by batch of threads, the ghosts of coloration found in the sticky tapes, the reduction of the color with diimide, the extreme superficiality of the coloration on-top of the cloth and possibly on the 2 sides in the region of the face, etc.), I really don’t think that this hypothesis involving a difference in the density of each threads (or batch of threads) can really offer a decent explanation for the banding effect we see on the Shroud along with his close connection with the intensity of the body image.\nLet me give you one example in order to show that this hypothesis present some enormous problems.  First, let’s state one important FACT about the Shroud : There really are body images on each side of the face on the Shroud, but they are very pale.  So pale in fact that it need a numeric treatment in order to see them properly.  Without any doubt, we can conclude that these 2 zones represent a very drastic change in the intensity of the body image of the face we see on the Shroud.  \nSo, when we take seriously this FACT into account, how in the world this drastic change in the intensity of the image of the face can be due to a difference in the density of the threads ?  Remember that the correlation between the intensity of the image and the banding effect is a FACT.  In other word, if the hypothesis expressed by Thibault or Mottern and Al. from STURP was correct concerning the banding effect, can you imagine the importance in the difference of density that it would be necessary to achieve this kind of drastic change in the intensity of the body image ???  In my mind, it is just unbelievable that 2 series of threads from the Shroud, located side-by-side, could possess this kind of high difference of density that would be the cause of this drastic change in the intensity of the image.  It’s just too much !  In fact, if this was true, I’m sure that the STURP team would have noticed an important difference in the density of the threads in that region (greater there than elsewhere on the cloth and easily noticeable).  Effectively, if this hypothesis was true, the difference of density that would be necessary to produce this drastic effect would have been so important that there’s no doubt in my mind that the STURP team would have note this change quite easily.  \nThat’s why I don’t believe this hypothesis of a difference in the density of the threads can represent a valid option to explain the close relationship that exist between the intensity of the bands and the intensity of the body image. I firmly believe that we have to look elsewhere for a logical explanation and that’s precisely what Rogers did !  After having put together all the observations and facts regarding the body image of the Shroud, that’s when he came out with his own hypothesis that offer a far better explanation (on the rational level) that the one presented by Thibault the other day.  In fact, an ancient bleaching technique done batch of threads by batch of threads with the result of leaving different amounts of impurities on-top of the fibers offer, I think, a much better explanation for, firstly, the banding effect itself, and secondly, the close connection that exist between this banding effect on the cloth and the variable intensity of the body image that can be very drastic at time (the face region is a perfect example of that).\nAnd if Rogers is correct about that, then the conclusion is this :  the image formation of the Shroud has a very good chance to have involved some kind(s) of chemical reaction(s) and logically, those should have been caused by the biological products that were produced by a corpse trapped in the cloth for maybe 36 hours or so.  And I really think that’s the main reason why this hypothesis of Rogers is so intensely criticise these days :  simply because most of those who yield the louder against it are members of what I call the “supernatural fringe” of the Shroud world.  In this context, I think it’s normal that they want so badly to crush down this hypothesis !!!  But sadly for them, for the banding effect and his close relationship with the body image, I think science has not been able to come up with a better explanation for the moment.  That’s why I truly believe this hypothesis from Rogers is here to stay, at least up until new chemical tests could be performed on the relic (along with new spectroscopic analysis and other tests).  I think it’s only then that, let’s hope, we’ll finally know if Rogers was right or wrong !!!\nTo conclude, I want to say this :  If you don’t agree with my point of view concerning the hypothesis of Ray Rogers (I’m sure there will be some people in that group !), then I would like you to give me a rational explanation for the sudden and drastic change in the intensity of the body image present in the region of the face !  If this isn’t due to an important variation in the quantity of impurities present on-top of the fibers in that region (most probably caused by a difference in the intensity of the bleaching that was performed on each batch of threads), then what is the cause of this drastic change of intensity between the image easy to see of the cheek and the extremely pale image of the side of the face ???  Remember that the presence of this image was scientifically confirmed, even if it is almost impossible to see it with naked eyes.  So, taking that into account, if you disagree with Rogers hypothesis, then what is your counter-hypothesis for this very particular feature of the Shroud ?  I’m open to hear any thoughts about that, as long as it come from someone honest who, like me, only seek the truth about the Shroud !  So, please, don’t bring back ancient hypothesis like the presence of a chin-band because the real presence of an image on the sides of the face is a proof that this one is incorrect.  In fact, what I would really like to hear is someone offering a rational explanation for the drastic change in the intensity of the image in the region of the face while using the hypothesis proposed by Thibault regarding the primary cell wall that would involved a difference in the density of the threads !!!  Personally, I just don’t see how someone can come up with a good scientific explanation involving this kind of hypothesis.\nOn important note to finish :  We often hear that the intensity of the body image is uniquely due to the distance between the corpse and the cloth, but, if we believe Ray Rogers conclusions, that’s not completely true.  For him, the intensity of the body image is due to the distance between the corpse and the cloth, yes, but it is also due to the intensity of the different bands composing the cloth.  In other words, for Rogers, the intensity of the coloration of the body image was not only due to the number of colored fibers per square unit (greater in the zones of direct contact and non-existent where the cloth was distant from the cloth of over 4 cm), but it was also due to the amount of impurities present on the fiber.  For Rogers, these 2 parameters were both important in the production of the body image we see on the Shroud and the very pale image present on both sides of the face is a very good indicator that Rogers was probably right about that.  In fact, in itself, the very good correlation that exists between the intensity of the image and the intensity of the bands on the cloth is THE indicator that he was probably right.  I thought it was important to shed light on that important aspect of the question because it is not always (not often I should say !) explained the right way on websites or TV documentary dedicated to the Shroud…  \nOn this particular topic, what is very interesting to note is what Marcel Alonso said about it in a presentation he made at the conference of Dallas in 2005.  Here’s what he said (we can find this quote in the paper he wrote for the conference) : “In fact, Rogers was the first to question this halftone model of “areal density of monochromatic dots” proposed by Pellicori (note : a member of STURP), suggesting a more “natural” one based on colors intensities.”  In fact, what Alonso summarised here is what I just described.  For Rogers, the variation of intensity in the body image is not due uniquely to the number of colored fibers by square unit but it is also due to the variation in the amount of impurities that was present on each fiber and his model is interesting because it can account very well (theoretically) for the strong correlation between the intensity of the bands on the cloth and the intensity of the body image on the cloth.  \nSo, I think this particular quote from Alonso can help us to understand what he really meant when he said that “Since these treatment leave the image intact (personal note : with no deformation of the image), the formation of this image WOULDN’T HAVE ALTERED THE SURFACE COMPOSITION OF THE THREADS, which would go in the sense of a DEPOSIT OF COLORATION ADDED TO THE THREADS.”  Effectively, I think we can presume easily that, for Alonso, if the body image on the Shroud was uniquely a halftone model of “areal density of monochromatic dots” involving some kind of molecular change in the structure of the fiber itself, the numeric treatment that was done by Castex and Al. would have created some image deformation.\nTo finish, I’ll say it again, I’m not an expert at all in imagery treatment, so I don’t know if Alonso is right or wrong about that.  But, nevertheless, I think the close correlation between the intensity of the bands and the intensity of the body image is a strong indicator that Rogers hypothesis concerning the image chromophore is probably correct.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2012 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12047","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"You clearly explained Alonso opinion/hypothesis.

One would also expect a sharp demarcation where the banding starts or stops, but it is not sharp, especially on the subject’s right side of the face, where the prominent cheek bone and/or swelling runs into the “dark area”. The hair too seems largely unaffected where it crosses the banded region.\nIf the difference in image intensity were really due to banding, one might have expected the equalisation to bring the dark regions up to the luminance level of the light. But it’s been done in reverse – reducing the luminance of the light to match the dark, and therefore failing to reveal new detail in the dark region (ears?), and reducing the attractiveness of the image generally. Why? Because there is no imaging worth speaking of at the periphery of the face, and that would have become all too apparent if that part had been intensified.\nThe real reason why the sides are not well imaged is because they present tangentially to the cloth. That’s why other parts that are not at the sides but which also present tangentially – like the underside of the chin and the eye sockets are also dark, i.e. poorly imaged, while the eyelids and other parts that present square on (extremity of nose, brow ridge, chin etc) are well-imaged.\nIn passing, it’s because the underside of the chin is imaged through draping of cloth, albeit poorly, that the neck “looks too long”.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2012 at 6:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12076","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"I’m going to disagree here.

Moreover, there is no demonstration from Alonso’s paper that such digital image processing could show such a differentiation, so everything written about this possible differentiation from digital image processing is speculation.  Besides, the darkened area around the face can be partly due to the distance between the cloth and the face itself. It just happens that if you loosely lay a cloth on a face (the head laying on the ground) with lots of hair, the cloth could come in contact with the hair and the cheek but in between there is a crevasse made of the gap between the cheek and the hair.

That suggests that poor imaging is due primarily to geometrical factors to do with body-cloth contact – rather than to any major variation in the ability of different fabric yarns to accept and record an image.\nThe inevitable conclusion is that the image is imprinted onto the superficial PCW, which is approximately of constant depth and chemical composition all over, rather than on an impurity layer that would tend to be somewhat variable, even over relatively short distances – tending to produce a patchy image. The Shroud image is not patchy – it is remarkably homogeneous from head to toe – as others have noted.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2012 at 8:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12089","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"\nRon :Chris at one time, I once thought the two areas in question were due too banding until I was made aware of the most likely way in which the Shroud was placed about the face/head area.

In fact, there are changes of intensity because of the ancient technique that was used to make the cloth) and I think that the explaination given by Rogers about this close relationship is very rational and it fits nicely with all the facts and observations we know about the body image.  Of course, those who believe the body images were due to a burst of energy at the time of the resurrection will always disagree with Rogers conclusions and hypothesis, simply because it doesn’t fit at all with their point of view.

Note : For Rogers, the banding effect was caused by some differences in the amount of impurities and these differences could have been important depending on how vigorous was the bleaching of each batch of yarns.  I also think it safe to assume that the evaporation-concentration process due to the washing and the drying of the cloth could also account partially for the probable variation in the amount of impurities that were left on-top of the fibers of the Shroud.\n3- The relative amount and concentration of a reactive product.  Note : For Rogers, it was different sorts of amines coming from the corpse and it is very probable that more amines could have come out from some particular parts of the body (like the nose and the mouth) versus other parts of the body.\nFor Rogers, every one of these 3 factors played a major role in the formation of the body image on the Shroud.  We can easily see the complexity of the body image formation for Rogers.  And I think it’s particularly true for the very pale images on each side of the face !  As Mario said, the particular configuration of the Shroud in these regions (that could have influenced the distance between the body and the cloth) could have played a role in the image formation that could explain partially the very paleness of the body images on each side of the face, but if we follow Rogers thinking, that’s not the only factor that caused those very pale images there !  The FACT that there are lighter bands of threads there cannot be taken for simply a hazardous element that had absolutely no influenced at all in the image formation process (especially the resulting intensity of the image).  In fact, most probably, this element also played a major role in the fact that the body images there are so pale.  Also, it is possible to think that the amount and concentration of the reactive product (amines) could have been much lower in these areas, which could have also accentuate the very pale image that is present there.  We have to remember that, for Rogers, the hair could have trapped a lot of the gas coming out of the nose and mouth, leaving much less gas on the sides of the face to react with the impurities at the surface of the cloth.  And in this particular case, since there are lighter bands on each side of the face, it’s very probable that there were not many impurities present in these areas in order to produce a coloration anyway.  So, in these particular areas, it is possible that there was not much gas present and not many impurities (and maybe a good distance between the corpse and the cloth).  I think all these factors put together (every one playing some role in the image formation process) are responsible for the drastic change in the intensity of the body image there.  I think, thanks to Rogers, that’s the most rational way to explain this drastic change.  And I think that the #3 factor that I mentioned could also explain why, on the contrary to the image of the sides of the face, we easily see the image of the hair !  Like Rogers said, it is probable that the hair could have trapped more gas with the result of producing a very intense and define image of the hair on the Shroud. \nTo conclude, I just want to say that it is also possible that there was other unknown factors at work in the Shroud and that they could also account partially for the drastic change of intensity we see on each side of the face.  Since we don’t know the exact process (or processes) that were at work in the Shroud, we have to leave the door open for some other influential factors that could have taken part in the image formation on the Shroud.  But nevertheless, I think the 3 major factors presented by Rogers could have been well enough to produce this kind of drastic change…  And what is the most important thing to note is that Rogers hypothesis is consistent with ALL the major facts and observations we know about the Shroud.  That’s the way the scientific method should be used (by taking account of every known elements and not just the ones that can fit well with your preconcieved ideas).\n\n","date":"June 8, 2012 at 1:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12096","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"\nWe have to remember that, for Rogers, the hair could have trapped a lot of the gas coming out of the nose and mouth, leaving much less gas on the sides of the face to react with the impurities at the surface of the cloth.

Honestly, I don’t know if the vertical isotropy aspect is a true fact of the image, but I just want to point out that if it were so, is in contradiction with an horizontal gas diffusion model from the nouse and mouth to the hair. In my opinion, the model by Rogers with a body emitting amines that react with a layer of impurities of the cloth, makes more sense if we think of a vertical flow of gas moving in a laminar regime. In fact, in my view, it is the only option. A horizontal motion of the gas from the nouse to to the hair would be very hard to explain according to the laws of fluid mechanics.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2012 at 2:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12097","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"Good point Gabriel.  I think it is possible, for the hair, to think that the gas there was not coming from the nose and mouth but was coming instead from urea (and maybe other biological products like lactic acid, etc.) that could have been left there in great quantity when the hair full of sweat would have dried.  After the drying of the sweat, this (or these) product(s) could have started to produce ammoniac gas that could have been much more concentrate in the hair than in other parts of the body (like maybe the sides of the face).  Some years ago, Thibault Heimburger wrote an excellent paper about the hypothesis of Rogers and he proposed a parallel hypothesis based on medical references he found out that proved that a tortured body like Jesus who surely produced a lot a sweating before dying could leave high amounts of urea on his skin. This urea then could have produced fairly rapidly (maybe after 24 hours or so) a released of some ammoniac gas.\nBut nevertheless, I still think that, for the very pale images on each side of the face, the most important factor of the 3 I’ve mentioned could well be the fact that there are 2 lighter bands there that could well contain very low amount of impurities…\n\n","date":"June 8, 2012 at 2:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12098","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"The hypothesis that the banding effect is due (solely) to a different linen thread used (either due to differences of impurities left on the thread or of a different growth condition of the linen) must match the weave pattern in almost all cases of banding effect found on the Shroud.

It’s pretty clear that, for Rogers, there was a rational explanation for these differences that would prevent him to look for a better hypothesis concerning the banding effect.  If he had not been able to explain these differences with satisfaction, you can bet your house that he would have changed his mind versus the banding effect on the Shroud.  But the fact is that he did not and, again, that speak very loud to me !  Here, we have to remember that Rogers was not the kind of scientist who wasn’t able to change his mind.  He followed honestly the scientific method, so much that, in fact, he had to really change his mind on some major aspects of the Shroud.  If he never had changed his mind on anything related to the Shroud, I wouldn’t be so sure of his conviction that there really was a strong correlation between the intensity of the body image and the intensity of the bands on the cloth, even if there are some differences on the cloth like you mentioned.

Remember that this process was going on AFTER the bleaching of the cloth, when the weaving was complete.  So, in all logic, it could have affected the appearence of the bands in some places by concentrating more impurities (especially those that were added to the fibers AFTER the bleaching, like the starch fraction for example) in some particular places of the weave.  I think this evaporation-concentration process is probably what can explain the best those apparent difference noted by Mario.  And if it’s so, that would mean that Rogers hypothesis concerning the bands cannot be discarded on that base.\nI want you to remember what I said the other day about the 3 major factors that, for Rogers, played a decisive role for the intensity of the coloration ?  For a refresh, here they are again :\n1-The relative distance between the cloth and the body.\n2-The relative amount of impurities present at the surface of the fibers.  Note : For Rogers, the banding effect was caused by some differences in the amount of impurities and these differences could have been important depending on how vigorous was the bleaching of each batch of yarns.  I also think it safe to assume that the evaporation-concentration process due to the washing and the drying of the cloth could also account partially for the probable variation in the amount of impurities that were left on-top of the fibers of the Shroud.\n3-The relative amount and concentration of a reactive product.  Note : For Rogers, this reactive product was in fact different sorts of amines coming from the corpse and it is very probable that more amines could have come out from some particular parts of the body (like the nose and the mouth) versus other parts of the body.\nNote the point #2 where I was already mentioning the possibility that the evaporation-concentration process could also account partially for the probable variation in the amount of impurities left on the fibers.  I should have also said that this process could well be responsible for a non-homogeneous repartition of these impurities on the fibers in many areas of the cloth.  In fact, I think I should have made a 4th point concerning the evaporation-concentration process, separate from the other 3 points, because I’m almost sure that Rogers thought that way.  To confirm this, here’s another quote from Rogers book concerning an experiment he made with dye, in order that we understand better the evaporation-concentration process and the way it works :  “Different types of cloth will show different degrees of concentration of the dye on the evaporating surface, EVEN ON DIFFERENT ADJOINING FIBERS.  It is possible to get dye concentration on both surfaces, while leaving the interior of the cloth white.”  \nI think this description from Rogers is well enough to understand that a non-homogeneous result in the concentration of impurities, at thread level as much as at fiber level, is what can be expect of the evaporation-concentration process that happened during the drying of the Shroud.  In that respect, I think my idea that this phenomenon could account, at least partially, for the observation made by Mario, is truly possible, especially if we take note of this description found in Rogers book…  Here, it’s important to understand one major particularity that can apply for almost every natural phenomenon : the non-homogeneous aspect of the result !  And this evaporation-concentration process is surely not different than most of the other natural phenomenon !  In fact, seeing a natural phenomenon producing a real and complete homogeneous result should be considered as something very exceptional…\nBefore I conclude, I want to report what Rogers said in his book, right after the quote I just gave you, when he talk about the Shroud itself : “The puzzling “half-tone” effect has been mentioned.” (Note : this concern the fact that, on the Shroud, it’s the difference in the concentration of colored fibers versus non-colored fibers that produced the intensity of the body image).  Let’s get back to Rogers quote :  “All of the colored fibers showed approximately the same color density under a microscope.  Assuming that the color formed by reactions with a very thin deposit of superficial impurities on the fibers, all of the fibers should have showed identical spectra and roughly the same intensity of color.  THEY DID.”\nI think this deserves some thoughts !  One thing’s for sure :  In regard of all the known facts and observations concerning the Shroud and the body image, the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the thin layer of carbohydrates impurities cannot be discard for the moment !  And I really think it’s exactly the same thing concerning his hypothesis about the banding effect…  No matter what the skeptics can think !  And, as I also said Saturday, I just can’t believe that a guy like Mario is not able to see the close correlation that exist almost everywhere on the Shroud between the intensity of the image color and the intensity of the bands, and so, no matter if Rogers hypothesis is correct or if it’s due to another thing, like the density of the threads, as reported by Thibault Heimburger the other day.  I’m just amazed to note that Mario don’t agree with the fact that there really is a close connection between the bands and the body image…\nI’m sorry for Mario but this is a FACT that there really is a close relationship between the intensity of the body image and the intensity of the bands on the Shroud and we can find a very good confirmation of that in this observation of the Shroud, reported by Rogers in his book : “A conservator of Turin’s Museum of Egyptology, Anna Maria Donadoni, point out locations where batches of yarns ended in the weft AND NEW YARN HAD BEEN INSERTED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WEAVING.  The yarn ends were laid side by side, and the weave was compressed with a comb.  The overlaps are often visible, even in high-resolution x-ray photographs.  When an overlap is observed, THE COLOR USUALLY CHANGES.  The color of the Shroud is not simply a result of changes in pure cellulose (linen).  Note :  When Rogers wrote “the color usually changes”, he refers to the color of the body image.  And because this particular change of color observed by Rogers represent a real FACT, this lead to only one rational conclusion :  A CLOSE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE BANDS ON THE SHROUD AND THE BODY IMAGE REALLY EXIST !!!  Understand that when I say “close correlation”, I don’t pretend it is a complete 100% correlation because the evaporation-concentration process done after the bleaching could have affected the bands in some places, along with their influence on the body image.  But nevertheless, if we trust Rogers opinion, there is a very good correlation between the bands and the body image that goes far beyond the possibility that it could be simply due to hazard.  In reality, how can there be changes of color in the body image when an overlap of threads is observed on the Shroud if there was no direct relationship between the body image and the banding effect ?  Good question, don’t you think ?  That’s precisely why Rogers was so sure about the fact that there really is a close connection between the bands and the body image on the Shroud.\nAs I said before, this close connection MIGHT BE EXPLAINED PROPERLY because it is a FACT.  And, for the moment, in regard of all the known data about the Shroud and his image, I don’t see any better and rational explanation that the one proposed by Rogers.  It’s as clear as that in my mind.  Of course, it doesn’t mean that Rogers was necessarily right, but it mean that his explanation is the most coherent we have right now.  And this can have great implications because, if Rogers is right about the banding effect, then he his probably right too about the image chromophore made of carbohydrates impurities on-top of the fibers.  And if it is so, consequently, that mean that the body image formation process have great chances to have come from some chemical reaction on the top-surface of the cloth instead of some burst of energy related to the resurrection of Christ, because, as Rogers said, it is highly improbable that any form of energy that would have been enough “energetic” to produce a coloration on the cloth would have only colored the thin layer of impurities and would not have affected, at the same time, the linen fibers under the coating, which is something unrelated to the reality of the Shroud (for Rogers).  I hope you can see more clearly now the real implication that is related to the exact nature of the banding effect on the Shroud !!!  If Rogers explanation is correct about this banding effect, I really think we can forget any kind of hypothesis involving some burst of energy, whether it would be related to the resurrection of Christ or not…\n\n","date":"June 11, 2012 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12211","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"I posted yesterday on the banding, and what I consider a major error of interpretation on Ray Rogers’ part. Here;s what i said. \nQuotation from Raymond Rogers’ 2004 (written one year before his demise):\nMy italics:\n“Where darker bands of yarn intersect image areas, the image is darker. Where lighter   bands intersect an image area, the image appears lighter. This proves that the image color is not a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen. Some impurities on the surface of the different batches of yarn produced the image color. This observation is extremely important when tests are being made on image-formation hypotheses. If image color is not simply a result of color formation in the cellulose of the linen fibers, image formation must be a much more complex process than we originally thought.”\nMy response: We see an image by the light that it reflects or scatters onto our retinas, but the latter depends not only on the light absorbing/reflecting properties of the image itself (obviously) but, less obviously, on what is underneath the image. That is especially the case where the image is exceedingly thin and superficial.  If the underlay were, say,  pure matt black, absorbing all light that passed through the image layer and fell on it, then less light can be reflected/scattered back to illuminate the image layer from underneath, and the image will tend to look darker than it would be in the absence of the underlay.\nConversely, if the underlay were pure white linen, with a propensity to reflect/scatter white light, then there would be additional illumination from underneath, and the image layer would look brighter.\nIt follows that an image on darker-coloured weave will tend to look darker than one on lighter-coloured weave., due to differences in illumination from BELOW.\nThese considerations render null and void the claim of  Raymond Rogers (RIP) that the image is not imprinted on the fibre itself, but in a superficial impurity coating. The effect he describes, and failed properly to interpret, tells one NOTHING whatsoever about where the image is located, except that is somewhat superficial.\n “This proves that the image color is not a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen.”? Nope, it proves nothing…\nThere is other evidence too that the assumption by Rogers that the image is in an impurity layer (largely based it seems on the writings of Pliny), formed by a purely hypothetical Maillard reaction between supposed reducing sugars in the impurities and volatile amines from post mortem decay (cadaverine, putrescine etc) is ruled out by Rogers’ own observation in the same paper that the Shroud’s image-bearing  areas are not enriched in nitrogen. (All amines contain nitrogen, the amine group being -NH2).\n\n","date":"June 11, 2012 at 11:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12212","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"And what do you make of this other quote from Rogers : ” A conservator of Turin’s Museum of Egyptology, Anna Maria Donadoni, point out locations where batches of yarns ended in the weft AND NEW YARN HAD BEEN INSERTED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WEAVING.

What I really wanted to say is this :  If Mario Latendresse’s observation regarding a possible difference that can exist in some places (like the region of the face) between the banding effect and the weave on the Shroud was really something new (like a new discovery for example) that Rogers couldn’t have been aware, I would agree that this observation could be considered as really problematic versus his hypothesis concerning the banding effect.  But since it’s not something new (in fact, it seem like a pretty obvious observation for anyone who look at the Shroud very closely), it’s evident that an observation like that could not have been missed by Rogers, during the time he was analysing the banding effect on the Shroud.  Here, we have to keep in mind that, on the contrary to all of us, he stayed with the Shroud 5 days and nights in 1978 and had the chance to see the cloth more closer than almost anyone in history !  Also, it’s very clear in Rogers writings that he did look closely at the x-ray and UV photographs of the Shroud when he was working to find a scientific explanation for the banding effect.  So I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the fact that he was fully aware of the particularity reported on this blog by Mario Saturday.  \nTaking this as a fact, we have to presume that if, in the eyes of Rogers, this would have constitute a real problem versus his own hypothesis, he would have taken note of that and search elsewhere for a better explanation.  And the fact that he did not and that he defend his hypothesis until the end of his life speaks very loud concerning this “apparent” problematic.   In sum, for Rogers, there’s no doubt that the observation reported by Mario never represented a real problem; most probably because he was able to explain it rationally INSIDE his own hypothesis, i.e. with all the elements and processes that are include in his hypothesis.  Of course, Rogers is not here with us to confirm my reflection, but anyway, I just can’t see Rogers missing an observation like that, directly related to the banding effect on the Shroud.\n\n","date":"June 11, 2012 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12213","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"In any discussion of banding based on the photographs in the post, it’s a case of “let the viewer beware”. Why? Because the photographs in question are light-dark reversed relative to the image on the Shroud, so what we see as two prominent dark bands, one on each side of the face, look far more dominant a feature of the image than is the case when viewing the “pseudo negative” of the Shroud. One also suspects that there has been adjustment of the brightness/contrast control that accentuates the so-called banding effect.\nAnyone inclined to think that the banding is due primarily to yarn differences could do a lot worse than look at an HD picture of the  Shroud in close up, one that shows the image in relation to the herring-bone weave. Here’s  a link to the picture , apparently a video still, which David Rolfe briefly placed into the public domain – as a banner on his Enigma blog – and then inexplicably withdrew. I have taken his “positive” and reversed it back to a pseudo-negative, as per Shroud.\nLook closely and you will see the “banding” as two lighter regions close to the outer limits of the eyes, with darker regions resuming where the hair is imaged.There is no abrupt transition from light to dark, as one might imagine from the positives. Indeed, the imaging of the eyebrows extends into the banded region, showing that the image is still there, albeit weaker, but definitely not absent. That would argue against any suggestion of a tenting effect that prevented any image-imprinting at all, at least in a model that disallows imaging if there is a sizeable gap between subject and cloth.\nWhat fascinates me most about the Rolfe HD image is not so much the banding, as those two “bloodstains”, and the manner in which they are largely indistinguishable from other imaged areas inasmuch as the image is confined mainly to the crowns of the fibres. How can anyone claim that the bloodstains are underneath the image areas if they are indistinguishable from image, at least in a photograph?  OK, the claim would make sense if one could peel off the blood and reveal an image-free area, but I for one to see how anything could be peeled off from those two “bloodstains”, given the location on ribs, with little if any carry-over into the intervening furrows.\nThere are so many questions that could be addressed and hopefully resolved if only we had access to more of the HD image, comparable to the panel in my link.? So what’s preventing you, or the Turin custodians, from releasing all of this vital resource into the public domain, David Rolfe?\n\n","date":"June 9, 2012 at 3:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12106","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"Why do you address such demands (high definition photographs) to David Rolfe when actually the largest collections of high definition photographs and macrophotographs is under the control (and ownership) of the Turin authority ?\n\n","date":"June 9, 2012 at 5:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-12108","author":"latendre","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer","post":"Why?
