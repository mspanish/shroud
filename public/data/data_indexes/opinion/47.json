It is quite clear Meyer has based his impressions of the Shroud exclusively from the writings of J. Nickell…An unfortunate decision. But one that many I`ve come across have done. I`ve dealt with many such people (Nincompoops, I like to call them) on youtube and other blogs. People who are too lazy or just too simple-minded to understand; One must read from all sources of information before coming to a decision, which includes all pro and con opinions and viewpoints. One also wonders who these “scientific and technical“ people are, which Nickells “collaborated with“? Does Nickells have the scientific or technical background to actually make the claims he does?…I would think not, infact I know he doesn`t, but that doesn`t seem to matter, aslong as people stay rigid in their research practices. Writers such as Nickells, Freeman and such are a huge detriment to the true scientific, historical and archaelogical facts, concerning the Shroud, being spread to the masses and their arguments must be dealt with, with much diligence, or we will have a world filled with Nincompoops.\nR\n\n","date":"August 26, 2012 at 10:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/freethought-or-cafeteria-thinking/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-15486","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
