In its original form, where heat was supplied by the fan heater on the back wall of the oven, I had to roast linen at a very high  air temperature  (180-200 degrees C) in order to get the flour imprint to turn brown.\nWith revised Model 10, using the electric element (“grill”) in the top of the oven, the oven thermometer that records air temperature rarely rises above 80 degrees C while the imprint turns a dark golden-brown. In other words, the flour is being ‘cooked’ directly by absorption of radiant infrared energy. The air, being largely transparent to infrared radiation, is scarcely heated at all.\nSo Model 10 has joined the ranks of “radiation models”, but with a difference. A corpse is not required to become incandescent,  scorching an image onto linen across air gaps –  fanciful thinking if ever there was.\nThank you for you interest, and for sharing your thoughts (but for now I’ll stick with my own revised Model 10!).\n","date":"August 8, 2017 at 5:50 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-9853","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature","post":"I found here – by accident – an interesting story…\nActually I am working close with thermal paper industry – but I am not a chemist – so here is some idea…\nIn case of thermal paper you use a leuco dye – in this story the lemon juice – and a developer.

Much of the information, although well advertised in general, I had not seen in detail before, and it makes very interesting reading. And some, especially your work, is completely new to me.\nAnyway, back to the custard…\n1) Smearing a bas relief in ammonia caramel and covering it with a sheet, or pressing it onto a sheet lying on a cushion of material produces less dimensionality than a scorch. The half-tone effect is very clear, with more or fewer coloured fibres per thread giving a lighter or darker image, and some fibres carry the image through to the other side of the sheet, but the 3D effect is so muddled by variations in pressure and ‘ink’ density at any particular place that the overall result is very un-shroudlike.\n2) Soaking material in cornflour starch, rinsing and allowing it to dry, then pressing a hot template into it does not make a noticeable difference in colour from using untreated linen. Pressing sellotape hard over scorched material and peeling it off does not noticeably diminish the image, and I find no trace of removeable coating on the sellotape (although there is a fair amount of particulate matter). When you press sellotape over cloth and pull it off, the contact area remains in the sellotape as a regular pattern of deformed patches in the glue, basically a mould of the cloth. It was presumably on the inside of this mould that Rogers observed his discolouration layer, but I wonder how he knew that the fibre from which it came was now clear and colourless.\nDo you know if there are any photos of any of the slides of sellotape at, say, 25X magnification? We often see immense closeups, but apart from one of some of Reis’s samples at about life size, that seems to be it. As my own work is mostly done at between 25X and 200X, it would be interesting to compare them.\n","date":"October 26, 2012 at 2:19 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1016","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature","post":"I think the point is that the image of the Shroud is not “non-fluorescing”. It just fluoresces less than the background. The UV-vis spectra of image and ‘red’ scorch are even almost the same:\n“When the photoelectric data are convolved with the scotopic response curve and normalized (Fig. 9), it becomes obvious that the background linen itself is responsible for the measured response of the blood and image areas, since there is an identical wavelenght characteristic. This agrees with the visual description. The curve for scorches having visual reflectance corresponding to that of image areas shows only a light weighting toward the orange region relative to the curves for body image, although the color difference is obvious to the eye and in the fluorescence photography. The explanation might be that the eye has an excellent ability to distinguish between colour differences when compared side by side.” (Pellicori, Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin, Applied Optics, Vol. 19, No 12, 1980, p. 1919).\nSo, it is is not that the image formation should produce no fluorescence at all, it should only produce less fluorescence than it takes away. If the Shroud threads were wiped with starch paste at weaving just as you dabbed the linen with your finger, Hugh, touching only individual fibers, this might indeed explain some of the ‘half tone effect’ of the Shroud image.\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 8:06 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1015","author":"Adrie","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature","post":"Oh my – you guys have gone into overdrive, and I’m suffering a degree of sensory overload at the moment, what with the fluorescence of this or that class of burn or scorch, and now these various coatings on the linen.\nThe important thing is to stay focused on key essentials, or we’ll all get swamped in detail. Might I suggest that the Shroud’s negative image is the key characteristic that makes it distinctive, and since most are agreed that no artist of a pre-modern era would attempt to paint a negative, whether with sulphuric acid, lemon juice or gravy browning, then the most likely explanation is imprinting off a bas-relief or other semi-3D object.  Was that done by applying some kind of pigment to a person’s face, obtaining an imprint then roasting, as per Garlaschelli, or was it obtained by direct thermal imprinting (“scorching”) off a bas-relief replica, like a Plaster of Paris death mask say, either with impregnated or unimpregnated linen (pyrolysed coating or pyrolysed linen?).\nSpeaking for myself,  I like  the idea of pyrolysis being the main source of colour, since that would leave no easy-to-spot-at-100-yards artists’ or chemical pigments. But is it pyrolysed linen or pyrolysed additive or a combination of the two?  The lemon juice system is a model if nothing else. Does a lemon juice image fluoresce? Is it reducible by diimide and decolorised? Does it strip off with adhesive tape more easily than a scorch on plain linen? Is it uniformly yellow, without “burned bits” (see Thibault’s new paper)?\nI for one am going to have a long hard think about the image characteristics, but do please keep those assorted experiments and approaches coming. They may or may not be relevant, but without new data there is less scope for Mother Serendipity to put in an appearance… The good lady has rescued more than one of my previous research projects, just when I thought I was getting nowhere…\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 5:26 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1011","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature","post":"You guys sure are fast, I can only just keep up 🙂 (if this is good English)\nThis is the comment I made on The Other Site a while ago http://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/\nSo, Hugh, if you like, you might read my article http://jesusking.info/Internal%20selvedge.pdf  or the parts you think are useful now.

With these four specimens soaked for ten minutes, lightly rinsed and dried, I heated individual spatulas (so they all started the same temperature) in a flame for a measured 10 seconds, and then applied them for 5 seconds to my cloths. The custard cloth scorched about as well as untreated linen, the others more so, especially the potassium hydroxide one. All of them fluoresced. All showed more marked scorching of the upper fibres of each thread, and all transmitted some discolouration on the reverse of the cloth. So far so good.\nHowever, thinking about a purely surface layer of degraded carbohydrate led me to a bottle of gravy browning, with ingredients: Water, Ammonia Caramel, Salt, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum and Potassium Sorbate, all good healthy ingredients that shouldn’t upset anybody’s spectrographic analysis. It’s a thickish goo, so I dipped one finger in, wiped it on a finger of the other hand, and dabbed a sample of linen. Brilliant. Discolouration only of individual fibres, darker in the middle where pressure is greatest and more fibres were touched, lighter at the edges where only a few fibres received a slight grazing. Some individual fibres conducted the colour along their length and round to the back of the cloth.\nThis result led me to re-thinking painting. Leaving aside the stylistic arguments, everybody seems to be agreed that no artist could have painted the cloth, as the medium would have soaked through, the paint particles would be conspicuous and it would have been impossible for him to paint individual fibres, leaving others completely untouched. This is not necessarily true. Get a felt-tipped pen and scribble lightly on some cloth, or a finger wiped with goo and dab on it, and look (under a 25X microscope) at what turns up. For a start individual fibres take the colour, and some are not touched, for a second the medium doesn’t soak from fibre to fibre, but along fibres (which is how the colour turns up on the other side), and even under 400X, the particles responsible for the colour cannot be seen (I think I did see salt crystals).\nA finger, of course, is not a good way of testing the “photographic negative” or the “3d information” aspects of the image, but watch this space…\nI’m not keen on gas diffusion, and am more convinced by physical contact. However there do seem to be at least two aspects to the image which must be derived from it, the direct, upper-surface degradation and the indirect, whole-fibre degradation (much paler). Scorches of various kinds, sufficiently controlled, seem to be able to provide this, but if we postulate some sort of chemical carbohydrate-based pre-treatment of the linen, a layer which degrades when the image is formed, why not also image a layer, transferred by contact, which has already degraded (basically caramel)?\nAlthough I’m still doubtful about any of these coatings, it would be interesting to find out if the non-image fibres had the same sort of coating that Rogers thinks is present on the image, but in an un-degraded form.\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 4:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1009","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature","post":"Hey Ho, I’m off to buy a lemon.

These margins at least contain:\n– many red iron oxide particles (from iron in water originally used for the retting of the linen. (H&A, A Chemical Investigation, p. 45-46, 50)\n– a higher concentration of calcium, compared to the almost uniform distribution on the cloth, implying it derives form the manufacture of the linen (Adler, Chemical and Physical, p. 23)\n– all sorts of debris, as all sticky tapes do.\nThe water stain margin at the edge of the Raes corner contained a higher concentration of salts than those in the rest of the Shroud (Adler, http://www.shroud.com/adler2.htm ).\nMy hypothesis is that the Shroud has a very thin film of starch that was dyed with an acidic dilute madder dye solution (pale yellow). A madder dye solution can be made by boiling dried crushed madder root in acidified water and/or by fermenting. (http://footguards.tripod.com/06ARTICLES/ART33_madder.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madder ).\nFirst-century Jews used vinegar for acidification of water (cf. the “vinegar” offered to Jesus on the cross Jn 19,29). Pliny talks about “some small drops of vinegar” (minimo aceti asperu) used in the water for making a fine starch paste. In Latin, acetum was sour wine, but perhaps sometimes lemon was used to acidify water.\nThe colorants of madder are the carbohydrates alizarin and purpurin, which fluoresce in the violet-blue and yellow-red. Together with the light blue fluorescence of the lignin in uncompletely bleached linen, they could explain the faint and mottled yellow-green background fluorescence of the Shroud. The image formation then transformed this film (plus perhaps the primary cell wall), quenching the background fluorescence.\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-1012","author":"Adrie","site":"colinberry"}]
