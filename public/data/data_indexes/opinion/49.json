[{"title":"God Does Whatever He Feels Like","post":"“…not a painting, not a scorch, not a photograph…”\nNo, but possibly a ‘chemograph’, obtained using then state-of-the-art 13/14th century alchemy (calcining of metal sulphates and nitrates to obtain nitric acid fumes).\nHere’s my latest result- just an hour or so old:\n\nI’ll describe in detail how it was obtained in my next blog posting (which may take a day or two). For now let’s just say that a viscous dispersion was made of white flour in hot water that was then painted onto my brass crucifix. A negative image was imprinted onto linen that was then allowed to dry (becoming near-invisible). The imprinted linen was then suspended overnight in a jar filled with nitric acid (HNO3) fumes. The linen turns a beige colour (aged look?) with the faint yellow-brown imprint you see above (the photo has been autocorrected in MS Office Picture Manager). There was no appreciable reverse side image, possibly because the swollen gelatinized wheat starch granules still have some kind of particulate properties, making it difficult to penetrate the weave.\nThese are early days. There’s a vast number of changes that can be rung with this ‘nitric fumigation’ model. I’ve briefly tested the effect of increasing the NOx content in the fumigation jar (by adding copper wire that generates visible NO2 as red-brown fumes, and no doubt invisible NO as well). The extra NOx does not appear to improve on the mainly HNO3 -developed image you see above.\nNote the parallel with pre-digital photography, using a developing agent to produce a visible image. That allows for constant visual inspection to achieve an optimised end-result, unlike ‘hit or miss’ contact-scorching with a heated template.  As I say, it’s not photography, but chemography. The technique could be adapted to work with a real person, needless to say, pre- or post mortem, though the first of those might object to being painted with goo, even edible goo.\n\n","date":"April 18, 2015 at 5:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/18/god-does-whatever-he-feels-like/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-196682","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"God Does Whatever He Feels Like","post":"Chemograph…love it.

The thrust of the TOF post was history, not science. I look forward to informed comments in this chain on history pre Lirey of the Shroud including expected skeptical denials.  – even from Colin.\nI would hope the skeptics would supply reason for that refutation of the history discussed at length in the TOF post with something more than invective.\nOne of the comments on TOF blog itself was the claim that the posting had plagiarized Markwardt and Scavone. That would be difficult because Markwardt and Scavone have a scholarly disagreement about the timing of the arrival of the Shroud in Constantinople. Markwardt places it there earlier than either Scavone or Wilson has written. \nMoreover, you can’t plagiarize history. One case on that point was Harry Lincoln’s ill-fated lawsuit against Dan Brown. Lincoln was one of the four authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail (HBHG). He claimed that Brown had plagiarized HBHG in the DaVinci Code because he wrote of the Knights Templar having possession of the Shroud at some point. Brown won the law suit because of a very simple legal proposition: You can’t plagiarize history. What can’t be plagiarized are the author’s words if they are uniquely his or hers. Brown, Scavone and Wilson are writing historical texts. Any event that they report as an historical event can be reported as history by another author, but the second author can not do so in the original author’s unique own words without attribution.\nIncidentally, to accuse an author of plagiarism without a factual-legal basis might be actionable slander. For example, I quote Tacitus, Boris Pasternak and Elaine Pagels in quotations of paragraph length or more in my book Quantum Christ with proper attribution and in Pagel’s case with her explicit permission. The other two authors were deceased at the time of my writing. Were someone to criticize me for saying I plagiarized those authors, that would potentially be a slander. Were they say I had just copied Tacitus or Pasternak, that would not be slander.\nOne omission from the TOF post which is very relevant is a discussion of the Justinian coins that demonstrate “Vignon markings.” Both Wilson and Markwardt have written of them.\nYou can read or download Markwardt’s presentation at the 2014 St. Louis conference at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf  It is documented with 251 footnotes.

Sulphuric acid weakened linen, but not cotton (recent posting on my site). What about nitric acid?\n\nSame finding. It was possible to tear the nitric-acid treated linen (albeit with considerable force), but not the nitric acid-treated cotton. The discoloration by nitric was arguably greater with linen, looking at before-and-after comparisons.\nI haven’t checked out cotton as a recipient for an imprinted image as yet, the chief interest being linen for obvious reasons.\n\n","date":"April 18, 2015 at 3:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/18/god-does-whatever-he-feels-like/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-196740","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"God Does Whatever He Feels Like","post":"There is no hurry, Colin, take your time.

One paints a person or effigy thereof with a gooey substance that after chemical development will provide the body image. While the goo is still wet and tacky, one adds trails and dribbles of blood on top of the goo. One then stretches linen over the body and presses. One removes the linen with its two separate imprints – body and blood. The blood stains on the linen are now UNDERNEATH the imprinted goo. After developing (to change goo into yellow pigment) one finds there is NO yellow body image underneath the bloodstains, It looks for all the world like a pre-bloodied man left a later body image on linen.

One can have the right ideas for the wrong reasons and vice versa. That’s science bizz. \nPrior to that,  the blood-first-image-second chronology had been a huge embarrassment for the scorch hypothesis. In a forgery scenario, one needed the image first in order to know where to apply the blood, and I made no attempt to wave aside the problem.\nSo forgive me if I say that this current ‘chemograph’ hypothesis, based on initial painting or smearing with a gooey paste or gel followed immediately by application of blood to all the right places is\n not “going to great lengths” as you put it. It’s a simple straightforward way to end up with a combined blood/body image that is consistent with the deposition of a crucified man into Joseph of Arimathea’s linen (straight from the cross in fact, before transport to tomb, with the linen acting as a makeshift stretcher, as reflected in a lot of medieval art, or indeed as up-and-over ‘body bag’ in modern parlance, it being the decent thing to do to a deceased and bloodied man while spectators are still present). \nNo, the forgers would not have been in the least bit concerned about the fact that blood image was under body image, or have given it a second thought. All that mattered from a practical standpoint was successful transfer of blood from subject to linen despite the presence of an ‘undercoat’ on the SUBJECT (not final linen)  of body-imprinting goo. Reminder: in the current model, goo and blood are being applied to the subject, not the linen. In passing, note the different geometry vis-a-vis Luigi Garlaschelli’s frottage model, where the linen is laid over subject first, then powder or slurry applied piecemeal onto the top surface under constant visual surveillance (“No, add a bit more there…). That is not pure ‘passive’ imprinting technology in my view, the prolonged manual moulding tempting the operative to add ‘artistic’ effects that are not possible when the two imprinting media are out of sight UNDER the linen. There’s then a real risk of going “too far round the sides” and risking excessive lateral distortion, os which there’s some on the TS , but very slight and not immediately apparent we’re told.\n100% passive imprinting is more likely to give the necessary high grade 3D rendering, free of obvious wrap-around effects, in my humble opinion than anything that allows for artistic licence, no matter how minimal.  I hope I’ve made my meaning clear…\n\n","date":"April 18, 2015 at 11:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/18/god-does-whatever-he-feels-like/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-196784","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"God Does Whatever He Feels Like","post":"Colin, it is not like that on the Shroud.
