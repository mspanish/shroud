There are many other potential answers including the combinations of “not atheist or religious”.  Further, the study is flawed due to the wording “convinced atheist.”  Why is there a need for a modifier to atheist?  Perhaps these are two different categories that need differentiation.  The wording would seem to imply that the hoped result is to increase the answers to atheism rather than providing a wide array of combinations which would give a much more nuanced result.  How disappointing.\n\n","date":"August 15, 2012 at 7:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/15/off-topic-major-shifts-in-religiosity-and-atheism-reported/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-15032","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Off Topic:  Major Shifts in Religiosity and Atheism Reported","post":"I passed the URL for the report on to a few NZ acquaintances.  Here’s two comments I received back: \nGG: “I feel the information re the increased % of people having no religion or being atheists in USA is not accurate in my opinion.  There are more Hispanics now and many are Catholics.”\nPMC: “I do wonder if it is indeed a rise in atheism, or rather a rise in the number of people admitting to, or facing up to, atheism – an atheism that was always there, but perhaps not accepted by themselves.  In other words – How many people in this “rise” have actively and recently denounced or ceased religious practice?    Or perhaps it might be that more people are coming to realise that they are atheistic, or have not actively followed Christianity for a long time, if ever…  just got around to formally stating their lack of religious interest?” \nI’d agree with Andy Weiss that the survey question is deficient and appears to be loaded.  Some sponsored surveys are merely looking for a headline for a slow news day.  It requires a rare professional skill to design a truly objective survey, including insights from disciplines in psychology, critical thinking, and mathematical statistics.  Much of the time they’re designed by no more than some amateur “think group” or committee, who think they know better than the professionals.  \nMy own comment: “Americans who say they are ‘religious’ dropped from 73 percent in 2005 (the last time the poll was conducted) to 60 percent.  At the same time, the number of Americans who say they are atheists rose, from 1 percent to 5 percent. This ‘change(?)’ would suggest that USA could still claim to be a religious country, well ahead of several others (probably including NZ).”\n\n","date":"August 16, 2012 at 3:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/15/off-topic-major-shifts-in-religiosity-and-atheism-reported/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-15038","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
