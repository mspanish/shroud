Falava sempre do essencial e evitava  envolver-se desnecessariamente com formas externas. Seu grande tema foi a atitude do homem diante de si mesmo e do cosmo. …\n>A influência de Blavatsky sobre Einstein foi investigada pela biógrafa Sylvia Cranston: \n>“Robert Millikan pode ter sido um dos primeiros cientistas a apresentar ‘A Doutrina Secreta’ para Einstein. De 1921 a 1945 ele foi o diretor do Laboratório Norman Bridges no Instituto de Tecnologia da Califórnia, em Pasadena; ele era também o presidente do comitê executivo do Cal Tech. Nos anos 30, Millikan ajudou a trazer Einstein para os Estados Unidos. Por três verões, Einstein trabalhou em Cal Tech, antes de aceitar um posto em Princeton. Millikan estava profundamente interessado em ‘A Doutrina Secreta’. …\nLink:  http://www.filosofiaesoterica.com/ler.php?id=597 \nHere a rough translation (Google) :\nThe Encyclopaedia Britannica states that Einstein is comparable to Isaac Newton because each revolutionized their time physics. What Britannica does not say is that both Einstein and Newton were mystical thinkers and esoteric philosophy students. …\nGreat soul, mature thinker, Einstein wrote to people of all religions and philosophies. Always spoke of the essential and avoided getting involved unnecessarily with external forms. His great theme was the man’s attitude toward himself and the cosmos. …\nThe influence of Blavatsky about Einstein was investigated by biographer Sylvia Cranston:\n “Robert Millikan may have been one of the first scientists to present ‘The Secret Doctrine’ for Einstein. From 1921 to 1945 he was the director of the Norman Bridges Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena; he was also the chairman of the executive committee of the Cal Tech.

The first volume is primarily concerned with the evolution of the Universe. The backbone of this volume consists of seven rooms, translated from the Book of Dzyan, with commentary and explanation of HPB In this volume there is also an extensive elucidation of the fundamental symbols contained in the great religions and mythologies of the world. The second volume contains a further series of rooms from ‘The Book of Dzyan’ which describes the evolution of Humanity…\n— — *** *** — —\nInstead Saint Luke is believed by many scholars to be a Greek physician who lived in the Greek city of Antioch in Ancient Syria, though some other scholars and theologians think Luke was a Hellenic Jew…\nLinks (about the Ancient Hellenistic World):As Jesus prayed on the mount of Olives, “his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground” (Lk. 22:44). Did blood actually come from the Lord’s skin, or is the language merely a figure of speech emphasizing the Savior’s agony? The only New Testament writer to mention this phenomenon is Luke, a physician (Col. 4:14).\nHere I should write a few lines on the ancient medical knowledge and the visual examination of the Shroud …\nI believe that the Shroud has nothing to do with Madame Blavatsky, but … See also the possible (or impossible) connections:\nShroud-Antioch-theory by Markwardt-St Luke and the Shroud…\nThe idea of Messiah can also be found in Buddhism, where the bodhisattva Maitreya plays a similar function as a Messiah… It is said that Maitreya’s coming will occur after the teachings of the current Buddha Gautama, the Dharma, are no longer taught and are completely forgotten…\nNow I apologize for the possible (great) confusion (!) occurred with the use of a series of mental associations (perhaps not always entirely consistent) … \nBut yesterday I have spent some time rereading a book by prof. P.L. Baima Bollone:\n“L’ identità di Gesù. La vera storia di Gesù Bambino” (= The identity of Jesus. The true story of the Child Jesus.).\nThis book breaks away from misconceptions  (and in that book there are also reported interesting theosophical and anthroposophic  tracks) and try to trace the identity of Jesus and the events of his birth on the basis of biological and natural that can be seen in the sources. \nTheosophy teaches the unity of man and the equality of all races, creeds, color and sex. Blavatsky believed in the world religions, and the coming of the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, the Ajita Bodhisattva, “that would return to teach the pure Dharma, at a time of darkness on the earth, when the Dharma will have been forgotten.” ( Wikipedia)\nSo…  Blavatsky believed the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, is linked to the Return of Jesus and the other ascendant masters. Blavatsky talked of a so-called Christ Principle, which in her view corresponds to the spiritual essence of every human being.\nMaitreya is a bodhisattva who in the Buddhist tradition is to appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor of the historic Śākyamuni Buddha. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya references a time when the Dharma will seem to be forgotten on Jambudvipa. … \nIn his eulogy to Isaac Newton written in 1927, the bicentenary of the great man’s death, Einstein called him a “shining spirit”. But I do not think there is a real parallel between Einstein (= science, theosophy, politics, etc.) And Newton (= science, alchemy!).

But that seldom prevented me praying for enlightenment that I might achieve a solution for the more intractable problems.  \nThe case of Laplace is curious.  He was an avowed determinist, in much the same way as Omar Khayyam’s “And the first Morning of Creation wrote / What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.”  His major scientific contribution was in demonstrating the stability of the solar system, notwithstanding its apparent perturbations, Newton previously having concluded that divine intervention was occasionally necessary to restore equilibrium.  Laplace was able to announce the invariability of planetary mean motion (average angular velocity).  He is noted for his first use of the “potential function” in his gravitational work, and which subsequently found applications in such diverse fields as magnetism, electricity, heat flow, and fluid mechanics (specifically in the equation of continuity).  The Laplace partial differential equation is pervasive throughout physics. \nSurprisingly, despite his philosophic determinism, Laplace also made major contributions to the theory of probability, proving the Central Limit Theorem and that the distribution of errors in large data samples approximates to the normal distribution.  I am unaware of how Laplace reconciled his determinism with his achievements in probability.  I believe Laplace’s determinism was dealt the death blow, by the later discoveries in quantum mechanics, where everything seemed to be entirely probabilistic.  No underlying variables determining which specific atom would decay into another were found, only that a definite quantity ever did, leading to Einstein’s expression of frustration “The old one does not play dice with his creation”.  I think it may have been Schrodinger who  scolded Einstein “Stop telling God what to do with his dice”. \nThe problem of evil in a God-given world is perennial, and many great minds have attempted to address this problem, the most ancient being the Book of Job, albeit with a conclusion I consider unsatisfactory, as Job ends up by overcoming all his adversities, hardly the common experience of more general personal suffering.  It does attempt an answer to “Why do bad things happen to good people, while sinners may seem to prosper.”  Augustine and the ancient Jewish writers thought they found an answer in man’s first act of disobedience to God-given commands and a doctrine of original sin, together with some personified demonology. \nTo some extent it depends on how evil is defined.  Is it part of God’s plan, for example, that it is the “Selfish gene” that should predominate, and determine the course of evolution by ensuring endurance and hence survival of the fittest?  Is this what made Christ’s redemptive act necessary, but yet pointed to a better way in the command to “Love one another” rather than compulsively following the fallacy of exclusive self-interest?      \nApart from the adversities arising from Nature in its act of giving birth and final fulfillment, whatever that might come to, true evil always seems to be a product of man’s freedom to act in a way contrary to what his true nature ought to be.  Thus the Nazi holocaust was the product of men free to act in a way contrary to decent human values.  The excuse of “acting under orders” was never able to exonerate them.  Nor could it be said to be a product of Laplacian determinism, but despicable acts of men acting freely, and certainly under no compulsion from God. \nI appreciate that what I have written may convince no confirmed atheist, who sees the presence of evil as his principle argument against the divine.  However, if there is evil, there is also good, and we might well ask whence does good come from.  It is significant I think that we are able to discern the distinction between the two, and we should ask “how does that come about?”\n\n","date":"January 2, 2015 at 5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-180702","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"Millions of children have been tortured and killed in History by: a) serial killers, war criminals and so on; b) Natural disasters as tsunamis, earthquakes, floods and so on.

I think Otto seemed to have a good understanding that God’s ways are not man’s ways, and  made it very clear that God is not to be judged in terms of human standards – He is the ineffable!  If you do not understand the statement “mystery of a God sometimes awful”, I suggest you do not understand Otto. \nThe point is that God has given man the freedom to act how he will, and with it goes the responsibility of man to use that freedom for good, not evil.  If man uses his freedom to do evil, then it is man who has to be held accountable, not God!  That is the true meaning of sin!  It is man who has acted in an evil way.  For whatever reason, God does not choose to correct every evil act perpetrated by man.  Indeed, to do so, would be to abrogate man’s responsibility in the matter.  Otherwise, one might construct a scenario whereby man could do whatever he willed, secure in the knowledge that God would correct any consequent evil arising from such an act, and could then abdicate from the responsibility of his actions.  But that is not how our world works.   \nWhen it comes to the consequences of natural disasters, the earth will do what the earth does, whether it is earthquake, flood, storms or tsunami.  God has given man the intelligence to deal with such disasters, which are not to be seen as punishments from God as the old superstitions believed.  An illustration:  I read in the news of some moderate earthquake occurring where there are poor construction standards and which has had devastating effects with great loss of life.  However if the same earthquake occurred in New Zealand, California or Japan, then it would only have moderate effects with much less trauma, as engineers there have set construction standards to withstand such forces.  There was great loss of life in Japan following a tsunami there a few years ago.  The effect has been to create an awareness of the danger, and not have people rushing to the coast to ogle at the wonder of a tsunami.  To take an extreme case: If you build your house on a volcano, you are not entitled to be surprised at the consequences.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2015 at 5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-180980","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"I think that during the debate has been forgotten a professor Lawrence Krauss …\nKrauss is one of the few living physicists described by Scientific American as a “public intellectual”…\nIn a story cosmological nailing attention and “at the same time enlightens us”, the pioneer of theoretical physics Lawrence Krauss explains the latest innovative scientific advances that overturn the most fundamental philosophical questions.\nWe can read that:\n>Krauss is an atheist activist and self-described antitheist.\n>Krauss has participated in many debates with theologians and apologists, including Hamza Tzortzis and William Lane Craig…\n>Krauss also featured in a full-length documentary entitled The Unbelievers, in which he and Richard Dawkins travel across the globe speaking publicly about the importance of science and reason as opposed to religion and superstition\n>In his book, A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing (2012), Krauss discusses the premise that something cannot come from nothing, which has often been used as an argument for the existence of an uncaused cause, or creator.\n>He has since argued in a debate with John Ellis and Don Cupitt that the laws of physics allow for the universe to be created from nothing. “What would be the characteristics of a universe that was created from nothing, just with the laws of physics and without any supernatural shenanigans? The characteristics of the universe would be precisely those of the ones we live in.”\n>In an interview with The Atlantic, however, he states that he has never claimed that “questions about origins are over.” >According to Krauss, “I don’t ever claim to resolve that infinite regress of why-why-why-why-why; as far as I’m concerned it’s turtles all the way down.” \nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_M._Krauss\n— — —\n>The book ends with an afterword by Richard Dawkins in which he compares the potential impact of the book to that of The Origin of Species — a comparison that Krauss himself called “pretentious.” …\n… … …\n>In “New Scientist”, Michael Brooks wrote:\n“Krauss will be preaching only to the converted.

Instead of eliminating religion—a Sisyphean task if there ever was one—atheists can help to move religion in a more loving, tolerant, and open-minded direction. We can’t make much traction tearing religion down, but maybe we can make the world a kinder and better place.\nSo… Krauss announced us something irrational?\nPerhaps someday we will face the fact that the most palpable assumption in physics is also the deepest unknown: Time…\n… And then some good intention can exist also in the field of atheists!  But we really have to depend on atheists, we are unable to examine our ideas Krauss?\n— — —\nRemaining in the field of mythology-cosmogony here is what I have found, I have found something about “Abraxas”:\nA vast number of engraved stones are in existence, to which the name “Abrasax-stones” has long been given.\nBut it is uncertain what the actual role and function of Abraxas was in the Basilidian system …\n…and Basilides (Greek: Βασιλείδης) was an early Gnostic religious teacher in Alexandria, Egypt who taught from 117 to 138 AD, and claimed to have inherited his teachings from Matthew…\nIs Abraxas the Guardian of the Universe?\n>Abraxas (Gk. ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ, variant form Abrasax, ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ) was a word of mystic meaning in the system of the Gnostic Basilides, being there applied to the “Great Archon” (Gk., megas archōn), the princeps of the 365 spheres (Gk., ouranoi).[1] The seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the seven classic planets—Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn …\n>The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung wrote a short Gnostic treatise in 1916 called The Seven Sermons to the Dead, which called Abraxas a god higher than the Christian God and devil that combines all opposites into one being. (= “There is a God about whom you know nothing, because men have forgotten him. We call him by his name: Abraxas. He is less definite than God or Devil…”)\n>The magic word “Ablanathanalba,” which reads in Greek the same backward as forward, also occurs in the Abrasax-stones as well as in the magic papyri. This word is usually conceded to be derived from the Hebrew (Aramaic), meaning “Thou art our father” (אב לן את), and also occurs in connection with Abrasax…\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraxas\n— — —\nIn short, what I mean is that believers in God can not stay too anchored to a given cosmology … that maybe it can also be false.\nIn this Scientific American interview with physicist George F.R. Ellis, he discusses Lawrence Krauss’ belief that physics has explained “why there is something rather than nothing.” Krauss’ metaphysical claim is, of course, much loved by New Atheists who believe that science has explained pretty much everything. Ellis, a giant in his field who co-authored The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time (1973) with Stephen Hawking, disagrees…\n[ then, read also:  “Physicist George Ellis Knocks Physicists for Knocking Philosophy, Falsification, Free Will” by John Horgan   Link:   http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2014/07/22/physicist-george-ellis-knocks-physicists-for-knocking-philosophy-free-will/   ]\n>… So at any moment we have a vision of reality that is effective, it’s good, it’s the best we have found so far.

It was not this that would have disturbed the serenity of the King of Kings, this could only have made him smile; but the philosopher, taking perhaps an unfair advantage of the regrettable happenings just then upon Earth, had asked him how, considering them dispassionately, it was possible to reconcile his All-Power with his All-Goodness.\n“No one can deny the fact of Evil,” said the philosopher, sententiously. “Now, if God cannot prevent Evil he is not all-powerful, and if he can prevent it and will not, he is not all- good.” \nThis argument was of course not new to the Omniscient, but he had always refused to consider the matter; for the fact is, though he knew everything, he did not know the answer to this. Even God cannot make two and two five. But the philosopher, pressing his advantage, and, as philosophers often will, drawing from a reasonable premise an unjustifiable inference – the philosopher had finished with a statement that in the circumstances was surely preposterous.\n“I will not believe,” he said, “in a God who is not All-Powerful and All-Good.” \nSee the link above to see how the little morality tale ends (and starts).

Fundamentally the case is made on the existence of observed order in the universe which seems to demand an intelligent origin.  I had indicated that some of those indications might be found in what have come to be known as “Goldilocks Zones”, of which there are many, the existence of consciousness which seems otherwise inexplicable, and the enigma of quantum entanglement.  \nThe existence of evil does not negate any of these arguments, is a separate issue and cannot be used to disprove the existence of intelligent design in any rational way, however repugnant the evil.  ‘Evil’ cannot exist as a concept without the concept of ‘Good’, but it is evident that both ‘Good’ and ‘Evil’ also exist as practical realities.  What is ‘good’ and what is ‘evil’ has always been a moot point among philosophers and religionists who have considered these matters.  A utilitarian for instance would only see as good that which serves self-interest.  A Darwinist might only see as good that which enhances natural selection and survival of a species.  A Christian theologian would only see as good that which brings a person closer to his concept of God, and that is evil which alienates the person from God.  An agnostic humanist might depend on more emotive arguments involving the repugnance or appeal of specific acts. \nIt is evident that the existence of God has been an attractive concept for very many philosophers throughout the ages, from the time of the Greek and Jewish philosophers, the Christian scholastics, notably Aquinas, more latterly Immanuel Kant and various others.  However there is not unanimity on the matter, so clearly the question of God’s existence cannot be said to be a matter of certain knowledge.  It is necessarily a matter of a faith belief based on a personal assessment of evidence, but in view of the intellectual support for it, it may clearly be held as a rational belief.  \nI choose to belief in the existence of God because I think it more likely than not, and I believe that Jesus Christ is the human face of that God.  I also consider that modern civilisation owes a debt of gratitude to Christianity with its heritage in such fields as music, art, literacy and literature, mainly though monasticism and the founding of the first universities, the doctrinal motivation it provided in a wide assortment of charitable activities and beneficent altruism, together with its missionary activities making civilisation accessible to pagan societies previously held in the thrall of superstition.   \nIt was Aquinas who pointed to the order in the universe, unifying philosophy and theology, so that no longer were deities to be considered as capricious beings, but that order was to be expected, thus making the underpinning of the scientific revolution possible.  \nI also believe that God endowed man with the freedom to choose, a freedom which is not enjoyed by the lower orders which are only subject to natural instinct.  Moral choices are unavailable to lower animal life.  A sentient being capable of choosing between good and evil, but not capable of choosing evil, is a contradiction, in fact a “Nothing”, and I could respond to David Mo by saying that “Nothing is impossible to God!”  With that freedom goes the responsibility of choosing for good, and being held accountable for one’s actions. \nMary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” was subtitled ‘A Modern Prometheus’, so that the besetting sin of her mad scientist protagonist was that of ‘Prometheanism’, putting man in the place of God!  Thus her Doctor Frankenstein was indeed at fault.  \nI had resolved to contribute no longer to the web-site, as I have too often found it an exercise in fruitless frustration, but had relented in the case of this particular off-topic.  However I do not see it as my personal vocation to justify my preciously held beliefs to any committed atheist impervious to any rational argument to the contrary.  I do have more fruitful avenues  I can pursue, without indulging in idle word-play. Consequently, I propose no further comment on the subject.\n\n","date":"January 4, 2015 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-181338","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"Hello DaveB!\nI had resolved to contribute no longer to the web-site, as I have too often found it an exercise in fruitless frustration, but had relented in the case of this particular off-topic.\nDon’t get discouraged!

(refer my posting above)\nThat is certainly conventional doctrine. But if we put that aside, and permit the possibility of the existence of God, then I can’t see any logical problem with the notion that God may not be all powerful.\nI agree that there is nothing stopping the notion of God not being all-good.

Just a belief, but also based on personal experience where I’ve experienced what I think is divine grace. \nI do believe in a ‘force’ (for want of a better word!) that permeates this world – God – that is the source of beauty, peace and goodness. Maybe this notion of God allows for a God that aspires towards the realisation of all these qualities and more but doesn’t always achieve it (ie. not all powerful).\nI don’t believe in a God who only answers some  prayers. I do believe in prayer though! – but not in the sense of ‘ask for and be granted/not granted’! more of a meditative sense of prayer.\nThis notion is not far removed from that put forward by some Theologians who view God as the ‘Ground of Being’ rather than as an objective interventionalist being. \nI sympathise with the philosophical problems of a God who is all powerful, and am not particularly sympathetic to the standard apologist responses.  \nBut as noted above there are definite alternatives, beyond only atheism.\nSurely doctrines can only ever be one interpretation of what God might be.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 8:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-181938","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"Thomas, there is an answer to the problem of all-powerful, all-knowledgable, all-good God.

Possibly the besetting sin of the engineer is that of Prometheanism, placing himself in the place of God, of which he is sometimes accused by lesser mortals.  \nNevertheless, few of my professional colleagues cannot have had the experience of being subject to idle sidewalk oglers all unqualified to a man beholding their efforts, each one of them utterly convinced that any fool could do a far better job of whatever enterprise was being undertaken at the time.  In local government work for instance it seemed a common habit of elected members of the employing authority wanting to make an otherwise undeserved name for themselves to make the engineer the whipping boy for the council’s own failures, as it seemed evident to them that every engineer was an incompetent idiot.  Such comments inevitably stemmed from an inability to grasp the inherent problems that the engineer was struggling to master at the time.    \nHowever the engineer is in good company.

If I did not believe in the existence of any kind of God, then I would neither need nor care to ‘want’ the entity I deny to do anything. I do not ‘want’ dragons not to breathe fire, and I do not ‘want’ Father Christmas to go on a diet, and I do not ‘want’ Bigfoot to be a vegetarian; I do not have ‘requirements’ for non-existent entities.\nBut I think the thinking behind OK’s argument is this: if I do not believe in God because the world is full of evil, then, if the world was completely free of evil, would I change my mind? The answer, of course, must be, I don’t know. There may be all sorts of other corollaries that would affect my decision. One such, which seems to be implied by OK’s question, is that a world completely free of evil could be a denial of Free Will, which, in some theologies, is an attribute of God’s love. So by making God more “all-loving” by removing all evil, we at the same make him less “all-loving” by his denial of free will, which is a paradox.\nThe way out, of course, is to postulate a third scenario. Suppose that God created man in his own image etc., etc. as postulated in the bible, and gave man free will to do good or evil, also as postulated in the bible, and more, that men, from the creation until now, entirely from their own free will, and in spite of numerous temptations, chose not to commit any evil. Suppose further, if you will, that, entirely by chance, men chose not to build their homes in the paths of any natural disasters, so that nobody died of tsunamis or earthquakes or hurricanes either.

From the God’s all powerful perspective all, even the most terrible evils of this world may be just “moderate” and very easy to fix and amend in the future world.\nThat’s the first fallacy you made.\nIn my metaphoric supposition of a “guardian angel” (some inhibitory mechanism against aggression), this one will be able to stop the criminal offender when he has started (but not accomplished) the act. So, the evil exists. It is the criminal intention. And the freedom for evil is preserved. If the problem is preserve both freedom and evil.\nA “guardian angel” which would make perpetrating crime  impossible…\nYour naivete is extreme… Like all those fools who don’t even consider what they postulate.\nI suppose you haven’t read this book? It came to my mind immediately when you formulated the problem\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_on_the_Spot\nWizja Lokalna by popular Polish s-f. writer Stanisław Lem. On margin I must say that he declared himself atheist, for similar reasons that you claim (the imperfect world) although actually his relations towards religion were extremely complex and equivocal (for example Catholic priest was present at his funeral).\nHere you have a part of the  summary of that book:\nThe other state, Luzania, constitutes the most significant treatment of the topic of an “ideal state” in Lem (and many would argue, in all science fiction). Their most prominent accomplishment is the creation of “ethicsphere” (compare “atmosphere”). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called “bystry” (“quickies” in English) that serve to control matter in the ‘quickated’ areas. The primary function of the ‘quickies’ is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word ethicsphere). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non-physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the ‘quickies’ would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet.\nHere you have your “ideal state” where evil is apparently eliminated, and making harm to any living entity impossible. Unfortuantely this turns out not to be a paradise but hell instead. A terrific totalitarian state with totalitarian control over its citizens. One of the most terrific prisons you can imagine.  That’s your ideal world. That’s ideal world you unbelievers demanded God to create.\nBut this does not mean that ideal world is impossible. No. There is one another element Lem missed (or didn’t look at it in a proper way).\nI can say that Hugh is close to answer. He mentioned it in his recent post -but didn’t follow it so far.\n\n","date":"January 9, 2015 at 1:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-182201","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"Of course there should be: \nYou cannot objectiely state what is “extreme” evil and what is only “moderate” evil.\n\n","date":"January 9, 2015 at 1:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-182202","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"I am a fan of Stanislaw Lem and Ion Tichy.

After a few of the stars have gone through their life cycle in about 5 billion years, you can get a few super-novae started so that you can get some elements heavier than iron, as these will also be useful.  \nYou look around for some benign locations that seem fairly stable, and you’ve fixed things so that some of the lighter elements will form organic molecules which will eventually turn into double helixes for DNA and become life forms.  You know how useful competition is for ensuring survival and development of the better parts of this mix, so that these life forms will struggle against each other and a few will become dominant. \nAfter a few star cycles in about 14 billion years, and throwing some rocks around to extinguish the worst of the aggressive animals you begin to see signs of rudimentary intelligence in your mammalian life, particularly the primates.  They still compete with each other, but they’ve got to the point where they see advantages in social organisation and mutual cooperation and you’ve got the beginnings of some kind of moral order.  \nThe competition and selfish gene are eventually successful in producing something called homo sapiens, a sentient being capable of sustaining himself, having a moral conscience, and who is beginning to understand what this is all about, even becoming aware that all of this didn’t get going all by itself.  \nHowever, the quest for dominance and exploitation and primitive rudiments are still there, so that you know you’re going to have to send your divine Son along to sort out the worst of it, and to tell your Creation what it’s all about.  You give them due warning of this, by raising up a few prophets, enlightening them so as to prepare the way.

I know a great deal more about Genesis than you give credit for, and I dare say more so than even yourself!  The problem of God’s omnipotence, perfection, innate goodness and foreknowledge, versus the problem of man’s free will and the pervasiveness of evil has exercised the greatest of minds since time immemorial.  Solutions to it were attempted in the two creation stories of Genesis, in the writing of the book of Job, in Socrates who mistakenly thought it sufficient merely “to know the good”, in Plato’s unrealistic idealism, Plotinus’ neo-Platonism which had a major impact on early Christian theology, in Augustine’s doctrine of original sin, and in Aquinas’ recovery of Aristotle’s philosophy from Averoes.  However, the problem only occurs because of the importance they all give to anthropocentrism,  I have said that “Nothing is impossible to God” and noted the inference this gives to what is in fact possible and impossible in creating a sentient being with free will capable of both good and evil.   \nMy rewriting of the Genesis story owes little to such mythologies of imagination, and the mental gymnastics of arm-chair philosophers, and a great deal more to the scientific facts of the case.  I am impressed with how life forms adapted remarkably quickly in their migration from South America to the hostile Galapagos in such a relatively short time as a few million years.  This could only be possible if the innate property of adaptability was implanted in them.  It required a struggle between competing individuals for dominance, and the dissolution of those unable to adapt, in fact a “selfish gene”.  This pervades all of Creation, is the product of a wise God, but has consequences for the problem of evil.  Man has now reached the stage in his development, where he can now seek solutions to many of these problems.  Christianity provides a frame-work, motivation and world-view for so dealing with it. \nThe way the world and the entire universe was created is evidently the best solution that is possible to be created.

Every normal human being thinks that spiting in the neighbour’ soup is a qualitatively different evil to kill a child.\nLet me answer it in this way.\nOf course from the human, limited perspective spiting in the neighbour’ soup is a different, smaller evil than killing a child. Yet God’s perspective is different. He can for example turn bad deeds into much greater good. Classical example may be the story of Joseph in Egypt, while being sold by his brothers into slavery (definitely extremely bad deed), in the end due to God directing the events, this saved his whole family from hunger. \nWe don’t know all consequences of our deeds. It may turn out that apparently small evil would have in the end much greater consequences than great evil. Of course this doesn’t modify moral responsibility, which is greater for greater crimes (like rape or murder) than smaller ones (cursing in public), yet we cannot say that total elimination of some forms evil by external intervention will make that there will be less evil in the Universe. It (evil) will simply change its form, and we will still be as far from Paradise, as we have been.\nIf I can give a similar example from another area: Every child knows than there are ten natural numbers in the range of 1 to 10:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nThere are 5 odd numbers in the range 1 to 10:\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9\nThere are also 5 even numbers in the range 1 to 10:\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10\nSo it seems that there is fewer (just half of them) odd (or even) natural numbers, than both of them. Yet if we take a range from 1 to infinity, their quantity is the same:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5….\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9….\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10…\nBy analogy, treating unlimited God within limited range of human perspective is simply erroneous.\n\n","date":"January 11, 2015 at 5:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-182533","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"“yet we cannot say that total elimination of some forms evil by external intervention will make that there will be less evil in the Universe. ” The implication of this is that it would be foolish to try and lessen the effects of any kind of evil.

In Gen II, God is anthropomorphic, He makes a woman from out of Adam’s rib indicating that they are of the same kind, He “walks in the garden”,  He can’t find Adam there and tries to search for him, He asks questions, “Where are you, Adam?”, there is a talking snake, and so on.  Nevertheless, like all primal mythologies, it has its own particular truth which mainly operates at the symbolic and psychological levels, and which spoke to the people then and can speak to us now.    \nDuring the 6th century BC, the Jewish people by their exile were exposed to the influence of Babylonian science, and one result of this was their writing down of the more cosmic Creation story of Gen I.  Nevertheless they did not abandon the older story, but placed it second in their setting down of the book of Genesis.  The setting down of Genesis I more accurately records the sequential order of the actual Creation process.  The “days of Creation” are of course not actual days of 24 hours, as reportedly explained by Pope John XXIII to Nikita Krushchev when they first met.  Or as another biblical text has it, a day in God’s eyes can be a thousand years, and a thousand years can be but a day.  \nThe perception of evils experienced by mankind, and promoted as an argument against God’s existence by David Mo and others, is based on the false premise that man is the supreme good.  There is a higher good, which may be found in necessity.  Man has been endowed with reason and intelligence, which enables him to progressively deal with the evils which trouble his species.  All it requires is sufficient motivation, proper direction, and the allocation of the proper resources, including that of science and I dare say some engineering!\n\n","date":"January 12, 2015 at 3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-182851","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Again:  Does God Exist?","post":"Hello David and O.K.\nThis is a nice discussion both of you are having, but where a solution is not that easy.

How can we state anything about an entity that we don’t understand? \nGod is not contradictory -simply your perspective is limited, and focused on the worng aspect. And we don’t need to understand fully some entity to state something about it. We don’t fully understand star evolution, or functioning of living cells, yet we can state something about those matters.\n“If egregious suffering did not exist non-believers would just complain about stubbed toes”.\nExactly! For such entities, who would not know “more serious” (from our perspective) pains (like cancer), this would be “extreme evil.” Their suffering, apparently insignificant (from our perspective) would nevertheless be the same.\nThe ‘problem of evil’ addresses the world as it is\nNot only, because we need to consier also alternatives, other worlds that could have been instead of ours.\nChildhood brain cancer is no different to a broken fingernail?\nThis is evil, and this is evil. Of course one seems to be much more serious -but only from our perspective. Not from the unlimited perspective of all-infinite-good God. \nImagine yourself that they stole you 10 $. That’s bad. Then imagine yourself that they stole you 1000 $. That’s worse (100 times), isn’t it? Yet assume you are very rich, you own say 100 000 000 000 =100 billion $. What’s then the difference between stealing 1000 $ and 10 $ (respectively 0.00000001 and 0.0000000001 of your total money)? Little. The main problem is not whether they stole from you 1000 $ or 10 $, but the fact of stealing.\nSimilarly with infinite good God. The main problem is the presence of evil, its scale is irrelevant. Of course, in limited human perspective there are greater and lesser evils, yet this can only be callibrated versus human scale. What’s the difference between 0.1, 10, 100, 1000 versus infinity?\nBelief that Evil can be eliminated (or even reduced as a whole) via God’s magical intervention, and elimination of physical ability to kill, rape, steal, as well as natural disasters and diseases, is just extremely naive. Turning stones into bread is no solution. This is no way. \nBut still there is another way.

I don’t say that in our world broken fingernail is as much great evil as cancer (because obviously it isn’t) but it is evil anyway.\nAnother analogy. Suppose we can give weights to different kinds of evil (which is not true in general, yet allows us to discriminate between “greater” and “lesser” evils). Let’s assume also that God is infinitely good -by definition (so we can assign God +∞ symbol). Let’s assign number 0 for those things that are morally neutral, that they contain no evil at all. \nThen let’s assume that the most terrible evil in this world is childhood brain cancer. Let’s assign to it a number -10.\nIn this scale we can assign -1 for broken fingernail. \nSo we live in the world with “the range of evils” from -10 (the most terrible evils) to 0 (no evil).\nYet in theory there could have been another world where there happens Evils More Terrible than Childhood Brain Cancer (EMTCBC). Let’s assign for EMTCBC -100. So in this world relation between EMTBC and childhood cancer is like relation between childhood cancer and broken fingernail. \nThen let’s consider another hypothetical world, where there is no childhood cancer, and the greatest evil is a broken fingernail. \nSo we have 3 potential worlds for God to create:\na)World with EMTBC as the most terrible evil. Scale of evil: -100 to 0\nb)World with childhood cancer as the most terrible evil. Scale of evil: -10 to 0\nc) World with a broken fingernail as the most terrible evil. Scale of evil -1 to 0.\nAt first glance seems that the world a) is more terrible than b) which is also more terrible than c). Yet there is no difference between -100, -10 and -1 in comparison to God’s +∞ ! And each of this worlds can be rescaled so the relative scale between the most terrible evil in each of them will be always from -1 (the most terrible evil) to 0 (no evil at all).  As the residents of each of these worlds do not know the alternatives, their perception of evil is actually the same.\nThus elimination of some forms of evil (or we can say forms in which the evil manifests) won’t make the world any better.\nDavid Mo:\nI repeat you: I have put here five possible solutions to the problem of evil and God. Do you have any evidence in favour of one of them? No.\nNeither of those 5 “solutions” may be true, as they are not the only ones possible. There is at least a sixth solution.\nMy “limited perspective”? You cannot explain the contradiction of God and evil.[…] But the problem of contradiction between God and evil is different because it implies facts and logic. Facts: the existence of sufferings. Logic: contradiction between good and evil. We have no means to test any hypothetical solution\nNeither your facts, nor your “logic” are complete. And as they are incomplete, you cannot say there is a contradiction between omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent God and existence of evil.\naljones909:\nWhat (or who) do you think is the source of this evil?\nThat’s the question!

Because this (apparent) paradox would be still present if there is ANY evil and suffering in this world.\nAs I am trying to show, you cannot objectively state what is “extreme” and “moderate” or “minor” evils. The terms “extreme”, “moderate”, “minor” does not describe absolute, but relative properties. You can of course describe evils as “greater” and “lesser” and set them in order, but to state that some of them are “extreme” or “moderate” you need reference scale. You and aljones do not understand that and thus fall in another fallacy. Had some now “extreme” evils been eliminated by magical intervention, other, lesser evils would become “extreme”. \nIf one likes to play with such “rationalists'” sophisms, he needs to know precise meanings of what he states.\nYou can ask to the parents of a child unexpectedly healed of a cancer of brain if they are happier. They will look at you as if you were mad.\nYes. However the point is that if you heal a child from brain cancer you will make the world better. But not necessarily if you magically eliminate brain cancer from this world.\nCatholics believe that God does intervene in this world, performing miracles -curing diseases for example.

See Denmark/North Korea.\nNonsensical? Give them a world where the most terrible suffering is too tight underwear + long enough lifespan, so that they can feel it. You will see, that from their perspective, the suffering would be no smaller then in concentration camp in (unknown for them) North Korea. They will be complaining the same melody, about terrible and inhumane conditions due to the too tight underwear. \nOn the contrary people living in North Korea can be extremely happy -if their Supreme Leader orders them to be so.

Angels (those who remained faithul to God) are perfect entities, not robots and have their own free will, humans can be also such like them.\n\n","date":"January 18, 2015 at 12:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-184302","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"}]
