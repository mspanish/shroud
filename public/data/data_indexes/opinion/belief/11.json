[{"title":"Seven short and simple answers to the Shroud of Turin Enigma Challenge – and a plea for the reporting of real science…","post":"I have just this minute posted this comment to David Rolfe’s Enigma site, using an open entry log in to avoid his block on my comments 9which may or may not still be in place). My comment has appeared, but will it still be there tomorrow? We shall see,\nHas the block been lifted?\nI’ve just this minute completed a posting/cum critique of your Enigma Challenge, Mr.Rolfe.\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/seven-short-and-simple-answers-to-the-shroud-of-turin-enigma-challenge-one-of-our-enigmas-is-missing/\n If this appears here, then I will need to remove the reference to your having blocked my comments – or rather state that after several weeks the block has been lifted\nWhy did you remove that HD image from your banner, btw, the one whose provenance I questioned, and was so keen to see more of? In fact, I have since discovered the similar Durante 2002 archive on Shroud Scope, a fascinating resource, and one I have used for well over 10 postings now.\nColin Berry aka sciencebod\n","date":"June 30, 2012 at 7:04 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/seven-short-and-simple-answers-to-the-shroud-of-turin-enigma-challenge-one-of-our-enigmas-is-missing/","cat":"atheism","id":"comment-335","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
