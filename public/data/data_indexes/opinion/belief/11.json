I found several of the bloggers’ comments of equal interest, including one that identified the source of the quote “A liitle philosophy … etc … leads you back.”  I was sufficiently intrigued to pass the URL on to a few oher philosophiles.  Here’s a comment back from a Catholic priest-scholar:- \n“Some Catholic academic philosophers need to take a deep breath, state their central thesis and then demonstrate this. Those who quote Aquinas and Gilson might learn from their methodology. While I admire Feser’s intent, he makes too many references and so his central point is not always easy to follow.  In the groves of academe some groves are more intelligible than others – and so one is tempted to linger longer.”\nPersonally I have not come across Feser previously, but his web-site demonstrates that he has a large community of followers.  But his presentation would benefit by the self-discipline of more concentration on conciseness, and thus communicate his intent more effectively.\n\n","date":"July 25, 2012 at 5:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/24/edward-feser-on-the-road-from-atheism/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14228","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
