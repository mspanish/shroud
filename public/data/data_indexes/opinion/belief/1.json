[{"title":"Peter Higgs Criticizes Richard Dawkins","post":"Assuming that all “scientists” have similar beliefs outside their realm of expertise is much the same as thinking the same of all “artists.” However, the latter would seem to most people to be ridiculous, while somehow “scientists” are seen by the general public to be a more homogeneous bunch. To a certain extent that may be true, but in my experience biologists are much more likely to be strict atheists than physicists – especially physicists of the very small and the very big. I guess this is because evolution and physiology are fairly mechanistic in their descriptions, while sub-atomic physics and cosmology, with its probability functions, multiple dimensions, many worlds, dark matter and energy, and all the rest, intuitively leaves more room for some form of theology.\n\n","date":"December 28, 2012 at 11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/28/peter-higgs-criticizes-richard-dawkins/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21249","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Peter Higgs Criticizes Richard Dawkins","post":"The filmed Interview with El Mundo as published at the link provided doesn’t mention Dawkins at all, let alone provide all those quotes attributed to Peter Higgs.

There are big names like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and others writing best sellers attacking religion.\nELAINE: Many scientists don’t want to be perceived as having any connection with the new atheists. Many regard Dawkins, Harris and the others as having a negative reputation with much of the public, so even atheist scientists aren’t eager to be associated with them. The situation backfires, because the loudest voices then tend to be the most negative and the general public assumes those are representative of all scientists. That cuts down on the dialogue even more. \nhttp://www.readthespirit.com/explore/701-science-vs-religion-interview-elaine-howard-ecklund.html\n\n","date":"December 28, 2012 at 2:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/28/peter-higgs-criticizes-richard-dawkins/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21267","author":"Tornike Chiboshvili","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Peter Higgs Criticizes Richard Dawkins","post":"I think Hugh makes a good point.  Your evolutionary biologist seems content to go back no further than primeval slime, and sees a mechanistic process thereafter.  On the other hand the physicist can be intrigued by the fundamental properties of matter, and the innate coincidences that make life, particularly life on earth possible.  \nCheck out: “Parallel Worlds – A journey through creation, higher dimensions, and the future of the cosmos” – Ch8 “A Designer Universe?”, Michio Kaku, Doubleday, 2005;  Kaku may be well known to USA TV viewers for presenting his regular science programmes. \nHis chapter 8 deals with “Goldilocks Zones” associated with making life on earth possible, but he also considers the innate “Goldilocks” properties of matter.  You can find quite a lot about Goldlocks zones on the web as well.  Too many coincidences for it to have been a random occurrence.  It had to have a designer!\n\n","date":"December 28, 2012 at 3:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/28/peter-higgs-criticizes-richard-dawkins/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21271","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
