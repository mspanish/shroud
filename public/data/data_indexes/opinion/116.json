Wuenscel seems to assert the presence of a sedile, but not a foot-rest, while Barbet asserts neither as death would then not be so swift. Wuenschel also seems to think that the wound to the side was a soldier’s impulsive gesture and not a usual practice. Barbet on the other hand asserted that unless the legs had been broken, the ‘percussio’ was a legal requirement to ensure death had occurred before the body could be released to relatives. Wilson illustrates the wound from a “Dying Gaul” statue in Rome, asserting that the blow was commonly practised by soldiers and gladiators and taught in the Roman combat schools. Some of the documentary evidence that Wuenschel asserts, may have been superseded by more recent investigations and reconstructions.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/19/paper-chase-a-wonderful-rare-document-from-father-weuncheal/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-73750","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  A Wonderful, Rare Document from Father Weuncheal","post":"Obviously, but he warns us of the many “Dr Hyneks” who will flourish on the Shroud.\n\n","date":"January 20, 2014 at 5:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/19/paper-chase-a-wonderful-rare-document-from-father-weuncheal/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-73862","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"}]
