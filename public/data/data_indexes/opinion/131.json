[{"title":"Ridiculous Claim x 2820 = Fact","post":"Oh yeah, that’s the internet culture all right. It happens every day on email. I ran a forum for a few years, and people were always posting stuff they got on email. I tried and tried and tried to get them to CHECK IT OUT on Snopes or Urban Legends FIRST, but there’s no way they would do it. It would come in on email, so they’d post it on our forum as a fact. And 100% of those crazy stories were hoaxes. But would they learn? NEVER. \nI’m surprised that the mis-information only got copied 2800 times.\n\n","date":"January 29, 2012 at 7:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/29/ridiculous-claim-x-2820-fact/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-7657","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"}]
