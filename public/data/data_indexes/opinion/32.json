[{"title":"Shroudie-Alert: Day 12: time now to write that long-overdue letter to the Royal¬†Society‚Ä¶","post":"So what do you make of the totally conflicting accounts re herring-bone (1-over-3) weaves, Matthias, with some saying it was commonplace in  1st century Palestine, Syria etc and unknown in Europe, and others saying it did not appear until medieval Europeans began looking for variety (at a price)?  When was the earliest herring-bone weave shown in works of art, say from the Byzantine period, or did it make a late arrival, consistent with a late discovery?\nIrrespective, that weave must have been a boon to medieval artists wishing to distinguish between shroud and other patterned or unpatterned surfaces in a 1st century cave tomb, especially as they had the quaint(?) idea that Joseph of Arimathea purchased not only a probably anachronistic variety of linen, but a sarcophagus as well, requiring its (patterned?)lid to be propped up at an angle to see an ‚Äúempty tomb‚Äù. Interestingly the Lirey badge shows both herring-bone weave and what Ian Wilson interprets as the ‚Äúempty tomb‚Äù, the latter again oddly sarcophagus-like. Whether it has a lid on top or something else (grid? grill?) is another matter. The Lirey badge is arguably the key for unlocking the mystery of the Shroud if you ask me, made all the more interesting by the recent discovery of the Machy mould ‚Äì showing there were at least two or perhaps more pilgrims‚Äô badges commissioned, and that the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù was being subtly altered with time.

The metacarpal bones that are in the palm of the hand seem remarkably well-imaged on the Shroud (thus the wacky ‚ÄúX-ray story‚Äù, the ghost image of a hidden retracted thumb etc,  with wacky medics going to Shroudie congresses after swallowing radioactive technetium to show fuzzy pictures of their internal organs). Regardless of why that should be so, i.e.the X-ray look, it‚Äôs possible that the monk or whoever given the task of adding blood in all the right places mistook those metacarpals for finger bones (an easy enough thing  to do). He then decided to play safe, and place the blood well below the metacarpals, thinking that would be the location of the palm. \nBefore moving on to that second site ‚Äì the back ‚Äì perhaps I might ask you a question: if the Shroud image influenced early pre-medieval art to the extent that so many claim, then why didn‚Äôt the wrist become quickly adopted as the standard site for showing the nail wound?\n‚ÄúIllogical‚Äù trickle of blood?

It would have appeared on the Shroud as an image that was indistinguishable from body, if thermal imprinting (scorching) were the mechanism. Our medieval monk with his ‚Äúblood‚Äù might have chosen to dab blood, or blood substitute, right on top of that ‚Äúchain‚Äù motif, link by link, trying, not terribly successfully, to make it look even more like a complex blood trail.
