[{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"As a believer I think that the topic of the Shroud is serious as it is the Lords gift to us,  A few parts of the article actually made me chuckle.  In my poor worded opinion, haters of Jesus are a weird group of people, there is a day coming that they will learn their of their error.  As a kid, I had an NDE when I almost drowned and as an adult I have researched them, read many experiences of others. All of us will have that true experience in our time. There are many people who doubt NDEs.  Look up NDE research in any search engine. There are even NDEs reported by people of most of the religions documented.\n\n","date":"July 11, 2015 at 6:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205233","author":"ekmcmahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"Hey Dan, glad to see the Shroud made it to the top of his list of relics!\n\n","date":"July 11, 2015 at 7:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205235","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"It does seem that Sam Harris, although American, did not bother to read about Cardinal Avery Dulles:\nhttp://averydulles.blogspot.com.br/\n\n","date":"July 11, 2015 at 2:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205272","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"Thanks for the link, Louis, obviously among the greatest of thinkers.

Joe Nickell’s book is a little “vintage” but I think it is “solid”. And the Italian “sceptics” as Andrea Nicolotti, Gian Marco Rinaldi, Antonio Lombatti and others are very “solid thinkers”.\nIn Spanish there are some “solid sceptic” blogs. Jose Luis Calvo’s “Escrito desde el páramo” especially.\nThe problem is what is “solid” for you. In many cases “solid” means “this is what I think”. But you, the shroudies, scarcely never go to a sceptical forum to test the “solidness” of your thinking. You live in a closed loop. So your thinking seems very solid… within the circle.\n\n","date":"July 12, 2015 at 1:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205338","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"David Mo – I’m always keen to hear skeptical opinions. I’m yet to hear any convincing skeptical theories, however. Colin B has done some interesting experiments but has not (at least yet) come up with a bulletproof theory.\nI’ve done a lot of thinking over the last couple of years of alternate theories. About 2-3 years ago I thought of a genius alchemist working with substances and bas relief / statue. I also thought of the Shroud also being linked somehow to a flagellant in the mid 1300s eg. maybe the shroud was used to temporarily cover a dead flagellant. But that still raises the question of how the image may have been formed, if it did cover a dead body (whether medieval or from the time of Christ). I’m far from convinced as to the Maillard theory.     \nThere’s plenty I don’t know and am happy to admit it. But I am very confident the image was created by an imprint. I don’t subscribe at all to any notion that the image was painted, such as advanced by Charles Freeman.Because the qualities of the image are certainly related to body / cloth distance.  \nI don’t cling religiously to faith in The Shroud  – it helps support my faith, but I’m very confident my faith would not fall apart if the Shroud was convincingly  shown to be a medieval creation.\nAs it stands, I think at present the collective evidence across disciplines -notwithstanding the carbon dating – points to a date significantly earlier than the 1300s.\nI could still be convinced by a medieval imprint theory, but I’m waiting…\nIn the meantime – and yes it’s unscientific – I believe the image was created by the miracle of the resurrection (and this explains the late carbon dating date). I don’t advance any radioactive theories etc. The resurrection being a miracle defies scientific understanding, so logically if the Shroud image was created by the resurrection then the image making process defies human explanation. \nOut of interest, what is your theory for the Shroud’s creation?\n\n","date":"July 12, 2015 at 2:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205345","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"Hi Thomas,\n                   To start with, there is no way that this image was formed from contact with a dead body.

We know a great deal about how the pyramids were likely made.  At present everything about the forming of the Shroud image is sheer speculation.  \nVery likely the pyramids were built with the assistance of earth ramps, and you might be aware that Egypt has no shortage of sand, a particularly tractable material.  We know a great deal about Egyptian mathematics, particularly from the Rhind papyrus, 17th century BC copy of a text 2 centuries older still, and also from the Golenishchev Papyrus (in the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts), dating from the 19th century BC.  \nThe blocks would be easily sledded up the ramps on timber rails using milk and fat for lubrication.  That such ramps were built is evident from a satirical problem set out in the Rhind papyrus. a satirical letter in which one scribe, Hori, taunts his rival, Amen-em-opet, for his incompetence as an adviser and manager. “You are the clever scribe at the head of the troops,” Hori chides at one point; “a ramp is to be built,  730 cubits long, 55 cubits wide, with 120 compartments–it is 60 cubits high, 30 cubits in the middle . . . and the generals and the scribes turn to you and say, ‘You are a clever scribe, your name is famous. Is there anything you don’t know? Answer us, how many bricks are needed?’ Let each compartment be 30 cubits by 7 cubits.”  There are three other problems like it in the same letter.  Further information is needed, but the point of the humour is clear enough as Hori sets these difficult but typical tasks. \nThe Egyptians did not seem to know Pythagorean triples (the Babylonians did), but were able to set out exact right angles, and it is evident that they originated surveying with resetting of land boundaries following the annual NIlitic floods.  They had an adequate numbering system, were familiar with binary fractions, and were capable of calculating areas and volumes, even of pyramids.   \nYou will have to find another enigma to make an adequate point on divine intervention, but don’t bother with citing Stonehenge!\n\n","date":"July 12, 2015 at 5:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205364","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"Exactly Daveb!\n\n","date":"July 12, 2015 at 5:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-205365","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ignorance with Wings","post":"Re ignorance with wings, methinks it’s well shared between both archmiraculist shroudies’ and archfraudulist anti-shroudies’ opinion about the TS.
