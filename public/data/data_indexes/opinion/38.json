[{"title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin","post":"With the discovery of nutrinos I think science has proved to the world that they basically don’t know much of anything yet. Barely scratched the surface. \nAnd they don’t know the essence of LIFE itself, they haven’t come close. I believe that the essence of Life comes from the mysterious breath of God (Biblical language study reveals this hint) and if that’s so, it also tells us that LIFE itself is not of this earth. LIFE is not natural, it is supernatural.  \nSo it’s amusing or ironic or something, that Atheists who scoff at the existance of God actually have a mysterious bit of God’s supernatural LIFE within them. Somehow. \nI don’t have any worries that the Shroud will lose it’s mystery. I think that the image was probably made through means that are not possible for us to analyze or duplicate. It’s not a natural process, anymore than the Resurrection of Christ was a “natural” event. Mankind cannot raise themselves from death. But Jesus was not an ordinary man. \nObviously I am inclined to believe that the Shroud is real. :)\n\n","date":"October 26, 2011 at 8:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/destroying-the-magic-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-4379","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin","post":"^ What she said x 2.\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/destroying-the-magic-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-4380","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin","post":"The supernatural is in our everyday life but most people are just unaware of it. \nWe dont need to have a proof of Yeshua’s ressurection!\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/destroying-the-magic-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-4384","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin","post":"You wrote : “We dont need to have a proof of Yeshua’s ressurection!”.  I agree completely with that statement but, unfortunately, many Shroud researchers have an agenda that state precisely the opposite !  Their main goal seemed to prove the resurrection with the Shroud, which is, for a Catholic like me, completely foolish !\nAnd for the comment from Holy Objects at Spiritual Questions, I think there is some truth in what it is said !  I really think that if one day science can prove that the body images on the Shroud came from a natural process of image formation (this is what I think myself), MANY PEOPLE (MOSTLY SHROUDIES) WOULD BE VERY UPSET AND DISAPOINTED ABOUT THAT !!!  And I’m sure many of those people would never admit a conclusion like that even if science would show them all the proofs to back it up !  I know we are not there yet but it’s a fair possibility (images done by a natural phenomenon) and I know that if it is really the case, many people would do whatever they can to deny it…\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/destroying-the-magic-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-4392","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin","post":"I agree with Yannick point by point.

For many years now I have had a hole on my leg no doctor in the world has yet been able to explain why and how its there let alone why I am able to even walk. What makes it more strange is that there is no penetration on the surface of my skin yet under x-ray my leg tells a different story. With the naked eye nothing is visible it is only under x-ray that one sees the hole the size of a nail which pierced through my leg but left not a single scare yet it pierced right through the front though the bone and out the other side. All I know is that the same holes are on my hands and both my legs and I feel its time I give my self to the world and let the brains of the world see and figure out for themselves how a person like me has all these wounds yet walks and can lift objects with no effort. The secrets of my body defy all laws of life yet then again the question I want to know is am I the only one of 6 billion people on the place we call earth that has the wounds of the cross hidden from the naked eye. If any out there exists I call u to speak out I think we are meant to show the world our gift so that they can see what only kings dream to see. You cannot tell me that of 6 billion people on this planet I’m the only on human who has been asked to help carry the cross there must be others out there please let’s group up so the world can see our gift. The only thing I’ve been told is to turn to when christ returns will someone tell me what it means\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/destroying-the-magic-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-4401","author":"saddened","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin","post":"The percentage of  certain type of messages like this by ‘saddened’ in this blog is exponentially increasing in this blog during the last days.

I do try to keep the blog open to everyone as best I can. I’m thinking of creating a special open thread where message such as ‘saddened’ can be moved because it is so far off topic. \nRight now, this blog is very successful. According to Alexis it is drawing more hits than the other three top Shroud of Turin websites combined without pulling them down. In the end I hope that is good for science as it pertains to the shroud. \nAny suggestions?\n\n","date":"October 27, 2011 at 4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/destroying-the-magic-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-4411","author":"episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Regarding the subject (the possible shroud of Christ), I am surprise, on the contrary, that there’s no more messages like the one by Saddened !!!
