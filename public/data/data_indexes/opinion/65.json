[{"title":"If it’s a fraud, make another one.","post":"Agreed about the committment to Materialism/Naturalism, i.e. nature is all there is, and nature is ultimately nothing but particles, which is the dominant philosophy in science.  \nIsrael’s leading botanist, Prof. Avinoam Danin, in his new book, “Botany of the Shroud,” agrees that Max Frei’s pollen is not determinable down to the species level, because its external identifying structures are obscured by Frei’s sticky tape glue. But Turin has a large collection of pollen vaccuumed from the Shroud that may be determinable down to the species level.\nAlso, Prof. Danin has identified the imprint of flower parts on the Shroud (on several different types of photos and also directly on the Shroud). They include four species: Gundelia tournefortii, Zygophyllum dumosum, Cistus creticus and Capparis aegyptia, which are only found growing together between Jerusalem and Hebron! And only flower in the March-April when Jesus was crucified!!\nBut as Jesus observed, a prior committment to Naturalism (i.e. Anti-supernaturalism), always overides evidence of the supernatural: “If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead” (Lk 16:31).\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 10:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/03/if-its-a-fraud-make-another-one/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-6497","author":"Stephen E.

Everything you mentioned, plus the bloodstains (NOT paint) and the photoelectric image seared into the cloth at a time when flash cameras hadn’t even been invented yet.\nIn the same way that great pains were taken over the centuries to protect & preserve God’s word (the Bible) from being destroyed, so countless individuals over the course of history have gone to great lengths to protect & preserve the Shroud. The Shroud itself affirms & backs up the truth of Jesus’ resurrection as stated in the Bible. No wonder the devil is working overtime to discredit it.\nI applaud the purity of your faith!\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 11:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/03/if-its-a-fraud-make-another-one/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-6528","author":"Leina","site":"shroudstory"}]
