If the image just shows the dead Jesus what can it tell us that is really important?\n2. If it does show the dead Jesus in the process of Resurrection does it answer all our questions?\n3. As you know, the Church moves slowly, it is in no hurry, and as you yourself agreed with me not long ago it is the risen Jesus, and not any burial cloth, that led to the birth of Christianity, according to the Gospels. Caravaggio understood this very well and therefore his beautiful two versions of the Supper at Emmaus.\nIt is worthwhile sending a petition to Shroud custodian Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia but the question that arises is if the Church will first create a scientific commission for the purpose of studying the photographs you mention. \nMeanwhile… looking forward to your paper on the coins-over-the-eyes theory.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2013 at 6:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/11/when-all-else-fails-resort-to-ridicule/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-24099","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"When all else fails, resort to ridicule","post":"I’m not sure how one could ever PROVE the Shroud is authentic.  I suspect that the closest that we’ll ever come will always remain the balance of probabilities on what weight of evidence is now or becomes available.  Meanwhile each must come to their own conclusion.  Those who assert that the Shroud is authentic, need to show why.  Those who assert that it is not, need to show why not!  \nAssuming authenticity, one thing that the Shroud does demonstrate, is that the image was fixed before there was any sign of corruption, and this image once formed did not deteriorate as a result of any subsequent corruption.  What then happened to the body?  \nOnce fixed, we still do not know soon the image first appeared – was it within the 40 hours or so Jesus was in the tomb, or was it much longer, even a hundred or so years.  I’m inclined to think it likely it was in the tomb, as otherwise why would a ritually unclean cloth be so carefully preserved?  Despite what Augustine has to say about what John came to believe when he entered the tomb (i.e. Augustine asserts he believed what the women had said), Augustine did not know about the Shroud image. claiming no-one knew the physical appearance of Jesus.  However if the image had already appeared, this gives a new slant on the particular text.  The image may still have had its own part to play in helping to form the disciples’ conviction that Jesus had indeed risen.  We can speculate, but we cannot assert either way.  But de Wesselow may not be the only one who can be mistaken about the role the image may have played.  They were plain folk, and it probably required several pieces of evidence for them to be eventually convinced: the empty tomb, the appearances in the upper room, at Emmaus, at the lake edge preparing a meal, even his Ascension, and just possibly the image on his burial cloth!  Here was the proof of his death and crucifixion.  It was no bad dream.  They had not been deluded.  He had been crucified, and He had died! And yet now he walked and talked and ate with them.\n\n","date":"February 13, 2013 at 4:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/11/when-all-else-fails-resort-to-ridicule/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-24122","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"When all else fails, resort to ridicule","post":"Correction (previous comments).
