Many thanks, timely for me! I’m now up to slide 60 in the presentation series I’m planning, have just reached the “Quest for a History” section, Edessa-Constantinople-Mandylion theory, I’ll be making use of it. Your earlier comment on John Curcuas’ besieging of Edessa and the concessions he made merely for the sake of an icon also remains as a powerful argument. \nThe Shroud Arcaulf saw in Jerusalem was said to have been given to Charlemagne in 797AD, and may have been the “Shroud of Compiegne” in the south near Toulouse, and destroyed during the French Revolution.  It eludes me why any Passion relics should be taken direct from Jerusalem to ancient Gaul. Later, Mahomet and Saladin’s domination of the East would likely have destroyed any remaining Christian relics, and any in France would more likely have come from Constantinople. Likely, any such would also have been destroyed in the Revolution along with the records, and the trail would now be hopelessly cold. That may be the reason why the matter has not been seen as a fruitful area for research. There’s little doubt that there are significant errors in Wilson’s complete theory, but it seems to me that something very like the Mandylion story remains as the best shot still available, if indeed provenance can still be definitely ascertained. And yet the Shroud survives!\n\n","date":"January 18, 2014 at 4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73607","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"‘It eludes me why any Passion relics should be taken direct from Jerusalem to ancient Gaul.’ Well, it is well documented from tags on the relics themselves that they were- see my earlier postings about relics from ‘the Lord’s Tomb ‘ that are known in collection close to Lirey. Northern France was avid for relics and there were large collections, including those of Charlemagne, early on. They were added to by the Crusades. As the Shroud is first documented in northern France, overwhelmingly the most likely  source of its origin lies somewhere within these collections but, as I have said above, I have not the skills or time to do the research that is needed for this. It may have been captured by de Charny in the wars with the English that devastated this area and must have involved the looting of relics from the collections that had been there for centuries.\nI can only repeat that to stick to the Edessa theory without even mentioning more plausible alternatives for the arrival of the Shroud in northern France is simply bad history. A historian starts,BEFORE researching , going through ALL the possible routes of which, of course, there are many through which relics made their way from Jerusalem to northern France, and picks out the most likely for further research. If I did have the time to do the research, the Edessa theory would be very low down on my list indeed, partly because specialist scholars in Greek texts and Byzantine relic cults have always rejected it. ( Wilson does not even read Byzantine Greek!!)\n Although it is still not that likely, the most interesting alternative for me would be to chart the well-documented collecting of relics from Jerusalem by Pulcheria, the sister of the emperor Theodosius II, in the early fifth century. The reason for this is that her collection was housed not in the imperial palace but in the Blachaernae church on the outskirts of Constantinople and it was, of course, there that Robert de Clari , saw a shroud with an image that might have been one of her fifth century imports brought directly from Jerusalem. Again, going for the Edessa theory without even mentioning this possibility is bad history.\n You need to start by listing all the possibilities and then you may well find that the actual truth is concealed from us because the documentation surrounding the early history of the Shroud has been destroyed anyway in the medieval Anglo-French wars in northern France, in the French revolution or in the sacks of Constantinople by the crusaders and Ottomans! Sadly  that is usually the case and we simply have to say ‘we don’t know’! That is why I am usually sceptical of people who are certain that they know what happened ( and proud of it!).\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 5:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73660","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"It goes without saying that Wilson’s Mandylion/Image of Edessa/Shroud theory overrides the gaps.

He has never been dogmatic and has said more than once that a lot more research is needed, therefore the need to read all the books he has published on the topic, not forgetting “Holy Faces, Secret Places”, which is about other images that could be related to the Shroud.\nWe must not forget the mosaic discovered not long ago in Turkey and, yes, there is another gap to fill after 1204, where the Templar connection can help and hopefully some more evidence will surface soon.\nI have published two interviews with Wilson, one a full-page interview-article in a major daily and a third one, stored in a drawer, is yet to be published. We did have extremely frank discussions, and agreed about everything, which is what prompted me to place a lot of hope in his work. \nBut, unfortunately, there have been problems in Shroud research. In my view, it is wrong to concentrate on making the Shroud known as much as possible, occasionally publishing rubbish in the process. As I said more than once, crucial research inside churches has come to a standstill because the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing in the realm of Shroud studies, particularly in websites and publications, where generally only chummies have had doors opened to them. Of course, it is part of Shroud politics, it is a sort of closed circle, and is that conducive to progress? That apparently is the reason why people blowing their tops with articles criticising the attitudes of prelates on websites, petitions to the Pope and so on have been ignored. The clerics in Turin and Rome are not blindfolded, they do know what is going on.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73687","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"See # 11\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73688","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"‘Without that there would be no Shroud websites, no Shroud books, no Shroud conferences, no Shroud papers,no Shroud blogs.’\nSurely not true.

(along with the opinions of Scavone and Tycner-Wolicka) proves what I always say:  in historical research, you can make all kinds of extrapolations… \nLet’s avoid any kind of extrapolation for a second…  Here’s what we can take out of the list of relics included in the 958 letter of Constantine VII:\n1- The list include the words “spargana” (normally meaning “small cloths” or “linen strips”) and “sindon” (normally meaning “shroud” in the context of such a list of relics of the Passion), which are often found together in many lists of relics from Constantinople (dated between the middle of the 11th century and the beginning of 13th century) as well as in the list of relics of the Passion that we found in the manuscript entitled De Imaginibus writen by St John Damascene in 726 or 730.  This is not at all unusual to see both terms in a list of relics of the Passion and there is not a single one of those list that contain one specific term or mention to suggest that the sindon can be the same thing as the Mandylion (or even just related to the Mandylion or the Abgar legend in some way).\n2- The expression “which God wore” (Scavone translation) or “God-carrying cloth” (Tycner-Wolicka translation) should not be seen as a clear and direct reference to the presence of an image on the cloth.  To remain prudent and rational, it is much more probable to understand Constantine’s expression as a way to say that this sacred shroud (sindon) was a cloth that covered the body of Christ in the tomb for some time after his death.\n3- This list of the relics of Christ’s Passion made by Constantine VII DOES NOT INCLUDE A SPECIFIC AND CLEAR MENTION of the Mandylion.  \n4- Since the terms “Mandylion” and “Image of Edessa” were well-known in Constantinople at that time, there is no good reason why Constantine VII would not have used one of them in his list if he would really have wanted to include the Mandylion in his list of relics of the Passion.\n5- The fact that Constantine’s list of relics doesn’t contain a specific mention about the Mandylion is very interesting because we can find EXACTLY the same thing in the Damascene manuscript I mentioned above!  Effectively, if we compare the list of Damascene and the list of Constantine VII, we find out that they are VERY SIMILAR in their content and that they DOESN’T mention specifically the Mandylion as being a relic of the Passion. And what is very important to note is that the Damascene manuscript talk also specifically about the Mandylion and the Abgar legend but in another section (another book to be exact), which means that, for St John Damascene, the Mandylion had NOTHING TO DO with a relic of the Passion, which is something we can also find in the Acts of Thaddeus (with a specific mention to the burial cloths in the lost tomb in a part of the story that has nothing to do with the miracle of the imprint of Jesus face on a towel).\nRational conclusion (which try to avoid to make any wild extrapolation or speculation): We have a list of relics made by Constantine VII in 958 that doesn’t talk specifically about the Mandylion (even though this great relic arrived in his city just 14 years earlier), but that specifically mention the same burial cloths associated with Jesus’ Passion as many other later lists of relics from Constantinople, as well as a previous list made by St John Damascene in 726 or 730.  And since Damascene’s list is very similar to the list of Constantine VII, we have to conclude that they most probably refers to the same “batch” of relics of Christ’s Passion.  Now, is it still possible that the Mandylion could have been present in those lists, even though none of them made a specific mention of that cloth (in some hidden way or because some of them used some vague terms to talk about it)? We have to say “no way” to this question.  Effectively, we can be confident to say this for the good reason that it was clear for Damascene (as well as for the author of the Acts of Thaddeus) that the Mandylion had nothing to do with a burial cloth of Christ’s Passion…  So, since it was clear like this for Damascene and since his list refers probably to the same “batch” of relics as the one of Constantine VII, we can conclude that Constantine’s list most probably doesn’t refer at all to the Mandylion and therefore, we can also conclude that the Mandylion and the Shroud of Christ were 2 separate cloths and that the Mandylion was not a relic of the Passion of Christ (just like we can see for ourself in every known depiction of the Mandylion).  \nSeriously, once we compare this list of relics made by Constantine VII to the one made by Damascene and once we understand that, for Damascene, the Mandylion had nothing to do with a relic of the Passion, we can therefore consider this 958 letter writen by Constantine VII as another good piece of evidence to support the conclusion that the Mandylion was a different cloth than the Shroud of Christ and that this shroud had nothing to do with the Abgar legend in any way. \nOf course, with lots of speculations and extrapolations, people can come to a different conclusion (Scavone and Tycner-Wolicka’s point of views are there to prove this), but if we avoid to do those kind of wild spéculations and extrapolations (like I think I have just done so), then we must conclude that the Mandylion was most probably a different cloth than the Shroud of Christ and that it had nothing to do with a relic of the Passion of Christ.\n\n","date":"January 18, 2014 at 10:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73634","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Complementary note:  All along my researches on the subject, I have not found a lot of reference concerning this 958 letter of Constantine VII.

There is no mention of Lirey, nor Geoffrey de Charny or any related people in the book Index.\nIt is hardly possible that there had been no serious research on transfer of relics directly to France, after over 100 years of studies on history of the Shroud, begining with Chevalier, who traced its history back to Lirey. The only results were findings of some other alleged burial cloths, and some fragments of others. This way seems fruitless, and gives rather no promise for the future.

Hynek’s 1937 book. The 14th century Byzantine historian Nikefor Kallisto claimed that sindonon kai othonion were already stored in the Blachaernae church in Pulcheria times, the problem is how much this late source is reliable. And still we can be certain there were more than a single burial cloth in Byzantine collection.

It provides no explanation of where the Shroud was in those crucial first five hundred ( repeat five hundred) years before the sixth century and again does not fill in the gap after 1204.\nProvides an explanation -the Shroud was hidden inside the walls of Edessa, for 300-500 years. Many other relics (Tunic of Argenteuil, Titulus Crucis) shared similar fate for large part of their histoy.\nThen again the chance that the Image of Edessa and the Shroud are the same is extremely tenuous – and this is being generous !\nNonsense.\nOnce one begins to look at the alternatives, the Edessa theory fades quickly out of the picture as a likely possibility.\nAgain.\nI can only repeat that to stick to the Edessa theory without even mentioning more plausible alternatives for the arrival of the Shroud in northern France is simply bad history.\nA bad history is what you and the ‘Academia’ do.\nI think myself that the blind prejudice lies in sticking to one possible, but extraordinarily unlikely, solution so dogmatically that one is not even able to consider others.\nYou seem to dogamtically reject the possibility of Wilson being right, clutching at straws just to discourage the people to it.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 11:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73694","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Now time to adress Yannick:\nThis post by O.K.

Latros (although I saw claims of earlier apperance) -and is quite rarely used. The Mandylion is described in various sources as mantile, himation, tetradiplon,cheiromaktron, manutergium among others.\nEffectively, if we compare the list of Damascene and the list of Constantine VII, we find out that they are VERY SIMILAR in their content and that they DOESN’T mention specifically the Mandylion as being a relic of the Passion.\nAll the lists about the relics of the Passion are very similar, because the set of items was well known, and it not necessarly mean that all those relics were in possesion of Emperors at given time. Some lists include even the Holy Sepulchr itself!\nOf course, with lots of speculations and extrapolations, people can come to a different conclusion (Scavone and Tycner-Wolicka’s point of views are there to prove this), but if we avoid to do those kind of wild spéculations and extrapolations (like I think I have just done so)\nIt is impossible to avoid wild speculations here and you hadn’t done so. Your reasoning has several hidden assumptions, of which you are maybe not even aware. For example you assume that John Damascene knew the true nature of the (contemporary version) of the Mandylion in Edessa, which is not certain, he probably knew only legendary version of it. You also assume that Constantine VII shared Damascene views, which is another assumption. And so on.\nA few words to Dave:\nThe Shroud Arcaulf saw in Jerusalem was said to have been given to Charlemagne in 797AD, and may have been the “Shroud of Compiegne” in the south near Toulouse, and destroyed during the French Revolution.\nWe don’t know whether it was the same Shroud. Perhaps, or perhaps not. There is a document, mentioned by Waliszewski and van Haelst, suggesting that in the 9th century the Shroud was still in Jerusalem. There is another latin document from 1190 suggesting that some shroud, or copy of it, along wit some fragments of the Crown of Thorns were given to Charlemagne (confused with Charles the Bald). The matter is extremely complex there. It seems also that the Shroud of Compiegne and Sindon Munda from Kornelimünster, which exists up to this day, were two halves of the same cloth, 4 metres long, 1 wide.\nAnd BTW: Compiegne is in the northern France. Perhaps you confused it with the Shroud of Cadouin, almost certainly a fake from the 1st Crusade times.\nThere’s little doubt that there are significant errors in Wilson’s complete theory\nThere are no significant errors in Wilson’s theory, although some minor details are debatable.

Latros (although I saw claims of earlier apperance) -and is quite rarely used. The Mandylion is described in various sources as mantile, himation, tetradiplon,cheiromaktron, manutergium among others.”\nMy answer:  Honestly, I cannot tell if you’re right or wrong here, but one thing I know (because I have read a lot of ancient sources on the subject): Almost everytime you find a reference in an ancient source about the Mandylion (or the Image of Edessa), you also find a pretty clear reference to the Abgar legend!  Taking this into account, I remind you that, in this 958 letter of Constantine VII, there is no specific mention about the Mandylion, the Image of Edessa or simply about the Abgar legend.  Therefore, any conclusion that maintain that there is a real reference to the Mandylion in this letter of Constantine is a pure speculation that have no solid historical or textual base. This is exactly what I meant by “WILD SPECULATION”.\nYou also said: “All the lists about the relics of the Passion are very similar, because the set of items was well known, and it not necessarly mean that all those relics were in possesion of Emperors at given time.”\nMy answer: Because those lists are so similar (this is true for the lists mentioned by Damascene and Constantine VII, as well as for many other later lists of relics from Constantinople), I think the most rational conclusion we can draw is to assume that they were both talking about the same “batch” of relics of the Passion.  Effectively, I have a real hard time to believe that, around the same era, there could have been 2 different batch of relics that could have included all those same items that we find in the lists mentioned by Damascene and Constantine VII.  Of course, we can’t be 100% sure about this, but the most rational conclusion is certainly the one I just draw…  Look at the description of both list I made in my new comment and you’ll see that the number of similar items is very high and, therefore, push in favor of my conclusion: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/#comment-73748\nOne last thing about this: In order for my analysis and conclusion to work all right, it is not important if the “batch” of relics described by Damascene were already kept in Constantinople or were kept elsewhere (in Jerusalem for example) at the time he was writing. The only important thing to note is the great similarity that exist between both lists, which indicate a high probability that both authors were talking about the very same “batch” of relics of the Passion…\nYou also said: “It is impossible to avoid wild speculations here and you hadn’t done so. Your reasoning has several hidden assumptions, of which you are maybe not even aware. \nMy answer:  There’s a huge difference between making the most rational assumption you can do (without any bias in favor or not of Wilson’s hypothesis and only based on what we can find in ancient sources) and the kind of wild speculation I just mentioned…\nYou also said: “For example you assume that John Damascene knew the true nature of the (contemporary version) of the Mandylion in Edessa, which is not certain, he probably knew only legendary version of it.”  \nMy answer:  What I assume (and this is only based on what we find in the texts) is this:  For Damascene, AS WELL AS FOR THE AUTHOR OF THE ACTS OF THADDEUS, the Mandylion was a completely different cloth than the Shroud of Christ and had NOTHING TO DO with his Passion, death and burial.  And such views of these 2 ancient writers is in total agreement with all the known artistic depictions of the Mandylion.  I think it’s fair to say that when you put all those solid references and pieces of evidences together, it is not hard at all to conclude that the Mandylion was not the same cloth as the Shroud of Turin…  This is how the historical method should be used.  I hope M. Freeman can back-up my statement here!\nYou also said: “You also assume that Constantine VII shared Damascene views, which is another assumption. And so on.”\nMy answer:  Because of the high similarity of both lists of relics of the Passion (see again: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/#comment-73748), it’s pretty fair to assume that both writers were talking about the same “batch” of Christ’s relics.  And taking this probable fact into account, here’s my thinking: since it was very clear for Damascene and for the author of the Acts of Thaddeus (as well as for many authors who made lists of relics of the Passion in Constantinople between the middle of the 11th Century and the 13th Century) that the Mandylion was a completely different cloth than the Shroud of Christ (and his other burial cloths), then it is pretty fair to conclude that the spargana and the sindon mentioned in the list of Constantine VII also doesn’t refer at all to the Mandylion.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73751","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"And now it seems, that neither Charles, nor Yannick, despite speaking many truisms and arguments that are good but irrelevant here, refuted the main argument presented in the article above.

Reading between the lines (the ability which ‘Academia’ certainly does not possess) one can guess what this item was.\nAnd here we have: \n* reference to image created by sweat and blood in Getsemanne in Narratio, clearly showing there was a blood on the Mandylion, and that the image was extremely faint, like sweat imprint.\n* the same in the sermon of Gregory Referendarius, along with the allusions to the side wound, leaving little doubt that it was actually there (why otherwise would he have even mentioned this?)\n* previously unmentioned Chronographia by Symeon Magister, who wrote that contrary to Constantine, his two brothers-in-low, sons of usurper Romanos I Lekapenos, didn’t see the image (thus they were unworthy to wield power in God’s eyes).

Freeman who said that, most probably, the Mandylion was forged during the 6th Century. \nIn regard of all the known ancient sources (particularly the Doctrine of Addai and a testimony of the 5th century), I think there is another interesting possibility…  I think it is possible that the Mandylion was originaly created (painted) around the time the Doctrine of Addai was written (around 400 A.D.) in order to back-up the fact that, in this legendary text, there is a mention of a portrait of Christ made by the artist of king Abgar, which was supposedly taken back to Edessa and given to the king, who placed it in his palace.  \nSo, how about this:  Could it be possible that, at first, the Image of Edessa was not considered at all as a Holy relic with a miraculous imprint of Jesus face on it, but simply as a painted portrait of Jesus that would have been made by an artist of king Abgar, during Jesus lifetime (which is what we got in the doctrine of Addai) and, later on, probably during the 6th or maybe the 7th century, the Byzantine Church (with the help of the Acts of Thaddeus and the manuscript of Evagrius Scholasticus) made believe that this painted portrait of Jesus was not at all a manmade portrait but was truly a miraculous imprint of his face?  Note that this “change” of nature would have occurred at least 150 years or maybe more after the creation of the painted portrait of Jesus and I think it is possible that a gradual fainting of the portrait’s colors could explain the later idea that such an image had been miraculously created by Jesus with the help of his sweat.

From this time on, several churches notably in Georgia begin to display icons depicting Christ, with facial features that bear striking resemblances to the Shroud image. They usually claimed to be based on the Mandylion image of Edessa. Edessa at this time had become a major centre of Syriac Christian scholarship. If the Mandylion was not in fact the Shroud, it would seem to have at least been based on it. However it was also claimed to have been “not made by human hands”, a description which readily fits the Shroud image. \nAs for there being no references to such images before the 6th century, it is just that Byzantine scholars are not adequately equipped to read pre-Constantine Christian code. We have for example the inscription of Avercius Marcellus, bishop of Hieropolis ~180-200: He describes his return journey from Rome having seen all the cities of Syria, in the company of one Palut, the name of one of the first bishops of Edessa, thus: \n“Faith everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands from a fountain and this it ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread.”  \nThe “fish of exceeding great size” is clearly not meant to be the eucharist, separately referred to at the end of the paragraph, but represents something else. It is during Avercius’ time as bishop that Abgar VIII becomes Christian, probably being baptized by Avercius, with the “fish of exceeding great size” as a visual aid, and hinted at in the pseudonymous allegory commissioned by Abgar VIII to mark the occasion, which became known as the doctrine of Addai. Avercius very likely returned the “fish of exceeding great size” to its place in Antioch, but it was subsequently brought back to Edessa, upon the impending destruction of that apostolic city.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73734","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"The fish of great size is another fascinating tidbit.

First of all, in the Narratio, we can find 2 versions of the same legend and one of them still locate the action before the Passion of Christ (which can be seen as the “traditional” version of the legend).  This is important because if the second version was due to a better understanding of the hypothetical bloody nature of the Mandylion, it is highly probable that the author of the Narratio would have only kept the new version (while putting the focus on the presence of blood in the sweat, which is not the reality), while leaving aside the “traditional” version of the legend.\nSecondly, and this is more important, the location of the action in Gethsemane is probably due to the presence of the word “sudarium” in another previous manuscript of the legend, which is used to describe the cloth that was used to Jesus to wipe his face, leading to the miraculous imprint.  This previous manuscript if called “The letter of the three patriarchs to Emperor Theophilus of Constantinople”, which is dated to the first half of the 9th century.  Even though this text used the word “sudarium” to describe the cloth with the miraculous imprint, it still located the action BEFORE the Passion of Christ (the letter specified that the miraculous imprint happened “while the Lord and Saviour was on earth”), which is similar to the “traditional” version of the Abgar legend, which locates the miraculous imprint some days before the beginning of Jesus’ Passion!  In fact, it most probably used that term “sudarium” simply because the author of the text said that it was Christ’s sweat (instead of the water he used to washed his face, which is found in the first versions of the legend) that was used by him to produce the miraculous imprint OF HIS FACE ONLY (the text is specific about the fact that Jesus only wiped his face with the cloth).  Note that, in this version, the sweat of Christ had NOTHING TO DO with the bloody sweat described by St Luke in the story of the Passion…\nTaking all those information into account, I think it’s fair to conclude that this new version that we find in the Narratio (which locate the action in Gethsemane) is only an extrapolation that originate from the previous use of the word “sudarium” by the author of “The Letter of the three patriarchs to Emperor Theophilus of Constantinople” and his idea that the miraculous imprint was done by Jesus with the use of his sweat (again, normal sweat in this version and not the bloody sweat described by St Luke in his Gospel).  What reinforces this assumption is the fact that we can find a direct reference to this particular letter in the Narratio!  It is also possible that such a change of location was also inspired in some way by some theological views of the Church of Constantinople, which we can possibly found an echo in Gregory Referendarius’ speech (which, as Guscin told us in a paper he wrote some years ago, can’t be taken in any way as a clear and direct reference to the presence of bloodstains on the Mandylion)… \nOn this subject, it is very interesting to note that, in his speech, Gregory refers also directly to this letter of the three patriarchs, which shows the great influence this manuscript (and the reference to the sweat used by Christ to form the image on the cloth) had in Constantinople at the time the Mandylion came to this city (which is the same era in which the Narratio was written).  In such a context, it is highly probable that the development of the second version of the Abgar legend we see in the Narratio (which located the action in Gethsemane and talk about the bloody sweat of Christ), as well as the speech of Gregory, was mainly influenced by this letter of the three patriarchs and his reference to a sudarium and the sweat used by Christ to form the image on that cloth (again, a normal sweat and not the bloody sweat of Gethsemane).\nAgain, to understand an important change in the legend of Abgar, it’s very important to understand the historical context and to take into account the previous texts that talk about the Abgar legend and the story of the miraculous imprint of Jesus’ face.  \nOne last note:  In the second version of the legend that we find in the Narratio (which locate the action in Gethsemane), the focus is put in his sweat (which he would have wipe out with a cloth, thus producing the miraculous imprint), and not on the blood that could have been present in his sweat.\nTaking this new version that is found in the Narratio and extrapolate that this is a clear piece of evidence that there were bloodstains on the Mandylion is just something any good and honest scholar would never do…  Once we put things in the right context, such an idea is clearly a wild extrapolation, just like the idea that Gregory Referendarius’ speech contains a direct mention to the presence of bloodstains on the Mandylion.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73747","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Good to see someone who knows the texts contributing to the debate!\n\n","date":"January 20, 2014 at 3:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73782","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Thank you very much M.

Effectively, it is highly improbable that, between Damascene and Constantine time, there could have been two separate “batch” of relics of Christ’s Passion so similar in their content.  But since Damascene doesn’t tell where those relics were kept, it is impossible to know if they were already kept in Constantinople at the time he was writing his manuscript.  Nevertheless, the fact that he made a clear separation between those relics of Christ’s Passion and the Abgar legend (including the Mandylion) must be considered with great care when it’s time to analyze the content of Constantine’s list, because the relics mentioned by this Emperor of Constantinople were most probably the same relics as the ones mentioned by Damascene some 200 years earlier…\nNote that because of the proximity in time between the testimony of Arculf (who saw a shroud of Christ in Jerusalem in 670) and the manuscript of Damascene (726 or 730), it’s truly possible that the Shroud mentioned by Damascene was the same as the one Arculf saw in Jerusalem and, therefore, it is also truly possible to think that this shroud of Christ was still kept in Jerusalem at the time Damascene was writing his manuscript.  This assumption is reinforced by the fact that Damascene included many Holy places of Palestine (he mention, among other places, Mont Sinai, Nazareth, Bethleem, Golgotha, the Holy sepulchre, the mount of olivier, the garden of Gethsemane, etc.) along with his list of relics of Christ’s Passion…\nTo summarize all I said in all the posts I made on this topic, I would say this:  IF (the “if” is important of course) the burial cloths mentioned by St John Damascene in his list of relics of the Passion are the very same cloths as the ones mentioned by Constantine VII in his own list of relics, then we have to conclude that Constantine’s list doesn’t contain any reference to the Mandylion as being a relic of the Passion of Christ and, therefore, the Mandylion was not the Shroud of Christ and had nothing to do with his Passion, death and burial, which would be totally consistent with the vast majority of the versions of the Abgar legend and totally consistent also with all the known artistic depictions of the Mandylion. \nAnd to conclude, I want to say this:  Because I’m convinced that the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth, I would like to find as much as you a rational historical path for this cloth from the moment it was found empty in the empty tomb to the time it get to Lirey, France in the middle of the 14th century.  Nevertheless, because of my long inquiry on the subject, I am profoundly convinced that the Mandylion’s trail is not the right path to follow in order to build a rational history for the Shroud before his arrival in Lirey.  The only value I’m ready to give to the Mandylion is the probable fact that such a depiction of the face of the living Christ was based (directly or, more likely, indirectly) on the image of the face of Christ that we see on the Shroud of Turin.  No more, no less than this. \nAnd for the Shroud’s ancient path, to remain prudent, I like to think that it was quietly transferred directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople at some unknown date (possibly before the transfer of the Mandylion, if the letter of Constantine VII is authentic).  After all, from ancient sources, we know that other relics of Christ’s Passion (like the lance, the sponge, the wood of the cross, the crown of thorns, etc.) were transferred that way directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople for their protection, without ever spending one day in Edessa…  Question: Why those transfers are known and not the transfer of the Shroud?   Maybe because this relic was more important than the others (which would have made it more attractive for the enemies of the orthodox Christians like the Arabs, the Persians or some heretic group).  Consequently, for its protection (and maybe to avoid some invasion thread of Constantinople), it was better not to tell anything about such a transfer and keep it secret.  Of course, this is just a possible explanation and others can be put forward…  But in the end, whatever the reason, I still believe that, in the light of all the known historical sources concerning both the relics of the Passion and the Mandylion, a direct transfer from Jerusalem to Constantinople without a séjour in Edessa is the most rational and prudent hypothesis we can draw for the Shroud of Turin.  I hope that even the most fanatical of Wilson’s fan out there will at least recognize that such a hypothesis is POSSIBLE (I don’t say probable, just possible).\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73748","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Note:  I just realize that there are 2 words in French in my previous post:\nMount of olivier:  Read “Mount of Olives”\nSéjour:  Read “stay”.\nSorry.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73754","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"‘Of course, this is just a possible explanation and others can be put forward (HURRAH!!]… But in the end, whatever the reason, I still believe that, in the light of all the known historical sources concerning both the relics of the Passion and the Mandylion, a direct transfer from Jerusalem to Constantinople without a séjour in Edessa is the most rational and prudent hypothesis we can draw for the Shroud of Turin.

It is also likely that someone who has never studied the Shroud but who is working on one of the other medieval linens that survive, using technology that is way ahead of anything known in 1978 or 1988, comes up with some findings about images on the medieval linens which can be applied to the Shroud.

And the lists of relics while mentioning an item that could be either Mandylion or the Shroud, rarely give precise description what is it, or references to Abgar legend. Thus confusion sometimes. See Scavone’s paper http://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos-jesus-images-in-constantinople-the-documentary-evidence/ For example: “In 1200 the inventory of Antonius of Novgorod similarly names two linen cloths: linteum and “linteum representing the face of Christ” Riant, Exuviae 223: . . . monstrantur in aedibus aureis Caesaris: Crux veneranda, Corona [spinea], Spongia, Clavi, iterum Sanguis, Chlamys purpurea, Lancea, . . . linteum faciem Christi repraesentans . . .; quae omnia in sola ecclesia parva B. Dei Genitricis reperiuntur.\nIs it the Shroud or the Mandylion?\nAfter all, from ancient sources, we know that other relics of Christ’s Passion (like the lance, the sponge, the wood of the cross, the crown of thorns, etc.) were transferred that way directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople for their protection, without ever spending one day in Edessa… Question: Why those transfers are known and not the transfer of the Shroud?\nNot all of those transfers are known -the transfer of the lance or the Crown of Thorns are unknown, for example.\nSorry, but this is another pure extrapolation made by people who desperately want to back-up the hypothesis of Wilson. First of all, in the Narratio, we can find 2 versions of the same legend and one of them still locate the action before the Passion of Christ (which can be seen as the “traditional” version of the legend). This is important because if the second version was due to a better understanding of the hypothetical bloody nature of the Mandylion, it is highly probable that the author of the Narratio would have only kept the new version (while putting the focus on the presence of blood in the sweat, which is not the reality), while leaving aside the “traditional” version of the legend.\nNo, he couldn’t.\nRemember, this is Byzantium. Despotic Eastern society. Some things cannot be related there directly, but only in a hidden, suggestive way. You must read between the verses to understand the proper meaning of the message.\nImagine such situation: the long awaited legendary Mandylion arrives in Constantnople, and then suddenly comes some high-ranked priest and shows them the relics, and tells to the people: “Sorry guys, the whole traditional version of the Mandylion legend that your grandmas told you while you were children is simply a bulls&*%^. It was not created before the Passion, look there are bloodmarks visible. Moreover, contrary to the false old version, it is not the image of the face, but the burial shroud. The whole hitherto tradition was nothing but a bunch of lies.”\nOf course  such scenario was impossible. And so it was impossible to discard the traditional version. Instead, a new version was suggested. But only suggested, with a subtle indication (but only indication!) that it is the correct one! Read that part of Naaration, and you understand. It clearly states that this version was “previously unknown”, and that it is “not unbelievable or lacking witnesses” Those are only suggestions. There is not even directly mentioned that there are bloodmarks on the Mandylion (which would discredit the “traditional” version) -but there are clear allusions to them, and everyone knows the point!\nIt is a mastery of composition of the text. And no word is used there without a reason. Thus there cannot be the slighest doubts to the presence of bloodmarks on the Image of Edessa.  \nSecondly, and this is more important, the location of the action in Gethsemane is probably due to the presence of the word “sudarium” in another previous manuscript of the legend, which is used to describe the cloth that was used to Jesus to wipe his face, leading to the miraculous imprint. This previous manuscript if called “The letter of the three patriarchs to Emperor Theophilus of Constantinople”, which is dated to the first half of the 9th century. Even though this text used the word “sudarium” to describe the cloth with the miraculous imprint, it still located the action BEFORE the Passion of Christ (the letter specified that the miraculous imprint happened “while the Lord and Saviour was on earth”), which is similar to the “traditional” version of the Abgar legend, which locates the miraculous imprint some days before the beginning of Jesus’ Passion! In fact, it most probably used that term “sudarium” simply because the author of the text said that it was Christ’s sweat (instead of the water he used to washed his face, which is found in the first versions of the legend) that was used by him to produce the miraculous imprint OF HIS FACE ONLY (the text is specific about the fact that Jesus only wiped his face with the cloth). Note that, in this version, the sweat of Christ had NOTHING TO DO with the bloody sweat described by St Luke in the story of the Passion…\nNo chance Yannick. The allusions are clear, and I see no other possibility than the real presence of the bloodstains on the Image of Edessa. Otherwise, the whole story of Gethsemane wouldn’t have been even invented -for what damn purpose?\nAnd my advice: forget all those fairy tales, about creating the Mandylion before the beginning of Jesus’ Passion. Forget the “traditional” story, forget the Gethsemane version, forget the Damascene or Acts of Thaddeus for a moment. It is all eyewashing. It is all irrelevant here, at this moment. The only important thing is what Byzantines saw on the so called Image of Edessa, when it was brought to Constantinople on 16 August 944, and went into procession through the whole city.\n\n","date":"January 20, 2014 at 3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73849","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Anything I can say here is a total waste of time.

At least some of his contentions could have been been verified with help from Rome and if this did not take concrete shape it has been largely due, again, to what has gone on in the realm of Shroud studies.

In my view that has been the case with Walter Kauffman, of Princeton, when it came to Nietzsche. He also had to defend Freud by attacking Adler and Jung, ignoring the fact that while there may have been some contradictions in what Jung wrote many of the Freud files are still not available for scrutiny and these would help in clarifying the many doubts in the battle that is raging in the realm of studies in the field of psychoanalysis.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2014 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-73944","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":">>Things are going to get crazy around here shortly and you’ll want to be around.

In fact, there is no reference anywhere concerning the transfer of the crown of thorns, even though there are references for the presence of this relic in Jerusalem and, later on, in Constantinople…  This is important because it seems to be the same thing for the Shroud.

In this paper, we learn that this transfer happened in 629 and was reported in the manuscript “Chronicon Paschale”.  \nTaking all this into account, I’ll leave you with this question: If there really were a direct transfer of some relics of the Passion from Jerusalem to Constantinople before the transfer of the Mandylion from Edessa to Constantinople, why wouldn’t it be the same for the crown of thorns and the Shroud?  After all, based on ancient sources, these are the only 2 places that we know for sure (without having to use wild speculations and extrapolations) where those 2 relics were kept before the sack of Constantinople of 1204.

The allusions to the side wound.\nNeither you, nor Charles, even attempted seriously to explain all those coincidences, assuming the Shroud is not the Mandylion transferred to Constantinople in 944. You run away from those features. I am not interested in ‘direct routes’ from Jerusalem to Lirey, nor theological debates with heretical movements in Byzantine Empire, I am only interested in an answer to A,B,C,D.\nQuestion: Maybe I mist it, but I would like you to explain to me how in the world you can think the shroud that Arculf saw could have been the same thing as the Mandylion, while we know that, in 670 A.D., the Mandylion was still kept in Edessa and not in Jerusalem? I don’t understand how you can think the Shroud of Arculf could have been the same thing as the Mandylion…\nThere are many possible scenarios. Some assume that the Shroud was transferred to Jerusalem and later to Constantinople in the 7th century, then, during Iconoclast period in the 8th it was transferred once again to Edessa, where it became (a new-old version of) the Mandylion. In theory, it is possible, though improbable. The fact is that the history of the relics may be much more complicated, than everyone thought. When my new post about Titulus Crucis appears on the scene, you will understand.\nWell the history of the relics may be so complicated as the history of The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies painted by Van Klomp. If you watched “Allo, Allo”, you know what I am talking about…\n\n","date":"January 21, 2014 at 5:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-74015","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"O.K., from your comment above, it is obvious that, unlike myself and the vast majority of scholars, you believe that the various changes that occurred to the Abgar legend over the centuries were due to a better understanding of the real burial nature of the Mandylion that occurred progressively and very slowly (at least, it would seem so)…\nTaking this into account, I got a good question for you: If this idea first put forward by Wilson would be true, then can you explain to me how in the world we don’t find one single artistic depiction (some we have now where probably made by artists of the 12th century who were eye-witnesses of the relic in Constantinople) that shows any signs of the supposed burial nature of the cloth and why in the world we don’t find one single manuscript of the Abgar legend that located the miraculous imprint after the crowning of thorns (while this is the most evident injuries we see in the face region of the Shroud) and also, why in the world we don’t find one single manuscript that DIRECTLY (without having to use wild assumptions) associate the Mandylion with a burial cloth?\nIf the real burial nature of the cloth would have been progressively discovered over the centuries, don’t you think it’s a bit odd that no one would ever have tell the truth about it, except for some vague references that you think are evident clues?
