We are a small museum (opened February 2009) and a relatively new site (been online since September 2009).  Yet we have had some fabulous talks by the likes of Dr. John Jackson, Barrie Schwortz, Larry Schauf and several talks on the groundbreaking holographic work of Dr. Petrus Soon.\nRon, thanks for the compliment, but it isn’t a find.  I created it since I am the creator and webmaster for ShroudNM.com, the online part (iSEAM) of the Shroud Exhibit and Museum, Inc. (SEAM).\nFor anyone who knows of other reliable Shroud sites, please let me know so I can build a somewhat complete set of pages to search.  I wanted to make it easy for folks to search a specific site without having to know anything about the search information in the address bar.  I am a geeky IT guy, but most people don’t care about that kind of thing, they just want to search sites in which they are interested.  So I offer this search capability to all interested, my small contribution to Shroud researchers.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2012 at 6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/17/comment-promoted-or-one-could-use-shroudnm-comsearch-html/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-15150","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted: Or one could use shroudnm.com/search.html","post":"Sorry, that’s Dr. Petrus Soons.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2012 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/17/comment-promoted-or-one-could-use-shroudnm-comsearch-html/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-15151","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted: Or one could use shroudnm.com/search.html","post":"Sorry for the misunderstanding.
