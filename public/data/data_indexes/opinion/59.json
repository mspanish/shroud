I take it you are acquainted with Hal Hellman’s “Great Feuds in … ” series, which includes his volumes in Mathematics, Technology, Science and Medicine. I have read the Mathematics volume and found it quite enlightening, although I shan’t say disgusting. \nIsaac Newton was the worst, he quarrelled with everybody, Robert Hooke, the Jesuits, Samuel Pepys, John Locke, John Flamsteed and Gottfried Leibniz. He was particularly manipulative with Flamsteed. His quarrels with Hooke and Flamsteed resulted in his ripping out whole pages from the Principia which had any reference to either.  Only Leibniz was an equally capable  adversary to Newton’s paranoiac hostility, resulting in Newton’s periodic nervous break-downs.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2014 at 3:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/06/hit-and-run-trolling-and-a-whole-lot-more/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-85787","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hit and Run Trolling and a Whole Lot More","post":"I would also suggest that Colin Berry write more temperate letters, because, though I can conjure up the imagination to conceive of him as a reasonable person, despite the tone of his “writings”, I seriously doubt that many other people would be able to.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2014 at 11:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/06/hit-and-run-trolling-and-a-whole-lot-more/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-85904","author":"Willard van Orman Quine","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hit and Run Trolling and a Whole Lot More","post":"I would also suggest that Colin Berry write more temperate postings, because, though I can conjure up the imagination to conceive of him as a reasonable person, despite the tone of his “writings”, I seriously doubt that many other people would be able to.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2014 at 11:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/06/hit-and-run-trolling-and-a-whole-lot-more/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-85905","author":"Willard van Orman Quine","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hit and Run Trolling and a Whole Lot More","post":"*corrected*\n\n","date":"March 7, 2014 at 11:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/06/hit-and-run-trolling-and-a-whole-lot-more/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-85906","author":"Willard van Orman Quine","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hit and Run Trolling and a Whole Lot More","post":"Troll Central.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2014 at 12:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/06/hit-and-run-trolling-and-a-whole-lot-more/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-85932","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hit and Run Trolling and a Whole Lot More","post":"Look at:\nhttp://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/after-2-years-and-over-200-postings-i-think-ive-finally-cracked-it-the-enigma-of-the-shroud-of-turin/\nSo, Colin finally “cracked” the enigma of the Shroud.\nHe now can explain all of the properties of the Shroud image, i.e superficiality at fiber and thread/fabric level, half-tone etc… \nMost of his claims are based on theoretical hypotheses.\nHowever, I think that CB’s claims has to be considered seriously.\nWhat do we need ?\nWe need some experiments.\nI can perform some experiments.\n\n","date":"March 13, 2014 at 4:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/06/hit-and-run-trolling-and-a-whole-lot-more/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-88376","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hit and Run Trolling and a Whole Lot More","post":"I don’t think anyone has explored the scorch theory to the degree Colin now has.
