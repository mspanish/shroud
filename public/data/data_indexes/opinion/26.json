Regarding other studies, the subsequent connection of MNS antigen expression related to non-human primates was unknown at the time the studies were performed by BB’s group, and their  significance unrealized afterwards until relatively recently.  It’s indicative, but it is important to bear in mind that this is only a single, brief report, not published in a typical peer-reviewed scientific journal).  It is important not to overextend what the data do and do not show.\nIn the analysis of the blood data involving species of origin, one has to disconnect the fact that the fibers came from a cloth containing an image.  \nBTW, the description of the immunological tests in part xiv) of the Stochastic paper is inaccurate.  The results do not suggest that it is human blood on the basis of positive results involving human antiglobulin.  As written, this would involve antibodies raised in humans, which would most certainly not react in this case!  Similarly with human anti-albumin-this is not not merely semantics or trying to be picky-it’s analogous to discussing a particular chemical reaction and confusing the reactants with the products.\n\n","date":"June 18, 2014 at 9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-130704","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us","post":"No one of us is a blood specialist like you, so thanks for the precisions but the fact remains:  it is human blood on the Shroud at 99% of certainty…  Adler was totally convinced of this (and this is EVIDENT when you read his book about the Shroud), just like Baima Bollone and almost every single forensic and medical expert who analysed the images of blood and serum stains.

This is not true. A glance at just the bloodstains above the eyes, or across the back, shows a wide variation of image intensity around them.\nFurthermore, the major part of those bloodstains which could have resulted from body- contact which was later removed would be, in a body being carried in a sheet, around the sides of the legs and sides, where we know there ought to be plenty of whip marks, as these are found on the front of the legs too. So there ought to be a large number of off-register scourge-marks down the sides of the dorsal legs, which there aren’t.

Note that my personal explanation for the fact that there are some off-register bloodstains on the Shroud versus the body image that you can find in our paper can also explain quite well the bloodstain that is off the elbow of the frontal image…  Effectively, if there was a transfer of the enshrouded corpse from a central place Inside the tomb to a stone bench carved in one of the walls, it would be natural for those who did this transfer to have touched the elbows of the Shroud man.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2014 at 8:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-131212","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us","post":"The marks you refer to are not off-register spacially, they are within the outline of the body.

How do you know?  All we know is that Rogers was not thinking about a stochastic process of image formation at all when he built his own hypothesis.  If he could have come accross the work of Fazio and Mandaglio, how do you know if he could not have come to the conclusion that a weak release of postmortem gases could not have produced a stochastic result of yellowed fibers on the Shroud’s surface instead of the kind of result he proposed (where each coated fiber that would come in contact with these gases would get colored)?  How do you know this Mr. Anoxie?\nThe quote you refer to is a quote that comes directly from one of Fazio and Mandaglio’s paper and when I wrote it on the blog, I was only trying to back up my own conclusion that the image formation was very mild (which is a conclusion that fits with Fazio and Mandaglio’s original proposal as well as it fits with my “alternative” hypothesis involving a thin and uneven layer of impurities that would have taken a huge role in the image formation…  At that moment, it was easier for me to take such a quote from authentic experts in radiation like Fazio and Mandaglio in order to back-up my idea that the image formation process was surely very mild than trying to describe the alternative scenario I recently proposed on this blog and which I was only starting to build up in my head back then!

I’m still not ready to throw his hypothesis, in the form he described it, to the garbage.  It’s just that I think a stochastic event of coloration is something that, in regard of all the known data, is truly possible (and which could have involved the same postmortem gases than Rogers thought).  I also think Rogers should have been more precise concerning the thin layer of carbohydrate impurities as the sole image chromophore by insisting on the probable fact that such a thin layer could have been uneven on the surface of the cloth’s top-most fibers and that such a probable fact could have played a huge role in the formation of the body image and its particular characteristics, especially when it comes to the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area.  Note that this is the kind of precision that is not particularly clear in Rogers’ writings.\nIn sum, here’s my opinion on this subject:  We got a stochastic kind of result in the image area when it comes to the colored fibers distribution.  What can explain this very particular and important observation?  For me, there are 3 possibilities:\n1- The nature of the chromophore.  In this case, I tend to highly favored the hypothesis of a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities well over the PCW hypothesis because I believe it can offer, on the contrary to the PCW hypothesis, a possible and rational explanation for both the very tiny thickness of the image and its discontinuous distribution.\n2- The nature of the image formation process.  In this case, I tend to favored the hypothesis of Fazio and Mandaglio over the one of Rogers, as both Italians proposed that the image is the result of an event that involved a so tiny amount of energy that it wasn’t able to colored all the fibers that became in contact with this weak energy.\n3- A combination of the first two possibilities, which is something that, to my knowledge, I’m the very first to propose…  In other words, in order to explain the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area, Rogers proposed (not very clearly) that a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities was more or less coating the top-most fibers of the cloth (in a uneven and non-homogeneous way) and that such a thin and uneven layer of impurities was the only thing that became colored in order to form the body image.  Fazio and Mandaglio, on the other hand, proposed that such a discontinuous distribution could be explained, not because of the particular nature of the chromophore, but because of the particularly weak nature of the energy that was at the origin of the formation of the body image.  And after a long reflection about this complicated issue, I personally came to the conclusion that we must consider the possibility that not only the particular nature of the chromophore could have played a huge role in the image formation and in the resulting characteristics of this image (especially when it comes to the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area) BUT ALSO that the particular nature of the image formation event (namely a very weak release of biological energy, which was not strong enough to be able to color all the coated fibers on the cloth’s surface) could have played a complementary role in the image formation and in the resulting characteristics of this image.\nBut I repeat that even if I propose a third hypothesis in an effort to explain the image formation and its very particular characteristics, I’m not ready yet to totally reject the other two proposal I mentioned above, in the form they were described by Rogers and the Fazio-Mandaglio tandem, which is different than you when it comes to Fazio and Mandaglio’s hypothesis…\n\n","date":"June 22, 2014 at 6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-132387","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us","post":"Great image Dan, I fully understand how you must feel now, being bombarded by mails from Yannick and me!\n\n","date":"June 18, 2014 at 11:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-130767","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us","post":"Yup.

Here’s what he told me by email:\nWe have already studied the interaction between alpha particles and linen and I send you the article that has been published in Italian language.\n In this article,, we have deduced the I(z) correlation when alpha particles of about 6 MeV energy emitted by human body collide with a linen that envelopes his corpse. The above kinetic energy is sufficient to penetrate the cloth for 20-30 µm. This result is visible in Fig. 2 (full line: Jackson fit; dotted line: alpha particle fit).\nAs you can see, the fit of the known experimental intensity of the image data (13 values) in the alpha case was compared with the Jackson one, by using both the correlation coefficient squared r2 and reduced χ2. Our estimations of reduced χ2 and r2 were 0.55 and 0.49, respectively; while the Jackson’s ones  were 0.53 and 0.58, respectively (see Table 1). Consequently, the  I(z) correlation obtained for alpha particles (see Fig. 2) was very good. However, we have rejected this hypothesis because the alpha can not distinguish the fibril that must be yellowed from the other that must retain the background color. Indeed, the agreement with the characteristics of the body image is only on the macroscopic level because the above particles would strike and to yellow all the fibrils.\nSo, we will have a continue distribution of optical density value, while on the Shroud this parameter has ONLY TWO VALUES. This occurs also if we consider proton, deuteron , 3H and 3He.\nFinally, A HUMAN BODY DOES NOT EMIT ALPHA PARTICLES OR PROTON OR DEUTERON…\nNote: I agree 100% with Fazio about that!\n\n","date":"June 19, 2014 at 1:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-131331","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us","post":"So what, precisely is the nature of the ‘energy’ that emanated fro the body.

Indeed, the four mechanisms described above (including the one described by Rogers and Arnoldi, which do not propose that a stochastic event happened during the image formation) could be, in theory, able to gradually yellow a number of fibrils proportional to the absorbed energy over a few years or decades.”\nTaking this fact into account, you will understand that the answer to your question is not easy at all and would definately need a lot of testing on old linen samples under proper lab control…\nWe also mention this: “Finally, it is still possible to think that other natural mechanisms that have never been proposed yet could be able to yield the kind of stochastic distribution of yellowed fibrils we see in the image area on the Shroud. If someone proposes a natural mechanism of this nature in the future, this could be added in the list of potential sources for the Shroud body image formation. For this reason, this paper does not solve the question. On the contrary, it offers to the Scientific Community, involved in the study of the Shroud of Turin a good reason to pursue further investigations, which could include coloring tests on linen samples that would be made with a known ancient method of manufacturing linen cloths.”\nIf this is not an honest and scientific way to see the reality of the image formation issue, I don’t know what it is…\n\n","date":"June 20, 2014 at 3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-131802","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
