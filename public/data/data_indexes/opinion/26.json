In the past I’ve heard him state something along the lines of “I wish I had the lamp equipment to test a lower intensity scorch”. Well as a much self hyped prominent scientist, you would think he would be able to access one if he really wanted to, or at least get an ex colleague or someone to do it for him. It seems very convenient that he hasn’t.\nUntil he does, I for one will continue to be totally unconvinced by his “scorch theory”, not just for the lack of flourescence, but for a multitude of other reasons too.\n\n","date":"July 1, 2012 at 4:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/30/rude-comment-of-the-day/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-13257","author":"Matt","site":"shroudstory"}]
