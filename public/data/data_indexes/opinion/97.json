You should know better than ask a scientist to give proof. I don’t deal in proof, leaving that to mathematicians and logicians who start with axioms that are assumed to be unchallengeable. I start with hypotheses that  are always challengeable, and then attempt to assemble evidence that supports a case.\nYou are the one who should be put on the spot, claiming that complex processes of wear and tear cannot explain the image we see today. How can you possibly know that? Do you have eyes that can see events at the microscopic level happening over hundreds of years?\nIn fact, the known structure and composition of flax fibres can account very readily for a highly superficial image AND mechanically-weakened fibres, due to the way that hemicelluloses are distributed between primary and secondary cell walls. I’ll be setting out my arguments in some detail in my next posting, addressed primarily to MSM journalists, warning them against pseudo-science being promoted as if unchallengeable axioms. The most glaring example is that fatuous and self-serving claim that the ~200nm(?) thick Shroud image is too gossamer-thin to have been formed using conventional energy sources. That is not just misinformation. It is a lot more serious than that. It is wilful and systematic disinformation,, backed up with virtually no hard information, and in any case contrary to basic physics, chemistry and botany. A 200nm thick image-receptive primary cell wall is approx 50 times as thick as a cell membrane (~4nm) which is a lipid bilayer, approx two phospholipid  molecules end-to-end. Since there are at typically  50 atoms from one side of the bilayer, then 50 bilayers is  50 atom x 50 atoms thick (i.e. 2500 atoms in all). I would expect a similar figure for the PCW, which makes it very substantial at the molecular level (it has to be, seeing the job it had to do before the SCW was formed, withstanding cell turgor and hydrostatic pressure). So why the instant dismissal almost everywhere in the Shroud literature of a 200nm image thickness?\n It’s high time someone blew the whistle, in the hope that sooner or later someone (preferably a serious-minded investigative journalist) hears and responds to that whistle, even from afar on a relatively obscure  science-based backwater site such as this.\n","date":"February 27, 2014 at 3:30 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/mickey-mouse-science-now-in-the-cross-hairs/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-3139","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Mickey Mouse science now in the crosshairs.","post":"Colin,\nWhat does “MSM” and “PR” mean ?\nWho are these “MSM journalists” ?\nYou wrote: “3.
