[{"title":"The Shroud Of Turin: Real Or Fake? Does it matter if you are Catholic?","post":"Excuse me but here in Quebec, Canada, the vast majority of devout catholics doesn’t care one bit about the Shroud of Turin !!!  And I know some people who are not devout in any religion who believe the Shroud is the genuine burial Shroud of Jesus…  So this affirmation is far from being correct !!!\n\n","date":"September 21, 2011 at 3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/21/the-shroud-of-turin-real-or-fake-does-it-matter-if-you-are-catholic/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-3986","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud Of Turin: Real Or Fake?

Does it matter if you are Catholic?","post":"I agree. Very well put.  \nI think the same is true of many of the Catholic saints. Some of the saints were early martyrs. I’m not Catholic but I’ve been interested in all of Church history recently and I’ve been very moved by the witness and dedication of the early martyrs.  Who can say that those saints were only “Catholics”, especially if it happened before Constantine. \nAll of Church history merges together at some point. And the death of Christ is certainly common to us all, so the Shroud (if it is Christ’s Shroud) would be something that all Christian sects and denominations would find intriguing.\n\n","date":"September 22, 2011 at 8:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/21/the-shroud-of-turin-real-or-fake-does-it-matter-if-you-are-catholic/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-4004","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"}]
