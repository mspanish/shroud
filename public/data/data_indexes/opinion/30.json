[{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"This topic has occurred before, and is likely to be fraught with misunderstanding of exactly where the man in the shroud’s shoulders are. “There appears to be a mislignment” needs to be illustrated in order for us to agree or disagree. Here are a couple of images from Shroud Scope, with some relevant details highlighted: http://imgur.com/PmbbVqc. To me, both shoulders are too high, and the shape of them from the front does not match their shape from behind. The absence of neck and general departure from the wishful idea of “anatomical perfection” is often taken as evidence that the two images were independently created (the non-authenticist view), or are because the head was tilted forward, one or both arms dislocated, rigor mortis or some other ad hoc interpretation (the authenticist view). Most of the great pathologists, of course, didn’t observe any distortion at all.\n\n","date":"July 18, 2014 at 11:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-139144","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"Hugh your dorsal image illustrates my point.

This image will naturally vary depending on the muscularity of the individual. In me, the slope of the trapezius is not as steep or as “bulky” as my brother, who is anatomically similar but works out at the gym a lot. To my eye, the image on the shroud is of a man who is not excessively muscular, but has generally quite well developed muscles. Whether such muscle development is consistent with the notions we have of Jesus???? If he did a reasonable amount of physical labour, then maybe its consistent. \n“the shape of them from the front does not match their shape from behind”\nA: This is explained by the tenting that occurred on the frontal image but did not occur on the dorsal image. Also, the trapezius muscle is basically flush with the back, but not with the front of the body.\nAs your images show, there is not symmetry in the trapezius image between left and right sides. On the side where the top of the trapezius image is set slightly “lower”, there appears to be a correspondingly lower setting of the arm and hand on the same side on the frontal image. Maybe coincidence. Maybe not. I favour the view that it is not coincidence.\nA further comment :I’ve just noticed on Shroud scope the lack of scourge marks just below the neck on the dorsal image. Could be explained by hair flowing down the back of the neck?\n\n","date":"July 20, 2014 at 9:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-139545","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"Hi Hugh,\n               I don’t understand very well what you mean by ” Most of the great pathologists, of course, didn’t observe any distortion at all.”\n               Could you please explain ?\n               Thanks\n               Patrick\n\n","date":"July 25, 2014 at 9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-140290","author":"PHPL","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"Have you tried to observe the famous bronze corpus of the Man\nin the Shroud created by an Italian sculptor, Luigi Mattei ?\nWhere are the “”wrong areas/volumes” ?\nI think we have to take into account the dislocations of the arms, etc.\nIf you are able to have at disposal a transparent model that would be better.\nYou have to paint in red the areas (… or volumes, if you have a\ntransparent model) that are considered important.\nThen that work would be a step towards a better understanding of your thought …\nOne must of course be able to make good use of a three-dimensional model\nof the body to be able to make those clarifications.\n— —\nBut …\nI should have, myself, the same attitude for improvement of the study!\nHere I want to refer to the issue of nanomechanical controls of linen fibrils…\nHow to pull a cord (the fibril) taut with the adequate frame?\n\n","date":"July 18, 2014 at 12:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-139149","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"Sorry, surfing the Web, under the address:\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669012006206\n I have just found an interesting study:\nby Alain Bourmauda,\n    Claudine Morvanb,\n    Anis Boualic,\n    Vincent Placetd,\n    Patrick Perrée,\n    Christophe Baleya\n“Relationships between micro-fibrillar angle, mechanical\nproperties and biochemical composition of flax fibers”\nHere an excerpt from the Abstract:\n>An elementary plant fiber could be assimilated to a laminate,\nmainly constituted of the secondary wall S2 layer, made of\na few non-crystalline polysaccharides reinforced by cellulose fibrils\norganized in a helix, with a microfibrillar angle (MFA) around\n10° relative to the longitudinal fiber axis. \nThat paper investigated the relationships between the MFA,\nthe mechanical properties and the biochemical composition\nof different varieties of flax… !\nHere another detail:\n>Within the different varieties of flax, Young’s modulus was found\nto be negatively correlated with the MFA.\n>The results showed that the ratio between hemicelluloses\n(matter extracted with alkali) and pectins (hydrolyzed with acids)\nis highly correlated with the tensile properties;\nconcurrently, we showed the great influence of pectic acids\non the fiber’ Young’s modulus, and\non the orientation of the microfibrils. …\n>Lower is the micro fibrillar angle, higher is the Young’s modulus.\nAt the end the question to solve is the following :\nWhat happens with ancient linens?\n-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-\nUnfortunately this argument is completely different\nwith respect your interesting notes on misalignment of shoulders\nand “absence of neck” !\nSo…\nI beg your pardon…\n… and\nI want add :\nIt is not in my will to taunt (to disturb) the researches.\n— —\nHow to tighten up the strings of a violin ?\n— —\nPerhaps we have to work with a “volumetric version”\nof “Shroud Scope” …\nAre you able to build that new useful tool ?\n\n","date":"July 18, 2014 at 12:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-139155","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"Thomas, I agree.

The indications I have given seem to me to be all there is. The dorsal image seems much clearer than the ventral. Try drawing in your own ideas about where exactly there is image of the shoulders on both sides, and upload your drawing via imgur.com, which is extraordinarily easy. Although the scourge marks, if so they be, are level on the shroud, they need not indicate any particular place on the shoulder.

I think the ventral is more difficult to distinguish with just the blood stains, there is a possibility that the cloth touched the top of the shoulder during wrapping leaving a stain without a body image. I am not sure why there are no side images for the body. It could be due to an orthogonal image forming process or due to spice bags placed around the body leaving a horizontal shroud with no side contact. I agree with Thomas, the right shoulder is lower, I think it’s how the body was fixed in rigor Mortis as seen in the previous post referenced in my previous comment (I believe this position is consistent with the shoulder position and the blood flow)\nAnoxie, The whole body would be misaligned as would be the case if you lean all your weight on one leg and bend the other.\n\n","date":"July 18, 2014 at 8:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-139199","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"I find it quite easy seeing where the shoulders / lower neck are on the dorsal.

It is not too difficult to imagine that when laying out a real body, that the shroud could easily become wrinkled, off-centre, and skewed; if the shroud was wrapped in any way around the body, then parts of the cloth would also no longer be symmetrical about the centre.  These effects may account for any apparent loss of symmetry in the image.  Off-topic: Mario shows the top of the sheet loosely draped at the top of the head.  Previous discussion has tended to conclude that the shroud was drawn firmly over the top of the head, because of head measurements between the facial and occiput images, even though there is no top-of-head image which requires another explanation (e.g. a head-cloth).   \nMy fundamental point is that it is not necessary to look for distortions in the body to account for any loss of symmetry.  It can be adequately explained by the actual disposition of the cloth that occurred during the burial rite.\n\n","date":"July 19, 2014 at 5:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-139262","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders","post":"If I might add a comment of another sort.
