I can’t recall if we accepted his unsolicited offer to address the student body or not. But I do know one thing. Flat- Earthers are far more keen to field questions than they are to pose them, because that’s what they revel in – showing they have an answer to each and every question you throw at them. There is a perverseness in their nature – they delight in denying and confounding…  \nOK, now for a brief defence of my position, which I do not propose to labour.\n My first post on the Shroud was at the tail end of last year.\nhttp://colinb-sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2011/12/turin-shroud-could-it-have-been.html\nIt’s working hypothesis was that radiation at a distance HAD produced the image, but if it has been radiant heat and white light, then an opaque absorbing pigment was needed, for which I considered pencilled and/or painted-on charcoal, and did in fact succeed in trapping enough radiation to produce a scorch on linen. But it was a positive, not negative image, which prompted further experimentation. Along the way I tried seeing if I could image the infrared rays from a hot metallic object (a metal pencil sharpener) onto cloth using a concave mirror, and almost idly, as an afterthought, stamped the linen directly with the hot template to produce a “brand” with a startling resemblance to the original, but for light/dark reversal, i.e. a pseudo-NEGATIVE, just like the Shroud is a pseudo-negative.\n  My first thought was – surely not? – too obvious! Some two dozen posts later I am now wholly convinced that the Shroud image WAS produced by scorching, with a few remaining details to be resolved, like was it treated or untreated linen? \nGiven the trial-and-error manner in which that current conclusion was arrived at, with no preconceived notions, and indeed  an assumption initially that radiant energy was somehow involved, then I hope you will appreciate why your comparison between my approach – that of a retired science bod with an experimental bent- and that of a Flat-Earther could not be further from the truth. But I suspect you will have a ready answer to my plaintive protest.  Indeed, I suspect it is you who will have a ready answer to anything I say in defence of my position, requiring little time and effort on your part, unlike the many weeks I have spent on this problem. So who may I ask is the real Flat-Earther? You  or me? I would suggest that the facts as outlined provide a ready answer…\nColin Berry MSc, PhD\n\n","date":"March 22, 2012 at 11:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/22/the-secrets-of-mfol-revealed/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9513","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The secrets of MFOL revealed","post":"This gave me a good laugh!

I believe most of the readers understand his theory by now.  But he continues to hammer his points in an attempt to convince everyone that he has come up with a breakthrough that has been missed by all the researchers over the past 40 years.   Even if the Shroud was an artist’s work (which I don’t believe for an instant), to execute his theory of a scorch created by a hot statue seems like a ton of work, and that simpler methods that McCrone (painting) and Nickell (rubbings) have described seem more reasonable and could be as effective in “fooling” those medieval believers.  I know Colin isn’t concerned about “arts and crafts”, but it seems unrealistic to not consider that as a major factor in proving the theory.  I can imagine how many ruined linen cloths there would be for the artist before they got it right (if they ever would) under his theory.  And while you might apply the blood first before you did the the hot statue, the flows that we see on the Shroud seem very realistic and must come from a real body.  For example, why would the hot statue artist even consider creating the flow of blood from the wound in the side that trickles over to the back of the image, especially if the dorsal image was done at a different time.  \nUntil Colin actually recreates the Shroud image (or a portion thereof) and determines that it is consistent with all the chemical and physical properties that have been published, I am not particularly interested in hearing more about his theory.\nThanks for your well-done and compelling blog.\n\n","date":"March 22, 2012 at 4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/22/the-secrets-of-mfol-revealed/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9522","author":"Randy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The secrets of MFOL revealed","post":"“Dan, I’m sure you are recognizing this and are concerned, but Colin has effectively taken over your blog.”\nNope, Randy, that’s a tad misleading if you don’t mind me saying. Colin posts his ideas on his own blogs, and Dan reports on them here, and Colin occasionally responds here to those posts and the comments they attract. Colin is largely reactive where this site is concerned – not proactive.\nColin\nPS:  A spear wound in the side would have been problematical to a medieval forger, knowing in advance through pilot trials that the sides would be incompletely imaged. So a decision might have been made to represent the site of the wound on the ventral view, and then to represent the pooling of blood under gravity on the dorsal. \nOK,so you think it improbable that anyone would resort to ambitious ‘pyrography’ to fake a holy relic. But aren’t you forgetting the value placed on convincing holy relics in that era  – the Shroud itself is said to have once changed hands in exchange for TWO CASTLES! Having gone to the trouble of creating the two base images, which little risk of it being mistaken for a painting or a brass rubbing, then surely no effort would have been spared to get the extra crucial details right – especially those blood flows under gravity etc. What’s the medieval equivalent for our (British) English expression “in for a penny, in for a pound”?\n\n","date":"March 22, 2012 at 5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/22/the-secrets-of-mfol-revealed/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9523","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The secrets of MFOL revealed","post":"Colin,\nAnd maybe what I’m saying is that Dan should not report on your blog anymore until you have done much more intensive work on proving your theory.  Then I’m sure all of us would be very interested in understanding how you were able to come up with your breakthrough.  I would guess you could author a book explaining how you successfully debunked the Shroud.  That might be a good investment of time for a retired Sciencebod.\nThe only reasonable way for the artist to determine what the blood flows would look like as a result of a wound to the side is to actually see it happen to a human body.   Now we have a highly skilled metal sculptor, who knows how to scorch linen with his work to create a superficial image, and is also expert on blood flows and how to make those appear natural on a linen cloth by using his statue to apply before the scorching exercise.   This is the “arts and crafts” aspect that doesn’t seem to support your theory.   Remember too that the Shroud first appeared in a small French church, under ownership of a Knights Templar.   If this was forged, I still can’t see why someone would go thru this much trouble to “fool” the pilgrims.\n\n","date":"March 23, 2012 at 12:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/22/the-secrets-of-mfol-revealed/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9544","author":"Randy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The secrets of MFOL revealed","post":"I agree wholeheartedly with Roger’s comments above, but alas I think I’ve actually mentioned this exact thing to Colin several times;…Produce a facsimile, and if not, stop implying it is possible and carry on to other things.

There’s too much other corroborative evidence to concede deliberate fraud.  Jerusalem road dust around the feet, Dead Sea halophyte pollens, Accuracy of the blood flows, Wrist nailing contrary to popular belief of hand nailing, First nude Christ breaking current artistic conventions.  Ancient Syrian manufacture of linen processing, not medieval linen; Slavishly copying of Vignon markings in hand-made icons; None of these are XYX mantra recitals; The arguments are all mutually independent, they’re in parallel not in series.  So they’re corroborative.  And that’s not even exploring the historical aspects.\nIf the image is ever shown to be confirmed as a scorch, then that’s how Jesus decided to do it.  Maybe he temporarily transmogrified himself into a “tin man” for the job.  But he’d have a problem with not scorching the blood stains.  And also the image doesn’t fluoresce under UV.  Enough said already.  I think we must have exhausted the scorch topic, and we should now move on to some other aspects.  There’s plenty we don’t know about to choose from for a fresh topic.  Colin can get back to us when he’s completed his totally compliant replica.\n\n","date":"March 22, 2012 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/22/the-secrets-of-mfol-revealed/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9528","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The secrets of MFOL revealed","post":"Nicely said Dave!

This includes manmade pictures, naturally formed images and imprints resulting from energy derived from a miracle. This is not a fact. It is a well informed opinion. As I see it, not one idea, even a scorch, has ever come close to being able to duplicate the complexities of the image.\nRogers once wrote of a man who called him on the phone and “pointed out that when you cover a ‘daid boddie’ with a cloth, the flies come to the smell. ‘They poke their little noses through the cloth. And you know what flies leave – – – little black specks. Jest look at that image real close, and you will see that it is made up of a whole bunch of fly specks.’ By that time I was rolling on the floor, and I couldn’t answer him.”\nWould you waste as much time on fly speck guy as you do on the scorch guy? You should, it makes more sense. What about paint guy? Or sun bleach guy? Acid etch guy? Photo guy?Corona discharge guy? Worm hole guy? Dematerialization guy? Even Rogers, who was neither a fake guy nor a miracle guy? (With apologies to the gals).\nYou’ve been played. As a thermochemist I can tell you the image is not the result of a scorch. De Lazzaro already explained why in this blog and to all of SSG. He is 100% right. Rogers also explained it in his FAQ and he is right. \nScorch guy should put up or shut up. He must duplicate all of the complexities of the image. Until then, I say ignore him. Stop.
