[{"title":"More on Petri Paavola from Finland","post":"An anonymous commenter (whom I assumed from his writing style was this Petri Paavola) recently left a comment under my blog posts: “Burial shroud proves Turin Shroud not from 1st century C.E. Jerusalem?”, as follows: \n“Many people speak in favor of the shroud of Turin. Some people are against the shroud. The Bible bears witness against the shroud and indicates it for false and a fake. This article points out in the light of the Bible that the shroud of Turin is a fake:\nhttp://koti.phnet.fi/petripaavola/shroudofturin.html \nMy response included:\n“Thanks for the link. But the article is wrong on all its key points. Significantly his reference list does not include any actual books on the Shroud, which discuss the Biblical and Jewish issues at depth. It is typical of well-meaning but uninformed criticism of the Shroud by some Christians. … I may answer that webpage in detail in a separate post.”\nSince my above brief response, I had already decided to respond to the claims on that web page in detail.\nStephen\n\n","date":"October 8, 2010 at 7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/10/07/more-on-petri-paavola-from-finland/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-1507","author":"Stephen E.
