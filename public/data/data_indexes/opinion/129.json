[{"title":"Resurrection as proof of an actual God-man?","post":"I always understood the distinction as resurrection being something that Jesus does under his own power to Himself whereas “raising from the dead” is an Act of God upon one of His children. I don’t see Lazarus as resurrected but raised. Jesus acted upon him. Jesus is resurrected because He, even while His physical body was dead, acted upon Himself.\nThe obvious point of these miracles, especially the Resurrection, is that anyone who has power of death enough to not only raise others from it but Himself is surely someone that can rescue any man from death. It is this rescue that Christ offers to man through the forgiveness of sins.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2012 at 10:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/08/resurrection-as-proof-of-an-actual-god-man/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9073","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resurrection as proof of an actual God-man?","post":"Very nicely said Chris, this as always been my interpretation also.\nR\n\n","date":"March 8, 2012 at 1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/08/resurrection-as-proof-of-an-actual-god-man/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9080","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resurrection as proof of an actual God-man?","post":"Yes.  Jesus restores Lazarus to life in this world, and Tabitha is likewise restored to life in this world, thus demonstrating Jesus’ power over life and death.. But, in the Synoptics at the Resurrection of Jesus, it is something else.  Jesus has now left his mortal life on earth behind, but somehow he still seems able to be physically present in this world if/when he so determines.  He is not always recognisable as such, and so we must look for the risen Christ and find where he may be present,  In Matthew, Magdalene clasps his feet, and likewise in the other Synoptics he is represented as being tangible – he can be touched.  In John however, Magadalene is told not to cling to him as he has not yet gone to the Father.  In all four gospels, Jesus seems able to be present both in the physical, here and now world, and also in the supernatural world of the Father, all at will.  Paul develops this idea further when he describes the general resurrection of the body: “We shall all be changed.”\n\n","date":"March 8, 2012 at 3:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/08/resurrection-as-proof-of-an-actual-god-man/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-9084","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Resurrection as proof of an actual God-man?","post":"I agree wholeheartedly with Daveb and add that Jairus’ daughter was raised to life by Jesus to continue again and die again in human terms.
