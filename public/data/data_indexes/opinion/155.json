A family with 2 teenagers, with itunes and netflix, downloads more than that in a month through a narrow cable or DSL connection. You don’t need more money for bandwidth. It sounds like you’re running on an old hosting contract that hasn’t been renegotiated in years. I know you could find any number of high capacity, high speed web hosting providers who would host shroud.com for less than $10 per month including unlimited storage and unlimited bandwidth. See http://www.consumer-rankings.com/hosting/pricing/. When was the last time you shopped for hosting. As a worst case, you should  be able to get 500 GB of free bandwidth per month. Overage charges shouldn’t cost more than $10 per 50 GB of extra bandwidth. See http://www.consumer-rankings.com/hosting/bandwidth/. I say get a  better deal from Impulse or changes providers. Changing providers is easy. Most companies will move your complete set of directories and files and transfer your domain while you sleep just to get your business. It sounds like you could raise $3000 by renegotiating your contract. I tell my clients to renegotiate every two years. Impulse, I notice, doesn’t show prices on their website. Hmmm.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2013 at 5:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/04/the-high-price-of-success-at-stera/","cat":"kelly_kearse","id":"comment-36479","author":"anonymous","site":"shroudstory"}]
