Jesus had a pretty unique death so its not all that hard to tell it is in fact Jesus, and not some anonymous crucifixion victim, and of course by tradition the cloth has been connected to Jesus which is worth noting, and i’m not sure why a burial cloth would even be taken out a tomb unless it was significant. \nI believe the forensic evidence is more than enough to establish the authenticity of the Shroud, but its always nice to have additional evidence like #7 where there is Jerusalem limestone. Its significant to me that it is largely concentrated near the feet which again just shows this is an authentic burial cloth of someone who walked around probably barefoot before being killed. Until we get further testing on the aragonite which i’m dying to see it will remain not quite excellent evidence, but still decent further evidence in part of a cumulative case for authenticity. \n#2, and #3 are very significant for the Carbon Dating question, and along w/ other pieces of evidence I think shows the results are probably in error without even getting into the scientific evidence. \n#6 Is interesting, but I don’t find it evidence for authenticity really, but more like possible evidence for the Resurrection. The body in the Shroud left within a couple days like Jesus in the Gospels left his empty tomb. Why did the body leave? Was it manual extraction or did Jesus just “disappear”? I think the evidence and what we see on the Shroud points to the latter more so than the former. \nI’m not sure about #1, and don’t quite understand the rationale for #5\n\n","date":"November 23, 2015 at 2:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/23/three-comments-promoted-seven-or-so-reasons-to-believe-the-shroud-is-authentic/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-215028","author":"Matthew L.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Comments Promoted, Seven or So Reasons to Believe the Shroud is Authentic","post":"Thank you for your comments, Matthew. \n#1)  Fanti’s mechanical testing:  The technical details setting up the testing are:\n“A NEW CYCLIC-LOADS MACHINE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF MICRO-MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SINGLE FLAX FIBERS COMING FROM THE TURIN SHROUD” By Giulio Fanti, Pierandrea Malfi, Department of Industrial Engineering, Padua University;\nhttps://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aimeta-fanti.pdf   \nIt was essentially a pioneering effort by Fanti & Malfi to develop an alternative method for age determination of flax fibres.  The margin of error must inevitably be quite large as age is not the only dependent variable.  The specific history of the parent cloth, such as frequency of folding and the various storage environments are also significant in affecting the parameters measured.  Thus the authors claimed a margin of error of 400 years, and found it was compatible within the time that Jesus lived.  The paper is highly technical and it is helpful to know something of the theory of Strength of Materials, a standard discipline in Engineering.  Parameters measured include Young’s Modulus, tensile strength, loss factor.  Other methods have also been used including Raman spectroscopy.  \n#5)  Cause of the image:  This remains unknown;  Possibilities include a) some as yet unknown naturalistic process; b) an artisan’s deliberate attempt by a process which still remains a secret; c) a miraculous divine intervention.  Despite various attempts to replicate the image, none have been really successful, and few if any attempts display all the known properties of the Shroud image.  If it was the result of an artisan, his identity is unknown and he left no record of either his attempts, or of his failures.  The forensic evidence displays a knowledge of anatomy not known in medieval times.  \n#6)  Unsmeared blood marks:  This is also part of the forensic evidence.  If say an artisan used even a crucified corpse to produce his image, then removal of the corpse would surely have resulted in smearing.  There are good indications that the blood marks occurred before the image.  However a miraculous resurrection could be expected not to smear the blood marks.  \nIt is important I think to weigh the totality of the available evidence, not necessarily any single one.  The evidence is necessarily circumstantial, and in such cases the total weight is what must determine any decision on the question of authenticity.  Particular pieces of evidence will be more persuasive than others, and individual viewpoints also play a part.\n\n","date":"November 23, 2015 at 4:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/23/three-comments-promoted-seven-or-so-reasons-to-believe-the-shroud-is-authentic/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-215035","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Comments Promoted, Seven or So Reasons to Believe the Shroud is Authentic","post":"I hope you will forgive me if I rise again\ntrying to clarify something about\nthe “alternative dating”… \nDaveb:\n>#1) Fanti’s mechanical testing: …\n… … …\n>…Other methods have also been\nused including Raman spectroscopy.\nThe other vibrational spectroscopy\nwas based on ATR-FTIR (but see also\nmy past generic remarks about the problem\nof exact ATR-FTIR calibrations).\nIn any case there is the book (by Fanti and Malfi)\nand then all the readers interested on\nthe issue of “alternative dating” can\nread that interesting book…\nLink:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Shroud-Turin-Century-Christ/dp/9814669121\nLike I already wrote on this blog particular works,\nuseful for “alternative dating”, can also\nbe done using SPM controls and\nthese works are based on the same\nidea of degradation of mechanical characteristics\nof linen fibers after centuries (See also my old\nintervention, during the International Congress\nheld in Turin [in 1998], where I indicated\nthe SPMs as useful tools in order to check the\ncellulosic chains of the ancient linen cloth and\nthe biological materials [blood, DNA, etc.]).\nBut, until now, no one was able to do\nthat SPM survey on Holy Shroud.\nSo, the work done by Fanti mainly seems\nto be only a preliminar step in order\nto improve the analyses, working with\nthe SPMs tools …as I indicated years ago…\nThen there is another possible thing to take\ninto account in your investigations.\nSee the past exhibition:\n“Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt”\n[February 15 – May 7, 2000],\n“Metropolitan Museum of Art”…\nFrom where it come the use (Fayum, etc.)\nto do the ancient “Graeco-Egyptian portraits”?\nThese reperts were rare and fragile works,\nincluding the Metropolitan’s entire collection\nof mummy portraits…\nSo, before to destroy linen fibrils coming from\nthe Holy Shroud there is that field to investigate\nusing:\n– vibrational spectroscopies : ATR-FTIR, IR-Raman\n– advanced microscopies: AFM, CFM, AFM-Raman\nand\nalso:\nSERS controls (vibrational spectroscopy)!\nB.T.W.:\nI have just found a book\nby Ricardo Aroca with the following title:\n“Surface-Enhanced Vibrational Spectroscopy”\nJohn Wiley & Sons, 2006 \nLinks:\nhttp://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2000/ancient-faces-mummy-portraits-from-roman-egypt\nhttps://books.google.it/books?id=4Wu3aQ3xefwC&dq=SERS+controls+vibrational+spectroscopy&hl=it&source=gbs_navlinks_s\nIf you find this is an interesting intervention\n(that worth to deepen), then answer to me!\n\n","date":"November 24, 2015 at 12:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/23/three-comments-promoted-seven-or-so-reasons-to-believe-the-shroud-is-authentic/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-215061","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Comments Promoted, Seven or So Reasons to Believe the Shroud is Authentic","post":"I was interested in the Fayum mummy portraits\neven before the book by Thomas de Wesselow\n(“The Sign”, 2012) came out!…\nIn any case see also (…the photographs):\nAncient Faces: Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt (Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications)\nSusan Walker, Morris Bierbrier \nLink:\nhttp://www.amazon.de/Ancient-Faces-Portraits-Metropolitan-Publications/dp/toc/0415927447\n\n","date":"November 24, 2015 at 12:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/23/three-comments-promoted-seven-or-so-reasons-to-believe-the-shroud-is-authentic/","cat":"comments_promoted","id":"comment-215062","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Three Comments Promoted, Seven or So Reasons to Believe the Shroud is Authentic","post":"I want to add something about\n“AFM Mechanical mapping of linen fibres”.\nNanoindentation using atomic force microscopy\ncan be used to examine the mechanical properties\nof fibers at nanoscale.\nThen the effect of accelerated aging of linen fibers\nunder ultraviolet (UV) and thermal-oxidative\nconditions on mechanical property gradients\nacross the fiber cross-section can be investigated.\nI am curious about the level of UV degradation\nthat produces bulk degradation up to x hours\nof exposure and surface degradation\nSee also the possible lower values of\nYoung’s modulus at surface compared to center. \nIn my opinion we can also try to use\nthe AFM microscopy (= AFM and flexural tests)\nwith bending actuators…\nSee (f.e.) the old tests:\n“Mechanical characterization of\nnanofibers – A review”\nE.P.S.
