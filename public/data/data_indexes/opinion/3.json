[{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"The physical evidence of the Shroud is consistent with the Resurrection (evidence of rigor mortis but no putrefaction byproducts). The body and the Shroud parted company therefore at a very early time after death. Whatever conditions of the tomb (dampness, cool temperature) that would have extended the time of rigor mortis and delayed putrefaction are almost irrelevant because there is no evidence of such having occurred. So if the conditions of the tomb would have extended the time from 48 hours to several days means only that the event of Resurrection could have occurred later that the approximately 30 hours or so of the Scripture accounts. (9 hours on Friday, 24 hours on Saturday and six hours to daybreak on Sunday). \nThat putrefaction is delayed by cool temperature is a well known fact. In Rogers & Hammerstein’s musical Oklahoma there is a song “Poor Jud is Dead.” The last the verse is:\n“He’s lookin’ oh so purty and so nice\nHe looks like he’s asleep\nIt’s a shame that he won’t keep\nBut it’s summer and we’re runnin’ out a’ ice”\nIsabel Piczek described the image as an event horizon. Scientifically, the most commonly known event horizon is the observable last gasp of matter as it is sucked into a black hole. Actually a sunset is a rough metaphor. The sun sinks below the horizon but we know of its presence because the horizon remains light for some moment of time.\nI think that when it comes to image formation that Jackson’s probably on the right track. None of the theories of image formation that claim to be purely natural work and any theory that obdurately refuses to take into account the Resurrection, probably won’t work.\nChrist’s body was transforming from state of existence that we know to another that we can’t really explain – yet. The complex theories of consciousness and quantum theory intrude deeply into basic questions that were in the past reserved for religion. Some of them tend towards solipsism – nothing exists until it is perceived and then only in the consciousness of the viewer. \nThose who insist on a natural explanation for the image formation process without reference to the Resurrection are doomed to fail. Ray Rogers who advanced the theory of a maillard reaction admitted that it alone did not explain the image.\nThe image is miraculous. That only means that we can not explain it   yet.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2015 at 7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-214345","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Isabel Piczek described the image as an event horizon.

I will explain what I know in lay person’s terms.\nA black hole isn’t really a hole. It’s a collapsed star with resulting extraordinary gravity. Objects approaching it that fall within the influence of its gravity are pulled into it. The gravity of the collapsed star is so large that even light can not escape its grasp. Thus it is black. However, there is a point before it is lost in the hole that an approaching object becomes distorted by the gravity and assumes new shapes. The point at which an object’s light can last be observed is called the event horizon.\nOn the case of the Shroud, the image is of a dead Christ. It was formed in a micro-second. Whatever, the process, the image is of the last instant of the body of Christ before/as it was transformed and brought to life and/or entered a new dimension or universe of existence. \nThe event horizon is an apt metaphor for what happened and for the time being as good as it gets.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2015 at 8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-214349","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"I asked you about an event horizon in general, not black holes (which it seems you also understand little).\nI don’t need metaphors, I need concretes.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2015 at 10:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-214354","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"typo: 30 hours = 39 hours\n\n","date":"November 7, 2015 at 7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-214346","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"The often parroted claim “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” makes no sense.
