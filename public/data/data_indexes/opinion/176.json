Citing his initial reaction he said words to the effect that it is complex and must be read more than once to understand it. I later wrote back asking if he began to read it. This time he said, again, words to the effect, he pretty much will not read it as we are not coming from the same place. Not a problem with me. Did he read something that will finally put the Shroud mystery to rest? I claim to understand the mechanism involved and all of its ramifications and all that it entails. For me as I’ve written on here the Shroud of Turin is not something I knowingly took an interest in. Given my level of education and erudition, actually disqualifies me from such a venture. The Shroud was one of MANY subjects in my book that came to my attention but a relatively short time before and found it way into the book resting comfortably within a body of knowledge I fortunately acquired. To this day it still remains a mystery to me why I was involved. Although……..all of this started early in childhood\n\n","date":"December 13, 2013 at 9:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/update-at-the-holy-shroud-guild/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-58826","author":"michael jude","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update at The Holy Shroud Guild","post":"Please Only Discuss Michael Jude’s Book and Claims HERE\n\n","date":"December 13, 2013 at 1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/update-at-the-holy-shroud-guild/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-58902","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update at The Holy Shroud Guild","post":"What is the title of your book, Michael?\n\n","date":"December 13, 2013 at 10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/update-at-the-holy-shroud-guild/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-58839","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update at The Holy Shroud Guild","post":"Michael, you say, “I claim to understand the mechanism involved and all of its ramifications and all that it entails.”\nThat’s nice.\n\n","date":"December 13, 2013 at 10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/update-at-the-holy-shroud-guild/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-58844","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update at The Holy Shroud Guild","post":"How does Ian Wilson believe the Shroud was created?
