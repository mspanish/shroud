Here’s an extract from Encyc Brit on prophecy in Islam: \n“Prophets are men specially elected by God to be his messengers. Prophethood is indivisible, and the Qurʾān requires recognition of all prophets as such without discrimination. Yet they are not all equal, some of them being particularly outstanding in qualities of steadfastness and patience under trial. Abraham, Noah, Moses, and Jesus were such great prophets. As vindication of the truth of their mission, God often vests them with miracles: Abraham was saved from fire, Noah from the Deluge, and Moses from the pharaoh. Not only was Jesus born from the Virgin Mary, but God also saved him from crucifixion at the hands of the Jews. The conviction that God’s messengers are ultimately vindicated and saved is an integral part of the Qurʾānic doctrine.”  \nI’ll check my copy of the Qur’an, and see if I can find the ref.  If there’s a Muslim Shroudie out there looking in, his comments should be interesting.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2012 at 1:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/06/dawkins-challenge-noticed-by-ahmadi-muslim-researchers/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-13560","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dawkins Challenge Noticed by Ahmadi Muslim Researchers","post":"Hi- this is absolutely true, that messengers are protected by Allah.

Rogers proved that beyond a shadow of a doubt.  According to all the medical experts that have studied the Shroud, the man enshrouded was without doubt dead.  There is absolutely no chance of that person surviving.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the hypothesis that Jesus survived the crucifixion is that it necessarily requires a naturalistic image formation. The problem proponents of this “live body” theory immediately run into is that the image on the shroud does not show the tell-tale signs that the man wrapped in it was alive. If he were alive there would be MUCH more image distortion, most especially in the areas of the face because he would be breathing. If a naturalistic image formation process was the cause of the image then you would most definitely see evidence of breathing interfering with that because the exhaust from the man’s lungs would disrupt the mechanism of image formation, especially around the nose and mouth. Plus there’s no image evidence of movement of ANY kind over it’s formation period, which would necessarily be many days. The man would have to remain dead still for the entire period.\nAlso, the blood evidence that remains would negate a live body as the man in the shroud would continue to bleed, especially from the side wound. There’s not enough blood on the shroud to suggest this was even possible, even at rates of flow where the victim was in a coma. And lastly, though not comprehensively, there’s no evidence of smearing of blood from the removal of the body. Had he been alive and got up of His own physical power (or even with the aid of another), even after days, it would be most plausible that there would be massive smearing of blood evidence because the wounds would still be bleeding, especially if the body was moved because it would disturb any clots, especially in the head, wrist, and side wound areas. There’s just no trace of this anywhere on the shroud. Even if anyone intended to fool future generations by carefully removing the shroud I do not think it could be done. But then again, who would intend to do such a thing in the first century. \nThe body wrapped in the shroud was dead.\n\n","date":"July 12, 2012 at 8:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/06/dawkins-challenge-noticed-by-ahmadi-muslim-researchers/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-13797","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"}]
