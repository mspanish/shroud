[{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"Stop laughing, Dan, this is in fact quite serious issue.\nFor some time, I am wondering why the Manoppello face has almost no moustache visible (only some traces of it left and rigt to the mouth). And I have shown that the faces on the Shroud and Manoppello are the same! (see https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/addendum-manopello-shroud-comparison3d.pdf )\nOn the contrary, COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SUDARIUM OF OVIEDO AND THE SHROUD OF TURIN claims: \n4. The man whose face the Sudarium covered had a beard, moustache and long hair, tied up at the nape of his neck into a ponytail.\n( http://www.shroud.com/heraseng.pdf)\nIt is at least theoretically possible that what we may see on the Shroud as a moustache, may in fact be illusion. \nImpactogram? Quite possible. We can say, in some sense, that the Shroud “impacted” the Man’s face.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 7:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-134846","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"It was the picture that got me laughing, not the idea of false imaging from compression.

Luke does NOT make any specific reference to a beard, David, yet I see there is an isolated and  imaginative misquoting to be found via googling, which you have just  given undeserved credence.\nhttp://biblehub.com/luke/22-63.htm\nIn any case, the issue for a scientist is not whether or not Jesus had a beard. It’s whether the higher-than-average image density below the nose of the TC man and on the chin can be blithely assumed to be a moustache and beard, given that we can be fairly confident we are NOT looking at a photograph, and indeed know nothing whatsoever about the mechanism of image formation.\nWe need to scrutinise every tiny detail of the image minutely to stand any chance of gaining an insight, no matter how tendentious initially,  into the mysterious mechanism of image formation.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 8:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-134863","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"I’m not a Biblical scholar so I’ll defer to your google expertise on the Luke passage — which would have been referencing the Isaiah passage anyway of course.\nI’m not saying your idea is silly either. But perhaps some of our 1st century experts (Max?) can confirm if beard pulling was indeed a common penalty for blasphemers. Given the beard in that period had religious/cultural significance to Jews, especially rabbis, it does seem logical that the Sanhedrin forces may have ripped the man’s beard. But what kind of damage does that do? I’ve never seen what that might look like in practice, body waxing not withstanding.\nBut back to impactograms. That would only be a relevant idea if the body was a corpse, right? Not a bas relief.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 9:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-134872","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"Given the absence of any recognizable extrinsic pigments on the TS, it’s easier to envisage as a (heated) metal template. But it’s not impossible if using a corpse. It just needs a different mechanism that works with a cold or still-warm corpse. Thus my dabbling with quicklime to test a conjectural  imprinting mechanism that might be described as thermochemical as distinct from just thermal. No joy with that one, thus far.\nTime now to address Angel’s point re allegedly feminine chest. Methinks it fits with a standard male chest, creating an ‘impactograph’ by virtue of elevated plane, rigidity and thus resistance to deformation (regardless of the precise nature of template/linen interaction at the molecular level).\nTime now for a long walk and further reflection.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-134877","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"No impactogram re the moustache and beard, just ‘eneilicograms’ as most likely, both were compressed by the taut TS and the Cahors skullcap fastened on top.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 10:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-134880","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"…not to mention the probable presence of a small ‘jaw-box’ in conjunction with skull-cap.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 10:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-134882","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"Colin is a specialist in introducing good questions into a joke. I like it.\nThe joke is (from Colin): ‘the TS face having a “pressed against glass” look about it’, so that the beard and mustaches could be artifacts of ‘impactography’.\nIf mustache and beard were artifacts created by impact, we should see the nose completely crushed/flattened. It is obviously not.\nBut the only interesting question is: ‘Come to think of it, why is it not possible to differentiate between hair and skin on the TS image? Why is there no ‘strandedness’ to the hair?’\nI do not understand the term ‘strandedness’. \nColin and others, can you give us more insight about this problem ?\nIn other words: why is it necessary for the hair (or mustache, or beard) to leave an image different from the image of the skin?\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 3:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-134936","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"“why is it necessary for the hair (or mustache, or beard) to leave an image different from the image of the skin?”\nBecause it retains fluids.\n\n","date":"July 3, 2014 at 4:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/02/is-the-beard-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-an-impactogram/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-135049","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the beard of the man of the shroud an impactogram?","post":"Just think of all the image “differences” we’ve been told are there – coins, flowers, lettering etc. Shame on us if we can’t see them.\nNow I’m expected to defend the proposition that one expects to see a difference between skin and hair (the latter comprising strands, thus my term ‘strandedness’ for something that comes in strands rather than sheets).\nThe only reason we see “hair” on the TS is because image density is in the ‘right’ places. But is not odd that we see no differences in the way the two imprint? That is certainly not the case with conventional photographs where enlargement of “hair” at reasonably high resolution shows strandedness,\nRepeat: the TS image is NOT to be viewed as a photograph: the “hair” alone makes that truism abundantly clear. \nGiven there is only one TS, we have to be exceptionally careful in the way we interpret that ‘one-off’.
