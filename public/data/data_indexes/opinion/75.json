It’s like hoaxes that go around on email: nobody checks it out, they just forward the hoax to everyone they know and as a result, everybody believes the Lie rather than digging to find out the truth for themselves. (Basically: you should NEVER believe ONE WORD you get on Email.)  I always check things out on Snopes.com  or… there’s another site like that but I can never remember it’s name. \nI wonder what Snopes has to say about the Shroud.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/03/is-it-leonardo-or-jesus/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-6499","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is it Leonardo or Jesus?","post":"The other site is URBAN LEGENDS at about.com, or:\nhttp://urbanlegends.about.com/\nNeither one of those sites had anything about the Shroud of Turin.
