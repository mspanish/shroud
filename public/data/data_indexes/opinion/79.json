[{"title":"Isn’t that the steering wheel from a 1953 Chevy Bel Air?","post":"Actually I watched a documentary that covered, amongst other findings the ‘chariot wheel find’ and it is almost certain it is an Egyptian chariot wheel, as it was compared to several wheels found in tombs; design, style and dimension wise it’s exact, but of course one cannot say it is from the Moses era or actual crossing of the nile story. but it is a chariot wheel. The author’s comparing the Shroud to evidence like this chariot wheel is or a piece of the cross is simply an absord comment.\nThe ’53 Chevy Bel Air came with 2 or 3 spoke steering wheels by the way lol.\nR\n\n","date":"April 22, 2012 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/22/isnt-that-the-steering-wheel-from-a-1953-chevy-bel-air/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-10707","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Isn’t that the steering wheel from a 1953 Chevy Bel Air?","post":"My dad owned a ’53 Bel Air by the way.
