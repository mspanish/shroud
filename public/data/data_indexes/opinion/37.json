[{"title":"Debate Blog Proposal","post":"Hello Rich (and anyone who will read this).\nIf you ever do a real debate about the autheticity of the Shroud with a sceptic, please, put this subject on the table :  In the STURP study entitled “Ultraviolet fluorescence photography of the\nShroud of Turin”, Miller and Pellicori made one VERY interesting obseervation. It’s an observation that applies to another aspect of the question we discuss recently. They notice that, on the frontal and on the dorsal part, there is some scourge marks that are not visible in normal light but only visible in UV light. It’s pretty much like some tiny blood stains can only be detected with UV lights on a crime scene. \nI think it’s a very good confirmation of what I said previously about the probable superficiality of the scourge marks on the cloth. To me, that’s why we can’t see these marks on the backlight photos. This observation fits very well with the idea that the scourges are mainly a superficial transfer of clotted blood on the cloth surface, unlike most of the other blood stains who were more fresh and/or more important in size so they could go way deeper into the cloth (many of them goes all the way to the other side of the Shroud). And this observation proves that the transfer of clotted blood from these scourge marks wasn’t done at the same exact intensity and there is some scourges who are more perfectly shaped and much more evident than others. This tends to prove that we are in presence of a NATURAL transfer phenomenon from clotted blood and not an artistic forgery done with real human blood or with red ochre and vermilion. In a forgery, we would expect to see scourge marks about the same intensity everywhere and, consequently, we would expect to see all of them very easily. It’s NOT the case on the Shroud ! \nJoe Nickell, Dr. Karl and all the other sceptics will have to explain this to me and to you !!! :-)\n\n","date":"August 9, 2011 at 3:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/09/debate-blog-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-3548","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Debate Blog Proposal","post":"Yannick,\n– Good points.\n– Could the basic “invisibility” be explained simply by aging?\n– Please send me your email address so I can put it on my team distribution list.

For your idea that the invisibility of some scourge marks could be explain by aging, it’s interesting but I think the simplest answer is that some marks were better transferred to the cloth than others.  If it was so easy to make those few marks disappeared with time, why it isn’t the case for the vast majority of the other scourge marks ?  No, since the scourge marks are a direct contact transfer of blood material from clotted scourge wounds, I think it’s very normal that some marks were better transferred on the cloth than others¸.  To me, that’s the best explanation to understand why some are more complete and more defined than others and why a few marks are not visible to the naked eye.  Those “invisible” marks were surely done by wounds not very humid and/or located in a way to permit just a slight contact with the cloth.  That’s the best way I can explain those observations made by Miller and Pellicori.\n\n","date":"August 9, 2011 at 4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/09/debate-blog-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-3553","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Debate Blog Proposal","post":"To emphasise my point about the scourge marks made of blood, I just want to let you know 2 interesting findings that were made by Alan Adler.  He found that the only apparent alteration of the blood stains due to time was microscopic abrasions on the surface of the stains.  That’s all !  And consequently, he found tiny little blood particles in every part of the cloth.  They were so tiny that you need a microscope to see them !  Those little particles of blood were scattered everywhere on the cloth because of the many handling of the cloth and the many folding and unfolding of the cloth.  So, I really don’t think that the time factor could have caused the disappearance of some scourges marks made of blood.  If there are some scourge marks invisible to the naked eye so that we need UV lights to see them, I think the most probable answer his that those few scourge marks came from a clotted blood transfer that didn’t made a good result.  I think the findings of Adler demonstrate that the blood stains on the Shroud are very resistant to the time factor and are still almost intact after all these years.  For me, it’s a good indication that this cloth was kept with great care since the beginning !\n\n","date":"August 10, 2011 at 1:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/09/debate-blog-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-3560","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Debate Blog Proposal","post":"Yannick,\n– Thanks.
