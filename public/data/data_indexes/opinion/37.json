He was sent for comprehensive testing, and they did a chromosone study, which showed he had female chromosones, but, the lab report said, ”male”… so, they kept faxing the doctor asking for the right patient, since, they were unable to process this report, since it showed a female, not a male.\nWhen they found out he was a blood marrow recipient, they were all surprised. Even they never saw that before. THAT was the source for our original discussion,\ni have to add that my brother is very antichristian, and has always been antagonistic towards my conversion. When he was getting his transfusion of my harvested bone marrow, everyone teased him that he would become me. So, they gave him a Bible and a LED ZEPPELIN CD.  \nIt was my way of trying to appeal to his vanity, when I tried to convince him that he was like Jesus, if our blood was related, because, like Jesus, he only had a female set of chromosomes in his blood, since Jesus had no human father.\nI didn’t mean to offend anyone, or imply we are Merovingians, or royalty, however, I have been extensively genetically tested, because, in addition to having ABneg blood, I was born with a rare disorder. I even was sent to the Mayo clinic, who were doing research, and they said I showed a genetic trait common in European and Russian royalty. I told them that was unlikely, knowing my relatives were common peasants, Jewish peasants, at that.\nIt’s very fascinating to me these stories of reptiles, and aliens, etc. Since my blood has sometimes been flawed enough to make me vulnerable to ailments, and ironically strong enough to save my brother’s life, it is a topic that makes me say foolish things, or maybe they’re wise… who’s to say… we all have a certain vanity, and hope that we’re special.\nI DON’T feel special, so, that’s something that probably is overcompensated for, by my tangeantial romps into these things. It’s nothing that serious in my life, but, I have gotten more people contacting me over this one blog post than everything else I’ve ever written.\nThanks, i think, for the interest, and repost.  I am happy if I made people smile, or laugh, or think about things.\nTake care..  ,\n\n","date":"November 24, 2013 at 10:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-52721","author":"Michele","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative","post":"Where did you read about those facinating stories?\n\n","date":"February 10, 2014 at 6:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-78015","author":"fifi5050","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative","post":"I am a black female with AB- blood.

Everyone expresses 2 forms of the Rh gene, called alleles; they inherit one allele from each parent, which in the case of Rh, are positive (+) and negative (-).  The different forms are written in this format: 1st form/2nd form, with a / separating each form (allele).  \nIf you express at least one + allele, you are Rh positive (positive is dominant); to be Rh negative, you have to express 2 negative alleles, (negative is recessive).  For Rh positive, the possibilities are +/+ and +/-.  For Rh negative, the possibilities are only -/-.  \nIf your parents were both Rh positive and you are Rh negative, that means your parents were both +/-.  They each carried the negative allele, but were themselves positive, because positive is dominant.  \nThe alleles segregate (separate) during reproduction & inheritance, so a +/- parent has an equal chance (50:50) of passing on a + or – allele to a child.  For each child that is born, the odds are still 50:50.  \nThe possible offspring of a +/- father and and +/- mother are: +/+ (Rh positive), +/- (Rh positive), or -/- (Rh negative).\nWhen a Rh negative mother has a Rh positive child, her immune system will make antibodies to the Rh protein, because to her the Rh is foreign (her body doesn’t have it).  This predominantly becomes an issue during subsequent pregnancies, because the mother’s immune system is now primed to respond against the Rh-the alarm has been sounded.  Typically, Rhogam is prescribed in such cases; Rhogam is a solution of anti-Rh antibodies, they help to clear the Rh from the circulation, so the mother’s immune system doesn’t respond.\nA person’s blood type stays with them throughout life, the genes remain, which will result in production of new copies of the (same) protein.  Unless a mutational event occurs  or a person receives a bone marrow transplant (in which case new genes are introduced), a change in Rh expression should not occur. In pregnancy/delivery, certain mistypings may take place, perhaps this is the case here, and not a true change.\nRegarding the Shroud, although the blood type is sometimes reported as AB positive or AB negative, expression of the Rh factor remains unknown-if interested, there are some additional posts on AB and the Rh factor related to the Shroud-can find using search bar at top right.\n\n","date":"March 2, 2013 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-26156","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative","post":"Quick note: for the phrase “because the mother’s immune system is now primed to respond against the Rh-the alarm has been sounded.”, this is a dash after Rh, not Rh negative :)\n\n","date":"March 2, 2013 at 9:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-26157","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative","post":"I’m AB neg. and a black female. age 59.

Blood is equal to the physical manifestation of life-force energy. Chinese say wherever there is bio-energy there is blood and vice-versa. Most likely there is a lot more to learn about the different blood types and what kind of people are represented by each than what we have discovered so far. Since the causes of birthmarks is still unknown it’s hard to speak at all about their significance. But I do believe that all things in life are connected and everything has purpose, even the smallest of things that exist. Perhaps the phoenix has special significance in your life. It is the symbol of death and rebirth- the ability to transform and to regenerate. Some people experience transformation on a much deeper level than others and can regenerate themselves well inwardly because they have a lot of inner knowledge instead of simply living on the surface with the bulk of society. Also some people experience this aspect in an outer way as well. Some people experience the death or loss of dear ones throughout their life in sudden and tragic ways, perhaps to learn about how to let go of other people.

That is all that it is. And a blood type is just a blood type. Jesus had no children. His bloodtype was Divine DNA given to Him in His mother’s womb by the Holy Spirit. It is something we accept in faith as Christians. Jesus death and resurrection hinges on the fact of Jesus, the Son of God shedding His blood. His blood, being of God, was for the remission of sins(Wiping out our sins completely).Adam had given his dominion over the earth to the devil in the Garden. That is when sin and death entered the world.It was never supposed to be this way. The only way to save us was for God to become a man, take on OUR flesh, and shed HIS PERFECT blood. And He did. He was the only One Who was Holy and the Son of God. When we make Him our Savior (recognizing the act of God’s love of saving us), then we become Righteous to God through Jesus Christ. You never have to worry about being “good enough” because only Jesus was able top live a perfect sinless life, and become our Lamb on the Cross.You don’t need professional help from the world. You just need Jesus, the Lover of your soul. God bless you Mary!

Of course, filtered through common sense, logic, and scientific knowledge, information is also relative to the recipient’s interpretation.\nThis appears to be a very current “blog” posting site, and I will watch closely for any follow-on comments.  I’d appreciate input or suggestions…\n\n","date":"August 5, 2013 at 9:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-40547","author":"Sharon Kramer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative","post":"I am A neg, my husband is B pos.  Our child is AB neg.  This is because my blood type is either AO neg/neg or AA neg/neg.   His blood type could be BB pos/neg or BO pos/neg.  That’s how you get a child with AB neg blood.  You get one factor from EACH parent.  AB is NOT passed down from one parent.  If you believe in such things, the only time AB was passed from mother to child was when Jesus was born, since we’re assuming God the Father neglected to contribute a blood type.  Any totally human child of Jesus or Mary (with Joseph) would have either A or B passed down from Jesus or Mary and A, B or O contributed from the other parent.  \nBlood type would not confirm a genetic link to Jesus or Mary.  You would need mitochondrial DNA for that.\n\n","date":"August 31, 2013 at 11:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-42498","author":"Jane","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative","post":"First off we are all children of God regardless of blood, Jesus blood is the only blood to really matter since you or me can not plead are blood over anyone and have it work.

The idea seems to be that the higher the incidence of AB the further back the intermingling took place.  Many different sites suggest the central Europe AB emerged after 900 AD but this seems to be based on lack of evidence that it can be found earlier rather than on firm evidence of this as the first date.  The professor of physiology with whom I shared the blood evidence doubted whether it was actually AB blood anyway.\nSo I just left it in my mind as an open question. One of the MANY areas of Shroud research where we need more up-to-date testing.\n\n","date":"December 11, 2013 at 5:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-57905","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative","post":"RACIAL & ETHNIC DISTRIBUTION of ABO BLOOD TYPES\nhttp://www.bloodbook.com/world-abo.html\n\n","date":"February 10, 2014 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-78011","author":"fifi5050","site":"shroudstory"}]
