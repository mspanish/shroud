[{"title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth","post":"That’s an interesting analysis and food for thought.\nIt’s not impossible that Jesus carried a complete cross, but I do not find OK’s analysis particularly convincing. It may be true that the execution equipment was not left on-site – and Glori’s suggestions seem quite sensible in that respect – but that does not mean that the condemned criminal carried a completely constructed cross. There are a couple of reasons for this.\nFirstly I have myself carried such a cross a number of times, the distance (about 700m) between the Catholic and Anglican churches on my parish as part of the Good Friday ‘Walk of Witness’ and I think I can say with some authority that the crosspiece is always in front of the body and never makes contact with the back at all. OK’s diagram which seems to show the whole cross strapped to the back is wholly unrealistic. What’s more, given its length, the cross presses on the top of the shoulders and does not abrade the shoulderblades.\nSecondly, my cross consisted of two pieces of wood of equal cross-section joined by a cross-halved joint. If this is not done, then the cross-piece would either be simply nailed directly across the upright, or have a mortice cut out for a tenon in the upright to fit in. In the first case it would be very difficult to stand the completed cross up with a body hanging on it (the Good Thief’s beam looks like this), and in the second the crossbeam would have to be much thicker than suggested (maybe 15cm or so) to accommodate both the tenon. Also I would certainly not assume the upright had a circular cross-section; the crossbeam would be impossible to attach securely.\nAs to weight, my cross was made of 6″ x 4″ (15cm x 10cm) pine and weighed about 50kg. However, I only carried it; I don’t know how stable such a narrow cross would be to hang a victim on.\n\n","date":"March 14, 2015 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-193351","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth","post":"Hugh:\nI think I can say with some authority that the crosspiece is always in front of the body and never makes contact with the back at all.

The assertion was probably first made by Barbet who devotes two separate sections to the question, a) Instruments of execution b) Carrying of the cross.  Barbet went to some pains to refute the assertions of a colleague, Judica, who had assumed that the whole cross was carried. \nNor was it necessary that the cross beam be carried across the nape of the neck as shown in the illustration.  Barbet referred to a time as a railway sapper in his youth when it was common for the workmen to carry a railway sleeper on the right shoulder, something which this correspondent is very familiar.  He even described the results of some of their falls and likened the evidence of their excoriations, including both on the right and left shoulder as a result, matching both the Shroud and Tunic evidences.  \nTo raise the whole cross requires ropes, some tricky logistics in hoisting, and backfilling with tamping to anchor the upright in its hole, to ensure that it stays securely vertical.  The only evidence for it is the partly damaged stone ring.at Holy Sepulchre, and whose use as such is conjectural.  Have any other stone rings be discovered, A ring would seem to require some tiresome and skillful work to construct from stone, but I suppose it might be done, they don’t occur naturally.  It would be a much simpler exercise merely to raise the patibulum with the crucified body on to an already fixed upright, and such ruthless efficiency is worth serious consideration, particularly if there are a number of prisoners to be executed.  Fixed uprights were a common enough feature throughout the empire, and having discovered an efficient way of carrying out executions, why would they vary it from a normal practice which had become standard? . \nBarbet’s explanation is worth reading in some detail, as he would seem to cover all the bases, including accounting for the apparent evidence on the Shroud and Tunic, classical references to the practices of crucifixion, its origin, and so on.\n\n","date":"March 14, 2015 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-193366","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth","post":"Upon the death of Herod the Great, and after a riot had broken out in Jerusalem following an unwise speech by Archelaus when three thousand worshipers were killed, Archelaus left for Rome to ratify Herod’s will.

It’s the classic work on Shroud forensics, has become something of a touchstone, a starting point for all Shroud forensic debates, is well-argued and is most authoritative as by an experienced forensic pathologist who also happens to know enough of the classics to be well read in matters pertaining to crucifixion, and punishment and other contemporary practices.  I see it still features prominently on the web, copies are available from Amazon, and you can probably find a copy in a good second-hand book-shop or a public library.  \nThere can be no doubt that the Shroud man fell while carrying his load, attested by injuries to the knees and nose on which there is the same dirt as on the soles of his feet, travertine aragonite, a rare form of limestone but which is commonly found in Jerusalem.  The impact of his load impacting on his shoulders as a result of falling are also evident.  All three synoptic gospels recount that Simon of Cyrene was pressed into service to assist with carrying the cross, and it may therefore be inferred that the scourged man had some difficulty in carrying it. \nBarbet goes into considerable detail in describing all these injuries as a result of falling, too long to replicate here, which is why I suggest you obtain a copy of his book.  A colleague, one Judica, had asserted that Jesus carried the whole cross, the lower half of the cross-beam hanging down in front, with the upper half over his right shoulder.  Judica had apparently asserted that the injuries to the left shoulder resulted from the upper half  of the cross beam falling across the man’s upper back and impacting on the left shoulder.  Barbet disagreed with this scenario, and considered that only the cross-beam was carried.  \nThere seem to be two possible ways the cross-beam might have been carried: Either a) as shown in the drawing above with the cross-beam  across the nape of the neck, with the man’s arms bound to it; Or b) as a workman might carry a beam on his shoulder, with the point of balance slightly behind, and held in place by the hands in front on the top surface.  Barbet was familiar with the second practice through workmen carrying railway sleepers (US = cross-ties) and the injuries incurred as a result of occasional falls.  He seems to envisage the trailing half of the cross-beam as crossing to the left when carried for purposes of balance, so that a fall would result in both shoulders being impacted.  His detailed description is so specific that you need to read it. \nIf you are able to obtain a copy of his work, your comments could be very enlightening in any further debates on the subject on this site.\n\n","date":"March 15, 2015 at 1:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-193389","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth","post":"On November 10, 2000 I bought the book by André Marion\n(CNRS research engineer):\n“Jésus et la science” (Presses de la Renaissance, Paris, March 2000)\nand the book has been autographed by Marion the day after,\nin Argenteuil (where there was a meeting around the research\nabout the Holy Tunic of Jesus).\nThe interesting book was dedicated to  Rodolphe, the son\nof André Marion.

However, several cells of skin, hairs, dandruff, and of white globules, which have been located on the Tunic, contain the human DNA of which the chromosomal analysis, at this stage, indicates the following certainties:\na) It is human DNA\nb) The genetic profiles of this DNA concern only one individual.\nc) The specific markers mention the presence of the chromosome Y, marker of masculinity.\nd) The chromosomal formulas indicate a correspondence with an oriental Semitic non Arabic DNA. We got, says the professor, the DNA print (like in legal medicine) of this man according to 15 discriminative markers.\n>This print, like all prints, is unique and will permit useful comparisons. …\nSo…\nHere there is not the claim aboout an opium addict person.\nNow I am curious to read what is the exact opinion by Kelly Kearse on DNA analyses\nconducted by Lucotte (who has found that Jesus was an opium addict with bad habits!…)\n— —\nand\nthe name “Lucotte” also appear in the paper by\nProf. Giulio Fanti:\n“A dozen years of Shroud Science Group”\n>… the Special Issue consisted of 12 papers signed\nby the following first authors: F.

A few points:\n(1) Like any penal system, the Romans preferred deterrence over punishment.  Having the stipes permanently mounted on Golgotha which was at the crossroads of two main roads converging on Jerusalem served this purpose well.  This site was outside the walls of Jerusalem and out of sight of the Temple so the well-known Jewish outrage at Temple sacrileges would have been substantially muted.  Similarly, the route to Golgotha was chosen to maximize the public spectacle so as to add to the deterrent effect of this horrific form of execution.  \n(2) Dragging a 100+ pound full cross would have been extremely difficult, perhaps impossible for someone as badly beaten and tortured as Jesus was.  Further, it appears the size of the Roman execution detachment was four or five men, including a centurion on horseback.  To ensure that a condemned prisoner did not simply dump his cross and take off through the crowds in the narrow streets suggests that the patibulum (crossbar) was laid across his back and tied to his arms.  As for the marks on the shroud, it must be remembered that Simon the Cyrenean helped Jesus to carry his cross.  It may be that by the time they reached Calvary Simon was carrying the whole thing.  Once Simon began helping, the patibulum would have rested on only one of Jesus’ shoulders at a time.\n(3)  If there is any “classic” authority on crucifixion to be read, it is not Barbet.  His conclusions on the crucifixion itself have been largely rebutted by Dr. Frederick Zugibe in his books, “The Cross and the Shroud” (1988) and “The Crucifixion of Jesus” (2005).  Specifically, the notion that the victim had to raise himself on the cross to breathe and eventually died of asphyxiation when he could no longer do that is false.  I was dismayed to see eminent Shroud researcher John Jackson repeat this discredited notion in the CNN show.  The simple fact is that there is no more impediment to breathing by a crucifixion victim than there is for any person standing up with his arms outstretched to the sides.  Try it against a wall on your tiptoes if you want to get as close to the physical posture of a crucifixion victim as you can.  Now substitute a nail for the floor and you’ve got it.  The point is that with the nail you are still standing.  Your skeletal structure is the same as when you stand on the floor.  A lot more painful, of course!  If you want to test the hypothesis even further, nail a pair of old shoes on a wall and put gate handles where your outstretched hands would be.  Get someone to help you and put your feet in those shoes while holding the handles.  You will discover there is no problem breathing.  You will discover that there is little weight on your hands and arms.  You will also discover that you really cannot raise yourself at all.  Within seconds your thigh and shoulder muscles will begin cramping.  The only way you can find some slight relief is to lean forward as far as you can.  All of this is discussed by Zugibe who also discredit’s Barbet’s thesis for the hand nailing.\n(4)  Finally, it is in the nature of human beings to find the easiest way to do things.  The easiest way to nail a person to a cross is to assemble the cross first, then lay the victim on it, then drive the nails through hands and feet (with one or more other people holding the victim in place), then use ropes attached to each end of the patibulum to pull the cross upright while the end of the stipes is placed at the edge of the hole where it is normally kept.  When it falls to the bottom of the hole, jamming it in place with 4 appropriately sized rocks will keep it there.  No need for a fancy rock ring.  The notion that it would have been easier to raise the patibulum with the victim attached suggests to me that the person proposing that hasn’t done a lot of manual labor in his life.  Plus, nailing the feet of a squirming victim on a vertical surface would have been far more difficult than doing it while someone could lay over his legs to hold them still.\n\n","date":"March 16, 2015 at 4:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-193536","author":"Jim Carney","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth","post":"Some interesting comments, Jim.  It was Barbet who gave weight to the fixed stipes, prisoner carrying only the patibulum idea, and he cites a few classic authorities and Roman military efficiency in support of it.  In your para (1) you seem to support this notion, and then in your para (2) & (4) you revert to the prisoner being nailed to the full cross on the ground and then raising it using ropes.  Are you speculating that the stipes were kept upright at the site as a deterrent, and on the arrival of the execution party, the stipes were removed from their holes, the full cross then assembled, and then prisoner nailed on to the full cross?  If the stipes were only loosely kept in their holes, what would prevent thieves making off with the stipes for use as timber?  \nNot all agree that Zugibe successfully rebutted Barbet’s scenario.  As I recall from Zugibe’s published papers, his volunteer mounted a fixed-in-place cross, his hands being placed in gauntlets fitted with strain gauges, and his ankles bound by a strap to the upright.  The arm tensions measured were much less than those claimed by Barbet, as some of he weight was taken by the feet.  He then claimed that this data refuted the need for wrist nailing. \nIf we use Barbet’s scenario of nailing the prisoner to the cross-bar only, then the full weight needs to be taken by the arms at the time of raising, and for that case wrist nailing would be required.  Alternatively, Zugibe’s volunteer, with his ankles comfortably strapped, hardly simulates the excruciating pain of putting his whole body weight on a nail through his feet.  The prisoner would seek to relieve this pain by transferring his weight to his arms, when again the need for wrist nailing arises.  When the pan in his wrists and arms became unbearable, he would again transfer his weight back to his feet.  Thus giving rise to Barbet’s notion of a see-saw action.  So I don’t know that Zugibe’s account can be taken as the last word. \nIf the cross-bar only was carried, then it may not need to have been carried as you describe in para (2), with it lying across his back against the nape of the neck, with his arms bound to it.  It could be carried on one shoulder lying parallel to the direction of travel.  The prisoner’s wrists could still be bound to the leading end of the cross-bar to prevent him dumping it.  The excoriation below the left shoulder is consistent with a fall when the trailing end of the cross-bar impacts on his shoulder.  Barbet claimed to have observed similar wounds by railway workers when they occasionally stumbled when carrying railroad cross-ties.   \nAs crucifixion has not been regularly practised since about 325 AD, we can’t know the full details, and doubtless there were some variations in local practices anyway.  So that any reconstruction inevitably involves a degree of speculation.  Any comments?\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 2:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-194504","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth","post":"On page 136 of the book “Inchiesta sulla Sindone” (= “An Inquiry Into the Shroud”), by Marco Tosatti  (Piemme editions, 2009) we can find the idea of a different explanation…\n It is a hypothesis, a bit less striking, but also with this (perhaps) of its rationality and supported by the experience of the doctor Prof. Baima Bolllone.
