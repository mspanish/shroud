[{"title":"The Shroud of Turin and Near Death Experiences","post":"He is unnecessarily mixing things up, as though the TS is only meant to remind us about the so-called NDE and the question of survival after death.There are humans who only think about their survival after death and forget about the rest of creation. If he goes a little deeper into ontology, about which we know very little, he will be led to the topic of energy and much more. For a start, the mind-body problem is still not resolved.\n\n","date":"July 25, 2014 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/25/the-shroud-of-turin-and-near-death-experiences/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-140292","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin and Near Death Experiences","post":"Louis:  The article compares the Shroud with NDEs in the way that enough evidence will give us a verdict.  I don’t see a mixing up of the two.  It’s only to agree with Dr. Long that enough evidence will demand a reasonable conclusion or verdict.  The Shroud is used as an example.  The article is focused just on Dr. Long’s findings.  The topic of energy and ontology is a larger scope than where this article intends to go.\n\n","date":"July 25, 2014 at 1:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/25/the-shroud-of-turin-and-near-death-experiences/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-140321","author":"1frontrowseat","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin and Near Death Experiences","post":"Hi\nOne wonders where his “evidence” will take us. Some of the people who have had such experiences claim to have seen Jesus surrounded by very bright light, others a dark tunnel with a light at the end, yet others floating above us here below and seeing everything that was going on. The evidence seems to lead to the unconscious, which encompasses past, present and future. What is “seen” is embedded in the unconscious. That is why ontology — our minds and the universe included — and the mind-body problem was mentioned.\nThere can be a positive effect: the blogger says, “materialism slides into the background and its importance often dissipates.” It is like shock therapy. Why? Because life is short, there is generally not enough time to think, we have to eat, see to it that we are living under a roof and that it does not collapse and so on. Of course, there are people who have all these material things easily and do not want to think, they are immersed in materialism.\n\n","date":"July 25, 2014 at 3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/25/the-shroud-of-turin-and-near-death-experiences/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-140335","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin and Near Death Experiences","post":"There is also pre-death experience.

I am interested in such a matter, even if I could not say I am sure what these phenomena really mean (Afterlife o creations of our brains!). Anyway, all this reminded me of a interesting experience recounted in a wonderful video interview that has been recently done to Mrs. Gabriella Magrini from Rome (Italy). She tells of her Near Death-Experience.
