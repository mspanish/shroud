[{"title":"Nice Short Summary of the Shroud of Turin","post":"I watched through the whole video posted here on this site – I found I had tech problems attempting to view it on the Tech I site.  I feel that anyone already reasonably well-informed about the Shroud would not learn a great deal more from the video, although the theory about the side-strip being used as a tying band and then afterward at some time later sewn into the main cloth, was a new aspect that has not been extensively discussed before to my knowledge.  The detailed close-up match with the Oviedo cloth was also well done. \nThe theory that the linen had bound CO molecules into it over the course of time was left inconclusive, although Dr Ramsey of Oxford appeared prepared to consider the possibility. \nWhat did disappoint me was that there was no mention whatsoever of the inept sampling for the original C14 tests, and as shown by tests on the Raes sample with its isolated contamination of cotton. that it may well have been taken from a medieval invisble mend.  We could speculate whether the presence of Flury-Lemburg in the video may have compromised such a discussion.  \nThiebault Heimburger has been insistent that there is no other cotton contamination of the cloth, only in the Raes sample virtually from the same location from where the C14 sample was taken.  This aspect screams out for attention, and possibly at one fell swoop might well resolve the problem of the errant results.  On the other hand, there are those scientifically qualified who also suspect that C14 tests even on the parent linen may still be inconclusive.\nThere’s too much that we don’t know, but which ought to be known!  An atmosphere of mystery and Oh Gosh or Wow factor seem regrettably to be essential ingredients for any such video intended for public consumption, but I feel we could do with a lot more science and a lot less speculation.\n\n","date":"December 22, 2012 at 6:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/21/nice-short-summary-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-20952","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nice Short Summary of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Is it certain that the side-strip is in fact detached? Accounts suggest that it is so well correlated that individual threads can be traced more or less continuously from the main cloth, through the seam and into the side-strip, with very close precision. I believe the Raes sample contained a bit of seam – did it come apart into two pieces?\n\n","date":"December 22, 2012 at 6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/21/nice-short-summary-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-20955","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nice Short Summary of the Shroud of Turin","post":"Dave wrote: \n  “the theory about the side-strip being used as a tying band and then afterward at some time later sewn into the main cloth, was a new aspect that has not been extensively discussed before to my knowledge.”\n  As early as 1994 (my paper to Daniel Raffard de Brienne) and 1997 (my memo in Nice), I first mentioned the strip band might well have been cut off from the main cloth for tight wrapping purpose.
