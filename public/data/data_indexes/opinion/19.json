[{"title":"Becky Garrison Article in Killing the Buddha","post":"I think it’s time to redefine “rational.” Given all the actual evidence of the Shroud itself, is it “rational” to doubt its reality? Or does such doubt reflect an inability to deal rationally with facts that are not in one’s own cosmic view of existence? \nReality is far more complex than a “rationalist” might admit.  For example, there are many scientist s who admit that some aspects of Quantum Mechanics defy “rational” explanation. Simplistic rejection of any idea of existence a not being “rational” is shorthand for “Don’t bother me with the facts or any idea that confronts my assumptions with which I am comfortable.”\nIf one looks back through the history of science one is struck at how many advances that ultimately became accepted truth were initially rejected because they were not “rational” according to the wisdom of the time and that includes Einstein (who himself initially rejected  much of quantum mechanics because it was not rational.\nOne might even conclude that nothing of importance can be accomplished by a “rational” man or woman.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2012 at 10:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/23/becky-garrison-article-in-killing-the-buddha/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-11555","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Becky Garrison Article in Killing the Buddha","post":"John I am in total agreement with your comment. It is the Naturalist world view that cannot accept there are things we cannot explain and are beyond our present state of scientific or naturalistic knowledge. Hense the push for a natural causation as opposed to a ‘supernatural’ one.\nThe Fatima story comes to mind here, as WITNESSED by one of my family. A drenched field with thousands of rain soaked people, in minutes were completely dry; ground, cloths everything completely dry!. This miracle as witnessed by many thousands goes beyond ‘Naturalistic’ thinking yet gets very little mention at all.\nR\n\n","date":"May 23, 2012 at 5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/23/becky-garrison-article-in-killing-the-buddha/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-11558","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Becky Garrison Article in Killing the Buddha","post":"John’s comments are right on the money.  One of my favourite books on this topic is John Cribben’s “In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat”, a layman’s elementary introduction to the mysteries of quantum mechanics.  One only needs a high school knowledge of physics to be able to follow it.  The peculiar thing is that before writing this posting, I have been searching all morning for this book to get the context right, but without success.  This failure gives a whole new dimension to the search for this blessed cat who’s obviously gone missing.    \nFor those who don’t know about Schrodinger’s Cat, he is the topic of a thought experiment in quantum mechanics, a sort of game played by Einstein and other physicists in their efforts to plumb the mysteries of quantum mechanics, in their unsuccessful efforts to obtain a “rational” explanation, at what they imagined had to be “underlying variables”, but which like Schrodinger’s Cat had no real existence.    \nPersonally I feel that the modern lack of a full understanding of “rationality” is the result of the failure of twentieth century philosophy, because of its excursions into unreality, particularly by two French clowns, Foucault and Derrida.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2012 at 6:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/23/becky-garrison-article-in-killing-the-buddha/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-11559","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Becky Garrison Article in Killing the Buddha","post":"Thanks for the comments. \nSpeaking of false apparitions, that picture isn’t me. :)\n\n","date":"May 24, 2012 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/23/becky-garrison-article-in-killing-the-buddha/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-11568","author":"Becky Garrison","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Becky Garrison Article in Killing the Buddha","post":"Let’s try the picture from WaPo\n\n","date":"May 24, 2012 at 9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/23/becky-garrison-article-in-killing-the-buddha/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-11569","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Becky Garrison Article in Killing the Buddha","post":"Well, let me offer this: the only problem with “rationality” is humanity. What we simply don’t understand we offer prevarications for. When we understand we offer our ignorance as excuse for our previous prevarications. Humility is the only solution.\nThere is an old saying: “Science is like climbing a mountain. When the scientists reach the summit they will find the theologians having a picnic.”\n\n","date":"May 24, 2012 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/23/becky-garrison-article-in-killing-the-buddha/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-11579","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"}]
