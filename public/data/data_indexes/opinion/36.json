[{"title":"Dear Royal Society. Time maybe to take a hard line on those who peddle Turin Shroud pseudoscience?","post":"Here’s a comment  from The Venerable Hugh that has just this minute appeared on The Other Site (the one that insists on holding up any comments I post there while Mr.Prissy checks them out for unseemly language – while allowing everyone to make their snide character attacks on me):\nSeptember 8, 2013 at 4:59 am | #15\nThanks, Yannick, but I’m afraid I still can’t agree with you.\n1) Can anyone find a reference to McCrone finding starch on the shroud except what is mentioned by Rogers himself?\n2) Can anyone (Colin, perhaps, if he’s ever on board these days) say whether the ‘ghost’ coloration on the Mylar tape could be due to the detachment of the primary cell wall of fibres rather than an ‘impurity layer’?\n3) Although Heller and Adler failed to report finding any starch on the shroud, do we “have to assume” that they did find it but failed to report it?\n4) Can Thibault Heimburger, one of the authors of the paper, and who does read this blog from time to time, confirm that Fanti was “was not willing at all to even mention Rogers’ impurity hypothesis” until forced to do so?\n………………………………………………..\nFrankly, I cannot be arsed (pardon the internet lingo) with Mr.Rogers’  so-called “impurity layer”. Maybe if he had taken the time or trouble to work in a PhD training in his career, his supervisor would have quickly disabused him of what probably is the most common error in scientific research. Yes, it’s good to have ideas, hypotheses, working models etc – all of which might be described as mental constructs. But what one must NEVER do is embrace a mental construct so closely that it becomes essentially “fact”, such well-established fact that you cannot be bothered to do the essential experimentation. But that is precisely what Mr.Rogers did – he took his “impurity layer” – a mental construct – and elevated it to the level of fact, with the result that some very silly and impressionable people, notably Yannick Clement on the other site, bang on endlessly about the “impurity layer”, and attack anyone who reminds folk that there’s a better candidate for the superficial image-receptive layer of flax fibres, namely that primary cell wall (PCW). Yes, Mr.Rogers could not be arsed to verify the existence of his own impurity layer, being content to make vague references to what others allegedly saw using reagents designed to look for something else (an iodine/azide reagent was used to test for sulphur proteins – not starch).\nWhether the PCW can be the entity that stripped off so easily with Mylar tape is something I’m not sure about. If it is, then that should not be too difficult to demonstrate in model studies with modern linen. What seems clear is that something that Mr. Clement thinks is needed to explain the discontinuous nature of the Shroud image should strip away so cleanly as a skin, pellicle, film etc.  without disintegrating. There’s an expression about wanting to have one’s cake and eating it…\nPS: Check out this most appalling piece of obfuscation and bluster from the same Yannick Clement, someone who must now rank as time-waster extraordinaire…\nComment\nStick to the things you know about, Yannick. You simply do not understand the imperatives of sound scientific research.\n","date":"September 8, 2013 at 10:56 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/dear-royal-society-time-maybe-to-take-a-hard-line-on-those-who-peddle-turin-shroud-pseudoscience/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-2265","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Dear Royal Society.

That view is currently being promoted on ‘the other site’ by a medically-trained lady anaesthetist (or anesthesiologist as they say in the US where she works). Not true. It is ordinary visible white light from fluorescent tubes that is used, and it the visible blue component that is absorbed by the yellow/orange bilirubin, whose absorption maximum is approx 450nm. So all the speculation about the “too red” bloodstains on the Shroud maybe only looking too red when viewed in broad daylight, the latter providing some “obligatory” uv component is pure tosh. There’s more sloppy and mistaken so-called science from the same source appearing on a daily basis, and has been for some weeks now. The lady has only the most superficial understanding of physiological topics relevant to the Shroud, yet sets herself up as an authority, issuing rebukes to those of us who attempt to correct her errors, and we then find ourselves the target for offensive comments that question our mental state. If she continues in this fashion, I shall have no hesitation in saying where she acquired her initial medical training, such as it is.  It was not a prestigious US centre of excellence – that much I can tell you.\nUpdate: we’ve now been told that bilirubin is conjugated to hyaluronic acid in the liver.\nhttp://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/#comment-35020\nHow did this individual ever come to be medically qualified? (It is of course conjugated with glucuronic acid).\nUpdate, 30 May: The same source of chemical mis- and disinformation is now claiming that carbon monoxide is “unstable”. It is not. It is chemically stable, showing reactivity towards a fairly narrow range other substances, notably  oxygen but requiring high temperatures to kick start the combustion to CO2. Of course, CO in the atmosphere may last only a few months, without combustion, though still being oxidised finally to CO2, but that is more a reflection of the reactivity of the tiny concentrations of highly reactive OH. free radicals (initiating chain reactions)  or of soil bacteria.\n","date":"May 27, 2013 at 8:35 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/dear-royal-society-time-maybe-to-take-a-hard-line-on-those-who-peddle-turin-shroud-pseudoscience/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-2130","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Dear Royal Society.

That’s presumably on account of my criticizing the role of Barrie M.Schwortz and his so-called Shroud of Turin Education and Research Association (Inc) for keeping so much crucial data from STURP under copyright, making the task of a Shroud blogger like myself well nigh impossible when one has sight of only some of the data.\nUpdate at 11:23 UK time: the comment has now appeared. It’s possible that it fell foul of WordPress and its filter for comments deemed to have an excessive number of links to outside sites – excessive in this case being two – one of them mine, the other being in the quoted passage.\nHere’s the comment, in response to ‘anoxie’ that is currently blocked now unblocked. \nApril 7, 2013 at 5:41 am | #129\nReply | Quote\nYour comment is awaiting moderation.\n———————————————————————\n    In response to anoxie , who wrote:\n    “… which doesn’t mean bilirubin is not part of the answer.\n    The spectra obtained with addition of bilirubin and methemoglobin is non additive :\n    \n    As far as color is concerned, red means more relative absorption in blue/violet.”\n———————————————————————-\nThat link makes the point better than anything I can say as to why all of Adler’s data need to be searchable and accessible online, and not just in copyrighted books and so-called ‘Orphaned Manuscripts’ (redacted). The proposition being floated there is just plain ludicrous – namely that if mixing A and B reinforces absorption in particular parts of the spectrum – notably the blue/violet you mention – then regardless of what is happening elsewhere – you re assured of your intensification of red colour.\nOne does not often meet intensely blood-red colours in the laboratory, so when one does, it pays to look closely at the absorption spectrum. A simple model compound for “blood” is iron(III) thiocyanate, with the Fe(CNS) ++ ion. When you look at its absorption spectrum, there is a single almost symmetrical peak, centred approximately on 480nm:\n\nThat’s the only kind of spectrum that guarantees that a compound will be blood red – one with a single peak at that value. I’m not saying that there cannot under any circumstances be secondary peaks or shoulders, simply that Adler’s mixing exercise is worthless unless one has a photograph of the end-result – to be certain that a convincing blood red colour really has been achieved . A set of absorption spectra on their own tell one next to nothing – and can in fact be highly misleading.\nDo you think that mixing bilirubin and oxidized haemoglobin would produce an end-result that was virtually indistinguishable to the viewer from fresh blood? Hugh Farey tried it – and just a few days ago reported here a negative result. Now there’s a surprise…\n","date":"April 7, 2013 at 11:19 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/dear-royal-society-time-maybe-to-take-a-hard-line-on-those-who-peddle-turin-shroud-pseudoscience/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-2089","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Dear Royal Society. Time maybe to take a hard line on those who peddle Turin Shroud pseudoscience?","post":"I received this email from “jsaun” a couple of days ago:\n#############################################\n“Hello and I came across your blog when I was looking at various shroud\nsites….and I am impressed that you noticed the shroud of turin ventral and\ndorsal photos are different heights…may I offer my theory about that?…welll\nmy theory is that when the Lord resurrected the power caused the top cloth to\nraise above him and produced the front photograph at somewhat of a distance\nwhereas the back photograph was closer to the cloth on the bottom….thank you\nfor listening 🙂     sincerely…..\nthere are videos on youtube to support this theory….” \n#############################################\n Well, jasaun, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since I was involved in that ‘discussion’ – or should we say browbeating, only partly deserved from the schoolteacher I now call the Valkyrie, given her tendency to swoop on me from out of the blue. You see, that apparent length difference was just of one dozens of characteristics I had listed that seemed at the time to cast doubt on the Shroud’s authenticity. I had seen the same discrepancy in other people’s images, including one in a Cathedral, Italian as I recall, where there was a Shroud exhibition, but being a science bod, someone who takes nobody’s word for it, had decided to check it out for myself. That meant taking a head to head image, dividing it into two between the two heads, then rotating the top one so that the frontal and dorsal images were side by side, feet to feet. The dorsal image did indeed look taller than the frontal, and indeed bulkier around the shoulders. I simply noted it and moved on.\nResult: the Valkyrie swooped, said I had committed the grossest of errors,  not worthy of one of her 9th(?) grade students, was a disgrace to science, and even suggesting I had rigged the comparison!\nWhat i had not fully appreciated at the time was that the apparent length of the feet on the dorsal image looks greater than if the figure were standing upright, because it is the underside of the feet that is imaged, almost as if the linen had been pulled around the heel, and then taken to the tips of the toes, without a similar right angle turn (push rather than press) being performed on the frontal feet images (which are scarcely discernible anyway). If one aligns the images shoulder to shoulder, it is then possible to see there may be no real height difference (although published detailed measurements do suggest that one is a few centimetres  taller). I can look up the references if you wish.\nRunning a science-based blog is all too often a case of “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” – certainly if one’s observations get picked up elsewhere. You then find yourself being blasted for trying to “blind lay folk with science” or being accused of being sloppy, taking liberties, of engaging in deception if one tries to keep things light and conversational, as I occasionally do, at least for starters.\nWhat was especially annoying where that lady is concerned (and she still hovers to this day) is the way she prejudges – and occasionally resorts to defamation of character – having had one of her hair-curling comments removed from TOS  The Other Site) without waiting to hear my reply.\nMethinks some people have made a heavy emotional stake in the Shroud being authentic, and anyone who attempts to question authenticity from a scientific standpoint, as I do, can find themselves under attack, not because the detailed science is wrong (though my first impressions re the relative lengths were admittedly premature and unwise, even as one item in a long list) but because one is a “pseudoskeptic” as a NY lawyer has called me.  Instead of attacking the science, folk attack the scientist, and in some cases are only a whisker away from attacking science in general ( see Pam Moon on David Rolfe’s Shroud Enigma site).\nForgive me if I stop there. I’m sure that John Jackson will be delighted to see the way your thoughts are running in a supernatural direction, but coming from STURP’s lead scientist who initiated the famous science bash-cum-dash  in Turin all those years ago,  I do wonder how much the world knew at the time about his theological interests/agenda, as plainly on view if you visit his Shroud Center site, or read the “critical summaries” that emanate from that source, or see the way he tried every means in the book to discredit the radiocarbon dating in the BBC documentary, or read his “collapsing cloth” theory. John Jackson lectures in physics, but from where I am standing his radiation theories are ‘fizics’, not worthy of  the term physics (try looking for scholarly examination of heat conduction or convection as alternatives to radiation. ) Somebody had to say it (even STURP’s  Alan D.Adler once described Jackson’s  collapsing cloth theory as unscientific).\nPS  I am going back to the drawing board on my new site, and have wiped the contents, except for the Home Page title. I’m beginning to see the Shroud as the thin end of an anti-science wedge, the attacks on the integrity of the radiocarbon laboratories being disturbing, especially the veiled (and not so veiled) hints that they collaborated to produce a false anti-authenticity answer. My letter to Sir Paul may simply flag up this sinister element, leaving he and his Fellows to wise up on the detailed science only if they wish to (with a link to this site obviously 😉\n","date":"March 21, 2013 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/dear-royal-society-time-maybe-to-take-a-hard-line-on-those-who-peddle-turin-shroud-pseudoscience/","cat":"medieval_forgery","id":"comment-2050","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Dear Royal Society.
