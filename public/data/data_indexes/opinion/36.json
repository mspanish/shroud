[{"title":"Superhero Fr. Dwight Longenecker Believes in the Shroud of Turin","post":"That’s the trouble with all these other churches.  They’re upsetting all their traditionalists, fundamentalists and biblical literalists with their excursions into extravagant liberalism and reductionism.  So what’s happening?  They’re all ending up in my church as if we didn’t have way too much ultra-conservatism already.  We’re being held back here!  Hey buddy! You wanna try out the the really right-wing ultra-Catholic Latin Mass Catholics; you could find a home there!  Oh, I forgot.  They don’t think there’s a real Pope anymore.  Welcome home, anyway!  Yeah! There’s a few like me in the fold too, all kinds of fish!\n\n","date":"May 19, 2012 at 5:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/19/superhero-fr-dwight-longenecker-believes-in-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-11435","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
