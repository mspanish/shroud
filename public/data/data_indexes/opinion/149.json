[{"title":"Tales of faith? Poisoning the well?","post":"Personally I think we all might have benefited from a semester or two in the Philosophy Dept, taking some lessons in Logic and Critical Thinking.  If Steve Sekula does his job properly, then it can only be of benefit to his students.  The absence of these two disciplines is only too manifest on this site from to time.\nYoung people no longer seem to be able to think logically, and it all seemed to go downhill when Euclid was dropped from the school syllabus.\nSome social commentators, and even scientists seem to blame two French clowns, Jacques Derrida and Michael Foucault with their post-modernist philosophy, which can be summed up succinctly as “There’s no such thing as a truth statement”, essentially a nihilistic approach.  Unfortunately their influence has been unduly pervasive throughout much of Western culture.\nWe saw many “Wizards of Oz” during the 20th c, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini; Their kind is also only too evident even during these early years of the  21st c, Gadaffi, al-Assad etc, .  However it takes a great deal of courage, bravery and heroism to pull aside the curtain and reveal that there’s nothing there at all.\nSekula could be stepping on tricky ground with the Shroud, but maybe the important thing here is that he covers the ground and evidence comprehensively.  It is probably not the sort of topic that can lead to a definitive conclusion, but may demonstrate the distinction between definite knowledge and a reasonable belief.  We can only ask for fairness of treatment.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2012 at 3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/02/tales-of-faith-poisoning-the-well/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-8907","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"}]
