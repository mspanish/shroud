[{"title":"Promoted Comment on “I think I see the Shroud of Turin”","post":"Thanks for writing this blog, and having an extra critical eye and not just accepting a hypothesis because it supports the authenticity of the shroud.

Thanks.\n\n","date":"November 4, 2010 at 1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/11/04/promoted-comment-on-i-think-i-see-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-1628","author":"Mark","site":"shroudstory"}]
