It is widely believed that the Grial is the Chalisse of Valencia, which in fact, is a semiprecious carved stone and which is widely admitted by art experts to have been manufactured at a 1st century workshop somewhere in Middle East\nThere is not one single indication in the Grial literature connecting the Shroud and The Holy grial (a stone)\n\n","date":"July 31, 2015 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/31/is-the-shroud-the-inspiration-for-the-holy-grail-legends/","cat":"history","id":"comment-207081","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is the Shroud the Inspiration for the Holy Grail Legends?","post":"Notwithstanding Gabriel’s objections, I find Scavone’s 2010 Frascati paper persuasive.  Venerable Bede’s confusion of Lucius … Abgar VIII in his citadel Britio Edessorum with a non-existent British king Lucius, who is converted to Christianity ~200 AD, is also mentioned by other writers including Jack Markwardt.  The linguistic evolution from “Abgar” to the “Arthur” of the Grail legends would seem plain enough.  There is also the Glastonbury legend with its connection to Joseph of Arimathaea.  \nIt is Markardt’s contention that the apostle Peter took the various Passion relics to Antioch, including the Shroud, and his papers on this have been discussed at various times.  In 1098 crusaders captured the city of Antioch and claimed to have discovered the hiding place of the Holy Lance of Longinus.  Curiously another artefact which might well be the true Grail was discovered there as recently as 1910.  \n“In 1910, local Arabs unearthed, at the traditional site of Antioch’s ancient cathedral,42 a silver chalice comprised of an unfinished inner cup and a finished outer holder, akin to a reliquary, exquisitely decorated with ten human figures, in two groups of five.43 Professor William Newbold has noted that only in the middle of the first century did two groups of five men each govern the respective Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch and only at such time would a Christian religious object have displayed such a depiction.44 Dated to the first century and considered genuine by many archeological and scientific authorities,45 the Great Chalice of Antioch has been called “a most sacred Cup, in all probability the one\nwhich once served the Lord and his disciples at the Last Supper, the most precious object in Christian history, legend and tradition”.46 ”  “Antioch and the Shroud”, p.4, Markwardt, 1998-99.   The numbered references include citing of Eisen, Gustavus A., The Great Chalice of Antioch, Kouchakji Freres (New York 1923).  \nIn a separate paper, Markwardt has also proposed an alternative 1204 – 1355 route from Constantinople to Western Europe.  He considers that the Cathar Crucifix may have originated as a result of the Shroud coming into the possession of the Albigensians at Languedoc in Southern France, through their connections with the Balkan Bogomils sect, which had similar doctrines.  In the early 14th century the Cathars were suppressed, and subsequently Geoffrey I de Charnay acquired the Shroud pursuant to a royal grant.
