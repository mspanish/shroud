It was displayed vertically. The frame wasn’t added until the 19th Century.\nHowever, beginning in in Medieval times it was displayed by four or so bishops or priests grasping it on the top as horizontally displayed in this picture without  frame. (There are dozens of  surviving paintings of the displays made before the invention of photography.)\nOne thing to note is the clear indication that the upper two corners of the edging strip had been removed. The Rayes and carbon dating samples were taken just below the the upper left hand corner (as viewed)\nThe frequent viewings caused the corners to fray. The edge was removed and the fraying required repair. The carbon samples were taken from the repaired area. The FACT of the repairs has been confirmed by recent  expert analysis. \nSkepics might want to check my article published on Shroud.com  http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/klotzcnn.pdf \nIt is a critique of CNN’s Finding Jesus program on the Shroud.

What the spectators were seeing was just the front image not the back. The back image displays His naked buttocks and would have been a scandal. Also, John Jackson identified crease marks on the Shroud consistent with folding for that kind of display.\nThe image of Christ is buck-naked on the Shroud. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus had to break rigor mortis becasue his arms at the time death were outstretched on the cross and he in fact hung on the cross for some indeterminate time after he died. The image is consistent with the rigor mortis being broken at his shoulders an his arms being drawn down and covering his genitals. \nAs a matter of fact, as I recall the all too many wakes I have attended, the fully clothed body of the corpse had its hands crossed as displayed in the image. Often at a Catholic wake with a rosary in the hands.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 5:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/04/picture-for-today-shroud-on-the-steps-of-the-cathedral-by-enrie-1931/","cat":"history","id":"comment-201060","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Picture for Today:  Shroud on the Steps of the Cathedral by Enrie, 1931","post":"The footnote URL’s have a break in the middle and don’t work.\nThese should:\nhttp://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Thomas_Ferguson_files/Updated_report_on _the_Consideration_to_the_Uniformity_and_Effects_of_the_Fabric_in_the_Shroud_of_Turin-5-1.pdf\nhttp://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Three_threads_files/BL%20Sebastian%20for%2 0website%201.pdf\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 5:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/04/picture-for-today-shroud-on-the-steps-of-the-cathedral-by-enrie-1931/","cat":"history","id":"comment-201052","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Picture for Today:  Shroud on the Steps of the Cathedral by Enrie, 1931","post":"Apparently the URLS are two long to work in the format of the blog and disconnect with a line break.

The above photo apparently taken during the 1931 exposition, when the Shroud was brought out onto the cathedral steps, seems somewhat similar to an incident reported by Barbet on p.17 of his “Doctor at Cavalry”.  \nBarbet reports that on Sunday October 15th, 1933, the Shroud was taken out of its heavy frame from under glass, and twenty-five prelates bore it in its light frame out on to the terrace of the cathedral, so that it might be viewed and venerated directly by the crowd.  The sun had just set on the opposite side of the square and the bright but diffused light was ideal for viewing.  Barbet was standing on the steps of the cathedral, in front of a double line of foot soldiers, and was able to view the Shroud closely, at a distance of less than a metre.  He comments on how the difference in the colour of the bloodstains from those of the image then struck him, and saw that the stains had sunk into the material colouring it, and how it dawned on him why the images of the wounds are positive and all the rest is negative, and comments on this experience at length.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 5:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/04/picture-for-today-shroud-on-the-steps-of-the-cathedral-by-enrie-1931/","cat":"history","id":"comment-201058","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Picture for Today:  Shroud on the Steps of the Cathedral by Enrie, 1931","post":"typo — “Doctor at Calvary”, I’ve always confused Calvary & Cavalry, probably reading too many Western comics when an altar-boy!\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/04/picture-for-today-shroud-on-the-steps-of-the-cathedral-by-enrie-1931/","cat":"history","id":"comment-201088","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Picture for Today:  Shroud on the Steps of the Cathedral by Enrie, 1931","post":"John…..(re:)  “I believe the LeCari remembrance is pretty clear on that.”  I believe you meant de Clari as in Robert de Clari, the French knight who chronicled what you are referring to.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/04/picture-for-today-shroud-on-the-steps-of-the-cathedral-by-enrie-1931/","cat":"history","id":"comment-201076","author":"David O.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Picture for Today:  Shroud on the Steps of the Cathedral by Enrie, 1931","post":"Yes\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 11:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/04/picture-for-today-shroud-on-the-steps-of-the-cathedral-by-enrie-1931/","cat":"history","id":"comment-201078","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Picture for Today:  Shroud on the Steps of the Cathedral by Enrie, 1931","post":"Thankyou for posting this.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 12:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/04/picture-for-today-shroud-on-the-steps-of-the-cathedral-by-enrie-1931/","cat":"history","id":"comment-201080","author":"joshua8b2015","site":"shroudstory"}]
