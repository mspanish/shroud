[{"title":"Max Patrick Hamon replies to Charles Freeman","post":"Max, that’s quite spooky, I saw all sorts of images.  Fig 1 was very plain indeed, but I had to work a bit harder to see the others.  However, stepping back about 5 metres from the PC monitor, brought them more into focus. Query: They show up on the negatives OK, but can you demonstrate they also appear on the positives, as they would have been seen in the first millenium?  They’re evidently some kind of optical illusion involving the image, eye and brain, verging on the “I think I see” category of perceptions.  But observers would in fact report as observations what they believed they saw.\n\n","date":"October 10, 2012 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/max-patrick-hamon-replies-to-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","id":"comment-17394","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Max Patrick Hamon replies to Charles Freeman","post":"OK Dave.
