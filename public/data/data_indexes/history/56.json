[{"title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin","post":"I received several books by J.D. Crossan for review years ago. He is becoming a thing of the past. Ignoring the after-effects of the Resurrection event, he believes that Jesus body was eaten by wild dogs, while continuing to be a believing Christian and asking the question, “What kind of manifestation of God was Jesus?”. His faith therefore remains intact.\nOne big problem I at least could detect while reading his books and articles is that his approach led him to show interest in the so-called Jesus family tomb in the East Talpiot district of Jerusalem. It is a blind alley:\n https://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Parts_I_and_II\nand followed by:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III\nThere will be more to write later this year on those parts of the biblical tradition that J.D. Crossan has ignored, after an article on the Shroud image formation process. Both will be online.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 7:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-181806","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin","post":"“The earliest sources were eyewitnesses from which we get the greater part of the New Testament.

What were some of the Jesus Seminar’s conclusions?  According to the seminar, “Jesus was a mortal man, born of two human parents who DID NOT perform nature miracles, NOR die as a substitute for sinners NOR rise bodily from the dead.  Sightings of a risen Jesus were NOTHING MORE than the visionary experiences of some of his disciples rather than physical encounters” (Jesus Seminar-Wikipedia).  Crossan and those of his kind are nothing more than ‘heretics’ who dismiss the historicity of the Bible and the veracity of Scripture.

One great New Testament scholar I had occasion to interview twice, once during the launching of his excellent guide “Responses to 101 Questions on the Dead Sea Scrolls” (Paulist Press), was Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ who was judged to be the scholar’s scholar in the United States before his retirement. It was published in a major daily in a different language and I hope to be able to post it soon.\nFrom what I could learn from him, biblical interpretation is a very difficult task, and he had also been judged as someone with “impeccable critical credentials”, also having been on the Pontifical Biblical Commission for a while. His opinion was therefore very important. He employed the historical-critical, whose shortcomings were pointed out by Benedict XVI in his book “Jesus of Nazareth”. It does indeed have its problems, although it is better than the “formesgeschichte”, form criticism, developed by German Protestant scholars around Bultmann. Father Fitzmyer’s exegesis was criticised by the biblical scholars at the John Paul the Great Catholic University, San Diego, California, a link to whom was given by me above and cited by Rick. The reason the scholars were critical was that their approach was different from the one adopted by the Jesuit professor. We therefore continue to see different approaches to biblical studies.\nJ.D.Crossan seems to have interpreted the New Testament narratives in an allegorical way, against which Father Fitzmyer warned in the interview:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJ\nBut he does indeed have some faith, in the broad sense. It is something I have also observed in some practicing Christians, although they do not say it in public. It is very difficult to agree with the Irish-American J.D. Crossan and that is because he has ignored the depth of the post-Easter NT narratives, in keeping with his allegorical interpretation.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-181917","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin","post":"At some risk of provoking my dear friend Louis, I see the main value of Crossan as the illumination he provided with his “Power of Parable”.  His apparently permanent excursion into the Jesus Seminar territory has unfortunately over-shadowed this achievement and damaged his reputation as an authoritative Catholic writer irrevocably.  Likewise Bart Ehrman’s “Did Jesus Exist?” is also a powerful work and provides strong evidence for the historical existence of Jesus as a person.  Ehrman’s personal reaction against his evangelical background towards agnosticism, may only serve to underscore the significance of his insistence on the real historical existence of Jesus, supported by his considerable reputation as a NT scholar, as well as his non-biblical references.  J P Meier’s “Marginal Jew” has the advantage of a minimalist approach to the question, and therefore leaves no question as to the value of his conclusion. \nCiting the late first-century dates of NT composition is a weak argument against their authenticity, and under-rates the value and strength of oral tradition in pre-literate societies.  There is more literary and timely evidence for the existence of Jesus than there is for many other famous contemporary personalities whose existence is more readily taken for granted.  The 1988 C-14 testing of the Shroud is an absolute mess and has no credibility for this writer.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 2:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-181885","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin","post":"“Citing the late first-century dates of NT composition is a weak argument against their authenticity, and under-rates the value and strength of oral tradition in pre-literate societies.”\nWell put. Gospel of Mark likely dates from circa 70 AD and less than 40 years from Jesus’s death is nothing in that context (ie. people who would have been circa 15 – 20 years old when Jesus died would have been circa 55-  60 years old in 70AD)  \nEarliest letters from Paul date from the 50s and their content reiterate already well established knowledge and traditions around Jesus.\nEx-biblical writings provide clear evidence of active Christian communities in the 50s – 60s AD. \nFrom what I can tell, the view that Jesus never existed is a very marginal viewpoint.  These writings come from a period very close to Jesus’s lifetime.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 11:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-181970","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin","post":"Hello David\nGood to see you back on the scene.
