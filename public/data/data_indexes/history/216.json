[{"title":"What we want to see from the new pope regarding the Shroud of Turin","post":"On November 19, 2012, I sent a registered letter to Archbishop Salvatore Fisichella of the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization criticizing the Catholic Church in the U. S. for suppressing my slideshow/lecture about the Holy Shroud because I don’t promote the theory that the Holy Shroud is authentic. I have not yet gotten a response. It looks like I’ll have to complain to the new pope.\n\n","date":"February 13, 2013 at 1:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/12/what-we-want-to-see-from-the-new-pope-regarding-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-24112","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"}]
