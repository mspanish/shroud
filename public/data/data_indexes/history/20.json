The main thing is the fact I don’t believe one second in the so-called “spy clues” that could be present in this Gospel…  I really don’t think John was writing a document for the CIA !  Of course, there’s often a second level of understanding in a text like that and we cannot take every line in a strick literal way (just like we cannot take every lines of a text like the “Narratio of Imagine Edessena” or the sermon of Gregory Referendarius in a stick literal way !!! The fact is that those texts are full of spiritual teaching and are not “historic books” in the modern sense).  Nevertheless, I have a hard time to convince myself that John wanted to let his Christian readers know about the presence of body images on the Shroud of Christ, while using a coded language.  In my mind, Dreisbach had a very good imagination…  \nI have a completely different point of view on this topic and I even think that the most logical way to translate the word “Sudarium” used by John in both chapters (chapters 11 and 12) is by using the word “Shroud”.  Yes, along with some researchers (but definately not the majority of them, I know), I think that John was talking about the “Shroud” when he wrote “Sudarium”…  We have an infinite number of examples in ancient greek texts where words like “sudarium” and “sindon” would mean the same thing.  Why not for the Gospel of John ?  For a second, just try to change the word “Sudarium” in both chapters by using the word “Shroud” instead.  You’ll see that both texts then take a completely different light !!!  It’s a very interesting hypothesis that, as I say, don’t come from me, but that I agree with, particularly because of the chapter 11, which takes a much more logical sense when you think that Lazarus came out with a Shroud instead of just a face cloth…  Effectively, if John really mean “face cloth” by using the word “Sudarium”, why in the world the dead had to be tied up with linen strips ???  Makes no sense !  Also, I always thought (and this was even reported by some “shroudies”) that the use of a Sudarium was only prescribes when the victim died of a violent death (with blood flowing out of the body) !!!  Now, as I know, Lazarus died of a disease, not of a violent death !!!  Why using a Sudarium in the case of a “natural” death like that (with, most probably, no blood flowing out of the body) ???  \nThat’s just my personnal interpretation but, as I say, I can back up this point of view with the opinion of some serious researchers…  I don’t think we can discard this hypothesis easily.\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/paper-chase-lazarus-jesus-by-kim-dreisbach/","cat":"history","id":"comment-9704","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  “Lazarus & Jesus . . . “ by Kim Dreisbach","post":"Hi Dan, Thanks for posting the link to the Paper by Dreisbach.
