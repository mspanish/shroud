[{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"Check recent paper on Barrie’s site by Jeff Williams, Feb 13, 2014 which discusses the issue of the crucifixion earthquake: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/williamsearthquake.pdf \nNicaea was at the present site of the Turkish city of Iznik on the sea of Marmara, more or less opposite Istanbul i.e. Constantinople.  Any earthquake there would not be felt in Jerusalem, there was no solar eclipse (full moon) and any high flying dust cloud in Nicaea proves nothing for Jerusalem.  Williams does mention evidence in Dead Sea sediments of a M 6.0 to 6.5 during the years between 26 and 36 AD.  A chronology from a core at Ein Gedi, west shore of Dead Sea identified a widespread earthquake in 31 BC and an early first century earthquake temporarily assigned a date of 31AD, +/- 5 years.  The paper has a few links to further technical information.  The identified earthquake may be that  mentioned in Matthew’s gospel, or he may have borrowed it as a type of allegory.  Either 30 AD or 33 AD are possible years for the crucifixion (15th of Nisan (Pasch) fell on the sabbath in those years).  Paul Maier seems to be crimping the earthquake date tolerances to suit his particular case.\n\n","date":"August 1, 2014 at 8:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-141610","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"What an amazing lecture, one of the best speakers I ve seen in a long time.\n\n","date":"August 1, 2014 at 8:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-141695","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"Paul Maier :\n“I have really been the first professor of ancient history to absolutely state that we have categorical proofs that the tomb was empty, in any case.”\n\n“While speaking to the probability of the correct locations of certain traditional sites in the Holy Land, and faced with a question regarding that shroud which was under intensive study, Dr. Maier then stated that in his judgment it was about “95% probably authentic.” \nhttp://www.wlsessays.net/files/LemkeTurin.pdf\nHe probably didn’t mention the Shroud because it is still controversial and he doesn’t need it to claim that the tomb was empty.\nBut the Shroud meets the missing body problem he has perfectly exposed.\n\n","date":"August 2, 2014 at 5:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-141772","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"Maier is indeed entertaining, but he takes a very long time to be informative. His interpretation of the Caiaphas Ossuary is simply wrong. When it is correctly translated – Joseph, son of Caiaphas, not Caiaphas himself – we see that it is Joseph, not his father, who merited the elaborate ossuary, and we wonder why there is no mention of his father’s rank anyway. As it happens there is good evidence from the Miriam Ossuary that Caiaphas was indeed a senior priest, but mistakes like that cast doubt on Maier’s confidence. Maier goes on to quote the usual historical evidence from Roman commenters, of which only Josephus’s is really evidence of Jesus rather than of Christians as a sect, and Maier does not see fit to mention that perfectly sensible people have queried most of his evidence on reasonable grounds. The idea that only 30 years after the resurrection there was a sufficiently substantial Christian movement in Rome either to burn to place down or to be blamed for doing so and executed in their thousands (“an immense multitude”) is a priori a little far fetched, although not of course impossible. We have to wait until the questions at the end for his opinions on the empty tomb, which as it happens I share but have no archaeological foundation, and on the earthquake which we have already examined, negatively, elsewhere.\nThere is some good material here (I hadn’t heard of the “Horus, son of Horus” census return) but we do have to earn it!\n\n","date":"August 2, 2014 at 8:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-141792","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"Hi Hugh, I think you’re mistaken.

We shouldn’t mix things here.\nRegarding your query about “Qupha”, there is no certainty that it is a Jewish name, the best scholars think it is a surname: “Qafa” or “Qofa”, and it is “Qupha” according to E. Puech.\nI read about the controversy a long time ago and if I’m not mistaken the reference was in Father Puech’s book: “La croyance des Esséniens en la vie future: Immortalité, résurrection, vie éternelle?”, 2 volumes, Paris, Liv. Lecoffre, 1993.\nThere were 12 ossuaries in the tomb, and the name was inscribed twice on one ossuary. The tomb was not rich, something that could be expected from the status-conscious Sadducees who were very influenced by the Greeks.\nPuech wondered why “the priest” was also not inscribed if it did indeed refer to Caiaphas and it is not hard to agree with him.\nYou know something? This ossuary will not take us anywhere. I am more inclined to agree with the great Israeli scholar David Flusser, We must bury Caiaphas, not remember him.\n\n","date":"August 3, 2014 at 1:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-142014","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"I agree we should bury Caiaphas, but as it stands, the ossuary is important in the argument for a Historic Jesus.

As I understand it the name inscribed on the Caiaphas Ossuary appears twice, but spelled slightly differently. Fr Puech has, probably correctly, explained that the two spellings can only both be correct if they indicate the name Qopha, which is sufficiently far from Qayyapha, or something similar, for identity with Caiaphas to be rejected. However, Helen Katherine Bond points out, with photographs, that the inscriptions are somewhat clumsily executed, nothing like the elaborately decorated front of the ossuary, and appear to have been added as afterthoughts, after the ossuary had been placed in its niche, as the inscriber had to jam his hand into the narrow space between the ossuary and the wall of the tomb to scratch the letters. In this case the possibility that there was a simple misspelling of one of the names cannot be easily discarded. Neither she, nor I, nor, I dare say, the museum of antiquities in Jerusalem, would go to the stake in favour of authenticity – it is, as I say, a question of the weight one gives to a piece of evidence – but that’s the reason I do not concur with Fr Puech’s conclusion, however much I agree with his linguistic interpretation.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2014 at 12:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-142135","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"As I wrote above, a tomb belonging to a (Sadducean) priestly family with Caiaphas among those buried there would be much more elaborate.

Her explanation is that Caiaphas was the only one of five High Priestly relations of Annas not to be a descendent (having married into the family) and his own family need not have been anything special, and also that as he was dismissed from office under slightly tendentious circumstances, he may have ended his days rather less importantly than his previous eminence should have suggested.

In addition the author reviews whether these two topics are indeed connected or not.  \nThe Relationship between Ossuary Burial and the Belief in Resurrection during the Late Second Temple Period Judaism by Dina Teitelbaum; Carleton University, Canada 1997.  So it’s a little dated, but well researched, considered and presented.\nhttp://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq22102.pdf     \nI learnt a lot from it and it’s well worth taking the time to read through it, by those interested in these two topics.  \nSecondary burial in ossuaries may have commenced in Jerusalem as early as 50 BCE and continued into 70 AD;  With the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish diaspora, the practice drastically diminished, and with Hadrian’s edict excluding Jews it ceased in 138 AD.  Subsequently secondary burials became established in Southern Galilee.  Rahmani is known to assert that the practice only commenced during the Herodian period from 20 BCE, while others asserted it can be dated to 200 BCE, but this early date is not now generally accepted. \nAuthor considers that the first affirmation of Jewish belief in resurrection is only found in II Maccabees and afterwards, from about 168 BCE.  She sees it partly as a reaction to the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, and to some extent, reaction to the Book of Job, “Why do bad things happen to good people, while evil-doers prosper?”  She also connects it with Ezekiel’s earlier ‘Valley of Dry Bones’, although most exegetes have seen this text as referring to post-exilic Jewish resurgence.  She also connects the concept with the pervading Greek influences on notions of the soul.  \nThe relative scarcity of ossuaries (perhaps only some 2000 are known), in relation to demographic considerations, suggest that their use was principally a privilege of the well-to-do, and not necessarily associated with, nor an essential corollary to a belief in the resurrection of the body.  But the issues involved are examined in considerable detail.  She refers to the site known as the Caiaphas family tomb, and it would therefore seem that a Caiaphas ossuary would not necessarily imply his belief in the resurrection, nor need it be considered paradoxical.  \nShe observes that whereas some ossuaries have been ornately well-decorated, the inscription of names is often rough, suggesting that inscriptions were not made in the work-shop, but possibly on site.  This of course might imply that the names were not inscribed accurately, by those sufficiently well-lettered to do so, and hence inaccuracies might therefore be expected.  There may therefore be no great significance in any presumed mis-spelling of any occupant’s name on their ossuary.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2014 at 6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-142190","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus","post":"There are famous scholars who have written on the topic with the latest research.
