Hardly a “conference” in its traditional meaning; the descriptive expression “ex cathedra” seems sadly apposite.

The paper is titled: “The Shroud and the Mandylion – A reply to Professor Averil Cameron”.  \nThe paper traverses Cameron’s objections to the Wilson theory that the two were the same object.  He deals with her objections in great detail, and for me seems to be an effective response to all those Byzantine history scholars who object to his thesis.  But then I’m not a Byzantine scholar and wouldn’t know, would I?  I’m just an ordinary lay person, who imagines he can recognise the truth of a sound argument when it’s placed before him.  \nSpecialists have an important role in such matters, but I’ve often found that their concentration reveals too limiting a view and cannot always be relied on to get at the full truth of things.  By the way, I’ve also discovered that Wilson is not entirely ignorant of Greek as alleged in a recent posting.

Wilson1.pdf deals very well with several issues raised against the Shroud/Mandylion/Edessa hypothesis, such as the imprint being described as being from a “living Christ” or of the eyes being seen as “open” and specifically the blood. To the blood statement he mentions “if in good light” one may discern the blood markings. This is a point I tried to put forth before but was shunned. Wilson has seen the Shroud first hand, up close in semi-darkness and in good light and with no glass covering. He would know FAR better then most what is discernable and what is not, most definately. It is probable early discriptions of the Mandylion (of just the face), that one could come to the conclusion as Wilson predicts…Wilson is not alone in this area as it has been mentioned by many others, such as Pierre Barbet, whom have had the liberty to view the Shroud in it’s natural form, that it is very difficult to discern details such as the eyes, the blood etc; but especially the blood as it becomes pronounced only slightly in ‘good light’.

On the contrary to modern writers, precision was not at all important for them.  Damascene uses a word in one manuscript (De Fide Orthodoxa) that refer to a long cloth (not at all a burial shroud by the way but more like a coat or something like that) and in another manuscript (De Imaginibus), he used another word to describe the Image of Edessa and that word refers to a small cloth (more like a towel or something like that).  So, just with this example, you can see that it’s very risky to take these choices of words as it was really a precise physical description of the cloth…  It’s the same thing for the choice of words to describe the real Shroud of Christ.  In many ancient texts, the writer used the word “sudarium” instead of “sindon” !  In other words, these ancient writers were often using many different terms to describe the same relic (like I said, precision was not important for them) and, based solely on these choices of words, no one can really pretend to get a clear and precise physical description of a relic.  In the end, you got to put these words in the context of the legendary text where we found them and, for the Image of Edessa linked to the Abgar legend, no doubt that the vast majority of text refers to only the image of the face of Christ and, on that base, we have to assume that this relic was not a very big cloth.  In fact, that’s precisely what “Mandylion (from the arab “Mandyl”) mean !

How in the world a “large outer cloak” can measure 4 meters long my friend ?  This is a very bad extrapolation that you did about that…  And for the alternative versions of the Abgar legend referring to a complete image of the body of Christ, I only know these manuscript : 1- Codex Vossianus Latinus Q69, dated from the 10th or 11th century and 2- “Historia Ecclesiastica” by Orderic Vital, dated of around 1141.

If someone really wants to only keep these 2 references as being true physical descriptions of the Mandylion, he has to throw a great amount of manuscripts to the garbage (those that don’t refer at all to a full-length image) and I’m sorry, but acting like that is NOT the good way to do History !  When 99% of the manuscripts talked about a small cloth bearing just the image of the face of the living Christ, I don’t think it’s correct to forget about them and just focus your attention on these 2 references !\n2- These 2 references to the image of a full-length body NEVER talk about the presence of injuries or blood, along with the body image and they don’t seem to refer to a double full-length image, ventral and dorsal.  When you read these references, you really have a sense that the authors refer only to a frontal image.\n3- These few references are all found in a legendary kind of text that is most probably using images to teach a theological message linked with the dogma of the Incarnation of Christ.  In that context, no one can’t used them as a real precise description of the Mandylion…  It’s only when you use bad speculations and extrapolations that you can see a description of the Shroud there.

A cloak is far from being a shroud !  And also, you have to consider the literary context where you found this word by Damascene : it’s during the lifetime of Christ, before his Passion !!!  In that context, no way you can make a direct link between this large cloth and the Shroud of Turin !  Here’s the part of Damascene’s manuscript where we found the word “large cloth” (the translation from the greek manuscript is from Guscin) : “Abgar, kind of the city of Edessa, sent an artist to paint the Lord’s image but could not do so because of the shining brilliance of his face.  The Lord therefore placed a large cloth on his divine and life-giving face wipe his own imprint onto it.

Damascene talks about an image of only the face of the living Christ and in another earlier manuscript, he was using a common word meaning a simple cloth to describe the same Image of Edessa and again, he talked only about an image of the face of the living Christ.  It’s clear that, for him, the Mandylion was simply an image of the face of the living Christ and had nothing to do with a burial cloth.  If there had been bloodstains and bruises on the face, don’t you think a doctor of the Church like him wouldn’t have written about that in details ???  You look at the face on the Shroud and it’s evident (even for a child) that we see an image of the Passion of Christ !!!  And you’ll make me believe that not him nor any other writers wouldn’t have said one word about that and make any link whatsoever with the Passion ?  It’s simply ridiculous to even think that as a possibility.  In fact, it’s completely out of context. And 2- You want real facts ?  How about the fact #9 of my recent paper ?  Can you please go reading again this most important fact ?  When that will be done, can you please give me a rational explanation for the FACT that, in the very same manuscript, Damascene is talk about the Image of Edessa (which was for him an image of only the face of the living Christ) in link with the Abgar legend in one place, and in another complete different part of the manuscript, he’s talking about all the known relics of the Passion of Christ and, while making a list of these, he refers to the burial cloths of Christ (in the plural) while he make no reference at all concerning the Image of Edessa and/or the Abgar legend ???  This FACT is, for me, one of the most important that exist in ancient manuscript that clearly show 1- that the Image of Edessa was a different relic than the Shroud of Christ (often associated with other burial cloths) and 2- that the Image of Edessa had nothing to do with a relic of the Passion of Jesus-Christ.\nIsn’t that enough clear for your brain Max ???  What do you need now to understand that Wilson’s hypothesis is as good as Dan Brown’s hypothesis concerning Mary Magdalene and Christ ?

It scarcely derogates from the soundness of Wilson’s argument in response to Cameron.  \nIf I interpret Max correctly, at #15, 2/, I think he is identifying the Mandylion with the Manoppello relic, but that it is NOT of a “not made with human hands” icon, but in fact a man-made copy of the sindon image.  From what little I’ve read of Manopello, I’m inclined to concur that it is indeed a man-made icon, and that the face geometry is a close fit with the sindon image.  However if the Mandylion was in fact a separate object from the sindon, then another case can be made for it having been with other relics hoarded in Paris and destroyed during the French Revolution, and that Manapello may be yet another different copy.     \nComing back to the sindon:  If it is indeed the burial cloth of Christ dating from the 1st century, and there are several reasons supporting its authenticity as we all know, then it had to be located somewhere.  Unless one is to believe the ancient Abgar story, which looks increasingly unlikely because of Edessa reverting to paganism, then its most likely first destination after 68 AD is Antioch, where the Apostolic church first became established.  Possibly it was taken there as early as 47 AD.  But it could not have remained in Antioch much after 525-540 AD, because of its destruction by a great fire, two earthquakes, and finally Persian Chosroes I, invaded all of Syria and destroyed Antioch in 540.\nThe Abgar legend may have its roots in the conversion of Abgar the Great, around 190 AD, and the subsequent establishment of Edessa as a major Christian center.  The sindon and/or a copied icon, may have been taken to Edessa for a brief visit from Antioch at this time, giving rise to the story.  So we have the destruction of Antioch no later than 540, and the emergence of the Edessa image in 544 AD, at the time of Chosroes’ abortive attack on Edessa.  All of this is comprehensively traversed in two papers presented at conferences by Jack Markwardt in 1998/99 and 2008.  Both papers are well documented and properly referenced, the most recent one at: http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf .  Similarly the other can be found by checking out the 1998 conference. \nThe Shroud and other icons could not have been preserved in Edessa after 1146, when it fell to Turkish Muslims.  The most likely explanation is that it was taken from there by John Curcuas, the Armenian-born commander of the Byzantine army in 944.  \nWhere else could the sindon have been: Armenia? St Catherine’s monastery at Sinai? Ephesus? All unlikely, and there’s no case to be made for them! Nevertheless, Icons apparently based on the sindon image, appeared all over churches in the Middle East, even as far as Armenia and Georgia. Early in the fourth century, the easterns discovered what happened to relics when they were revealed to Helena, they ended up at the imperial court, where Constantine made a talismanic bridle for his horse from one of the crucifixion nails.  There was good reason not to reveal the whereabouts of the sindon and other holy images.  \nIt is hardly surprising that the whereabouts of the Shroud has remained an enigma for so many centuries.  However it is an enigma on which the likes of Ian Wilson, Jack Markwardt, and various others have been able to shed some illuminating research, which they have approached industriously and comprehensively, from the purest of motives.  Any comparison with the likes of the charlatan Dan Green is utterly odious.\n\n","date":"July 19, 2012 at 12:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13970","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers","post":"Very well said DaveB, I agree with most all you state, but especially with your last paragraph.\nThanks,\nR\n\n","date":"July 19, 2012 at 5:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13992","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers","post":"Dave bwnz wrote: “If I interpret Max correctly, at #15, 2/, I think he is identifying the Mandylion with the Manoppello relic, but that it is NOT of a “not made with human hands” icon, but in fact a man-made copy of the sindon image.

I dedicate this quote particularly to Ron, who seem to be a pretty good fan of this very suggestive (in consequence, not very scientific) hypothesis !!!  You can find this quote in page 1 of Meacham paper.  Note : the context is that of an infamous speech given by Jackson in Turin, where he was defending the 2002 restoration…  Here is the quote : “I merely cut out of his speech (note: he talks about) a vague and meaningless bit (even more meaningless after translation into Italian), PLUS SOME WAFFLING ON ABOUT HIS 8-FOLD THEORY THAT HE THINKS CHALLENGES THE C-14 DATING (A TOTALLY LAUGHABLE NOTION).”\nNote:  If you have a good brain, it’s easy to see that Meacham completely disagree with this hypothesis of Jackson concerning the dating of the Shroud and, by extrapolation, the Mandylion’s hypothesis…\nComing from one of the Shroud researchers I respect the most in all the Shroud world, that quote was like a bit of fresh air to me !  I said to myself : Now I know why I respect him so much: because he, like me, has no fear to tell what he really think without any political consideration !  I’ve always admired people who tell what they really believe to be the truth and no doubt that William Meacham is one of them.  Sadly, there’s not enough people with balls like that in the Shroud world…  \nAnd the rest of this paper go on like that !  He speaks freely and without any fear and tell us what he think of Jackson’s acting in Turin after the restoration.  I’m 100% convinced that he is one of the few who had the guts to react that way (i.e. publicly, with passion) back then !!!  Bravo Meacham !  Keep on speaking loud and true !!! \nAnd concerning the paper written by Wilson for the Hong Kong conference on the Shroud in 1986 (you can read it here: http://freepages.religions.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wmeacham/wilson1.pdf), it’s interesting to note what he said, near the end, concerning this 8-folds hypothesis of Jackson.  Of course, Wilson defend it, but it’s very interesting nevertheless to note that even a guy like him (who is a king of speculative arguments) had no choice to recognise that, in reality, there is just one of the 8 folds that Jackson claim to see that is really visible on the cloth without any doubt.  \nI’m sorry folks but one evident fold mark present at a distance of nearly 1/8 of the length of the Shroud is far from being a proof (or just even a good clue) that the hypothesis of Wilson concerning the Mandylion is correct (or just to think that the Shroud is really older than the C-14 result of 1988) !!!  Again, this is just a very sad example of a hypothesis concerning the Shroud that rest almost uniquely on speculations, extrapolations and special assumptions in order to, evidently, defend a religious agenda.  \nOf course, this is not at all this way that any good science should be done (in hard science fields like chemistry or physics, as well as other fields like history).  But sadly, in the Shroud science these days, it seem to almost be the norm !!!  I’m sure there’s still some real scientists who work on the Shroud without having a religious agenda hidden in the back of their head, but I’m also sure they form a very thin minority…\n\n","date":"July 24, 2012 at 5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","id":"comment-14186","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers","post":"There’s a little error in the quote from Meacham paper.

(…)Maurus Green clearly state that the first two epitaphios that we know were created for a chapel in the Vatican during the papacy of Pope John VII (between 705 and 707) !!! ”\nActually there are not two original epitaphioi but TWO 17th CE drawings of THE SAME Umbella as recorded by Grimaldi.

Wilson serious doubts whether the Umbella’s appearance via Grimaldi’s two drawings could be genuinely compatible with an 8th c. CE date: the Crucified Yeshua is depicted with a loin-cloth in the Umbella scene.\nNow “in the 8th c. CE and before, the commonest way to depict Yeshua was with him wearing a colobium, or long sleeveless robe as in John’s VII’s time in St Mary Antiqua Rome (see G; Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art) also in the Rabula gospels, also on the wall of Pope John VII’s chapel in St. Peter’s as copied by Grimaldi”.\nYeshua’s loin-cloth iconography only starts c. 1000 CE NOT BEFORE!\n“Besides, there is NO EVIDENCE for the “Veronica” itself (which Veronica exactly since there are couple of them + the Uronica?) -the showing of which the Umbella is said to have ornemanted -having been in Rome BEFORE c. 1000 CE.”\n“According to Grimaldi’s careful archiving, the shrine that housed this “Veronica”, the same shrine the window of which the Umbella ornemanted, bore an inscription ‘Pope Celestine III had this work done in the 7th year of his pontificate (…). Since Pope Celestine III’s pontificate was 1191-98, AGAIN the indications are that the Umbella did not date from the time of Pope John VII (i.e. 705-7 CE), but MUCH MORE LIKELY sometimes around the end of the 12th century CE.”\nCan we still UNCRITICALLY believe Yannick Clément?\n\n","date":"July 25, 2012 at 4:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","id":"comment-14200","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers","post":"Correction: ” Yannick Clémet asking Matt not to believe me”\n\n","date":"July 25, 2012 at 4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","id":"comment-14201","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers","post":"Yannick, \nas far as the “TWO” alleged “8th c.

Beside, it NEVER expressly identifies the Umbella as an 8th c. object. Is it what you call “a compelling proof” beyond any rational doubt?\n2/ There is NO HISTORICAL EVIDENCE at all for the showing of the“Veronica” itself in Rome BEFORE c. 1000 CE. John VII’s side chapel was ORIGINALLY dedicated to the Virgin not to the Veronica.\n3/ “Only” three objects (The Uronica, The Veil of Manoppello and the “Veronica” (that was substituted to the latter in the 17th century CE) can be identified as “THE Veronica” that was kept in Rome. None of them three cannot be confused with the Turin Shroud! (You are just adding up more speculation to your former speculation!)\n4/ THE Veronica that was kept under the pontificate of Innocent III (1198-1216) was officially known as the Sacrosanctus Veronicae Sudarium (Le Sacrosaint Suaire de Véronique) and cannot be confused with Yeshua’s  burial body-cloth. It shall be noticed that the appearance of this Veronica coincided with the disappearance of the Holy Face of  The Holy Mandylion of Constantinople. This Veronica was a fine transparent nearly square Byssus face-cloth 55cm high and 40cm wide.\n5/Threre was then (and still is today) a Byzantine Greek community in Rome.\n6/ The John VII side -chapel Umbella cannot be simply said to be “John VII Umbella” as the Umbella was made to ornementate the window of the Veronica shrine that was built in the 7th year of the pontificate of Celestine III. Since the latter Pope ’s pontificate was 1191-98, this implies that the Umbella was made sometimes around the end of the 12th century CE.\nYour file is and remains TOTALLY empty…\n\n","date":"July 26, 2012 at 6:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","id":"comment-14255","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers","post":"Yannick,\nin spite of your alleged extensive reading on the subject, you STILL don’t know your stuff.
