Which is it?And all that Crispino wrote was: \"Can we assume that when Jeanne de Vergy married Aimon de Geneve, probably in 1357,3 she left Lirey to reside with her second husband in his mountainous domains?\"Crispino's footnote \"3\" does not say anything about Jeanne marrying Aymon. In fact it implies she hadn't yet in 1357. Check it out online for yourself. According to my sources and best estimate, Jeanne married Aymon IV in 1359. But if anyone has any hard evidence that it was in 1357, I will change the Shroud's time at Anthon accordingly.>While the ruined Castle of Montfort is correctly illustrated,Thanks.>the photo of the Anthon Chateau is at Anthon, Isères, not Anthon, Haute Savoie, and is not associated with Aimon de Genève.Thanks, but half-right. I will make the appropriate minor correction. It still could be near the \"Anthon\" in which Aymon IV and Jeanne lived with the Shroud. And far from it being \"not associated with Aimon de Genève,\"as I wrote (does Farey have a reading problem?), it says the chateau was built in 1315 by \"Guichard d'Anthon.\" As I wrote, presumably that was Guichard VI d'Anthon (c. 1278-1320), who was Aymon IV's great uncle. And Aymon's mother Isabelle d'Anthon (c.1307-1335), did inherit Guichard VI's lands and titles through her father, Aymar d'Anthon (1286-1325).So most of the alleged \"mistakes\"  Farey raised were either Farey's own mistakes or debatable. Only the minor point about which \"Anthon\" the chateau was near requires a clarification.That's not worth me wasting my time wading through all the dross on your blog (let alone the personal attacks) to find the odd speck of gold!Stephen E.

Ramm (1916-1992), pointed out that they include \"intellectual riches\" (and \"cultural riches\" too), which are an obstacle to saving faith in Jesus:\"In the Gospels a very wealthy young man refused to make the motions of faith. He was intrigued by Jesus Christ, but when the issue became sharply one of Christ or his possessions, the tug of his possessions was the stronger, and sorrowfully he left Jesus Christ. He wanted religion without the motions of faith. It is not a rash presumption to believe that many scientists and educated men wish for peace of mind, relief from a guilty conscience, hope for the life to come, and the blessedness of faith in God. But they find themselves caught between their science and their religious hopes, unable to move. Being possessed of great intellectual riches which manage to come first in their sentiments, they leave Jesus Christ. Just as Jesus refused to pursue the rich young man and make other terms, so today we cannot lessen or cheapen or alter the terms of the gospel for our men of science. There is no other Saviour than Jesus Christ, and there is no other means of having Him than by the motions of repentance and faith. Therefore, if a scientist comes to God he must come in the same way as any other person comes to God. He must make the appropriate spiritual motions. He must repent; he must confess his sin to God; he must believe in Jesus Christ with all his heart.\" (Ramm, B.L., 1955, \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture,\" p.245).Jesus also added at the end of His parable above, that those who are prepared to give up their \"great possessions\" to gain Him, \"will receive a hundredfold\" in this life \"and will inherit eternal life\" as well!

This would help increase its Google PageRank number and so enable those who are Google searching on \"the Shroud of Turin\" to more readily discover my blog. Thanks.\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"March 13, 2015 at 4:36 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2015/02/locations-of-shroud-turin-shroud.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nLocations of the Shroud: Lirey c.1355 - Chambéry 1471: Turin Shroud Encyclopedia \n","post":"\n\nOn the International Skeptics Forum thread, \"Miracle of the Shroud II: The Second Coming\" Hugh Farey wrote on 13th March: >I have recently read a comment by Stephen Jones on his website referring to my remark, in which he calls me a liar and asks me to apologise. I did NOT ask Hugh to apologise to ME. I regard asking for apologies as a mark of weakness and my long-standing practice has been to NEVER ask for apologies.I only suggested (not ASKED) that Farey: \"should apologise to your fellow `critical thinkers' on the forum you made them, correctly stating my theory in my previous comment above.\">Putting aside the \"yeti/'Squatch/human hybrid\" nonsense, which I hope nobody took seriously, Why write it then?>he says specifically that he does not propose that there was \"a sleeper agent put in place to protect the secret.\"As Farey well KNEW. So it was a deliberate LIE on a forum where most (if not all) would not know what I did propose. >He says that: \"A sleeper agent is A SPY WHO IS PLACED in a target country or organization, not to undertake an immediate mission, but rather to act as a potential asset if activated.\"That is not what I say - it is what WIKIPEDIA says. >But he believes that: \"Arizona radiocarbon laboratory physicist Timothy W. Linick (1946-4 June 1989) was allegedly the primary hacker, who: 1) allegedly wrote and installed on Arizona radiocarbon dating laboratory's AMS computer a program which ensured that the Shroud of Turin samples' actual radiocarbon dates would be replaced by dates which, when calibrated, clustered around 1325; and 2) allegedly passed that program on to the KGB, for which he was allegedly working, to be installed by confessed KGB hacker Karl Koch (1965–3 June 1989) on the AMS computers at Zurich and Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratories.\"Farey should have stated this from the outset. But I give him credit for quoting my words stating my theory eventually.>I am happy to make clear the distinction and apologise unreservedly for any confusion.I also give credit to Farey for apologising to the Forum members for misleading them. >He also says that: \"I am NOT \"totally alone in\" in my theory that the 1325 +/- 65 radiocarbon date of the Shroud was a result of a computer hacking. At least two prominent Shroud pro-authenticists have emailed me privately that my theory may well be true. Later I regretted the \"At least two...\" as `gilding the lily'. It was only two, but they ARE \" two prominent Shroud pro- authenticists.\"[continued]\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"March 16, 2015 at 12:56 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2015/02/locations-of-shroud-turin-shroud.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nLocations of the Shroud: Lirey c.1355 - Chambéry 1471: Turin Shroud Encyclopedia \n","post":"\n\ncontinued]>And I am sure that some of the 60+ readers a day of my blog provisionally agree with my theory. But it is early days and they are understandably reluctant to publicly agree with it.\"From memory I have had no comments on my blog disagreeing with my theory. If commenters on Dan Porter's blog are disagreeing with it, I am not aware of it, because I haven't read his blog's posts or comments since 8 May.>I have no wish to upset anybody, least of all Stephen,I regard this as a LIE (unless it is self-delusion). From the outset of my commenting on my theory on Porter's blog, Farey has gone out of his way to PERSONALLY ATTACK me:1) On Porter's blog Farey on several occasions PERSONALLY ATTACKED me, casting doubt on my mental state, which was one of the main reasons I left Porter's blog.2) Farey sent early comments of mine on Porter's blog WITHOUT MY PERMISSION to Profs Jull and Ramsey, Directors of Arizona and Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratories. Which backfired because their unexpectedly prompt replies contained evidence for my theory!3) Farey FALSELY accused me of linking the Pope with Satan, when they were my entirely separate comments on Shroud news items.4) Farey wasted no time in attacking me and my theory in only his second issue as Editor of the BSTS Newsletter.5) In (4) above, Farey omitted to mention that I had scanned back issues #1-42 of the BSTS Newsletter for Barrie Schwortz to add them to his online archive, when it was highly relevant in the context for Farey to do so. I regard that OMISSION AS DELIBERATE by Farey.6) Farey's LYING comment on the above Skeptic's forum is just part of a pattern of personal attack and denigration of me and my theory by Farey, which I expect will continue.>who is a tireless worker on behalf of the Shroud,Farey regards the Shroud as having had \"an accidental 14th century origin,\" so WHY WOULD he think it was good that I am \"a tireless worker on behalf of the Shroud\"? From his EXTREME ANTI-AUTHENTICIST position he must regard all pro-authenticists (including me) as wasting their time at best and being hopelessly deluded enemies of the truth at worst.>and am happy to be corrected.Now that he had been found out!The point is that AN HONEST PERSON (at least in Shroud matters) COULD NOT have posted what Farey did, when he thought no one on that forum would know that his comments were a LIE.Stephen E.
