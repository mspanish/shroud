[{"title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie","post":"Yeah, this makes total sense. Were the positioning too perfect it would be a signal against authenticity. \nBut I think you drew that one green line of the dorsal image too far down. I’m thinking it should be a tad closer to the edge of the cloth (still an asymmetrical orientation). Aren’t the toes visible above that line? Being a smaller image than I’m normally used to looking at you may have included them but I know they are definitely there on the shroud. \nThe toes being present on the dorsal image does make me wonder if the shroud was tied in some way because if Jesus was laying on his back in the tomb, as we suppose, I imagine the cloth would have to have been held up against the soles of his feet somehow in order to get the image. Was there a foot rest in the tomb or was the shroud tied like in the Jackson hypothesis?\n\n","date":"June 4, 2012 at 11:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/yannicks-nice-surprise-folding-test-on-the-enrie/","cat":"history","id":"comment-11897","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie","post":"Chris, you’re maybe right about the precision of my green lines…  Like I said in my text, those lines were done approximately because 1- The real edge of the feet are not easy to see on a positive photo of the Shroud and 2- I did it pretty fast.  But, nevertheless, as you also said, even if the real edge are located a bit more up or down, that wouldn’t change the fact that the 2 images are non-symmetrical.  That’s the real important thing to note, because it is a very good clue that point toward the fact that the Shroud was a real burial shroud of a crucified man and not some kind of forgery done by a genius…\n\n","date":"June 4, 2012 at 12:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/yannicks-nice-surprise-folding-test-on-the-enrie/","cat":"history","id":"comment-11903","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie","post":"This subject should probably be a new post.

It is quite obvious the body was not placed central (lengthwise) on the Shroud. The green line at the feet of the dorsal image is way off anyways. As it is and has been proposed the dorsal, lower part of the Shroud was brought over the feet, hense we get the full foot marking including the toes, with space below. I mentioned something to this months ago in a debate with Colin over image size discrepencies. Guess it’s another one of those points that go unnoticed!. Anyways to truly understand the folding of the Shroud one should watch the BBC documentary; Material Evidence, reported by Rageh Omaar and  Produced by David Rolfe. In the documentary they have a clip with Dr Jackson et.al showing how THROUGH YEARS OF STUDY they have come to the most likely method in which the Shroud was wrapped. After one views this demonstration the question of a ‘forgery’ will definately be dismissed, especially in accounting for the blood markings being on the Shroud previous to the image.\nI believe the clip with the Jackson demonstration can be viewed on Youtube, whilst I’m not sure it has been licensed.\nR\n\n","date":"June 4, 2012 at 6:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/yannicks-nice-surprise-folding-test-on-the-enrie/","cat":"history","id":"comment-11916","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie","post":"This comment sound like someone jealous !

That’s why it’s the most important line.  The other 2 green lines were just put there rapidly by me to show approximately the edges of both feet for a better understanding of my argument.  The fact that those 2 lines can be off-track a bit is not important at all regarding my reflection, because it’s not those 2 lines that prove that the body images are non-symmetrical versus the length of the cloth.  On the contrary, it is the green line near the middle of the cloth that is THE proof of this non-symmetrical aspect of the body images (because it’s not located at the same exact spot as the red line in the center of the cloth).  That’s why we could remove the 2 green line near the edges of the cloth and my argument would still be as valid as it is now !  \nI’ll repeat it : The heart of my argument is not found in these 2 green lines near the edges of the cloth but in the green line near the middle of the cloth !!!

I am extremely interested in the shroud and have been following the research for a number of yours.  I most definitely believe that it is the burial cloth of Christ (though a nonbeliever) and that the image was formed by some inexplicable event.  I accept that it might have been a side effect of the Resurrection—why not?–but I WOULD very much like to know how the image was formed in physics terms, however it was implemented.  I appreciate these articles and these comments as shedding more light on the developing evidence.  \nI just finished reading Wilson’s last book, where he updated the history.  I see a reference at this site  to Dreisbach.  Was it he or someone else who found references to the shroud in the Acts of Thomas?  This would appear to be extremely valuable historical evidence, even if it does not date to the first century, yet I seem to find little written about it.

You can read it here :  https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/please-dont-forget-the-evidence-of-the-bloodstains/\nIn it, I was mentioning that because it is a proven fact now (especially because of the particularities of the blood) that the Shroud was not created with some kind of artistic method, there’s only 3 different possibilities that are left open regarding the image formation on the Shroud.  Then, after reading some comments, I realised that, in fact, I should have separate one particular possibility in 2 in order to be clearer.  So, I thought it would be a good idea to post them here (you’ll understand why at the end of this comment).  Here’s the only 4 possibilities that can explain the Shroud of Turin, considering that the option of an artistic forgery is completely excluded :\n1- It is a real burial shroud of someone who suffered the same tortures than Jesus, but who is not Jesus of Nazareth.  In fact, it is a forgery produced by a forger (or many forgers) “naturally” (without using any art technique) while using a real human being.  And because of the great resemblance of the bloody and body images with what happen to Jesus in the Gospels, we must assume that this forger (or forgers) did it in order to produce a false relic of the Passion of the Christ.  We also have to assume that this forger (or forgers) took the dead body out of the shroud before it start to corrupt there, in such a way that this extraction of the body from the shroud never disturbed the bloodstains, never broke the linen fibrils under them and never disturbed the body image.\n2- It is a real burial shroud of someone else than Jesus of Nazareth who suffered the same tortures than him and was produced accidentally by some undetermined natural phenomenon(s).  In other words, this is not a forgery but instead, an accident of nature.  In this scenario, we must assume that a person or a group of persons, for some obscure reason, took the dead body out of the shroud before it start to corrupt there, in such a way that this extraction of the body from the shroud never disturbed the bloodstains, never broke the linen fibrils under them and never disturbed the body image .\n3 – It is the real burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth and was produced by some undetermined natural phenomenon(s).  The fact that the body left the Shroud before starting to corrupt there can be related or not with the resurrection.  In other words, in this scenario, it is not completely clear if the resurrection had something to do with the bloody and body images.  Nevertheless, even if this scenario involve a natural creation of the body image of Jesus, the fact that the extraction of his body from the shroud never disturbed the bloodstains, never broke the linen fibrils under them and never disturbed the body image, can be seen as a possible sign of a “dematerialisation” of his body at the moment of the resurrection.  To conclude this point, there’s one thing very important to note : If it’s true, a scenario like that, involving some kind of natural phenomenon(s) related to the body image formation, cannot be taken by the sceptics as a proof that Jesus did not resurrect, because in the light of the all the facts we known, a manual extraction of the body out of the shroud seem to be highly improbable.\n4- It is the real burial shroud of Jesus-Christ and was produced by some undetermined supernatural action directly linked to his resurrection.  In this scenario, a “dematerialisation” of his body at the moment of the resurrection could explain the fact that no bloodstains was disturbed, no linen fibrils under them was broken and no body image was disturbed.\nNow, if we go back to the little clue given by the non-symmetrical aspect of the 2 body images on the Shroud (versus, at least, the length of the cloth), I think it is fair to say that this observation (along many others that would be too long to mention here) is a very good clue to say that the option #1 describe above is UNLIKELY.  At the very least, let’s say that there’s not much room left open for this option (the only one involving a forger) to be true !!!\nAgain, this deserve some thoughts.  SINCE IT’S SURE THAT THE SHROUD IS NOT AN ARTISTIC FORGERY AND IT’S ALMOST SURE THAT THE SHROUD WASN’T MADE BY A FORGER USING A DEAD BODY, that lead us to an important question that is, in fact, THE question concerning the Shroud :  IF THE MAN OF THE SHROUD IS NOT JESUS, THEN WHO IS HE ???\n\n","date":"June 5, 2012 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/yannicks-nice-surprise-folding-test-on-the-enrie/","cat":"history","id":"comment-11948","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie","post":"“Material Evidence, reported by Rageh Omaar and Produced by David Rolfe.
