The Prey manuscript is a fairly typical “Three Marys” and the ivory above is an “Entombment.” We have recently seen several examples of the “Man of Sorrows,” and there are, of course “Crucifixions,” “Depositions” and “Resurrections” among others. The general layout of these types seems fairly rigid, and sometimes a misunderstanding of the epitome give rise to absurdities, such as the ridiculously sloping coffin lid upon which the angel sometimes perches in “Three Marys” paintings. Does anybody know of a work (Belting perhaps or Shiller?) which gives a ‘family tree’ of these styles? It would be good to see whence and when each one appears to have originated. From what I gather, “Entombment” icons preceded “Man of Sorrows” icons, which seem to have derived their right-sided spear-wounds and crossed wrists from them. Some icons seem to have derived from sermons delivered by particularly notable worthies rather than directly from the bible, but I’m not sure about the authority there is for that. Some people, including the early church fathers, thought that the Pantocrator derived from the pagan image of Zeus, and condemned bearded, long-haired Jesuses for that reason.

Most of the so-called Vignon markings are stylistic variations of earlier models dating from before the time of Christ, or reflections of contemporary hair styles. As I commented on an earlier post, some later Pantocrators do have a distinctively odd wavy brow ridge and downward nose loop which does not seem artistically relevant, and perhaps someone more au fait with Byzantine art can say what it symbolises. I do not think it derives from the Shroud, however, as the most distinctive bridge-of-the-nose irregularity is the famous open square between the eyebrows, which is completely ignored in favour of some barely visible triangles except in one single example, the St Pontianus wall painting, whose artist can hardly have had the Shroud before him as he worked.\nAnd I’m sorry, clublu22014, that I do not see the “obvious miracle” that you do.

And that’s fine. (…)\nI insist the problem is conceptual. \nWe arbitrarily choose fifteen features that never go together. Six or seven how much. (Why not the ears? Because the ears are ever present in the Byzantine iconography of Christ but not in the Shroud).\nSome of these features are not clearly visible either in the Shroud or in the Byzantine iconography. Some people see them but other people don’t see them.\nWe enlarge arbitrarily the rank of our survey. For example, we accept the Pantocrator of Taüll but not the Pantocrator of the Cristo de la Luz of Toledo. Why? Because we think the first accomplish (??- I doubt a lot) some Vignon Marks and the latter not a single one. How long the influence of the Shroud reached ? How? These are some important points to an historical hypothesis never specified in this case.\nWe made some arbitrary interpretation from a blood stain to a lock of hair, but we discard some pictures when the lock of hair doesn’t correspond to any blood (St. John the Baptist). These pictures will be an evident refutation or our hypothesis.\nThe more common features (10, 11 and 13) are present on a lot of portraits, even long before to the alleged date to expansion of the (non recorded) presence of the Shroud in the Byzantine Empire. \nAnd so on , and so on. \nWith this non rational method we can match the Venus of Milo with the Demoiselles d’Avignon. “Squirming”? May be. I don’t know this word.\n\n","date":"May 12, 2014 at 9:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/08/might-the-av-ivory-have-been-the-inspiration-for-the-pray-manuscript/","cat":"history","id":"comment-117793","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Might the A&V Ivory have been the inspiration for the Pray Manuscript","post":"Mike M\nMay 12, 2014 at 7:25 am\nYour answer to OK was scandalously lacking of any criteria you used to declare 20 similar features were “scandalously” insufficient for comparing two images. \nYou are in a mistake.

Jesus beardless and with the short hair was an icon that persisted till the first centuries of the Middle Age.

This has no necessary relation to the Shroud nor the actual appearance of Christ but to some theological conventions. Jesus with a beard and long hair was assimilated to the philosophers and Wisdom. Jesus beardless was the symbol of the Life.\nCf: Chavanne-Mazel, Claudine A.: “Popular Belief and the Image of Beardless Christ”, Visual Resources, Vol 19, nº 1; 2003; p. 19-24.
