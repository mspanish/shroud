Doubtless they can provide more detailed information about it if so inclined.  Its dimensions, identity of the coats of arms, its material and other aspects would be of considerable interest.  Its provenance and dating are obviously critical to its identity.  Max includes the note that a similar impression of the figures is apparently on the Coudray tower. \nIan Wilson includes a colour plate of Templars Molay and Charnay being burned at the stake taken from a British Library ms (plate 28c in “The Shroud” 2010),  If the colour plate is a moderately realistic representation, then both men appear beardless and also tonsured.\nIf the badge can definitely be connected to the Templars, it would seem to add some little weight to Wilson’s theory that the Templars were at least aware of the Shroud image. \nTo me, the left-hand image appears to have a face and is therefore intended as a frontal image; I cannot discern a face on the right-hand image, and presume it may be intended as a dorsal view as represented on the Shroud.  An alternative explanation might be that if they indeed are connected to the Templars, they might represent the two Templar victims, although I tend to favour a Shroud-like image representation. \nIf the figures are indeed frontal and dorsal views, then it seems highly unlikely that they can be seen as anything else but a representation of some intended connection with the Shroud image,  There is nothing else like it which it could otherwise represent,    \nAny potential the badge might have for creating a rubbing or any other kind of copy is an irrelevant distraction from whatever else its true significance might be, assuming that it’s a genuine article.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/colin-berry-historybod-a-tale-of-two-meanings/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10741","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry, Historybod: A Tale of Two Meanings","post":"Just an interesting note about this medal :  DId anyone noticed the herringbone weave on the cloth ?

the Charny medal evidently struck by Geoffry de Charny & Jeanne de Vergy to commemorate the Lirey showings of the Shroud.  Hence I’d said that I hadn’t been aware of it, and I’d inferred it was a separate object.  Ian Wilson of course mentions it in both his 1978 & 2010 books.  As Max says at #9, it is of course well-known.  I had been led astray by the comments referring to Templars Jacques de Molay & Geoffray de Charnay.  But it is curious that the face does seem to be beardless – perhaps it is just meant to be representational, with just a few of the Shroud features included – disposition of the body image, suggestion of herring bone twill etc.  It also seems curious that a representation of the image is apparently on the Coudray Tower where de Molay was imprisoned in 1308.  I wonder if there are any clues as to when the Coudray image might have been done and who might have done it.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/colin-berry-historybod-a-tale-of-two-meanings/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10777","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry, Historybod: A Tale of Two Meanings","post":"Shall I repeat here the same naked figure is only a frontal image with no long hair, no beard and no moustache?\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 5:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/colin-berry-historybod-a-tale-of-two-meanings/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10780","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry, Historybod: A Tale of Two Meanings","post":"The naked-Chirst graffiti stone was to be read in conjunction with a vandalized graffiti commonly known as the De Molay stone (most likely carved by the Templar chapelain, Johan du Galub) between June and  September 1308.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/colin-berry-historybod-a-tale-of-two-meanings/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10783","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry, Historybod: A Tale of Two Meanings","post":"The templar chapelain went to Chyprus once.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 5:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/colin-berry-historybod-a-tale-of-two-meanings/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10784","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry, Historybod: A Tale of Two Meanings","post":"I succeded to identify him in a Templar prosopography (sorry for the Greek-rooted term)\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/colin-berry-historybod-a-tale-of-two-meanings/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10785","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry, Historybod: A Tale of Two Meanings","post":"Correction: “at least once”\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 5:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/colin-berry-historybod-a-tale-of-two-meanings/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10786","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry, Historybod: A Tale of Two Meanings","post":"I read that Johan du Galub probably carved the De Molay stone that was vandalized and that there was a separate carving of the frontal image of a naked beardless man.

If du Gulub also carved the naked man, (or whoever did it), it would seem that the person may have heard about the Shroud image (its nakedness) but possibly not seen it because he carved it beardless,  It is curious that anyone should carve a frontal naked man ~1308 (++?) unless they had heard about the Shroud image.  Put that together with the naked beardless image on the Lirey medal and we have a curious set of coincidences.\nAnother hypothesis might be that the Coudray tower image of the naked man, might have been intended to represent Jacques de Molay if it was carved after 1314 when he was burned at the stake.
