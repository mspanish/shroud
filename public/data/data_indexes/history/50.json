[{"title":"Comment:  The real history is nothing like what Christians believe . . .","post":"The historical Jesus was a Jewish prophet who was crucified by Roman soldiers sometime between 30 and 33 AD. In all probability, Jesus was buried in an identifiable tomb, rather than in a common grave for criminals. This detail is historically significant because of an historical event, the Resurrection, and an artifact, the Shroud of Turin.  \nThe Resurrection occurred within a few years of the crucifixion, and can’t be explained in terms of any other historical event because the followers of Jesus founded the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church rose to political power in the 4th century, and produced Western Civilization. When the Catholic Church lost its influence in the 18th century, the wars and genocide of the 19th and 20th centuries followed. \nThe Shroud of Turin is a long piece of linen with a mysterious image of Jesus showing the blood marks from the crucifixion nails, whipping, crown of thorns, and stabbing, as reported in the gospels A heretical Christian sect probably created the image in the 1st or 2nd century with methods that have been lost to history. \nThe faith response to the historical Jesus is to believe that Jesus is alive in a new life with God and that if you follow Jesus the same good thing can happen to you. The historical Jesus includes an accounting of those who believe in Jesus, those who don’t, and those who think believing in life after death is irrational. One of the reasons I believe in Jesus is that those who think faith is irrational tend to be ignorant of the cosmological argument for God’s existence, unintelligent about the mind-body problem, and irrational about the meaning of life.\n\n","date":"August 7, 2013 at 11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/07/comment-the-real-history-is-nothing-like-what-christians-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40654","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment:  The real history is nothing like what Christians believe . . .","post":"Quote: “A heretical Christian sect probably created the image in the 1st or 2nd century with methods that have been lost to history.”\nQuestion:  Why would this hypothesis of yours should be more probable than the idea that it is the real crucified body of Jesus of Nazareth who produced this image?  \nSub-questions:  If your hypothesis was right, than why history would have also lost the name of this heretical sect who would have created such a false relic at the same time it would have lost the method they used to make it?

The estimate of the age of Jesus was about 33 years of age, which makes the year of his birth 3-4BCE. I unfortunately cannot cite the specific evidence for this off the top of my head, but I believe my statement to be correct. \nYour post makes the following claims\n” Jesus was buried in an identifiable tomb, rather than in a common grave for criminals”. \nThis is of course stated in the gospels, and I believe the site of burial was provided for by Joseph of Arimathea.\n“This detail is historically significant because of an historical event, the Resurrection, and an artifact, the Shroud of Turin”\nYou speak of the resurrection as an historical event. There is not one iota of historical evidence that such an event occurred. This is a theological precept that has no place in academic historiography. The story goes, depending on which gospel you read, that  when Jesus’ disciples approached the tomb, the stone had been rolled away and the tomb was empty. An “angel”appeared to them and told them that he had risen ( I am paraphrasing here). These are articles of faith, not history.  By definition, faith is a belief, without any evidence to support it. It is an emotively based phenomenon, not founded on any physical scientifically reproducible evidence. The rising of a human being back to life after clinical death just does not happen. The changes that occur immediately after death occurs, precludes the return to life, no matter who the individual is. One can believe what he or she wishes to believe, however, the reality remains and has been the same throughout time. The story, in my and others view, is made up, by those who had an interest in maintaining calm and preventing political unrest after the execution of Jesus. Those would have been the Sanhedrin, specifically Caiaphas. They presumably did not want Jesus’s tomb to become a shrine, a place to rally and further the Jesus movement. A more plausible and more likely scenario could have involved  two or more priest novices (who were traditionally dressed in white robes), sent by the Sanhedrin (Caiaphus), to remove the corpse during the night (who else could have gotten past the Roman soldiers guarding the tomb, and gotten help in removing the heavy stone in front of it). Then, they taking the corpse into the Negev desert, left it there to be devoured by wild dogs.(1) They then advised that his body had risen from the dead; a story easily accepted by the illiterate peasants that made up most of Jesus’ followers. The resurrection story sounds idealistic not realistic and I submit to you and others that it historically never happened. \nSecondly, the Shroud of Turin as a historical icon. I agree that it is indeed that, but not necessarily what believers claim it is. It is indeed controversial and I myself am not well versed in it per se. However, couple of comments. \nThere is a great deal of disagreement in the lay community regarding the age of the shroud itself. It was dated by Radiocarbon 14 dating, performed at three separate academic centers, independent of each other. The date of the shroud was dated to the middle ages, roughly the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating is a way of determining the age of certain archeological artifacts of a biological origin up to about 50,000 to 75,000 years old. It is used in dating things such as bone, cloth, wood and plant fibers that were created in the relatively recent past by human activities. The more recent the artifact the smaller the confidence interval, that is to say, the range of dates of which the mean is the date given to the artifact. It was developed by one of my professors at UCLA and remains to this day, as far as I know, the main method of dating organic artifacts. It is accurate enough that one can rely on its results with a fairly good confidence interval. There are academics, or purported academics who would challenge that statement, however it remains the mainstay of dating biological material artifacts. The fact that three independent prestigious academic centers independently dated the shroud to the middle ages, suggests very strongly that it was created during that time period and not long before or after, despite all the obfuscations of those who disagree with it.  Secondly, the image on the shroud, however it was formed has the image formed by an individual of a stature of 5 feet 10 inches. This itself is an unusual  stature for men of the first century CE, where the common height of a man was about 5 feet one to three inches. Had Jesus been 5’10” one may assume some scriptural reference to his stature, as it would be highly unusual. It would coincide more with the height of someone of the middle ages, and even then, this person would have been considered tall.\n“The Resurrection occurred within a few years of the crucifixion, and can’t be explained in terms of any other historical event because the followers of Jesus founded the Catholic Church”\nI believe you misstated years for days. I am not sure what you meant by the second part of your statement, however I refer to my statement above regarding the resurrection. I for one, do not subscribe to supernatural or mystical statements as evidence, as it does not provide one iota of physical evidence that an event occurred. Again, people don’t become alive again after they die for the clinical reasons cited above. It is again a matter of faith, which I see as a belief based on emotive (emotional) responses, not factual, evidence based historical events. I will not go into the history of the Catholic Church as its foundation is based on a restricted set of beliefs that coincided roughly with the theology of the majority of Church fathers in the fourth century to suit their theology. It left out those writings that did not meet the specific theological criteria of those few individuals. In fact any one who disagreed was excommunicated and in a few instances killed.\n“When the Catholic Church lost its influence in the 18th century, the wars and genocide of the 19th and 20th centuries followed. ”\nI doubt very much that the “genocidal wars” which you mentioned, (American and French Revolutions? Nepoleonic Wars?, American Civil War?, WWI?, WWII?) had any thing to do with the decline of the influence of the Catholic Church. There is not one shred of evidence these are in any way connected.\n“The Shroud of Turin is a long piece of linen with a mysterious image of Jesus showing the blood marks from the crucifixion nails, whipping, crown of thorns, and stabbing, as reported in the gospels A heretical Christian sect probably created the image in the 1st or 2nd century with methods that have been lost to history.”\nThere is no convincing evidence that what you claim is correct regarding the shroud. It is a piece of linen, with the image of a man 5’10”, who appears to have wounds consistent with scourging, and wounds to the ankles and wrists. The fact that the wounds to the ankles and wrists are evident is historically interesting. If one was crucified by the use of nails (some victims were tied to the cross), then the nails or spikes would have been placed through the ankles (there is a specimen of the calcaneous (ankle) extant that is the remains of a 20ish year old male from the first century with spike through it as a result of crucifixion). Additionally, the spikes were not placed in the hands but through\nthe wrists, as the hands are not capable of supporting the weight of the body. That evidence in itself does not suggest that this is the shroud of Jesus, far from it, especially in light of the independent C14 radio dating. \n“The faith response to the historical Jesus is to believe that Jesus is alive in a new life with God and that if you follow Jesus the same good thing can happen to you. The historical Jesus includes an accounting of those who believe in Jesus, those who don’t, and those who think believing in life after death is irrational ”\nYou are showing your bias here as a believer. Therefore you cannot dispassionately argue on the historical evidence and mix that with your beliefs in the theology which I suspect you were raised with and is emotionally, not factually or scientifically, driven. To say that those of us who rely on physical evidence for the historicity of events as they really occurred and do not subscribe to the religious belief that you and other Christians subscribe to as irrational, is motivated by your emotion and perhaps lack of understanding of the scientific method.\n“I believe in Jesus is that those who think faith is irrational tend to be ignorant of the cosmological argument for God’s existence, unintelligent about the mind-body problem, and irrational about the meaning of life.”\nAgain, I am not sure what you mean here, it is somewhat of a rambling statement that obviously is motivated by your emotional need to believe those religious precepts that you have been taught. It is very difficult to stand back and look at the physical evidence without a jaundiced eye if you are religiously inclined to accept certain stories as fact. Unfortunately many of those “facts” do not stand up to historic and scientific scrutiny.\nHaving said everything I have said. I mean to argue against your statement from an academic point of view and do not mean in any way to demean the beliefs you may hold. I have respect for your beliefs. However when making statements, you have to be ready to provide evidence and defend your position. The burden of proof lies with the individual who makes the claim. That proof must rely on hard, reproducible, falsifiable evidence (Popper).\nSincerely, A.

Effectively, there was still no public Christian sanctuary, no public Christian church or cathedral, no public Christian pilgrimage place, etc. and the Christian religion was not perceived very well by the authorities throughout the Roman empire, whether they be Roman or Jewish.  In such a bad context (which was accompanied by sporadic persecutions from time to time), why such a Christian group would have gain in creating such a false relic of Jesus-Christ?  That makes no sense to me.  I have studied this subject intensively and came out to the conclusion that the only possible period of time in which a false relic of the Shroud of Christ like the Shroud of Turin could have been created is between the Edict of Milan of 313 A.D. and the apparition of the first Pantocrator icon, around 500 A.D. and I must add that such an hypothesis is very improbable because, among other things, in order to accomplish that feat, the real body of a crucified man was necessary and we all know that very few crucifixions done with the standard Roman method were done during that period of time…\n\n","date":"August 7, 2013 at 2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/07/comment-the-real-history-is-nothing-like-what-christians-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40670","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment:  The real history is nothing like what Christians believe . . .","post":"\nYannick Clément :\n  But again, the fact that he wasn’t even sure it was Jesus and the fact that in another letter he was clearly talking about artistic depiction of Jesus make it highly improbable that what he saw was the Shroud of Turin…\n\nYes, and neither I believe this was the real Shroud.

I have no doubt that Jesus’s followers experienced his resurrected presence, whatever that precisely was. \nThe FACT is that we have Paul, someone who was a strong opponent of the Jesus movement, converting within just a few years of Jesus’s death.\nWe know from Paul’s letters that he had a vision of Jesus. We also know that he attests to over 500 witnesses to Jesus’s resurrection. His account is not just based on a subjective vision that might have been a hallucination, but is also backed up by accounts of direct witnesses. Now, Paul was a pretty matter of fact guy, a pretty credible witness, and very intelligent. And he attests to those witnesses, ‘many of whom are still alive’ – in a very matter of fact way. This IS a historical account.  \nWe also know that Paul emphasized the spiritual, non-material aspect of the resurrection, rather than a bodily resuscitation. You assume that Christianity is based on the revival of Jesus’s physical body. Now some Christians clearly believed that, and do today, but Paul didn’t, and neither do I!  \nAnd what of the women witnesses. I know it is a cliche. But the fact remains that a made up story in first century Palestine would have hardly been likely to make up women witnesses to the resurrection. \nI have had a number of experiences in life that defy rational explanation. I am a PhD with an IQ of over 150. I realise that these experiences, and my Christian belief, defy atheistic and rationalistic belief. But all I know and experience is all I know and experience. I live by that knowledge and experience, and am compelled by it.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2013 at 7:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/07/comment-the-real-history-is-nothing-like-what-christians-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40728","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment:  The real history is nothing like what Christians believe . . .","post":"Albert, one last thing. You said:\n“The real history is nothing like what Christians believe what happened. The modern story is a construct that has been embellished by supernatural and fantastical events through the millennia, by hundreds of believers who added them for their own purposes, never mind the translational mistakes that occurred..”\nThose are big statements, without much evidence, and are in fact wrong. Most of the recorded events  of Jesus’s resurrection were recorded within 50 years of his death. Paul wrote some accounts within 20-25 years.\nCertainly, church traditions have evolved through the millennia. But the accounts in Paul’s letters, and the gospel accounts, which form the basis for the faith, were recorded in close temporal proximity to the events.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2013 at 7:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/07/comment-the-real-history-is-nothing-like-what-christians-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40729","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment:  The real history is nothing like what Christians believe . . .","post":"I just want to react about one statement made by Albert in his long comment above: He said: “You (David) speak of the resurrection as an historical event. There is not one iota of historical evidence that such an event occurred.”\nI want to say this to Albert and anyone else:  You are right!  On a pure scientific base, there is not one single proof that the Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth really occurred.  BUT…  There are tons of solid historical evidences that all of the closest followers of this prophet of Galilea were completely convinced (so much that some of them gave their life for this belief) that he was really resurrected.  \nNow, it’s up to anyone to believe their claim or not.  And in the end, who cares?  If you don’t need God in this earthly life, that’s fine.  But if you need him, the testimony of these early followers of Jesus can truly give you a great hope to go through life.\nLast thing:  Even if I agree that the Resurrection of Jesus cannot be proven as an historical event, the burial cloths found empty on Easter morning and the tomb itself found empty the same day have to be considered as real historical events since no one (not even the ennemies of the Christians like the Jews or the Romans) during the first few centuries after Jesus’ death ever denied these findings (at least, as we know of from ancient sources).  On the contrary, most people who did not believe the claims made by Jesus’ followers ended up thinking that it was them who had stolen and hide the corpse and then claimed he was resurrected.  This should be enough a good clue to understand that the empty burial cloths and the empty tomb were not an invention of Jesus followers.  A set-up made by them?  Some can think this, but the bottom line is this:  2000 years ago or so, on Easter morning in Jerusalem, the burial cloths and the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth who had died less than 48 hours earlier were found empty.  Now, it’s up to anyone to explain this historical fact the best he can.  In my mind, there are two main way to explain this:  1- You believe the claim made by Jesus’ followers.  Or 2- You believe the rational explanation of the ennemies of the Christians (i.e. the disciples came at night, they took the corpse and hide it somewhere and then claimed Jesus was resurrected).\nI think this summarize pretty well the historical reality of the account of Jesus’ resurrection.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2013 at 10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/07/comment-the-real-history-is-nothing-like-what-christians-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40744","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment:  The real history is nothing like what Christians believe . . .","post":"To Yannick,\nThe idea that you are explaining anything by believing that Jesus is alive in a new life with God is a mistake.

I KNOW that every one of them will end up in Heaven anyway…  Salvation doesn’t depend on our present faith or on our good deeds.
