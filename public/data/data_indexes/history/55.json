It followed a company of US paratroopers from the US to England to combat in Europe to peace. When the paratroopers were getting ready to board their aircraft for their Normandy jump, there was an interchange between a US Trooper and an Aussie over a German Luger the Aussie had and the GI thought the Aussie was giving it to him as the gift. The language and the minds didn’t meet. Having been raised singing Waltzing Matilda and totally bummed out by On the Beach, I was surprised by the “pure” Aussie dialect employed by the writers of Band of Brothers for that sequence. It really was unintelligible to these stateside ears. \nSide note on the the JFK thing. When Oswald was in Russia everybody in the interior  took him for a native Russian but with a Leningrad accent. Pretty good trick for a HS dropout who self-taught himself Russian listening to phonograph records. Somehow I kind of doubt it. I have nephew who was military attache to the American Embassy in Moscow for  a part of his career. He was a Rhodes Scholar with an Oxonian degree. He ended up speaking Russian quite well but he didn’t do it by listening to phonograph records in a barracks. He had months of personal instruction. Russian, I am told is difficult for English speakers because it doesn’t have the common German, Latin admixture that English has.That Oswald, must have been a genius.\n\n","date":"December 26, 2013 at 10:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/25/did-jesus-talk-funny-and-when-was-he-born/","cat":"history","id":"comment-68281","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Talk Funny and When Was He Born?","post":"I don’t recall seeing “Band of Brothers” specifically, although like most when young I did go through a bit of a war film phase, more particularly popular war histories, Douglas Bader’s “Dam Busters”, history on Gen Rommel (he had great respect for Kiwi soldiers and Gen Montgomery in the Western Desert), Colditz Castle etc.\nEven in Australia, there are variations in local speech patterns, Queenslanders have their own variations from Sydneysiders, and in NZ, Southlanders have inherited a Scottish burr. \nI attempted both elementary Russian, also Dutch, when young, and still have some of the texts I used (Fourman, University of Kiev).

For a good historical perspective, I can only recommend John P Meier’s “A Marginal Jew”, specifically Vol 1, and also Pope Benedict XVI, “Jesus of Nazareth”. Meier sets a stringent discipline for himself, specifying some five criteria in his selection of facts he is prepared to accept. He concludes that Jesus was born about 7-6 BC, most probably in Nazareth, rather than Bethlehem, was baptised by John in 28, and accepts John’s version that he died on Preparation Day, making the year either 30 or 33AD.  He opts for Friday, April 7, 30AD, at age about 36 years old.  \nThe Last Supper is to be seen as a farewell meal, rather than a Passover meal, although there are some calendrical variations that might allow it to be a Passover meal. In John’s scenario, the crucifixion occurs while the Paschal lambs are being ritually slaughtered at the Temple, making the timing particularly poignant. \nMeier considers that the brothers and sisters mentioned in Mark’s gospel are blood-siblings rather than opting for other patristic explanations, the perpetual virginity of Mary being a late doctrine of the 4th century. I believe that adoption might offer an alternative explanation, as adoption was a widespread practice in those times, because of high mortality rates resulting in many orphans, and adoption conferred the same rights as birth under both Jewish and Roman law. \nWe need to keep in mind that the gospels were not intended to represent history in the style of Josephus, notwithstanding that the gospels draw on actual historic events. Each one of the evangelists has his own agenda, with the intention of proclaiming Jesus variously as Messiah, the Son of Man (c.f. Daniel), and Lord. Raw Mark tends to tell the crude bare facts as he sees them, Matthew sees Jesus as the new Moses and is writing for a Syriac congregation, seeking to bring in Gentile elements, Luke has his own agenda and is most obviously anti-Jewish, while John is more elevated, identifying Jesus as the timeless Son of God, and totally in control of his destiny. \nAll of the evangelists have a most remarkable familiarity with the ancient scriptures which they use to an astonishing degree to bolster their message. \nI repeat, each of the evangelists has a specific agenda of proclaiming, and the message is more important than the literal text. Remember too, that Jesus was following a strong tradition of conveying his message in parables, and much of what we read in the gospels is itself intended as parable. Perhaps this is the best and only way of communicating deep and profound truths of great significance.\n\n","date":"December 26, 2013 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/25/did-jesus-talk-funny-and-when-was-he-born/","cat":"history","id":"comment-68558","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Talk Funny and When Was He Born?","post":"Daveb,\nDid you ever read Garry Wills: What the Gospels Meant?

They are too complex to summarise easily here. About half the book comprises citations, notes and references. Nevertheless he is sparing in his acceptance of apocryphal source. \nFor deciding what comes from Jesus as distinct from early Christian tradition he proposes five primary criteria:\n– 1. The criterion of embarrassment: Why invent what would invite difficulty for the early church?\n– 2. The criterion of discontinuity: Why reject as words or deeds of Jesus what cannot be derived from the Judaism of Jesus’ time or the early church?\n– 3. The criterion of multiple attestation: Is it more plausible to deny words, sayings, or deeds attributed to Jesus in more than one independent literary source (e.g., Mark, Q, Paul, and John) or literary genre (e.g., parable, miracle story, or prophecy)?\n– 4. The criterion of coherence: Given the claims to historicity from any of the above criteria, are different sayings or deeds evidently inconsistent?\n– 5. The criterion of rejection and execution: If Jesus’ ministry came to a violent, public end, what of Jesus’ words or deeds could have alienated people, especially powerful people?\nThe criteria are to be used in tandem for mutual correction. Still, any claim is only to the probable, not the certain. \nI concur that the earliest assertion as to Mary’s perpetual viginity is the James Protevangelium ~145AD, but it was not accepted as doctrine until very much later. It is also the source that asserts that Jesus’ siblings were from a previous marriage of Joseph. Meier rejects this on the basis that the Greek word used for sibling is “adelphos” rather than “anepsios”, implying a direct full sibling relationship. The James source is first mentioned by Origen in the early 3rd c. “which was of recent and dubious appearance”, sharing some common ground with the “Gospel of Peter”. It also asserts certain Jewish practices for which there is no other evidence. As I previously mentioned, I believe that adoption would be a credible alternative, would admit the term “adelphos”, and it would reflect the generous spirit of Mary and Joseph. \nNote that at Matthew 1:20, the Angel tells Joseph not to be afraid to take Mary his wife into his home. I see that as potentially undermining the traditionally accepted doctrine. i.e. Joseph may take Mary as his wife. \nFurther comment on the distinctions between the individual gospels: When does Jesus become God? For Mark, it is when the Holy Spirit descends on him at his baptism by John in the Jordan; For Matthew and Luke it is at his conception; But for John, it is from the beginning, before time ever was. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God (distinct?) and the Word was God (identical?)” The mystery  of the Trinity already!\n\n","date":"December 27, 2013 at 4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/25/did-jesus-talk-funny-and-when-was-he-born/","cat":"history","id":"comment-69164","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Talk Funny and When Was He Born?","post":"One of the problems with this blog, and possibly its strength, is that all opinions are treated equally and contrary authorities easily trashed equally. Thus Gary Wills and John Meir are both cited and then renounced.\nMaybe Garry Wills is too much a popularizer  of religion for some  tastes. But no one can deny that John Meier is a very serious scholar. He started out two write a three volume history of Christ and now he’s working on volume five with no end in sight. I have found N.T. Wright helpful but he writes hundreds of pages to every dozen for Wills.\nWe are in a very blessed generation. For nearly two millenia the Shroud has been among us but its lessons were undecipherable until unlocked by Secondo Pia’s camera and the thousands of hours of scientific study that have ensued.\nI believe that the demonstrated facts square with the Gospel accounts and create a positive  feedback. Excuse the following sentence in all caps. THERE IS NO OTHER HISTORICAL EVIDENCE OF CRUCIFIXION OF ANYBODY THAT MATCHES WITH FACTS OF THE SHROUD OTHER THAN JESUS CHRIST. Please, no speculation. We have a name and we have time established, by the way, by  a pagan Roman historian – Tacitus.\nThe Shroud is a Revelation, that the proposition is not entirely devoid of reason that perchance it is THE  Revelation. Christ is being brought to us by the scientists in their white lab coats. \nAs anybody noticed that the four horseman are loose again. The again, they seemed to have been loosed on most generations.

After all, what can be deduced from the Gospels is that the Resurrection was a less historical event, but isn’t that sufficient for a historian or should it be left to those in the field of psychical research to decide? \nAs for Crossan, I did read his lengthy book on the Historical Jesus for review. How can one who believes that Jesus’ dead body was eaten by wild dogs be considered a Christian? Only as an Unitarian, perhaps. I once questioned the editor of a Protestant magazine about the decision to interview him, where he was presented as the world’s best Jesus scholar! That was obviously said in order to sell as many magazines as possible — the money line again! — and the editor told me that Crossan still had faith.
