[{"title":"Evidence of the Resurrection?","post":"Scepticism about the resurrection of Jesus is quite common today, be it among theologians or among laymen. Some theologians refer to the event in a sense that is not traditional, there are churchmen who are vague when it comes to definition and there are those laymen who pretend they believe in it when in fact they don’t.\nWhen Jesus is not buried in Talpiot( east Jerusalem)\n https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III\nhis remains are to be found in Kashmir (north India):\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7893085/The_Quest_for_Jesus_in_Shroud_research\nBoth theories have hidden agendas.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 4:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/evidence-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"history","id":"comment-144392","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Evidence of the Resurrection?","post":"No bones were found in the ossuary marked Jesus at Talpiot!

Puech. The body of a crucified person was never brought into a family tomb, it would have to be buried alone for the “earth of Israel” to purify the bones of sin. The documentary kept quiet about this.\nThe James ossuary, which jokingly came to be called the “Protestant hoax”, was on the list of Discovery’s Top Ten Hoaxes, the IAA returned the bone box to the owner without authenticating the second part of the inscription.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 6:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/evidence-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"history","id":"comment-144412","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Evidence of the Resurrection?","post":"When did the “single most studied object in human history” claim surface, and is there any truth in it at all?

The latter satisfies the Vignon marking fans better than any eastern possiblitilty.\nIf research was widened then the Shroud might win out , but certainly not yet when much of the so-called research is simply repeating the same old points. The only new info. in Habermas’ lecture was the AD30 radiocarbon date and even that looks like turning out to be a red herring.\nI think we should concentrate on the areas where no research has yet been done!\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/evidence-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"history","id":"comment-144409","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Evidence of the Resurrection?","post":"From the article: Several findings indicated that the Shroud’s images were from Israel and apparently in the spring of AD 30 due to the identification of 28 species, 20 of which grow specifically in Jerusalem and the other 8 within a 12 mile radius of Jerusalem, and with a common blooming time of March and April which would have been around the Passover, the time that Jesus was crucified.\nHow much of this has been verified?\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 11:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/evidence-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"history","id":"comment-144477","author":"Julian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Evidence of the Resurrection?","post":"Part of the conflict can be traced to the “brits” laughing at what the “yanks” had seen on the Shroud while turning a blind eye to what some of their own members also claimed to have seen. Just have a look at the older issues of the BSTS newsletter.\nYes, T. Litt questioned some of the findings by U. Baruch but his methodology was in turn dismissed by A. Danin. He had used a powerful, confocal lens, not removed and washed the grains for examination, and did not publish anything. \nThe result;A.Danin stands by what U.Baruch said he discovered.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2014 at 8:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/evidence-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"history","id":"comment-144538","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
