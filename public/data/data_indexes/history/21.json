[{"title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Jack Markwardt on the History of the Turin Shroud","post":"I know of three papers by Jack Markwardt, all of which I have found a fascinating read, and all annotated with footnotes and citations.  \nIn the first of these, “Antioch and the Shroud”, presented at the Dallas conference of 1998, he expounds his theory that the Shroud was taken to Antioch in apostolic times, with supporting argument.  \nHis second paper “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” presented at Ohio in 2008, he develops this theory further but with more detail.  He believes it had a role in the conversion of the court and household of Abgar VIII the Great, involving Bishop Marcellus Avercius of Hieropolis, during the reign of the emperor Commodus and pontificate of Pope Eleutherius; that the event was recorded as a coded allegory in what came to be known as the Doctrine of Addai, later the Acts of Thaddeus; and is reflected in the Bardesanic “Hymn of the Pearl”; that the Shroud was returned to Antioch, was hidden in the wall there to be later rediscovered, the basis of the legend that it was found in a wall at Edessa;  that with the impending destruction of Antioch, by earthquake and Persian invasion, that it was then taken to Edessa about 540AD. \nThe third paper written in 2001 is on a different topic altogether, “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD” and closely examines the Chevalier & Thurston’s attempt to misrepresent the D’Arcis memorandum.  \nURLs for the three papers are respectively:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf  \nI shall be intrigued to discover what Jack has to say about the Shroud’s history in his latest paper for the St Louis conference.\n\n","date":"June 16, 2014 at 5:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/16/anticipating-the-conference-jack-markwardt-on-the-history-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-129949","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Jack Markwardt on the History of the Turin Shroud","post":"There is more by Markwardt:\nWas The Shroud In Languedoc During The Missing Years?\nhttp://www.shroud.com/markward.htm\nThe Fire and the Portrait\nhttp://www.shroud.com/markwar2.htm\nTHE CATHAR CRUCIFIX: NEW EVIDENCE OF THE\nSHROUD’S MISSING HISTORY\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markwar3.pdf\n\n","date":"June 16, 2014 at 5:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/16/anticipating-the-conference-jack-markwardt-on-the-history-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-129952","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Jack Markwardt on the History of the Turin Shroud","post":"Will the presentations be available for the public to view if one is not able to attend the conference, maybe via Youtube or a set of CD’s?\n\n","date":"June 16, 2014 at 10:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/16/anticipating-the-conference-jack-markwardt-on-the-history-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-129985","author":"Chesterbelloc","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Jack Markwardt on the History of the Turin Shroud","post":"The papers will eventually be on a separate site from the conference site.
