As the atheist pope, Richard Dawkins pointed out in one of books, circumstantial evidence can be more reliable than direct evidence of an observer. \nFingerprints have been used to identify individuals with as many as few as 1`2 points of comparison. The issue resolves to probabilities. How probable is it that two items would have the same identical points?\nThere comes a point when the circumstances are sufficient to change the burden of proof. That is, the burden is on the skeptic to offer facts that contradict the conclusion, not simply hypothesize as to what could be. This is the problem of the Shroud deniers. Once you establish the points of similarity to the Gospel accounts, taking into account the variances in the four Gospels, it is not enough to say maybe it was someone else. You have to answer if not him, who?\nAs far as the Pray Codex is concerned, we have several points of comparison. It is clearly a shroud.

Doesn’t seem like much, but the Shroud didn’t just get there in 1204.  It is most likely the same cloth that arrived in 944.  The point is simple.  The carbon date is wrong.  How wrong?  No one can say.  Does it prove it to be first century?  No. But it does prove the carbon date is wrong.

I’m a bit lost here. If you mean that the sepulchre lid, which is shown in almost identical orientation in dozens of similar images before and after the Pray manuscript, and which bears a number of concentric zig-zag patterns emanating from at least six centres around its perimeter, “is clearly a shroud,” then I beg to differ. If you mean the untidy pile of cloth dumped on the lid, which spreads out towards the angel’s feet and is marked by ‘X’s and two wiggly red lines along the hem, then I concur. However, I have to say that neither of these is sufficiently similar to the Turin Shroud to “prove the carbon date is wrong.”\n\n","date":"September 21, 2013 at 2:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/21/so-is-that-the-shroud-of-turin-depicted-in-the-hungarian-pray-codex/","cat":"history","id":"comment-44994","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So is that the Shroud of Turin depicted in the Hungarian Pray Codex?","post":"Russ, 100% agreed,.

Indeed, arguably none of the similarities in their own right can argue for the link in a compelling sense. It is the collective weight of the multiple similarities that presents a compelling case.\nI think a point I’ve made elsewhere is very relevant. In the 1100s, without the 1532 fire burn marks, the L shaped poker holes would have been conspicuous – and that provides a good reason why they would be shown in a depiction such as the Pray Manuscript – especially if they held some symbolic meaning, perhaps a meaning supporting the shroud’s holy status as a relic that can defy destruction.\nSince the fire in 1532, the L shaped holes, although clearly observable, became less conspicuous.\nSo, in the first known painted copy of the Shroud from 1516, prior to the fire in 1532, the poker holes take a prominent place in the depiction. In later depictions the prominent fire burns from 1532 are depicted, but not the poker holes. \nThis, I think, addresses the question from some skeptics as to why the Pray Manuscript artist would depict the L shaped holes, seemingly meaningless features. They were depicted because at the time the artist worked they were conspicuous features of the shroud and probably held some meaning.\n\n","date":"September 22, 2013 at 4:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/21/so-is-that-the-shroud-of-turin-depicted-in-the-hungarian-pray-codex/","cat":"history","id":"comment-45055","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So is that the Shroud of Turin depicted in the Hungarian Pray Codex?","post":"I agree, when looking at the 1516 copy, the poker holes are extremely prominent probably because the image itself is so faint as to create a striking contrast.  We see in later copies of the Shroud after 1532, the various artists make a point of painting the burns and patches.  So it stands to reason that artistic renderings of the Shroud prior to 1532 would include the poker holes which is why we see it on the HPM and therefore proof of the HPM’s genesis.  Those holes are not random.\n\n","date":"September 22, 2013 at 9:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/21/so-is-that-the-shroud-of-turin-depicted-in-the-hungarian-pray-codex/","cat":"history","id":"comment-45084","author":"Shroud Encounter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So is that the Shroud of Turin depicted in the Hungarian Pray Codex?","post":"yes the holes make no sense as random elements, nor as decorative elements ( they might if they were repeated).\nAnd I think they make no sense as apertures either. I acknowledge there could be an alternative explanation, but after much thought about this I am at pains to think what that could possibly be! \nAssuming the holes on the shroud were in existence in the 1100s and therefore highly visually prominent when the HPM artist viewed it, it is entirely logical that they would have assumed some symbolic significance to drive their artistic representation. This is especially so when there is already a symbolic aspect to the lower image, with the floating letter, and the head next to Mary’s sleeve.\nThere might be symbolism in the HPM image along the lines of the shroud representing both the worldly and human aspect of Jesus and worldly objects(the holes and the blood streaks) and the otherworldly and divine (the crosses, the head of Jesus next to Mary’s sleeve representing an intermediary between death and resurrection state). I acknowledge this is pure speculation, but it’s fun!!!!\n\n","date":"September 23, 2013 at 4:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/21/so-is-that-the-shroud-of-turin-depicted-in-the-hungarian-pray-codex/","cat":"history","id":"comment-45160","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So is that the Shroud of Turin depicted in the Hungarian Pray Codex?","post":"I’d love to see an image of the Shroud less the 1532 burn marks. but with the poker holes, are there any out there?

It is one of the earliest “Three Marys” I’ve come across (about 1130 or so), and reputedly made in Jerusalem, for the Queen of Jerusalem. As such, the illustrator had a better chance than many accurately to depict the holy sepulchre as it then was. Following the earliest traditions, the tomb is shown as an upright door, and the “stone rolled away” is presumably the square block upon which the angel is sitting. Later (Western, apparently) tradition adopted the box-like tomb, and the tilted lid for the angel to sit on. Where this came from I don’t know, but the illustration before the Three Marys in the Melisende Psalter shows the Harrowing of Hell, where the dead are emerging from boxes rather than doors.\nPoints to note are the appearance of the marble tombs – reddish, and with irregular Xs to depict the marbling; and the shroud and headband, which appear to be transparent. There is also the pointing angel (with a sensible four visible fingers) and the white grid under the cloths, which appears in one or two 12th century images before disappearing for ever.\nAlso relevant, but not terrible helpful so far (to me anyway) are the “Angel’s Stone” and the “Stone of Unction” which are in the church of the Holy Sepulchre to this day, which may be the origin of some aspects of the illustrations.\nI think that out of context, the similarities mentioned in so many posts might lead me too to suppose that the Pray manuscript is evidence of the contemporary existence of the shroud, but the more I find new (to me) illustrations of medieval psalters the less I am convinced.
