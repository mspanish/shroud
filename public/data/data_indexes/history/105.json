No wonder it hadn’t gone off!  And any old cloth from Israel could be swaddling clothes or the robe or some other cloth sacred by contact.

You don’t know, until you examine it. Do not give a verdict before a trial.\nNote Calvin’s comment: “How they obtained this milk they do not say.” Why not? What had they got to hide?\nCalvin was rather not interested in, say ,”technical details”, like overhelming majority of sceptics are not. They just want to ridicule, in their opinion, naive and superstitious items. No one would go and trace their origin -slandering is much easier than gaining evidence. Usually the sceptics and anti-catholics have more to hide, and obscure the truth, which often (like in the case of “bloodthirsty Inquisition”, Dead Sea Scrolls hidden by the Vatican, alleged antisemitism of Pius XII etc.) turns in the favor of the opposite group.\nWhy didn’t they say how they had obtained this milk? I don’t know, there may be various reasons, ignorance to its exact origin (fueling anti-Catholic myths) being one of them.\nHowever, let’s look at the other examples, how the relics were obtained:\n*the Crown of Thorns (essentially a wreath of reeds) was obtained by Louis IX for 135 000 golden livres (the entire Sainte Chapelle costed just 40 000)\n* The relics of the True Cross were recovered by the emperor Heraclius in 628 after deadly war with the Persians.\n* The Image of Edessa was brought to Constantinople in 944, at the ransom of 10 000 pieces of silver, and release of 200 muslim prisoners.\nIsn’t it much cheaper and esier just to make a “factory” of faked relics, if forgeries were so common in the Middle Ages, as popular and often repeated (with no justification) stereotype claims?\n\n","date":"May 8, 2014 at 5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/08/more-on-the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus-never-have-preconvictions-about-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-114860","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the Letter from Alexius Comnenus:  Never have preconvictions about relics","post":"Calvin was just one among others to be cynical about relics, but he also caused a lot of suffering for millions of people for generations with his doctrine of predestination which was used to justify slavery, even apartheid in South Africa.

The link says it has been a site for veneration since the 4th century, fragments from the cave being sent to churches in Europe since the 7th century. Perhaps the cave limestone is the origin of the purported “milk relics”. There is a kind of closure that limestone dust was found on the Shroud cloth by STURP in 1978. \nThe legend has it that a drop of the Virgin’s milk spilled on the rock turning it white during the flight into Egypt fleeing Herod’s soldiers.  I wonder if it is the same kind of aragonite limestone on the Shroud. \nThe only record of the story of Herod’s slaughter of the infants is to be found in the infancy narrative of Matthew’s gospel, and nowhere else.  Some exegetes see the story as merely a means of getting the family into Egypt as Matthew wants to portray Jesus as the new Moses (and thus coming out of Egypt), and he does this in several ways. (e.g: Matthew has Jesus preaching from a mountainous place like Moses, whereas Luke has him preaching from flat ground).  It also helps Matthew to get the family into Nazareth, (because of Archelaus) as Matthew did not know that they were Galileans originally from Nazareth, as did Luke know. I’m aware that Egyptian Christians take the Flight story seriously, and I’ve heard that there are various sojourn sites of veneration there accordingly.\n\n","date":"May 8, 2014 at 6:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/08/more-on-the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus-never-have-preconvictions-about-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-114904","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the Letter from Alexius Comnenus:  Never have preconvictions about relics","post":"Correction: The web-site has it that the rock is soft chalk not limestone, and hence not aragonite.\n\n","date":"May 8, 2014 at 6:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/08/more-on-the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus-never-have-preconvictions-about-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-114906","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the Letter from Alexius Comnenus:  Never have preconvictions about relics","post":"Dave, you are correct.
