[{"title":"A comprehensive new theory detailing a medieval origin for the Turin Shroud: a scorching onto linen – and human consciousness – of the last of the Knights Templar.","post":"Here is a comment, or rather a semi-hysterical diatribe, that has just appeared from “Ron” on the Other Site:\n“Well Colin if you disregard those comments on C14 especially as you claim to be a scientist/chemist, then I would say you are either blinded by bias or a fraud. There have been many other archeologists that have commented the same and agree with Hawass’s statement. Any scientist, archeologist, anyone who has dealt with radiocarbon dating would agree with those comments. It is a true fact that RCD is error prone, highly subseptable to contamination and ‘based’ on some voodoo mathematics, not to mention relies on “basic assumptions” regarding c14, c12 levels prior to the 1950s…this is fact Colin, not stories or assumptions.\nPeople like you now have to deal with the ‘FACT’ that the 1988 RCD is INVALID and scientifically speaking have no argument against the authenticity of the Shroud. All you can do now, since you’ve failed to replicate the image attributes in any form, is try to nit-pic at studies that have been done by some with maybe far more knowledge then you, which sorry to say seems pathetic to me.\nThanks for coming out.”\nOdd, isn’t it,  how the true-believer single-issue internet sites can generate these instant experts in specialist technology – when the latter delivers the “wrong” answer, yet bandy around the “right” answers as if battle trophies.\n I personally try to avoid confrontations with these internet amateurs, not because I consider myself an expert (least of all on the fine detail C-14 dating protocols, while understanding the broad principle) but because one is on a hiding to nothing. One can do the research, point out the error, and nine times out of ten there is either no response, or a change of subject (“what about the blood stains?” or “what about superficiality of the image?” ,,,  ad infinitum, ad nauseam. ). Nope, I have no intention of wasting my time on other people’s denialism, aka flat earthism.\nWhat I will say is this: firstly, it was not the 3 labs who made that crazy decision to sample from one corner only. That was foisted on them at the 11th hour by a so-called scientific adviser whose name I shan’t repeat here, but who managed to keep it off the final multi-author paper. If people don’t like the answer, then they should stop casting aspersions at the integrity of the 3 labs, and lobby Turin to have the analysis repeated, using a better sampling frame.\nFinally, I have to say I find this nitpicking on the C-14 dating not just unseemly, but intellectually dishonest if the truth be told. Imagine the result had come back- confirming the Shroud was 1st century AD. Imagine then I or someone else had questioned the reliability of the methodology. It’s not difficult to guess the response of the Rons of this world – the type who casually sticks the charge of “fraud” on someone who blogs under his full real name, with a solid track record in experimental science. It would be “tough titty, that’s the science chum, you cannot argue with the science, you are not entitiled to comment on something outside your own speciality..  bla bla bla”.\nIt is knowing that would be the response of flat-earther Ron and his ilk that I respond to his systematically biased advocacy here on my own site, where I can say what I want, within reason, without having Dan Porter the OberGruppenFuhrer vetting all my comments, and/or blocking some as has happened in the last day or two. \nDan’s “Shroud of Turin” site is a slick operation to continue marketing the Shroud as an unsolved mystery, and no doubt to keep the cash registers ringing in the States and elsewhere. I  have no more time (or patience) for Dan Porter’s site\n","date":"April 28, 2012 at 12:05 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/a-comprehensive-new-theory-that-provides-medieval-origin-for-the-turin-shroud-a-scorching-into-linen-and-human-consciousness-of-the-last-of-the-knights-templar/","cat":"1532_chambery_fire","id":"comment-226","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"A comprehensive new theory detailing a medieval origin for the Turin Shroud: a scorching onto linen – and human consciousness – of the last of the Knights Templar.","post":"Copy of exchange with “bmoon1” on yeserday’s DT article o the teaching of history:\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9229379/Pupils-failing-to-study-British-history-at-school.html#comment-512815103\nbmoon1 replied to you\nThe shroud is that of Jesus Christ.\nThe hand weave of the cloth is very important.  France did not hand weave at the time you would have everyone believe the shroud was dated; France used looms.  The hand weave of the shroud coupled with the particular design of the weave is typical of linen weave in the First-Century in the Middle East.\nThe linen contained pollen from plants found only in Turkey and Palestine.\nThe linen shows a clear imprint of a Roman coin.\nThe blood imprints on the wrists and ankles show the stakes piercing at these points, rather than the wrongly believed hand and feet piercings.\nThe face shows clearly Sephardic features.\nThe carbon dating sample was not done on the main body of the linen; the fabric used was not representative of the entire shroud.\nFinally, the fold of the shroud is also unique to that of the Middle East in the First Century.\nEverything completely fits in with the shroud being removed by the disciples and hidden in a cave.  From there it was taken to an early church and then stolen by Turks.  It was stolen from the Turks by a Frenchman in the 1300’s and from that point we have always known of it’s whereabouts.\nI do not know why you would wish everyone to believe your incorrect and baseless claims.\n•19 hours ago\n• Pupils failing to study British history at school\n2 people liked this \nYou replied to bmoon1\nNaturally I have seen each and every one of those arguments before, and while contributing to Shroudie blogs – like Dan Porter’s – have refrained from comment. Why? Because few if any of those arguments are scientific ones, capable of being tested scientifically. That does not mean they are mistaken – simply that they are non-scientific, and, if the truth be told unscientific.\nMy starting point was to attempt to reproduce the image characteristics of the Shroud by means of scorching (direct contact with a hot metal bas-relief template) to demonstrate its superficiality, negative light/dark reversed character, encoded 3D information, all of which I have demonstrated and reported on my sites over a period of several months.\nThe next step was to think of a rationale for why anyone would go to the trouble of imprinting a scorch onto linen in the medieval era, which looked hopeless to start with, until I came across the Lirey pilgrim’s badge.\nThe rest as they say is history – medieval history! All those points you raise are what we boring and tedious old science bods, including this retired one, would describe as ‘special pleading’ – with a search for facts purely to support preconceptions. The scientific approach is to collect and appraise facts that are not driven by preconceptions – except maybe as temporary working hypotheses – while admitting in my case to an irritable response to being bombarded by others’ preconceptions (ENSA’s “miraculous flashes of uv light”), and then thinking to oneself “Hold on a minute, there’s something not quite right here. If it looks like bullsh*t, smells like bullsh*t, then it probably is bullsh*t…”\n•19 hours ago\n• Pupils failing to study British history at school\n1 person liked this \nYou replied to bmoon1\nI’ve been puzzling that first point of yours for the last 24 hours – thus the tardy reply – and have to say I think you are somewhat confused about weaving. Inasmuch as mechanized looms did not appear till the 18th century, then it was always “hand-weaving” before that. But that still required a loom – it would be virtually impossible to do any kind of weaving – at least for more than a square inch of two – without some kind of loom. Even the ancient Egyptians used looms to weave.\nSo there is really no case to answer re your weave point – the Shroud would have been hand-woven on a loom whether it was first or 14th century. As for the herringbone twill, I’m amazed at the authority with which folk talk about weaving practices in Biblical times. Where are the samples from that era stored that one can go and examine closely?\n","date":"April 28, 2012 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/a-comprehensive-new-theory-that-provides-medieval-origin-for-the-turin-shroud-a-scorching-into-linen-and-human-consciousness-of-the-last-of-the-knights-templar/","cat":"1532_chambery_fire","id":"comment-224","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"A comprehensive new theory detailing a medieval origin for the Turin Shroud: a scorching onto linen – and human consciousness – of the last of the Knights Templar.","post":"Try googling…  shroud turin knights templar… I’m feeling somewhat humbled right now, but in a strange way quietly elated.

That makes important the date 18th March 1314 when the last of the Templars’ worthies – Jacques de Molay and Geoffrey de Charney, were hideously slow-roasted at the stake on a small island in the Seine.\nIt’s the story behind it (see title above) that is important, or rather what ensued, which in my humble opinion, based on a close look at the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge, recovered from the Seine close to the execution spot, has evaded the grasp of generations of historians and TV documentary makers.\nYes, the Lirey badge does depict bishops (with heads broken off) displaying the fabled Shroud of Turin. But the man on the Shroud looks nothing like Christ, and indeed looks for all the world like a man who has been roasted.\nSorry Ian Wilson et al, but you have missed a lot of detail on the Lirey badge. No, it was not an “open tomb” between those two coats of arms. It was a barbecue – with a grill top -for roasting Templars.\nThank you DT for providing an opportunity for promoting my out-of-the-box theory for what inspired the Turin Shroud.\nSee my most recent blog post on a medieval origin for the Turin Shroud (which fits with the C-14 dating).”  Link to this site\nColin Berry, retired science bod (who maintains that the Shroud image was scorched onto the fabric – akin to branding livestock with a hot iron)\n","date":"April 27, 2012 at 7:23 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/a-comprehensive-new-theory-that-provides-medieval-origin-for-the-turin-shroud-a-scorching-into-linen-and-human-consciousness-of-the-last-of-the-knights-templar/","cat":"1532_chambery_fire","id":"comment-214","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"A comprehensive new theory detailing a medieval origin for the Turin Shroud: a scorching onto linen – and human consciousness – of the last of the Knights Templar.","post":"Postscript to the above comment: immediately after placing that comment on the DT editorial, my comment was wiped (not even replaced with a “Guest – comment deleted).
