[{"title":"No bogus Shroud of Turin here. Huh?","post":"A reporter from the Cincinnati Inquirer, shown around Chartres by a guide, Anjali Janakiraman, quotes (http://www.cincinnati.com/travel/stories/072003_travlede.html):\n“It’s not probable that it was worn by Mary, because the cloth has been dated to probably the 7th century,” said Janakiraman.”\nNovelist Kate Mosse writes (http://www.katemosse.co.uk/index.php/kates-books/labyrinth/labyrinth/chartres/):\n“The Chartres Cathedral reliquary was opened during the French Revolution and a robe, 6.4 metres in length, was discovered. It was torn up into 6 or 7 pieces and scattered. Two pieces of the long robe were returned to the cathedral at the beginning of the 19th century. Expert examination has shown the cloth to be about 2000 years old and or Near of Middle Eastern origin.”\nA blogger (http://catholicismpure.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/our-ladys-veil-two-tales/) writes:\n“The veil itself is more than six metres long and made of silk. Scientific studies have shown that it is of Syrian design, of fine quality and can be traced to the first century. If indeed it was the original Veil of Our Lady it has probably been extended and embellished over the centuries.  It had once been depicted as a tunic (Sancta Camisia) but when this was unwound it was found to be a Veil, or a long piece of cloth rather than a tunic.”\nThe best information I can find is a book “Sea of Silk: A Textile Geography of Women’s Work in Mediaeval French Literature,” by E. Jane Burns (try Google Books) which says everything there is to be said about the relic. It’s made of silk and covered in embroidery. She quotes Yves Delaporte; La Voile de Notre Dame, and another source (which Google books won’t give me!) saying that “according to an analysis in 1927, the embroidered cloth is Syrian work from the 8th or 9th century.” And: “More recently, Annemarie Weyl Carr has identified the tiraz-like fabric now called the Virgin’s veil as Byzantine, dating it to the tenth or eleventh century.”\nSadly I suspect that Kevin Stuart Brodie gets his information from “The Kabbalah Code: A True Adventure” by James Twyman and Philip Gruber, which does date the santa camisia to the first century, but is, like all books entitled “a True Adventure,” really not much more than a romantic fiction.\nIncidentally, it appears that the single sheet in your photo above is, in fact, just a dust and light excluder. The veil itself is draped over a bar behind it – Google more pictures to see it.\n\n","date":"August 5, 2013 at 11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/05/no-bogus-shroud-of-turin-here-huh/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40506","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"No bogus Shroud of Turin here. Huh?","post":"What makes the Shroud unique is the medically accurate, yet inexplicable,  image of crucified body in rigor mortis (0-48 hours after death normally) and the blood “residues.”\nTrying to bootstrap other relics unto the back of the Shroud doesn’t work becasue it is truly unique and casts doubt on the Shroud through guilt by association.\n\n","date":"August 5, 2013 at 12:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/05/no-bogus-shroud-of-turin-here-huh/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40512","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"No bogus Shroud of Turin here. Huh?","post":"Update. Kevin Brodie got his information from Rick Steve’s Guidebook, “Paris 2013,” which in turn got it from the doyen of Chartres guides, Malcolm Miller. An email to Malcolm Miller said:\n“I am familiar with E. Jane Burns’s book “Sea of Silk,” which devotes some space to the Camisia, and says “according to an analysis in 1927, the embroidered cloth is Syrian work from the 8th or 9th century,” and also, “More recently, Annemarie Weyl Carr has identified the triraz-like fabric now called the Virgin’s veil as Byzantine, dating it to the tenth or eleventh century.” However, you may know of more recent tests which date it earlier. If so, I should be very grateful for any information you can pass on.”\nThe reply said:\n“Like you I have heard different estimations of the Veil’s age, varying from 1 century BC to 8th.c AD !”\nThat’s a No, then.\n\n","date":"August 9, 2013 at 6:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/05/no-bogus-shroud-of-turin-here-huh/","cat":"history","id":"comment-40804","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
