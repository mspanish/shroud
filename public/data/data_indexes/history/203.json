I missed the ‘Trial of the Shroud of Turin’, yet was able to hear you on The X-Zone 11-17-2010.  It is so true that that you can produce all the fact based data in the world and not reach people that are not ready to accept that which they have categorically rejected.  I respect your level of patience and persistence.\n\n","date":"November 18, 2010 at 2:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/22/trial-of-the-shroud-of-turin-at-newman-university-in-wichita/","cat":"history","id":"comment-1702","author":"Mark Bailets","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Trial of the Shroud of Turin at Newman University in Wichita","post":"In my opinion even if 21st century technologies achieve to obtain an image on a linen fabric with ALL Shroud of Turin’s characteristics that cannot be used either as a skeptical argument or a true pro-authenticity one.\nWhen I wrote ALL I meant all optical physical and chemical properties of the Shroud image on a fabric,ruling out all the purported Shroud fakes namely Shadow Shroud and Garlaschelli’s, because if we go deeper on scientific analysis neither has the chemistry and optical characteristics of the true Shroud.\nBut let me explain my viewpoint:\nIf a medieval forger managed to fake the Shroud of Turin undoubtedly he would have to perform a miracle and skeptics don’t believe miracles that defy laws of nature.\nI agree with Dr.Andrew Silverman’s comment because to duplicate Shroud image scientists got to figure out how the image formed on the cloth and till now scientific theories just approach how the image could possibly form on the cloth.\nBut even if an  image just like the original one  could hypothetically be reproduced by a laboratory experiment it would argue neither against authenticity nor pro-authenticity (because if the Shroud is authentic it’s image originated from a human body… and not from an experiment using some kind of energy acting on a linen cloth to color it’s fibers).\nIf the Shroud originates from the 1st century and an hypothetically 1st century forger by a theorethical unknown technology faked the Shroud, that would be still a miracle, perhaps a bigger miracle, but that’s complete nonsense.\nConsidering the third possibility that the Shroud of Turin has imprinted an image resulting from the projection onto the cloth of ventral and dorsal surface points of a real human body (and that is true from a scientific and forensic point of view)that is an unique event which happened once in all the History of Mankind all facts pointing to that body beeing the one of Jesus Christ.\nLeaving out of discussion here so many other issues I guess will be mentioned on «trial» by Shroud’s attorney the Jury’s verdict can be no other than the SHROUD IS AUTHENTIC.\n               best regards\n          Maria da Glória\n     CENTRO PORTUGUÊS DE SINDONOLOGIA\n\n","date":"September 23, 2010 at 10:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/22/trial-of-the-shroud-of-turin-at-newman-university-in-wichita/","cat":"history","id":"comment-1444","author":"Maria da Glória Gonçalves Barroso","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Trial of the Shroud of Turin at Newman University in Wichita","post":"BAD NEWS: I’m told that this presentation is not going to be recorded.

But the death of Michelangelo Merisi happened in 1610. In the case of the Shroud the Ancient DNA seems to be more difficult to detect and control (and see also : the level of degradation about the DNA and the past claims by Garza-Valdes).\n— — —\nFrankly I am not able to solve the other too difficult questions about the BIF (= Body Image Formation).\nSee for example the three faces of the BIF :\n1) Was the Corpse of Jesus vanished through the nanoholes ? Was the Shroud a result of the emission of the Vacuum Energy ? See also : the claims by Eng. G. Fanti and Dr. P. Di Lazzaro about the excimer lasers and the VUV.\n2) Was the Image obtained applying the Ark of the Covenant (a great mystery of the Bible as energy source) to the Corpse ? See the idea of the Corona Discharge by Scheuermann, Fanti (who believe in the internal origin = from the corpse and not from an external field) and others.\nor :\n3) Was the Image the simple result from the cadaveric emissions (with the IR from the corpse and without other energy source) ?\n—\nRespectful regards,\nPiero Iacazio\ntechnician dyer (since 1974)\n—\nP. S.\nI have read that :\n>The first practical demonstration of the vibrating cantilever technique in an atomic force microscope was\nmade by Wickramasinghe in 1987 with an optical\ninterferometer to measure the amplitude of a cantilever‘s vibration.\nThere is another recent forensic-archaeological case to take in account : the skin of the Iceman under the AFM (= Atomic Force Microscopy).\nHere the inherent (2010) control:\n>In collaboration with the EURAC Bolzano, Professor Dr. Robert Stark’s research group at LMU-Munich, has used a NanoWizard® AFM system to reveal the nanostructure and mechanics of mummified type I collagen from the 5300-year-old Tyrolean Iceman.\nWhere is the little remain of the skin of the Man in the Shroud ?\nI believe that some acarus has eaten a the skin. We have only seen the eggs.\nBut I still hope to see the discovery of the little nanoparticles, the remains of the skin …\n—\nPI\n\n","date":"October 1, 2010 at 12:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/22/trial-of-the-shroud-of-turin-at-newman-university-in-wichita/","cat":"history","id":"comment-1471","author":"Piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Trial of the Shroud of Turin at Newman University in Wichita","post":"Piero, thanks.
