[{"title":"Lentulus vs. the Shroud of Turin","post":"Hardly surprising that Lentulus was popular in Germany, they seem to have a preference for blondes.  Inculturised representations are common.  The “Maori Madonna” by artist Julia Lynch is well-known and popular in NZ.  Samples of Lynch’s work can be found at: http://www.gsc.ac.nz/lynch.htm . As well as her 14 Stations of the Cross, and the ‘Maori Madonna’, they include: ‘Madonna of the Tui’, ‘Southern Madonna’, ‘Tangiwai’ (= weeping waters), ‘Maori Christ’.  Inculturisation seems to have a worthwhile evangelising purpose for indigenous peoples.  I dare say there are also corresponding “First Nation” representations.\n\n","date":"February 21, 2013 at 4:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/21/lentulus-vs-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-25194","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
