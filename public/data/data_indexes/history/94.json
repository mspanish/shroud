[{"title":"John the Baptist Relics?","post":"But it’s radiocarbon dating, so the answer can’t be right. The sample was not representative of the entire John the Baptist. There must have been contamination with modern bone. One has to look at the entire historical record of this artefact and not rely purely on just one totally discredited methodology …\nOops, sorry, it’s the right age. I take back everything I just said… I say, this radiocarbon methodology has really come on in recent years…\n\n","date":"June 18, 2012 at 4:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/17/john-the-baptist-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12662","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"John the Baptist Relics?","post":"I’ve read somewhere that the dating of bones via carbon dating is much precise and sure than ancient pieces of cloths.  I don’t know if it’s a real fact, but it’s interesting.  I think it’s due to the fact that cloths are much more easy to get contamined than bones.  Also, concerning this bones dating versus the dating of the Shroud, we have to understand one most important difference between the 2 objects :  the Shroud had been manipulated a lot and suffered many accidents throughout his long history, on the contrary to these bones (I assume).  In that context, the Shroud is an object that have much more chances to have been contaminated…  And since the work of Rogers, we know it has been contaminated by some medieval materials serving for textile a repair.\n\n","date":"June 18, 2012 at 3:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/17/john-the-baptist-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12682","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"John the Baptist Relics?","post":"I felt sure you would work in a mention of St. Raymond somewhere…\n\n","date":"June 18, 2012 at 3:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/17/john-the-baptist-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12684","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"John the Baptist Relics?","post":"Don’t bother Yannick, it’s obvious Colin has his sciencebod ‘nonscientific’ binders on.

It is a well-known fact that the DNA of the Shroud is so degrated that it’s impossible to get a full profile from it.  Too bad for a comparison with other DNA samples from other objects or from bloodstains on other ancient cloths like the Sudarium…  I’m not even sure if one day it will be possible to do that.  Since the DNA of the Shroud is so degrated, how in the world can you rebuild something with so much missing parts ?\n\n","date":"June 19, 2012 at 3:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/17/john-the-baptist-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12721","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"John the Baptist Relics?","post":"Just a precision :  The expression “missing parts” I used refers to the DNA profile that can be found on the Shroud, not the relic itself !!!\n\n","date":"June 19, 2012 at 4:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/17/john-the-baptist-relics/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12726","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
