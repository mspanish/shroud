[{"title":"Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different","post":"Also, by the time Christ died he was extremely dehydrated, almost depleted of blood entirely. From descriptions of the crucifixion, medical professionals have determined that he died of heart failure due to extreme blood and fluid loss. Basically, Christ bled out from His many wounds: which would have made his eyes very sunken due to the extreme dehydration. The gaunt appearance that is evident on the Shroud indicates more than just a man who was slender: it also confirms the description of Christ’s death in the Gospels. \nThe Lamb who was slain… the sacrificial lamb of the Old Testament was drained of blood. The blood was the most significant part of the sacrifice, because it was the blood that was sprinkled on the Mercy Seat in the Holy of Holies. It seems that Christ gave every last drop for our atonement, He did not spare a bit of Himself but truly gave all so that His death would be the last and final sacrifice. \nAlso, I feel as if I need to repeat this over and over in order to UNDO the damage done by the movie The Passion: Christ was not a victim. At no time was he ever a captive of the Romans or the Jews. The scriptures make it clear that He did this willingly, that He died when He decided it was time to die and that Christ raised Himself from the dead when the 3 days were completed. \nChrist was not a victim!! What we see on that Shroud was done in submission to the Father’s Will.  The Shroud is a monument to Holy Obedience, and it should serve as an example for all true believers of what “discipleship” truly means.\n\n","date":"March 13, 2012 at 4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/13/banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","id":"comment-9287","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different","post":"I can’t remember now why I started on that tangent… Oh yes, it’s because the writer mentioned that Christ probably looked different once you eliminate the banding in the linen. I think the linen studies are very interesting and it’s great that they help to confirm the origin of the Shroud. But do I think it’s important to remember that Christ was definitely not at his best when that image was made. Although they’ve been able to extrapolate a computer-generated image from the Shroud that is quite attractive, I think the image on the Shroud may not look anything like the Christ before he was so brutalized.\n\n","date":"March 13, 2012 at 4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/13/banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","id":"comment-9288","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different","post":"Quote from Dan : “To my way of thinking banding provides strong evidence that the cloth is not medieval.”\nI agree totally.  \nI also want to add this quote from Yannick Clément :  “To my way of thinking banding provides VERY strong evidence that Ray Rogers hypothesis about the chromophore responsible for the image (Rogers said it is a very thin layer of impurities on the top surface of the cloth that was colored) is correct.” \nI also want to give all of you a personal reflection about another quote from Dan.  He said : “The most significant aspect of banding is realizing that the man whose image appears on the shroud may not have looked like we think he does.”\nI would say this :  It is true that the banding effect could have produce an image that is a bit different from what Jesus really looked like at the moment of his death.  But it is also most probably true that the image on the Shroud is somewhat different (to what extend I don’t know) from the real aspect of the Resurrected Jesus, simply because the Gospels tell us that even his closest friends had difficulties to recongnized him !!!  So, if you think the Risen Christ looked like the image on the Shroud, I’m sorry but I disagree with you !  This image is the one of the dead Christ, and not the image of the Risen one !!!!  Again, how much different ?  It’s just impossible to respond.  But if we believe the testimony of the Gospel writers, we have to agree that the image that is on the Shroud don’t look exactly like the Risen Christ that was seen by the disciples…\nI think most people forget this interesting aspect of the question regarding the Shroud of Turin.  It’s an image of the humanity of Christ, not an image of his divinity.\n\n","date":"March 13, 2012 at 4:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/13/banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","id":"comment-9289","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different","post":"I get what your saying Annie, that is why I think one should really watch the film “The Real Face of Jesus’. Not only for the wonderful final portrait of Jesus at or near the end, but sometime earlier when Downing shows how they clear the banding and the herringbone weave from the image, I can’t remember what they called the procedure, but when the software ran it’s course and the image was cleared of most all interference, the face showed such a loving power. Although obvious the torture received and shown all over the image, the image of the face seems to show a serene and majestic look. Not one of a tortured victim, but one of accomplishment.\nR\n\n","date":"March 13, 2012 at 5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/13/banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","id":"comment-9290","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different","post":"“Not one of a tortured victim, but one of accomplishment.”\nYes, that’s true. I hadn’t thought about it but the face does have expression. He looks peaceful, not tormented. Perhaps even “satisfied”, as if he was thinking, “I’m glad that’s over with.” A job well done. \nThe Shroud is truly amazing, in all that it conveys. Although I had not been very interested in the Shroud before I found this blog, it would be difficult now to convince me that it is NOT the real Shroud of Christ. There is so much about the image that is authentic. \nAnd the fact that it drives the atheists crazy: well that seems like God’s sense of humor, as well as his Mercy in trying to reach out to a bunch of hardheads.\n\n","date":"March 14, 2012 at 3:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/13/banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","id":"comment-9313","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different","post":"Anyone would think this banding hypothesis (neat, plausible but wrong) had been written on tablets of stone.\nA few moments of thought about the imprinting of a certain transverse crease should be sufficient to demolish any notion that vertical banding was the cause of the gaunt-looking features. There is another explanation for the cut-off peripheries of the face, and it’s nothing to do with colour variations in the yarn, and everything to do with the mechanism of image imprinting,\nBut I’m not here to debate technical matters – not any more. \nI’m thinking of setting up a new site that will specifically address this and then rest of Shroudology’s received wisdom, which all too often strikes me as little more than tendentious pseudo-scientific twaddle.

I do agree with you but I guess NOT EXACTLY for the same reason you implied. In the most likely hypothesis the Shroud is Rabbi Yeshua’s, there are actually more archaeological explanations for “the cut-off peripheries” (or more exactly the presence of two squared U shaped discontinuous boxes we can see framing up the Shroud face). \nBTW how are your “lightly baked/cooked mummified monk skeletons/cadavers in the manner of the Turin Shroud” doing? CAN YOU show us (before Easter or Trinity) any “thermostencil”/\n”scorchography” on linen of the face, arm, leg, toe or even fingernail of any of them just in case it is not mere scorchoscientistic kitchen mummo-numbo-jumbo which in this instance would have contributed precisely NOTHING?\n\n","date":"March 14, 2012 at 8:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/13/banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","id":"comment-9303","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"}]
