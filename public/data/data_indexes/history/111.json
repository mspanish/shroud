But has Charles Freeman still not got his head round the difference between a negative image and a mirror image? We know for certain that the TS is negative, thanks to Secondo Pia, and some assume it’s also a mirror image, based on dubious (lack of) scriptural evidence for the position of the spear wound – left or right. In fact, the negative proprties alone should be sufficient to be 99% certain (at least) that the image is a passive imprint from a shaped template (animate, living or dead, OR inanimate) , not a free hand painting or freehand anything. \nI’m preparing a new post right now that spells out the differences between negative and mirror images, showing that the two CAN be independent, since they arise for different reasons.\nThe starting point will be this mock-up of a rubber stamp, which will serve as my initial (pseudo)3D template.\n\n It will then be reverse-processed as per Secondo Pia, and then 3D-enhanced to a pseudo-pseudo version of the original, with or without correction of the left-right reversal that accompanies any IMPRINTING mechanism where the template has to be turned away from the operator through 180 degrees in order to make the imprint. The light/dark reversal occurs for entirely different reasons, needless to say,  independent (in principle) from mere left-right reversal.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 3:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/24/new-paper-on-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"history","id":"comment-192763","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper on the Shroud of Arquata","post":"Thanks, Charles.  I won’t pretend that I understand what you’re talking about for your new post.  But if I understand Freeman’s theory, then I agree that the Shroud of Arquata is evidence against it.

Did he try do the same with the image in question or satisfy himself with the image at hand?\nJohn: I used the image(s) that accompanied this posting, but have just repeated the exercise with those shown by Di Lazzaro et al in their paper:\n\nNote the reversal of order: the TS is now on top.\nI raised contrast in MS Office Picture Manager from 0 to 77 (max +100), accompanied by a modest intensifying of dominant colour by reducing mid tone value from 0 to -21 (minimum -100).\nI’m finding the midtone setting a handy probe for Shroud images, it giving a visual indication of chief colour component(s) by splitting the RGB mix. My earlier claim for the Halta Definizione image on the BBC’s site (2008) is  two-tone I now realize to be mainly the result of a strengthening of a red component in the faint sepia image achieved by lowering the midtone setting. One can see a similar effect by deconstructing “sandy brown” – a standard web shade.\nI’ll shall keep quiet for now about the working hypothesis that is presently being explored except to say that Ray Schneider’s Ohio conference paper is proving a mine of useful information, albeit heavy going for a mere biochemist. His references to “apparent blood” on beard and elsewhere are interesting.\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p08.pdf\n\n","date":"January 24, 2015 at 7:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/24/new-paper-on-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"history","id":"comment-185945","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper on the Shroud of Arquata","post":"You’re not wrong there, Colin. Way over my pay grade, but I’m discovering a lot more about digital imaging as I go along, so I dare say I’ll get there in the end. Cutting directly to the conclusions, I note, as you probably have yourself, that: “The image area shows a strong affinity with the interstitial blood modes” and “The observation that it is hard to distinguish image pixels from interstitial blood pixels may have some image formation implications.” I think this means that where the blood has eroded away, the cloth has the same colour as the rest of the image, which implies that the image is not surpressed under the bloodstains, and therefore that there is no reason to suppose that the blood arrived before the image.\n\n","date":"January 24, 2015 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/24/new-paper-on-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"history","id":"comment-185947","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper on the Shroud of Arquata","post":"That’s an interesting interpretation you have there, Hugh. I now have two possibilities to consider.
