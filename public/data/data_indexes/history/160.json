[{"title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman","post":"It has become fashionable in some circles to dismiss the Vignon markings as a “joke” and to parody them as for example on Davor Aslanovski’s site.  Possibly Stephen Jones follows Ian Wilson’s text a little too slavishly,  But he makes the point that Vignon originally identified 20 such markings, Wilson reduced these to 15, but Jones also mentions that some enthusiasts claimed to have identified 60.  Whatever, 15 correspondences are too many to dismiss so lightly.  \nPrior to the 6th C, there were considerable variances in the very few portraits of Christ now available, one such portraying him as a beardless Apollo.  Augustine asserted that nobody knew what Jesus looked like, but suddenly in the sixth century, the iconography seems to have become fairly standardised.  It has to be apparent to any fair-minded judgment that whatever template was used for these depictions, there must have been a select few who had access to the Shroud facial image, and these various markings were included in that template.  This is not to make a case that the template was wholly based on the Images of the Shroud or the Edessa nor that the Edesssa was necessarily the Shroud as asserted by Wilson, but it is interesting that much of the iconography seems to have radiated out from Edessa.  Perhaps there were other images available at the time or earlier copies which contributed to the template.  \nJones makes a telling point when he comments:\n“An interesting argument is that in the law courts (where proof `beyond reasonable doubt’ is required), cases of plagiarism or breach of copyright will be settled in the plaintiff’s favour if it can be shown that the text (or whatever) is supposed to have been copied contains errors present in the original. Similarly, in tracing the texts of ancient authors, the best evidence that two versions are copies one from another or from the same original is when both contain the same errors. A charming example is an intrusive colon within a phrase in two fourteenth-century texts of Euripides: one colon turned out to be a scrap of straw embedded in the paper, proving that the other text was a later copy.” [Patterson, C., 1999, “Evolution,” Cornell University Press: Ithaca NY, Second edition, p.117]. \nIf a scrap of straw can be accepted as evidence of copying Euripedes, then 15 Vignon markings on 6th century icongraphy has to be even more compelling that the Shroud facial image was certainly known at that time!\n\n","date":"September 22, 2012 at 4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","id":"comment-16759","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman","post":"Dan said : ” I now agree that the much mentioned topless square between the eyebrows that we see on the shroud is probably the result of vertical banding.”\nPlease folks, be serious and honest for once !\nThat doesn’t mean for one second that the Mandylion (or any other ancient icons that could present such particular feature) was the same thing as the Shroud !!!!

On the other hand, if I always come back with critics against Wilson’s hypothesis whenever the occasion seem to be right is just because there are too much people in the Shroud world who believe too much blindly in this incorrect hypothesis and I just want set the record straight as much as I can.  We have to look elsewhere for a better explanation concerning the obscure years of the Shroud and as you cleverly said : it’s possible (maybe even probable) that this obscure history of the Shroud will never be known, especially if there is no new discoveries related to that in archaeology or in ancient manuscript…  And like you also said :  In the end, it’s not that important.  Another C14 dating done on better samples (at least from 3 differents spots on the main body of the cloth) is what should be done to learn the true age of the cloth.  And to reduce the possibility of contaminations, I would take just thread samples on the reverse side of the cloth because it was pretty well protected from contamination since 1534 (at least better protected than the inner part of the cloth).\n\n","date":"September 22, 2012 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","id":"comment-16769","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman","post":"It is Yannick who is confused.  If he’s bothered to read my comment above, he has failed to comprehend what I’ve written.  Perhaps he could use Google translate to read it in his native Quebecois better to understand it.  Nowhere in there have I asserted that Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object.  I dare say it is progress that he seems prepared to concede that the iconography was influenced by the Shroud facial image.  But where was it?  He says that there’s no mention of a burial cloth in Edessa prior to the relic’s transfer thence to Constantinople.  He says perhaps it was in Constantinople, but likewise there’s no mention of the burial cloth in Constantinople, and it wasn’t taken there by Helena.  He says perhaps it was in Palestine, Where in Palestine?  It certainly wasn’t in Jerusalem after 70 AD, and it certainly wasn’t in Antioch after 540 AD when the city was destroyed.  Rebuilding work had commenced there shortly beforehand following eathquakes.  Perhaps the Shroud was discovered then, and where’s the nearest other city? Why, Edessa of course!  And where does this 6th icongraphy commence, also Edessa!  \nPerhaps he imagines it was in St Catherine’s monastery in Sinai, or perhaps it was in Armenia, or Georgia – Sorry, no record!   \nIn the fourth century, Athanasius, the Bishop of Alexandria (ca. 328-373), affirmed that a sacred Christ-icon,12 traceable to Jerusalem and the year 68, was then present in Syria:\n“…but two years before Titus and Vespasian sacked the city [i.e Jerusalem], the faithful and disciples of Christ were warned by the Holy Spirit to depart from the city and go to the kingdom of King Agrippa, because at that time Agrippa was a Roman ally. Leaving the city, they went to his regions and carried everything relating to our faith. At that time even the icon with certain other ecclesiastical objects were moved and they today still remain in Syria. I possess this information as handed down to me from my migrating parents and by hereditary right. It is plain and certain why the icon of our holy Lord and Savior came from Judaea to Syria”  Syria must surely mean Antioch.  \nNo record in Edessa?

In that context, why there’s almost no other ancient text following this one that took over this “great information” ?

For Rogers, this banding effect on the Shroud is a good sign of the very old age of the Shroud because it seem to come from an ancient technology of making linen cloths that was dropped during the 8th century and that consisted to bleach linen threads by batch before the weaving, which caused slight differences in the quantity of impurities that would be left on top of the linen fibers.  And if Rogers was right, this banding effect had a big influenced in the image formation process because tonality of the image seem to be directly proportional to the tonality of the bands.\nThe outcome of this ancient way to bleach the threads was a final cloth showing bands of different tones.  For example, the Holland cloth (ancient back-up cloth for the Shroud) is a medieval cloth for sure and don’t show this banding effect, most probably because this cloth was bleached only one time at the end of the weaving, once the cloth was final.\n\n","date":"September 25, 2012 at 3:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","id":"comment-16905","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman","post":"\nLyfe :Stephen Jones was challenged on the Vignon markings in comments on Part Six of his critique of Charles Freeman (his post of August 23rd).

The parted hair and some facial similarities may occur, but not much of anything in the sense of the Vignon markings. The similarities could simply be due to Jesus’s appearence being brought down through word of mouth, nothing else. Furthermore these catacomb depictions were not wide-spread and it is very unlikely many people would be viewing frescos painted deep in the catacombs, very unlikely!

Personally, I favored the dating of 521-526 because I have read here (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Christus_Ravenna_Mosaic.jpg) that this very particular artwork (that could well be the ancestor of the Pantocrator icons in the Byzantine world) is said to have been completed within 526 AD by the so-called “Master of Sant’Apollinare”. Of course, it is also possible that the artwork was done after the Byzantine took the city in 540 and the upper date 547 could still be true. \nBUT THE THING IS THIS : The Mandylion was NOT discovered in 525 as Wilson wrongly try to make believe ! This is another very good example of the great intellectual dishonesty of this author and it’s truly disgusting. He knows as well as me that both ancient historians Procopius of Cesarea and Evagrius Scholasticus NEVER said that this relic had been discovered during the great flood in Edessa in 525 and so, even if these 2 ancient historians did mention the flood in their work !!! It is a FACT that both historians never said a damn word about the Mandylion in the part of their manuscripts where they described that flood ! If the Mandylion would have been discovered during that catastrophic event, you can be CERTAIN that these 2 highly respected historians would have talked about that. Look, even ca. 550, Procopius of Cesarea was not aware of the presence of any miraculous imprint of Jesus face in Edessa while he was writting about the Persian invasion of 544 !!! On that base, can’t you realized that this concept of an image of Christ not made by human hands only surfaced in Edessa AFTER that time ??? The miraculous imprint of Christ COULD NOT have became publicly known prior to that date of 550 and that’s a fact ! And nevertheless, BEFORE that time, there was already at least one artwork (the one of Ravenna) that was showing a bearded Christ with long hair depiction that was obviously based (directly or not) on the Shroud’s face !!! \nOf course, you will never found these information in any of Wilson’s articles or books !!!! WHAT A SHAME !!!!\nLyfe is totally correct in his remark that the presence of an artwork that is obviously based (directly or indirectly) on the Shroud’s face already during the first half of the 6th century is truly problematic for Wilson’s hypothesis and I definately should have add this fact in my recent paper on the subject ! Make it one more problematic fact against Wilson’s hypothesis !!!! Wilson is most probably aware of the problem and obviously, that’s why he invent (without any historical basis whatsoever) the story of a discovery of the Mandylion during that flood of 525 !!! He obviously did that simply because he NEED his Mandylion to have been present in Edessa well before the middle of the 6th century !!!! If that’s not intellectual dishonesty just to defend at all cost your preconceive ideas, I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS !!!\nSorry Wilson but your Mandylion not made by human hands only appeared in Edessa during the second half of the 6th century AT BEST and there was already some artworks obviously based directly on the Shroud or indirectly based on a copy of the Shroud’s face WELL BEFORE THAT TIME !!!! This fact ALONE is enough to understand that all his hypothesis is incorrect ! All these different artworks that first appeared during the 6th century and that all show a bearded Christ with long hair very similar to the Shroud’s face (i.e. the Christ in Majesty, the Pantocrator icons and I have no fear to add all the so-called miraculous imprints of Jesus face – like the Mandylion – that all appeared during the second half of the 6th century in the Middle East) were obviously based directly or indirectly on the image on the Shroud and NOT on the Image of Edessa (Mandylion) ! \nNote that I will talk in length about this great piece of evidence in my upcoming paper about the question of the identity of the Shroud man…\n\n","date":"September 30, 2012 at 9:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","id":"comment-17097","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman","post":"And to make you reflect some more about other possible options concerning the appearence of the Image of Edessa (Mandylion) during the second part of the 6th century (at best, because it is not totally clear if this image really was there before the beginning of the 7th century. Some scholars think that the reference found in Evagrius Scholasticus is a later addition done during the 7th Ecumenical council of Nicea in 787, which reaffirmed the cult of Sacred images), here’s a little reflection of mine :  Have you noticed that almost every copies of the Mandylion that have survived to this day shared an important feature with almost all the known Pantocrator icons ?  Among many other things pointed out by Vignon, in almost every copies of these 2 forms of Byzantine depictions of Christ’s face, we can clearly see the 2 ear lobes which are not covered by the hair !!!  And here’s another question for you :  Can you see the ears on the Shroud ? ABSOLUTELY NOT !\nBecause we know for a fact that the Christ in Majesty of Ravenna (which is possible the artistic ancestor of the Pantocrator icons) was made BEFORE the apparition of an image “not made by human hands” in Edessa and because of some striking similarities between this form of bearded Christ icons and the copies of the Mandylion (like the ear lobes not covered by the hair among many other things), I submit this little hypothesis to your reflection:  And what if this image of Ravenna (along with possibly some Pantocrator icons) were truly the real and only artistic source for this Image of Edessa ?\nI think this hypothesis cannot be worse than the one defended at all cost by Wilson and his fans.

Both of you have come to your own conclusions, through a s***-load of speculation, to put it mildly!\nAs to the dating of the Ravenna pantocrator; It could be hypothesized, that it could date even later then 547! As it was never established ‘conclusively’, it was created by the so called “Master of Sant Appolinare”. This was just speculation and conjecture…It is just as ‘likey’ the mosaic which is of a ‘Byzantine style’ was created years later, after Justinian I had secured Italy into his empire. Lets not forget it is well agreed that it was Justinian I who in ‘most likelyhood’ commissioned the making of the Pantocrator image and had commissioned the one at St Catherine’s in the Sinai, at relatively the same time period…Is this scenario speculation? Absolutely yes, but more logical and plausible then scenarios put forth by the two of you.\nOh and by the way Wilson’s hypothsis to the dating i.e; ‘discovery’ of the Edessa cloth? He states in his book; sometime between 503 and 544, whether you want to believe his sources or interpretations are correct or not Yannick.

Freeman indicates :  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO HISTORICAL BASIS FOR THIS CLAIM !  This 503 to 544 dating come out of Wilson’s imagination and anybody can do these kind of non-historical claims.\nHere’s the FACTS (I thought I was clear in my previous comment but anyway, I’ll wrote them again just for you) :\n1- The Ravenna mosaic was made BEFORE 550 A.D.\n2- Procopius wrote about the Persian failed invasion of Edessa around 550 and NEVER said a damn word about the presence of a miraculous imprint of Christ’s face.  CLEARLY, the Mandylion was not present in Edessa BEFORE that date.\n3- Evagrius talk about the presence of the Mandylion in Edessa during the Persian invasion but because of Procopius writings, we know for a FACT that this mention is false. Procopius talk about the Persian invasion of 544 and did mentioned the letter of Christ to Abgar (which are part of the original version of the Abgar legend) and said that this was this Holy Letter who saved the city from the Persian ! He NEVER talks about a miraculous cloth.  Clearly, this relic was simply not there at the time of the invasion. As I said, some scholars thinks that this is a later addition in Evagrius manuscript that was made by the Church to back-up the miraculous story of the Mandylion.\n4- There is absolutely no ancient writers (and no ancient historians like Evagrius or Procopius) that mention the presence of the Mandylion before 544 and as I said, it’s clear that this relic was NOT in Edessa BEFORE ca. 550.\nThese are the facts.  And because of the Vignon’s markings, there’s a very high probability that the Shroud served as a (direct or indirect) source for the creation of the Ravenna mosaic.  It’s highly probable that the Shroud was already existing BEFORE the creation of this mosaic, not the Mandylion.  Conclusion :  The Shroud never was the Mandylion.\n\n","date":"October 1, 2012 at 10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","id":"comment-17121","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman","post":"The reason why that mosaic is given an earlier dating is that it is in the same sequence commissioned by the heretical (Arian) Theodoric who died in 526.They redid many of the mosaics but left some of those, including the Christ, that they found inoffensive.

Freeman’s clearly indicates (and that’s the most important thing to note) : There’s absolutely no written reference for the presence of the Image in Edessa prior to the Persian failed invasion of 544 and even then, we know for a FACT that this dating that is found in the manuscript of Evagrius is incorrect because of the manuscript of Procopius, who was an authentic historian who described in length this failed invasion of the Persian without ever making any reference to the presence of a miraculous image in the city at the time.  Since Procopius have written his manuscript ca. 550, since he did mentioned the letter send by Jesus to king Abgar (which was part of the original version of the Abgar legend), since he never said a damn word about the Image of Edessa (Mandylion) and since he indicates that it was this letter at the time who served as a palladium for the city and was responsible for the victory of the Edessenian people against the Persian army, it is CLEAR that this miraculous image could not have appeared in Edessa before ca. 550.\nAnd since we know for a FACT that the Ravenna mosaic was made during the first half of the 6th century, it is sure that it was done BEFORE this Image of Edessa became known.

Isn’t that enough for you to realize that Wilson’s hypothesis must be considered highly unlikely at best (and in my mind, I would say “impossible” !) ???  I think any reasonable person without any pro-Wilson bias would understand that…\nTo conclude, I want to say this very important comment :  In the end, I don’t care too much if Wilson want to sell is crazy ideas to the public.  We live in a free world right ?  But what enraged me is the FACT that this extremely weak hypothesis has been defended blindly and without any critical sense by a lot of pro-Shroud researchers over the years (some of them being real historians !), which gave a smell of propaganda to the whole issue !  Since I seek only the truth regarding any aspect of the Shroud (whatever this truth can be), I simply cannot accept this situation.  I’m very sad for all the people who knows not much in history and who have been fooled by Wilson’s ideas, which were bring forward by many pro-Shroud people over the years.  THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO FIGHT.  In the end, the only thing I want is this :  to open the eyes of people over this hypothesis that has been often presented in the pro-Shroud circles just like an accepted theory, which is VERY far from being the case.  You don’t believe me ?  Just ask any authentic Byzantine expert and you’ll see what he will tell you about that !!!!\n\n","date":"October 1, 2012 at 12:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","id":"comment-17128","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
