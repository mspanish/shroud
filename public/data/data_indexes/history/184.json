[{"title":"The Lord Is Risen! He is Risen Indeed!","post":"I had an interesting thought regarding the significance and meaning of the Shroud. The scripture says, “You were bought with a price.” That Jesus gave his life as a “ransom.” That we were “purchased”. \nThe Shroud is a the RECEIPT demonstrating the PRICE that was paid, not in dollars but in blood. However the image represents the PROMISE of future glory. So the Shroud reveals both the price paid and the promise of transformation for all who believe. \nHere is the future promise: But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body. Philippians 3:20-21\nThis is a future event…I hope its soon!\nHappy Easter!\n\n","date":"April 8, 2012 at 8:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/08/the-lord-is-risen-he-is-risen-indeed/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10149","author":"Shroud Encounter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Lord Is Risen!

He is Risen Indeed!","post":"In the part of the Gospel of John we read today at the Mass, we can say that the fact that the Shroud was still in the tomb (even if he was empty) was THE SIGN for St-John that Jesus was resurrected. \nI think that’s the way we should still see the Shroud of Turin today :  A GREAT SIGN that Jesus is resurrected !!!\nFor St-John, the emptry Shroud (I love the expression) was not what we can call a PROOF of the resurrection, but it was a great SIGN.  I think it’s still the best way we can look at the Shroud today.  There was a dead body in this Shroud, but science was able to let us know that this body didn’t stayed more than 48 hours in there, while the dried blood stains were not disturbed.  That’s the greatest SIGN of the resurrection of Jesus !  A SIGN that, almost 2000 years later, we still can see !  That’s really amazing, don’t you think ???\nHappy Easter to everyone !\n\n","date":"April 8, 2012 at 6:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/08/the-lord-is-risen-he-is-risen-indeed/","cat":"history","id":"comment-10175","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
