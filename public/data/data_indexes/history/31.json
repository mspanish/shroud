[{"title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?","post":"What is the point of this, Dan? I believe you are intelligent and cool-headed enough to see that the only topic I have addressed is the plausibility of the link between the Image of Edessa and the Turin Shroud. Eminent scholars such as Averil Cameron, Sebastian Brock, Hans Belting, Robin Cormack, and Ewa Kuryluk; as well as some others who are not as advanced in their careers as to be called ’eminent’, but are certainly trained in relevant disciplines and have based their opinions on diligent research and much reflection – such as Andrea Nicolotti or my own humble self; have expressed their expert opinions on the topic and have rejected the idea as entirely fanciful. But our opinion is not valued within the ‘sindonological’ circles, and is rejected with intelligent and well-argued explanations such as:\n‘Rather turgid prose, straining at gnats, swallowing camels, he doesn’t see the woods, too focused on the trees, twigs and leaves. I can see why academic specialists are unsuitable candidates for jury trials. There’s rather a lot more to it than he’s considered, I should say yet another victim of over-specialisation.’ \n‘I trust that DA has had “the last part he has to say on the matter”, as despite his extensive verbiage he has contributed nothing to our understanding of the Shroud. He may return to his ivory tower where no doubt a trail of sycophants may admire his further efforts on Byzantine scholarship, and other such related topics.’ \nYou yourself have read my two papers, admitted that they were products of serious study, and then granted them with no other comment but ‘I have not changed my mind’. \nAnd you go out and ask yourself: ‘What could he possibly mean by this ‘disrespect and distrust for the orthodox academia?’ \nI have been thinking about refuting the idea that the Pray ms illustrations are somehow depictions of the Turin Shroud, or that the Disciplina Arcani is what Markwardt thinks it is – but, frankly, I don’t even know where to begin. So many things have been misunderstood here that I would have to start with questions like ‘So what is art?’. And even if I found a way of debunking these syndonological myths – what would the reactions be? ‘You haven’t changed my mind, you iconologically blind, over-specialized, archskeptical sycopanth. Go back to your ivory tower.’ \nFor the hundredth millionth time: I don’t know what the Shroud of Turin is. I don’t know what the worth of chemical, physical, botanical, or any other research on it is. I don’t even know much about C-14 dating. Because I am not a specialist in any of those fields, and have not had any first-hand information on the subject. So I have no opinion on these issues. But I am trained as an art historian, at a university that prides itself with being one of the first in the world to have introduced the subject of art history, and where it takes you at least 6 years to complete your undergraduate degree – so extensive are the reading lists. And I am currently sponsored by the University of Oxford’s most prestigious scholarship and am reading Late Antique and Byzantine Studies under the supervision of the world-famous Jaś Elsner. And, after having dedicated many, many hours to examining both the textual and the visual sources, I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in them to support Wilson’s hypothesis. And I am not saying that Wilson isn’t right. I am only saying that, at the present moment, there is no evidence to support his thesis.\nSo, rather than pretending not to know why I would say that there is disrespect and distrust for the orthodox academia here, you either start accepting my views as informed judgments made by a sincere and serious person, or let me back go to my ivory tower to mingle with my fellow sycophants whose testimony would be valueless in New Zealand courts of law and whose over-specialized camel-swallowing will never convince you.\n\n","date":"July 1, 2012 at 7:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/01/sindonology-oh-what-an-awful-word/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13264","author":"Davor Aslanovski","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?","post":"And, yes, it is irritation that all these typing mistakes show.

But these believers believe that they are scientists. And that’s why I brought up Velikovskianism and exoheresy. I wouldn’t walk into a village where simple peasants worship an icon that they believe was painted by St Luke and lecture to them on the improbability of such a thing. But this is something else. This is: ‘St Luke was a painter and all the Christian art drew on what he painted and we can prove it scientifically. We have found a crack in the paint on an old icon in the shape of the philtrum – the philtrum was not painted, it is a crack in the paint, but it was misinterpreted by the artists and copied as a  philtrum, which you will find on a number of old icons of Our Lady – both on the Virgin AND ON CHRIST! And this proves that every icon stems from this one source, which was painted by St Luke. And we have analyzed the wormholes in the wood on which the original icon was painted. And if you connect the wormholes (consistently with the paleographic and steganographic data made widely known to us by a retired dental surgeon who made several trips to Mount Athos in his life, both alone and in the company of his plumber who is an expert on the Disciplina Arcani), you will get the letters MP ΘY – which you will find on almost EVERY old icon of Our Lady!!! ‘M’, as was conclusively shown at our 1999 international conference in Las Vegas, stands for the Latin ‘mecum’ – we are still working on the rest of the letters in this arcane message.’ I don’t know about you, but I am a weak man and find such temptations very hard to resist.\n\n","date":"July 1, 2012 at 12:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/01/sindonology-oh-what-an-awful-word/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13283","author":"Davor Aslanovski","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?","post":"The nature of the replies to Davor makes his own point for him. \nThe fact that some amazing space and nuclear programme scientists worked on the Shroud means absolutely nothing because ancient textiles was not a field in which they were trained to work.\nI am happy to be corrected by Davor but having worked on the sidelines of similar issues it seems to me that if you want to carry out a research programme on an ancient textile or a fourteenth century painting or whatever.\n1) You have to have proper laboratory conditions set up for an examination so that the artefact can be moved there and there can be no further deterioration or contamination from other substances.\n2) You have a full examination of the object before you do anything, especially if you want to remove pigment or other substances.\n3) You assemble a team of experts covering a variety of disciplines- it is important someone is in charge who can judge on the quality of each member of the team and make sure that the problems you have identified on your preliminary examination can be dealt with.\n4) You don’t expect to work under pressure of time.\n5) Samples are removed with extreme care and only when essential and are only allowed to leave the laboratory if another specialist laboratory has equipment that you don’t have.\n6) Intervention is minimal- of course, a great problem with the conservation of pictures .\nOne day the story will be told of how it was possible for a self-selected group of nuclear physicists to get access to the Shroud in 1978, not to have had any preliminary physical examination of it before they began research on it, were able to examine it in a draughty hall with nuns on hand to cut off the backing cloth, to improvise the examination within a very short time span of 120 hours, to remove samples and take them out of the system, to have a completely disorganised method of distributing the samples around once they had been taken back to the States ( Who actually owned and was responsible for these possible substances from the body of Christ?). It also seems that there was a preconceived idea of what would be found.When the samples were sent off to Walter McCrone’s laboratory,  Ian Wilson in his latest, 2010, edition of the Shroud , notes on p.92, how the apparently brilliant McClone (who had  worked on Yale’s Vinland Map) was selected for the analysis of the samples and goes on ‘The expectation ( not least on my part) was therefore that by some equally brilliant feat he might be able to show the Shroud to be authentic’. Further comment unnecessary! Of course, as is well known, McCrone came up with a mid-fourteenth century date to the horror of the team.\n  Then Wilson tells, us, p.92 , ‘With the benefit of hindsight, the STURP [this was the self-selected US work team on the Shroud]were probably far too undemanding  in their sample requirements. Their ‘light touch’ sticky tapes did little more than kiss the Shroud’s surface’.  Well, that is one relief -who knows what irreversible damage might have been done with ‘real’ sticky tape?.\nSo far as one can see there are still samples from this 1978 raiding expedition around and they can still be handed around but only  it seems, after the McCrone episode to people who will back the Shroud  is authentic point of view . Needless to say the samples are pretty worthless from the scientific point of view by now and there does not seem to be a single hint from any of the samples that we have a first century artefact. Davor has explained the immense difficulties in linking a historical narrative which takes the Shroud back to the first century. As he says, surely correctly, it is not impossible that the Shroud is authentic, simply that Wilson et. al. have not yet come up with any usable  evidence to suggest that it might be.\nIt would have been better simply to have a traditional ‘Veneration of the Shroud’ guild and have kept the science out of it altogether. It is pretty worthless and the latest idea to offer a £15,000 prize for explaining how the Shroud ‘s image was made makes no sense  unless the Shroud is allowed to be properly examined under laboratory conditions and the samples taken from it that are still floating around returned to the examining laboratory. Perhaps the £15,000 can be diverted towards paying for this! The answer may well come back that in the present state of knowledge  we don’t know how the image was made but with further scientific advance it might well be in the future. In the meantime ,don’t fret. Keep to your traditional faith in Christ as a human/divine being and stop worrying so much about any physical objects that might have survived from his lifetime.\n\n","date":"July 1, 2012 at 12:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/01/sindonology-oh-what-an-awful-word/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13284","author":"Menedemus","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?","post":"Why all this rubbish about “Exhoheretic”?

You started by saying that there were many doctors with “brilliant” curriculum who guaranteed that the image of Turin was not a work of art. Then you provide a confused list without clear references, which includes general practitioners, surgeons, surnames (???), without reference to publishing titles, editorials, etc., etc.\nNow you hold that any physician who sees the blurry image of the Shroud of Turin is able to distinguish a true mark of a human body because he has studied a course in forensic medicine. Apparently not: I have quoted a forensic doctor who says this is impossible. I explained why and I have got no answer. Do any of the doctors on that list you put may explain how it is possible that streams of blood run over hair?\nTo draw up a confused list of believer doctors is easy. To draw up a confused list of doctors and to maintain they say the image is of a real human being is also easy. Let’s be serious. You do not know if that the names you mention are all doctors, you do not know what is written in titles you quote (some are badly copied, some repeated) and to attend a course of surgery do not prepare you to make an open-heart surgery.\nMoreover, I may explain you how some of the “famous” doctors that appear in your list commit blunders for not knowing the medieval art. All thumbs hidden history, for example, is explained simply by the position of the corpses in the burial of the time and also the way to represent the hands crossed in medieval painting. They are hands of Christ, Santa Margarita or nobles of the Sforza’s court. I can put a lot of examples. No need to know comparative anatomy. We only need to know what we are talking about: history of Art.\nGood, you are a believer and you’re doctor (but you do not know how to write a bibliography). Bringing together these things makes some doctors think more with their desire than with their reason. It’s called “wishful thinking” and is typical of sindonist world. But their speech does not reach the academic world. He stays in their circle. And what you have demonstrated with your confused list does not lead anywhere.

You can see the experiments described here: “Experimental Studies in Crucifixion” (www.crucifixion-shroud.com/experimental_studies_in_crucifix.htm). \nI know the miraculous explanation of how the streams of blood that appear in the hair were originated on the cheeks. It comes from Lavoie. It is an ingenious explanation. But it has some problems. The main fault is that it can explain how in the back of the neck of the image streams of blood are still running over the hair (from right to left!). (See; http://people.bridgewater.edu/~rschneid/FocusProjects/Shroud/ShroudMeasure/enrieImg.html). And that excludes the miraculous corrections proposed by Lavoie. Then, it shows that the streams of blood are painted. As Dr. Baden said and no one can deny.\nI think you do not understand that the disappearance of the thumbs has nothing to do with the crucifixion. It is a common way to represent hands folded in the Middle Ages. Here’s an example.
