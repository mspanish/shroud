[{"title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?","post":"Russell Kirk clearly understood that Jesus “transcended matter”, as he says, in his resurrection. Why did he say this and not “broke the bounds of death”? It can be traced to his previous studies, before his conversion to Catholicism.\nBut, what did matter mean to Jesus? Did he break the bounds of death or did he transcend matter? This is a question that requires lengthy discussion and will be dealt with later in a paper.\nFor the time being, it must be pointed out that the Hindu belief in reincarnation makes taking any material goods for an after-life redundant and it would also be pointless because the dead bodies are cremated. There were other ancient peoples who believed in an after-life and took not only some precious material goods but also slaves and young girls with them, these being buried alive.\nThe concept of resurrection, as primitive Christians interpreted it, based as it was on Jewish belief, was essentially different and the birth of the Jesus movement was a resurrection movement, not an empty tomb movement. The NT leaves no doubt about this.\nIn today’s sceptical world not many theologians believe in literal resurrection and the “Jesus family tomb” story was specifically produced to deny the event. How much of it is true?\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Parts_I_and_II\nexplains the beginning and how the Knights Templar and the Turin Shroud come into the picture – with illustrations.\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III\ngives a detailed account about the topic from the academic point of view.\nIs that the end of the story?

There is more to come and hopefully Part IV will be written shortly.\n\n","date":"August 2, 2014 at 9:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/02/the-key-to-understand-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-141795","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?","post":"The concept of resurrection and after-life in Jewish thought I believe owes a great deal to two main external influences.  Following Cyrus’ release of the Jews from their Babylonian Captivity, those who had taken foreign wives were excluded from returning to Jerusalem, many of them settling in Egypt, the Arabian peninsula and elsewhere.  In 324 BC Alexander founded the city of Alexandria, and following his death his successors there became the Ptolemaic dynasty.  Ptolemy II was persuaded to establish the Great Library, and it accumulated a vast wealth of learning from the many travelers passing through it.  Alexandria became a centre of both Greek and Jewish culture, for example the Septuagint being written there.  But it was essentially a cosmopolitan city, and the ideas from many cultures were melded there.   \nThe two main influences I believe that contributed to the development of the concept of resurrection and an after-life were 1) the Jewish exposure to Egyptian burial practices with its belief in an after-life; 2) their exposure to Platonic philosophy, with its concept of an eternal soul, its theory of ideals, and the concept of the One.  The hierarchy in Jerusalem, the priestly caste with its temple cult, who later became the Sadducees, rejected this notion, but it took root among the Pharisaic  movement, which also happens to owe something to Persia, particularly Zoroastrianism, dualistic notions of good and evil.   \nIn the Gospel of John, we read that Jesus asserted that Abraham saw His day and was glad, and he quotes David’s psalm “The Lord said to my lord ‘Sit at my right hand … “.  It is very clear that Jesus embraced this idea of an after-life, and seems to make the claim that the concept was always present in Hebraic thought.  \nThe most avid of the early churches missionaries seem to have been the Hellenists, who with their Greek culture, were able to embrace this fundamental Christian belief, so that together with the ideas of brotherly love and high moral standards, it became the principal stamp of Christianity.\n\n","date":"August 2, 2014 at 4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/02/the-key-to-understand-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-141875","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?","post":"Long before Cyrius, Isaiah prophesied;\n“Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.

This part of Isaiah is indeed written by the prophet that exegetes call “First Isaiah”, either Isaiah himself or his contemporary followers about 740-700 BCE. \nThe USCCB version includes the following note concerning this verse:\n“[26:19] This verse refers not to resurrection of the dead, but to the restoration of the people; cf. Ez 37. The population of Judah was radically reduced by the slaughter and deportations that the historical disasters of the late eighth and seventh centuries B.C. brought upon the country. In this context, a major concern for the future was for an increase in the population, a rebirth of the nation’s life.”\nThe verse needs to be read within the context of those preceding it v.v 1-18.  \nNevertheless, regardless of prophecies relating to resurrection and the after-life, and we might include Isaiah’s enigmatic prophecies of the suffering servant (e.g. ‘my servant shall prosper … ) which have similar messianic themes, they could only take root among the people where there was the fertile soil to do so.  They could only be understood where there was a capability of understanding.   Any development of resurrection theology occurred late in Jewish thought, and it was not universally accepted among them.  It was certainly not the view of the hierarchy isolated from such influences in Jerusalem, notwithstanding the proclamations of any prophets.  The evangelists, particularly John, have Jesus pointing out that this message could still be inferred even from the ancient scriptures.\n\n","date":"August 3, 2014 at 5:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/02/the-key-to-understand-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-141955","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?","post":"Hi Dave, I do believe God communicated with the Gentiles (e.g ancient Egyptians, Persians..etc) in some manner. I’ve always found fascinating that Ankh (the letter for eternal life in the Egyptian hieroglyphs) AKA “the key of life” was in the shape of a cross. However I think that message was intended to the Gentiles and not to God’s chosen people (Why would God use pagan religion to communicate a message to His people when He can speak to His people directly through the prophets). I find no evidence for any “fertile soil” in their hearts since they completely missed the point when the “suffering servant” actually came. The soil of their (and our) hearts are only properly prepared by the Holy Spirit. Jesus had to go through the prophesies to explain what they actually meant.\n“How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
