[{"title":"The Shroud as Reasons to Believe in the Resurrection","post":"For my own tastes, a faith that exists prior to facts and not held up by them, is a faith not worth having. Dalton mentions the historical reasons for believing in the resurrection, like the empty tomb, and these have been important for me too. For anyone interested, here is a piece I just wrote on a particularly important slice of those historical reasons:\nhttps://www.circleofa.org/library/articles/resurrection-actually-happen/\n\n","date":"April 17, 2012 at 5:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/17/the-shroud-as-reasons-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10480","author":"Robert","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud as Reasons to Believe in the Resurrection","post":"Teilhard predicted a convergence of science & religion and that seems to me where we are going. I think the bias against science as a grounds for faith expressed by some represents a misunderstanding of where science is heading. Scientific and philosophical determinism dominated science until the beginning of he 20th century when the incongruities of quantum mechanics revealed destroyed the basic assumptions of determinism and revealed realty to be conscious driven and devoid of “common sense.” \nThe Determinists included Newton, Darwin, Freud, Marx and Adam Smith. The end result was that free will was discarded as a myth and we acted in accordance with a myriad of circumstances that determined our action. The seeds of quantum mechanics were planted around the turn of the twentieth century, at the same time that science through Pia’s photography demonstrated the image on the Shroud to be the image of a tortured and crucified man who could only be Jesus Christ.\nThe complaint about the Shroud is that it lacks “provenance” – a demonstrated history. But the physical facts of the Shroud demonstrate through scientific examination establish its authenticity.\nWhen one places the collapse of determinism that is intrinsic in quantum mechanics along the side the development of Shroud Science, the question arises is not provenance, but providence.\n(Some determined atheists may argue that quantum mechanics does not refute determinism, but their arguments smack more of desperation than logic.)\n\n","date":"April 17, 2012 at 10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/17/the-shroud-as-reasons-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10494","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud as Reasons to Believe in the Resurrection","post":"Thanks to all for the stimulating conversation!\nThe image from Blessed John Paul II’s encyclical Fides et Ratio comes to mind. “Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth.”  These two modes of knowledge are mutually dependent in such a way that, if we eliminate either one, we get nowhere.  \nIt seems to me that we are used to arguing that reason presupposes faith, but not so much vice versa.  For example, a good scientist, if he is going to make any progress, must trust other good scientists without attempting to prove everything himself.  But it is also true that every believer must first have atleast a working knowledge of the concepts he believes.  You can’t believe, for example, that God is omnipotent if you don’t know what omnipotence means.  In this way, we may say that faith presupposes reason.\nEven the empty tomb works as an argument that appeals to human reason before calling upon faith.  This is stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:\n“The empty tomb was still an essential sign for all. Its discovery by the disciples was the first step toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrection. …The disciple “whom Jesus loved” affirmed that when he entered the empty tomb and discovered “the linen cloths lying there”, “he saw and believed”. This suggests that he realized FROM THE EMPTY TOMB’S CONDITION that the absence of Jesus’ body could not have been of human doing and that Jesus had not simply returned to earthly life as had been the case with Lazarus (CCC 640).\nIf the Shroud helped John move from reason to faith, why shouldn’t it do the same today?\n\n","date":"April 18, 2012 at 1:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/17/the-shroud-as-reasons-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10544","author":"Andrew Dalton","site":"shroudstory"}]
