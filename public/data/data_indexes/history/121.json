[{"title":"Paper Chase:  The Conspiracy Against the Shroud","post":"I question Dave of New Zealand’s implication that progressives in the modernist controversy in the Catholic church were promoting “reductionist liberalism.” The primary doctrine of Christianity is that Jesus is alive in a new life with God and if you follow Jesus the same good thing can happen to you. The doctrines about the incarnation, trinity, virgin birth, and papal infallibility are secondary matters. I think the disagreements between progressive and conservatives was over tertiary matters. Liberal Christians do not believe in life after death. They think that life ends in the grave, and we are better off knowing this so we can concentrate on achieving self-realization and serving our fellow human beings. \nThe resurrection of Jesus is an historical event that can’t be explained in terms of any other historical event. The best explanation for the Shroud of Turin, in my opinion, is that it was generated by Gnostics in the 1st or 2nd century using a crucified victim and methods that have been lost to history. The Holy Shroud and the Resurrection are two separate reasons to believe in Jesus. Chevalier and Thurston may not have understood the miraculous nature of the Holy Shroud and were ignoring that fact that it is a reason to believe in Jesus. Advocates of the authenticity of the Shroud are confusing the resurrection of Jesus as an historical event and the resurrection of Jesus as an object of faith.\n\n","date":"December 23, 2012 at 11:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/23/paper-chase-the-conspiracy-against-the-shroud/","cat":"history","id":"comment-21019","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  The Conspiracy Against the Shroud","post":"“Modernism” in the early 20th century covered a very broad spectrum of ideas, with its various promoters holding them to various degrees and with a variety of interpretations – ‘quot homines, tot sententiae’!  The encyclical of Pope St Pius X.”Pascendi Dominici Gregis” September 8, 1907, which the historian Anne Fremantle has described as “longest of encyclicals”, sought to address the problem.  I’m afraid it makes for some fairly tiresome and heavy reading.and could only recommend it to serious students of the movement,  A more succinct syllabus of errors “Lamentabili Sane” of July 3, 1907 lists some 65 specific errors to be condemned.  You can probably find both encyclicals by simply googling on “modernism encyclical Pius X”.  The various errors are not ranked as ‘primary’, ‘secondary’ nor ‘tertiary’ but all are equally condemned \nModernism seems to have had its primary roots in much of the 19th century biblical exegesis carried out by various German Protestant studies taken to excess.  Catholic biblical studies have moved on since the early 1900s and encyclicals starting with the time of Pope Pius XII to our present Pope Benedict XVI, have actively promoted serious scholarship and biblical studies.  \nReaders can come to their own conclusions as to whether they can accept David Roemer’s thesis: “The best explanation for the Shroud of Turin, in my opinion, is that it was generated by Gnostics in the 1st or 2nd century using a crucified victim and methods that have been lost to history.”  I know of no evidence that would support such a position and cannot concur with it.  With their emphasis on the spiritual, “true knowledge” and denial of the significance of the corporeal, Gnostics would have no good reason to manufacture such a relic.  Contrariwise, David Roemer apparently asserts “the miraculous nature of the Holy Shroud” – the two positions are mutually contradictory.  The Holy Shroud may be miraculous, or it may not,  Many readers seem to consider that while the Shroud is providential, it is but naturalistic.\n\n","date":"December 23, 2012 at 4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/23/paper-chase-the-conspiracy-against-the-shroud/","cat":"history","id":"comment-21031","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  The Conspiracy Against the Shroud","post":"It all depends on the kind of Gnostics to which reference is being made.

It is an accurate observation that there was a  reaction against the Shroud epitomized by Thurston and Chevalier. But that was then and this is now. I don’t anyone would confuse me with a conservative but I find that the evidence for the authenticity of the Shroud is overwhelming and that the issues raised by the Shroud are quite germane to the direction of the Church and science.\nIt would not surprise me if it were some conservatives who might be dragging there heels now. The Shroud is a revelation that will ultimately be beyond the control of any particular faction of the Church or society. It leads us towards profound issues of consciousness and existence at the quantum level. It is no accident that most of the analytical devices that have revealed so much about the Shroud in fact function at the quantum level. It was the photon that ushered in quantum mechanics and it is photons of light we receive and analyze from the Shroud.\nThe only comparison as to its impact as revelation I can make is probably Guttenberg’s bible. Hang on to your hats brothers and sisters, it may be a bumpy ride.\n\n","date":"December 24, 2012 at 2:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/23/paper-chase-the-conspiracy-against-the-shroud/","cat":"history","id":"comment-21049","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  The Conspiracy Against the Shroud","post":"I can take John’s point that every generation has its preoccupations and challenges.  The issues faced by a Pius X were certainly different from those now faced by a Benedict XVI, and the world is very different now.  From the time of Pia’s photographs in 1898 however, here was independent testimony to a real suffering Christ, no mere archetypal myth derived from the seasonal dying and resurrected autumn god to be resurrected in the spring according to ancient myths, as a reductionist liberalism might have it, but a real Christ who had suffered and died as recorded in the gospels.  It had to be the beginning of a true awakening.  \nJohn’s mention of quantum mechanics, brings to mind that even in 1905, the renown physicist Ernst Mach was still able to deny the very existence of atoms.  Today subatomic particles are the stuff of everyday life in our communications, and our understanding of material existence.  The political emphasis has now shifted away from the concerns of European national.states of those times, to the global village and political awakenings in Asia and Africa.  The interim has seen the rise and fall of Soviet Communism, two major world conflicts, civil wars, an Arab Spring, and the rise of radical Islam   There is now the potential for some fool with the power to do so, to destroy this fragile planet from the very stuff of quantum physics, through nuclear destruction.  In the meantime, the rest of us set about doing much the same in a questionably more benign manner by industrial pollution, the elimination of the Creator’s work through the destruction of species, and continue to exploit the vulnerable through their forced labour in sweat shops. \nThe image of the suffering Christ depicted on the Shroud may awaken us to His reality in history or herstory as the case may be;  We can ask why this had to happen;  Was this the Redeemer of humankind?  Did His sufferings open the gates of heaven as the old theology would have it?   Or else we can go deeper and ask what was the message of this god-man?  That message was Love!  Real love, without reservation!  He asks that we follow Him in His example of Love!  This man was certainly a radical, overturning conventions that imprisoned the culture of His time.  To probe deeper into the message is the task that every generation must pursue each in their own era, to bring about God’s kingom on earth. \nMay the blessings of Christmas be yours:  To Yannick, Max, Chris, John, Gabriel, Anoxie, Kelly to David, Davor Colin and Hugh and all those who regularly contribute to this wonderful site, and especially to Dan who keeps us all attuned with such regular and provocative postings.that we may become all the more enlightened.\n\n","date":"December 24, 2012 at 6:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/23/paper-chase-the-conspiracy-against-the-shroud/","cat":"history","id":"comment-21054","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  The Conspiracy Against the Shroud","post":"The critical issues that the Church will have to tackle are very deep and do not involve the TS.
