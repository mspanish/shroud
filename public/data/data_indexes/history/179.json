The cleaning process happens in a closed bath, and I do not know if any note was taken of the colour of the waste cleaning fluid to see if it had extracted anything. Probably not. They then tested pure, uncontaminated, specimens. If cotton was an intregral part of the specimen, then they tested that. If it was merely a surface contaminent, then they didn’t. They did not fail to identify contaminents. Oxford even sent a thread off to have it identified, while others mention, in particular, red silk fibres and shreds of wax. These were removed.\nSo what was Rogers’s cotton, dye and gum arabic? The answer may lie in his Diagram 18, in Scientific Method Applied to the Shroud of Turin (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers2.pdf). Although it is labelled “UV Fluorescence photograph” it looks nothing like one, and much more like an ordinary photo, but that doesn’t matter here. What is important is that the backing cloth under the Raes sample area is bright white, while the rest of it is much darker. This suggests to me that some attempt was made to stain the backing cloth to make it ‘fit’ the shroud better, quite possibly by smearing it with a cotton pad damp with a mixture of dye and gum arabic. Such a process would only affect the surfaces in contact with the cloth (which is why the backing cloth under the Shroud stayed white) and liberally scatter cotton, dye and gum over the margins of the shroud.\nNeedless to say, all this gunk was removed and had no effect on the C14 dating.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2014 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/20/the-idea-of-something-being-authentic-is-just-too-powerful/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73926","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The idea of something being authentic is \"just too powerful\"","post":"Hugh, you seem quite convinced the C-14 testing, and subsequent results, are impeccable.

Just because one man, even if he is the editor, throws doubt on one particular hypothesis doesn’t of itself mean that the question of authenticity is solved, and even if it were, it would not detract from the fascination the image inspires of so many people, and its pre-eminent position as an icon of Christianity.\nI don’t know how many “opponents of the Shroud” Jeff knows, or knows about. I know several, and can assure him that they are not “willfully determined to ignore any evidence favouring authenticity.” On the contrary, I often find that the reverse is the case. There are commenters on this very blog who declare something along the lines of “either the Shroud is genuine or it is the work of Satan so anybody who denies its veracity is one of his ministers.”\nI am inclined towards a 13th century origin for the Shroud, mostly on the basis of the C14 date which I do not think has been satisfactorily discredited. If that makes me an ‘opponent,’ I should be grateful to know if there is any evidence at all that I appear to have ‘willfully determined to ignore.’\n\n","date":"January 21, 2014 at 3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/20/the-idea-of-something-being-authentic-is-just-too-powerful/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73976","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The idea of something being authentic is \"just too powerful\"","post":"It is true that the C14 date has not been satisfactorily discredited in scientific papers, however there are also many doubts about the entire procedure beginning at Turin and ending with the three laboratories that have not been satisfactorily answered.\nNow on another recent thread I was indirectly accused of “over-speculation” when it came to the Jospice Mattress Imprint, and also had to read that both this image and the one on the TS were possibly the work of artists. I will leave the question about an artist and theTS to Shroudies who have better images and data.

I don’t know where you get your age-range from. The Nature paper gave 1390-1260, although I believe 1330-1260 is a better assessment.\nAs for a 13th century creation. if the image is intended to represent Christ it is hardly surprising that it shows the marks of the wounds as listed in the Gospel. How accurate they are we cannot guess, in the absence of any archaeological evidence – they may be hopelessly wrong. And it was not necessarily a deliberate forgery by a far fetched cult. Byzantine Christianity specifically requires that mass be said on a symbolic shroud, Byzantine altars are wrapped in symbolic shrouds, and Byzantine priests are given a symbolic shroud when they are ordained. Symbolic shrouds are paraded through the streets at Easter tide. Many of these are elaborately decorated with representations of the dead Christ. There were, and are, a lot of symbolic shrouds about.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2014 at 7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/20/the-idea-of-something-being-authentic-is-just-too-powerful/","cat":"history","id":"comment-74028","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The idea of something being authentic is \"just too powerful\"","post":"Letter from Theodore Angelos-Komnenos to Pope Innocent III complaining of pillage: “most sacred of all, the linen … Our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before his resurrection …in Athens.” Clearly it was no longer in Constantinople after 1204, but was headed to western Europe, where there there seems to have been little appreciation that altar cloths had burial cloth significance. Hardly corroborative of a Byzantine 13th c. creation therefore!\nAlternatively: Vignon, De Lage, Barbet, Willis, Bucklin and Zugibe, to name only a few forensic pathologists all agree that the wounds are anatomically accurate, and differ only in matters of minor detail.  Conclusion would then have to be some genius Byzantine found a suitable victim matching the facial features of the then known Mandylion in wide circulation, and inflicted on him the punishment described in the gospels, as well as having the secret of how to create an image that has eluded the scientific establishment to this day.  It doesn’t have legs, Hugh, and can’t run!
