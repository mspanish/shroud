When one of them was dead, the husband’s coat of arm was placed at heraldic “senestre” (this according to a use & custom that prevailed till the 19th c CE in France), which means the reliquary keep was made when Geoffroy of Charny was still alive while the badge in se, most likely dates back to late 14th- early 15th c.

Actually de Weselow pays little interest to proving that the Shroud once covered Jesus’ body, and his arguments to this point are nothing extraordinary -one doesn’t need PhD in art history (or anything) just some plain common sense. The actual history of the Shroud is largely irrelevant to him. I have got impression that he is interested only in attacking and disproving Christianity, and the Shroud itself is only a mean to achieve this goal.
