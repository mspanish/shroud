[{"title":"Hard to buy the made in the 1340s line of dogma","post":"I read both postings. The second one on the “historical reconstruction” is very close to the papers by Markwardt (Antioch) and Scavone (Othon de la Roche / Besancon / Jeanne de Vergy / etc).  However no credit is given to these two authors in Mike Flynn’s article.  I suspect the web page is a “digest” version based on their papers.  The reconstruction is very close to my own opinion.  However recent comments by Charles Freeman, O.K. and others on this site, indicate that other entirely different explanations may well be viable.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2013 at 4:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/29/hard-to-buy-the-made-in-the-1340s-line-of-dogma/","cat":"history","id":"comment-42347","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
