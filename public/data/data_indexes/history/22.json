However it comes about third hand: Arcaulf saw something, which some believed was a burial cloth of Christ; Arcaulf recites what he recalls seeing to Adamnan the Abbot of Iona, and perhaps Adamnan’s scribe or someone to whom Adamnan retells the story sets it down in writing, perhaps colouring it with his own pious perspectives and world view. I think there can be little doubt that Arcaulf did see a cloth which some firmly believed to be a burial cloth of Christ, and it was probably subject to some kind of “trial by fire”. I seem to recall Wilson’s retelling of the story suggesting it may have been the origin of the poker holes, but there are better explanations for these (incense grains). Wilson does mention a separate Arab source, referring to a burial cloth which had been tested in “trials of fire and of water”. \nWe still have to explain how Arcaulf’s cloth found its way to Constantinople, although from Scavone’s text of sources, there seem to be plenty of potential candidate cloths there. We certainly know how the Edessa mandylion arrived there. \nHow many other stories might there be telling of the journeys and destinations of Christ’s burial cloths? There seem to be several in the various apocryphal gospels and acts of pseudonymous apostles, and others. Might any of them have any substance?\n\n","date":"January 14, 2014 at 7:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73293","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Matthias: Sorry OK I find this theory weak. Too much speculation is involved, a lot more than Wilson’s theory.\nWell, I have written that I actually prefer Wilson’s theory over that. But I think a case could be built for Arculfus Shroud being the Shroud of Turin, if one rejects Wilson’s, like Yannick for example.\nDave: How many other stories might there be telling of the journeys and destinations of Christ’s burial cloths? There seem to be several in the various apocryphal gospels and acts of pseudonymous apostles, and others. Might any of them have any substance?\nI have written a long article in Polish about all the relics of burial cloths venerated through the centuries, that were known to me (see footnote 3). I was discussing only objects which existence were testified by witnesses whosaw them with their own eyes, excluding various legends about St. Luke, or Pilate’s wife possesing some burial cloths.\nWhat I recommend to read, is Remi van Haelst article in footnote 4. It gave a lot of info to me.\nThere is a very interesting problem of Charlemagne’s relics -we know that around the year 800 he obtained, either from Jerusalem or Constantinople, two burial cloths, or possibly representative copies of them, the large Sudarium Domini, currently stored in Kornelimünster, and the so called Sindon Munda, divided between Kornelimünster and Compiègne. If we combine the two halves of the latter, we obtain a cloth about 4 metres long, 1 wide, very similar to the Shroud of Turin. Next comes the matter of Stuttgart Psalter, which was raised by Maxa Patricka von Hamon.\nThe problem of the burial clothes is very complex, and its hard to find a satisfactory solution to it.\n\n","date":"January 14, 2014 at 8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73298","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"And BTW, I also recommend checking this: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi05part4.pdf\nNeither Scavone’s nor Savio’s lists of documents are complete, I think.\n\n","date":"January 14, 2014 at 8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73300","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"I really appreciate the effort that has gone into this and other posts but I wonder if this issue of the Shroud’s early provenance will ever be resolved definitively. The question is: how much should this bother us? While it would be a lot easier if we had warehouse receipts and shipping labels, we are never going to have in my opinion, a definitive  provenance of the Shroud from the tomb to Constantinople and I doubt we will ever have a definitive provenance from Constantinople to Lirey. It does make for great debates though. Personally, I have a tendency to doubt the details of the Templar theory. The Templar’s have become the “usual suspects” of medieval history.\nWhile we may never know the complete provenance of the Shroud., we  have learned a great deal. Most importantly in my view,  we have  two related physical facts: the blood stains and the image. Science has come a long way in unlocking these mysteries. It is definitely blood, but the nature of the mechanism that transferred the image from the body of tortured, crucified man to the Shroud remains a mystery. \nScience has gone along ways toward resolving the issue of the blood and identifying what the image is not: it was not created by any process we have been able to discern.\nJust as science has given us a definite answer to the blood issue (and it has), science may one day give us a definite solution to the image issue. I suspect that when it does, the answer will be the Resurrection. And unlike some, I like Teilhard, see science as an ally not an enemy of religion. I also believe that somewhere in the chaotic world of quantum mechanics will lie solutions to the many religious mysteries and the answers will not be bad for religion.\nI am reminded of Rabbi Hillel’s formulation of the Golden Rule and then adding: “Everything else is commentary.” As far as the provenance issue is concerned, solving the problem of image formation is paramount. Giving the impossibility of resolving the issues of where the Shroud was when it twice disappeared for literally hundreds of years is commentary.\nI have enormous respect for Ian Wilson and what he has done in his work on the Shroud. I don’t know if this is common knowledge, but it isn’t a secret. David Rolfe’s 1978 landmark “Silent Witness” began with a proposal by Ian Wilson circa 1974. Outside of that,  I personally believe that Ian’s most important contribution, may be in bringing  the Vignon markings to a greater audience. I also believe, as illusive as they may seem, the Vignon markings in art outside  of the  Shroud itself, are the most compelling evidence of the pre-Constantinople provenance of the Shroud with the emergence of the markings as an artistic convention. \nI find this debate interesting, but I honestly believe that the pre-Constantinople provenance of the Shroud has disappeared into the mists of time. But just like the bones of a dinosaur discovered today, the physical existence of the Shroud testify to  its previous existence.\n\n","date":"January 14, 2014 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73299","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"“I really appreciate the effort that has gone into this and other posts but I wonder if this issue of the Shroud’s early provenance will ever be resolved definitively.

A further medieval date and I’d concede, and we would then still have a great mystery as to provenance to solve.\nA date around the time of Christ and it’s a different story.\n\n","date":"January 14, 2014 at 8:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73302","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K.","post":"Thanks for the compliment and I agree in part. Yes, we should have another carbon dating but under a real protocol and only in conjunction with tests that the sample area(s) are not anomalous. Also, since 1978, scientific analysis has made great strides. A new examination now might be  to STURP as  STURP was to Secondo Pia.

I still think that Ian Wilson’s Tetradiplon hypothesis is viable but will need modifications. He did ask Pope John Paul II, to whom he dedicated the book “Holy Faces, Secret Places”, for some ‘glasnost’ in the Vatican. For reasons stated more than once on this blog this will apparently not be possible, there will have to be a change in direction in the realm of Shroud studies for Shroudies to gain the confidence of the authorities. \nThe constructive criticism we see in shroudstory, which is not restricted to chummies, can help pave the way for Shroudies in general to learn from mistakes and change attitudes. Who knows, it may even lead to the ‘glasnost’, that petitions to Rome have not been able to obtain.\n\n","date":"January 14, 2014 at 10:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","id":"comment-73312","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
