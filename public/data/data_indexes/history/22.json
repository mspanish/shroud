Particularly impressive is Prof. Joseph’s challenge to the revisionist school of Christian theology that would deny anything miraculous and divine about Christ and reinterpret him as an interesting personalty who had some good (and bad) ideas.\nPersonally, I believe that some day we shall meet the story at the quantum level where the primordial self-conscious from which our existence sprang has left its fingerprints. Isn’t therre an old hymn: Lets Gather at the River?\nDavid Rolfe has challenged Richard Dawkins and by extension the militant atheist cult. But, Prof. Joseph as done in a much needed explanation of how the Shroud also challenges theologians. \nThe Shroud is here. it’s real. it’s not going away.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 10:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/29/paper-chase-distinctive-features-of-the-shroud-that-have-yet-to-be-explained-and-their-correlation-with-historical-jesus-research/","cat":"history","id":"comment-15558","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: distinctive features of the Shroud that have yet to be explained and their correlation with Historical Jesus research.","post":"There is already extensive comment on this paper on this site’s posting of August 26 “Barrie Schwortz Announces (etc)”, beginning with my own comments at #5.

Personally, I think it’s highly likely.  But it doesn’t seem to have been adequately written up or corroborated.  There are differing points of view about it.  And, as you must well know, a historian can’t use a debatable document as a primary source, until it’s been adequately proven in the crucible.  That’s why the Shroud can’t be used in the movement searching for the “Historical Jesus”.  I’m sure Professor Joseph must realise that, if he’s involved in that movement.  I think he might have been “testing the water” to gauge reactions.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 9:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/29/paper-chase-distinctive-features-of-the-shroud-that-have-yet-to-be-explained-and-their-correlation-with-historical-jesus-research/","cat":"history","id":"comment-15591","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: distinctive features of the Shroud that have yet to be explained and their correlation with Historical Jesus research.","post":"I hadn’t hardly started reading this paper when I came upon this comment in the paper, “Crossan also proposes that Jesus’ crucified body was not buried, but thrown in a common grave and eaten by dogs,” which reflects gross ignorance on Crossan’s part.  The Scriptures are themselves historical records, so to ignore the eyewitness accounts of the writers is to ignore history itself.  This sounds similar to the Jesus Movement, an extension which ignores the evidence to propose outlandish theories based in nothing but the imagination.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 6:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/29/paper-chase-distinctive-features-of-the-shroud-that-have-yet-to-be-explained-and-their-correlation-with-historical-jesus-research/","cat":"history","id":"comment-15576","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: distinctive features of the Shroud that have yet to be explained and their correlation with Historical Jesus research.","post":"On that topic, I think Crossan only focus on the common practice that was done in most parts of the Roman empire.  I think the footnote #23 of my recent paper (the one Andy helped me to translate in English by the way !) could help to understand the particular context of Jesus burial versus the normal Roman procedure that was applied in most parts of the Roman empire at the time.  Here it is : “In his article Crucifixion in Antiquity – The anthropological evidence, renowned archaeologist Joe Zias states: “Giving the victim a proper burial following death on the cross, during the Roman period was rare and in most cases simply not permitted in order to continue the humiliation. Thus the victim was in many cases simply thrown on the garbage dump of the city…” (http://www.joezias.com/CrucifixionAntiquity.html). It’s interesting to note that the same conclusion can also be found in the excellent article Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion, written by Matthew W. Maslen and Piers D. Mitchell. On the other hand, we have to understand that the description given by Zias and taken by Maslen and Mitchell concerning the Roman practice in general, and it is truly possible that the procedure could have been different in Palestine at the time of Jesus. In the documentary The Wonder of the Shroud, Fr. Martin Haigh, quoting the book The New Testament and Rabinnic Judaism, written by the distinguished Jewish writer David Daube, states that the normal procedure in Palestine during the first century A.D. was to throw the body of crucified victims into a common grave and only after a year, the family was hallowed to collect the bones (in order to place them in an ossuary and bury them in a family tomb). We can also a very similar description in the book La Passion de Jésus : De Gethsémani au Sépulcre, written by Jean-Maurice Clercq, a French doctor, but with an interesting precision, i.e. that this very particular procedure came from a description that is found in the Talmud, which is a text written after the time of Jesus. Personal note: no matter if the correct procedure at the time of Jesus was the one described by Zias, Maslen and Mitchell or the one described by Daube and Clercq, we must always assume that, under Roman law, it wasn’t a normal procedure to allow a condemned person (Jew or other) to be buried in a clean burial shroud after his execution by crucifixion.  That can explain why the Gospels emphasised the fact that Joseph of Arimathea had to ask permission to Pilate to take the corpse of Jesus in order to give him a decent burial. That can also explain the presence of a post-mortem wound in the side of the man of the Shroud… Effectively, this type of post-mortem injury to the chest was surely done by one of those who were in charge of the crucifixion to make sure the victim was really dead. This kind of post-mortem procedure is logical only in the case a “special” permission was given to take the body, in order to give him a decent burial.”\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 7:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/29/paper-chase-distinctive-features-of-the-shroud-that-have-yet-to-be-explained-and-their-correlation-with-historical-jesus-research/","cat":"history","id":"comment-15579","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: distinctive features of the Shroud that have yet to be explained and their correlation with Historical Jesus research.","post":"There is very little historical evidence pertaining to crucifixion, so most historical comments are based from writings and speculations…The reason Jesus was lanced in the side was because they found he was already dead, otherwise they would have broken his legs (This is clearly stated in John20 ).

Also, it is not ‘probably’ why Jesus and the thiefs were taken down, it was EXACTLY why they were taken down! In the case of the thiefs though, (assuming they were not Jews), it was because it was the Sabbath moreso then anyother reason. If it was not the Sabbath a non-Jew criminal would stay hanging. Most scholars and the ‘fact’ you mention is not confirmed and actually refutted by the only crucifixion victim’s bones ever found…A Jewish man’s bones found in a ossuary with a crucifixion nail still thru his heel! It may have well been common for crucified Jews to be entombed properly according to Jewish law.
