No, it’s a University Event…  \nThe Spanish Center is a cultural association Sindonology therefore non-profit organization that aims to study the Shroud of Turin, but also that of other relics that may be or have been scientifically studied.\nJorge Manuel Rodríguez Almenar\nProfessor University of Valencia\nPresident of the Spanish Centre Sindonology (CES)\nWell, if the Catholic Church does not allow access to the Shroud, what is the point? Perhaps this group hopes to influence the Church with such an event?\n\n","date":"November 24, 2011 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/24/international-conference-on-the-shroud-of-turin-in-valencia-next-april/","cat":"history","id":"comment-4969","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"International Conference on The Shroud of Turin in Valencia Next April","post":"I can’t answer your question as it’s a good one but, I know they hold an International conference atleast once a year in different locals. Sometimes more then one. Anyways it would be awesome to be able to attend one of these, as I enjoy listening to many of the speakers that are listed. I would assume Barrie Schwortz will probably cover this conference quite well on his site, atleast I would hope so.\nRon.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2011 at 7:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/24/international-conference-on-the-shroud-of-turin-in-valencia-next-april/","cat":"history","id":"comment-5045","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
