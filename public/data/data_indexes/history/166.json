[{"title":"Ten Reasons to Believe","post":"Fascinating. I had never read of the Man of Sorrows parallels.\nJust on the Pray Manuscript. I find it interesting that Jesus is portrayed with only minimal facial hair. Contrast with the heavily bearded male figures anointing him.\nIndeed historically Jesus has been quite lightly bearded in art.\nOften heavy beards in art denoted wisdom. Logically it would follow that Jesus should be depicted heavily bearded. He often isn’t. Perhaps this is the influence of the relatively lightly bearded face on the Shroud?\n\n","date":"May 6, 2014 at 4:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/06/ten-reasons-to-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-112570","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ten Reasons to Believe","post":"This story is something like the James ossuary, where “brother of Jesus” was added to “James son of Joseph”, apparently as an attempt to pass it off as the genuine article. Whoever did it must have read the NT, known about the interpretation in the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant churches, but not about OT usage, where “Jesus” would be the brother of “Joseph”, not “James”. Since they were all Jews inscriptions would denote the same thing in both periods. It has therefore been said that modern forgers are not bright.\nWe need more concrete evidence, go beyond working hypothesis, to link the Image of Edessa with the TS and hopefully something new should turn up soon. The problem is the always the same: you may be in a hurry but others you depend on are not or are unwilling to cooperate.\n\n","date":"May 6, 2014 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/06/ten-reasons-to-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-112853","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ten Reasons to Believe","post":"I checked all 10 Reasons presented on the site.

In my last presentation, one of the audience questioned the position of the side wound. He said that “according to tradition the wound was on the right side, but the shroud shows the wound on the left.” That’s when I explained the mirror image property of the shroud. However, I was surprised he was so sure it was on the right. It is possible that the artists were also following tradition that the wound was on the right but painted the crossed hands as they saw on the shroud.\n\n","date":"May 7, 2014 at 6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/06/ten-reasons-to-believe/","cat":"history","id":"comment-113633","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ten Reasons to Believe","post":"Yes.There is an obvious corollory, I suppose, which is that Man of Sorrows iconography emerged from epitaphios art in the 13th century, and having achieved a style, was relatively slavishly copied, certainly as to the position of the side wound and the inclination of the head, and the shroud was simply a part of this tradition, modified to represent a reposing rather than an arising Christ, as it was intended to be laid flat rather than elevated.
