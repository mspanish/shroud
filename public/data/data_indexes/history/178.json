I don’t think Indy chose poorly. One can make the case that a fine cup would have been used for such an important occasion as the Passover supper, but I’m inclined to believe it was a simple cup. A seemingly ordinary vessel containing something extraordinary, like Jesus’ human body, the symbolism is perfect. In the end it matters little, for each of us is called to be a holy grail — of greater worth than any ornate goblet.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2014 at 12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/02/the-holy-grail-found-in-spain/","cat":"history","id":"comment-95868","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Holy Grail Found in Spain?","post":"Further to #4, it is important to note that the legends begin to appear only from the late 12th century onwards.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2014 at 12:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/02/the-holy-grail-found-in-spain/","cat":"history","id":"comment-95874","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Holy Grail Found in Spain?","post":"Louis: The Irish Dominican biblical scholar Father Jerome Murphy-O’Connor, an expert in Jerusalem, who died recently, felt that the cup used by Jesus was like the clay cups used by the Essenes.

According to Hesemann and others, clay is ritually unclean, and couldn’t have been used during Passover meal. Instead, stone chalice was probably used -which likely is now in Valencia.”\nAnswer: As far as I know Father Jerome Murphy-O’Connor was a world-renowned biblical scholar, which Hesemann isn’t, so how can such comparison arise? It seems that Hesemann hasn’t done important homework. I have taken photographs of the clay cups and jars used by the Essenes in Qumran and the Pharisees were liberal when compared to them even when it came to ritual purity. It is believed that these clay bowls and cups were meant for storing soup, even for medicinal purposes, in fact one scholar even thought that there was a pottery — not stone — factory in Qumran.\nThis pottery was found by the French Dominican archaeologist Father Roland de Vaux, Qumran excavator and first editor-in-chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls.   \n“The legend, yes. But the cup as a material object existed independently of legend.”\nAnswer: There is no proof that the material object is the authentic one. Sooner or later more cups, chalices and what not will appear together with the claim to the title “true Holy Grail”. Ian Wilson has provided the best explanation for why the legend emerged and, particularly, why Joseph of Arimathea appears there.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2014 at 2:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/02/the-holy-grail-found-in-spain/","cat":"history","id":"comment-95898","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Holy Grail Found in Spain?","post":"It is believed that these clay bowls and cups were meant for storing soup, even for medicinal purposes, in fact one scholar even thought that there was a pottery — not stone — factory in Qumran.\nYes -there were meant for ordinary, everyday use.

Passover? All they had to do was to use clay cups and jars that had never been used and these were available in abundance. I think the Essenes produced this pottery also to exchange it for other kinds of goods like clothes, footwear in Jerusalem and one of their cups may well have landed on the Last Supper table.\nJesus did not bother about ritual purity, he stayed in the house of Simon the leper, in a leper colony, on the way to Jerusalem. The great Israeli scholar Yigael Yadin used this fact\nto buttress his contention that Jesus was anti-Essene and had to show them what he thought about ritual purity. It is the spirit that matters….\n\n","date":"April 2, 2014 at 3:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/02/the-holy-grail-found-in-spain/","cat":"history","id":"comment-95908","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Holy Grail Found in Spain?","post":"The Holy Grail did attract attention in the 12th century, Chretien de Troyes’ Perceval, Eisenbach’s Parsival, various others, and eventually finding its way into Malory’s Arthurian romances. \nHowever Markwardt’s ‘Antioch and the Shroud’ 1998-99, also cites several early Syrian sources, and citing references, in discussing the distribution of Passion relics. Samples: \n“In 1910, local Arabs unearthed, at the traditional site of Antioch’s ancient cathedral,a silver chalice comprised of an unfinished inner cup and a finished outer holder, akin to a reliquary, exquisitely decorated with ten human figures, in two groups of five. Professor William Newbold has noted that only\nin the middle of the first century did two groups of five men each govern the respective Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch and only at such time would a Christian religious object have displayed such a depiction. Dated to the first century and considered genuine by many archeological and scientific\nauthorities, the Great Chalice of Antioch has been called “a most sacred Cup, in all probability the one which once served the Lord and his disciples at the Last Supper, the most precious object in Christian history, legend and tradition”. [p.4]\n“In Syria itself, archeologists have discovered, in fourth-century tombs, amulets and molded figures connected with the life and passion of Christ, including a zigzag lance, the Cup of the Last Supper, and so called “objects from the resurrection of Lazarus”. Were such resurrection objects actually intended to\nrepresent the burial linens of Christ and not those of Lazarus, it could indicate that the lance, the cup, and the Shroud were all copied in Syria during the fourth century. After exhaustively studying the evidence for many years, Professor Gustavus Eisen concluded that these artifacts had, in fact, been modeled upon actual sacred objects that were once kept in seclusion for their safety and were later lost when concealed upon the approach of persecution or war.” [pp 8-9]\n“Hints of a lost Syrian sindonic history are to be found in the legends of the Holy Grail, an object which, in recent years, has been increasingly linked to the Shroud. Some seventy-five years ago, Professor Eisen concluded that the earliest Grail legends attempted to account for the loss of real sacred objects known in fourth-century Syria and that these stories reflected a passionate desire to locate and recover such objects from concealment.” [p.13]\n[daveb]: It would therefore seem that interest in the Grail considerably predates the 12th century, and that they merely reflect an earlier tradition of the loss of the Grail in the 4th century, possibly hidden by the Arian presbyter Theodorus at Antioch in 362AD to conceal them from confiscation under order by the emperor Julian the Apostate. Theodorus would not reveal the hiding places even under torture and eventual martyrdom. The 1910 discovery may in fact be the true cup used at the Last Supper.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/02/the-holy-grail-found-in-spain/","cat":"history","id":"comment-96100","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
