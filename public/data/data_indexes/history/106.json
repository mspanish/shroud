[{"title":"More than you want to know about crucifixion","post":"It is interesting that her article states: the practice of crucifixion was discontinued BECAUSE of Jesus Christ. Constantine abolished it in 337 A.D. \nWhen the Roman Empire is mentioned, what do we think of first? Slave revolts, crucifixions, gladiator events, executions of men and women in the Coliseum, and the terrible tortures of Nero and other heartless emperors. It seems that the Romans are remembered primarily for their extraordinary cruelty. \nI read recently that the Gladiator competitions were discontinued due to public outcry against them. Constantine abolished the games in 325 AD, but Emperor Honorius had to abolish them again less than 100 years later. Like cockfights or dogfights, apparently it’s very hard for some people to give up their taste for violence as entertainment.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2011 at 12:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/13/more-than-you-want-to-know-about-crucifixion/","cat":"history","id":"comment-4798","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"}]
