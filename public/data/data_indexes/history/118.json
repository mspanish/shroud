[{"title":"Paper Chase:  John Iannone’s The Veil of Veronica: Fact or Fiction?","post":"It is true that the image of the St Peter Veronica now, and since some time, has almost completely disappeared. But this favours the hypothesis that the veil is still the same that was in Rome in medieval time. If the present veil was a new copy made at the beginning of 17th century, the image should now be still clearly visible. Indeed looking at the copy now in Vienna (ca. 1617) one may think that already then the original was degraded.\nhttp://veronicaroute.com/1617/04/29/1617/\nPossibly the painter of the Vienna copy did not see the eyes in the original, that had faded away, and painted a face with seemingly closed eyes. Other copies followed with closed eyes.\nThere is no proof that the old frame, still extant in Vatican, had two glasses (or panes of rock crystal). Presently it has one (broken) glass and there is no indication that it had ever had two.\nLastly, needless to say, the Manoppello veil is evidently an earthly painting, not a divine miracle.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2013 at 10:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/18/paper-chase-john-iannones-the-veil-of-veronica-fact-or-fiction/","cat":"history","id":"comment-61983","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  John Iannone’s The Veil of Veronica: Fact or Fiction?","post":"If the present veil was a new copy made at the beginning of 17th century, the image should now be still clearly visible.\nWho said it was a new copy? It could be an old Mandylion-like icon, put in the place of original Veronica. Or it could be deliberately painted in a way that nothing can be seen.\nThere is no proof that the old frame, still extant in Vatican, had two glasses (or panes of rock crystal). Presently it has one (broken) glass and there is no indication that it had ever had two.\nNo indication? Than what was from the back of the frame? Why there is no back cover, which is quite unusual (compare with 1675 frame)? Glass from one side, and empty space from the other!\nLastly, needless to say, the Manoppello veil is evidently an earthly painting, not a divine miracle.\nGian Marco. We are not discussing here whether original Veronica (Manoppello) was divine or man-made artifact. We are discussing here only whether the pre-1600s Veronica is the same as the current Manoppello.\nLastly, needless to say is evidently not an earthly painting, at least not any classical painting we know. The transmitted light photographies show it clearly. The presence of some pigments from touch-ups does not prove it a painting. And I do not worry about the words of militant sceptic Gian Marco Rinaldi, who cannot distinguish  between paintings of the transparent Veil and the transparent Veil itself. The real miracle would be if one day he changes his biased views.\nSee http://manoppello.eu/eng/index.php?go=badania\n\n","date":"December 19, 2013 at 5:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/18/paper-chase-john-iannones-the-veil-of-veronica-fact-or-fiction/","cat":"history","id":"comment-62662","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  John Iannone’s The Veil of Veronica: Fact or Fiction?","post":"No indication?

There is only a small splintering in the glass pane. So what?\nI add that in the same Frascati 2010 paper by Falcinelli, just above its Fig. 15 that you have reproduced in your link, he quotes a sentence by Giacomo Grimaldi, early 17th century, where one, and only one glass is mentioned. Perhaps there had formerly been two glasses, but where have you found the information?\n\n","date":"December 20, 2013 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/18/paper-chase-john-iannones-the-veil-of-veronica-fact-or-fiction/","cat":"history","id":"comment-63393","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  John Iannone’s The Veil of Veronica: Fact or Fiction?","post":"I have written to Roberto Falcinelli himself and he has kindly sent me another photo with a detail of that corner of the frame. There is only a small splintering in the glass pane. So what?\nCould you show that photo? Looking from that Fig. 15 one gets impression there is something (a piece of glass?) in that corner. Looking at the right photo and following course of the cracks, one can get the orientation of the frame on the left photo. Then there is that long diagonal crack going through the whole pane. On the left picture, in that particular corner, it intersects with the line  parallel to the other cracks, which create a triangle shape there. But this “crack” is not visible on the right photo, suggesting the “triangle” is in front of the pane. It is definetly not that small splintering visible on the right photo.\nAnyway, the frame looks quite symmetrical -and it is likely there were two glasses originally.\n\n","date":"December 20, 2013 at 4:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/18/paper-chase-john-iannones-the-veil-of-veronica-fact-or-fiction/","cat":"history","id":"comment-63484","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  John Iannone’s The Veil of Veronica: Fact or Fiction?","post":"O.K., if you contact Roberto Falcinelli, he is ready to share the details of his examination of the frame and his photographic documentation.
