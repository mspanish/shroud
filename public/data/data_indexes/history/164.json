I am a Historian and Author, who has studied and written about the Templecombe panel. I have also had two recent visits by Rex Morgan, who has assisted me with all his research papers, including lab results of particulate samples taken from between the grooves of the Templecombe panel by his collegue Dr E. Nitowski, which provided some very interesting results. \nThe Carbon 14 dating for this artifact is between 1280 and 1340. It now hangs in a special exhibition room at the Bishops Palace, Wells, Somerset.\nAre you also aware that another ‘head’ exists? It is from Temple Cloud Somerset. This head is wooden, and carved in relief. It has recently been Carbon 14 dated, and is of almost identical date to the Templecombe panel. The chuch where it was found was in the possesion of the Knights Templar.\nI would argue that there is a strong possibility that this is another example of a Templar ‘Idol’, or as Dr Frale would say ‘Simulacra’. \nAll this, including Dr Nitowski’s findings, and Rex Morgan’s research are included in my latest book ‘Glastonbury, the Templars and the Sovran Cloth’ published by the History Press 2012.\n   Juliet Faith\n\n","date":"April 26, 2013 at 3:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/18/templecombe-and-the-shroud-of-turin-continued/","cat":"history","id":"comment-31940","author":"Juliet Faith","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Templecombe and the Shroud of Turin (Continued)","post":"The Templecombe panel was radiocarbon dated between 1280 and 1440 (not 1340).\n\n","date":"April 26, 2013 at 6:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/18/templecombe-and-the-shroud-of-turin-continued/","cat":"history","id":"comment-31991","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Templecombe and the Shroud of Turin (Continued)","post":"Dr Gowlett of the Oxford Radiocarbon Excelerator Unit (ORAU) examined the samples, and his conclusion was that the wood was cut between 1280 and 1310 plus or minus 60 years.

This can allude at one and the same time to Yeshua as “la Bocca della Verità” (see Revelation), the already famous “Bocca della Verità” in Rome (literally “the Mouth of Truth” in Italian, an ancient stone mask from the Classical period that represents the river god Okeanos  with an open mouth, wide eyes and a flowing mane of hair much like both Yeshua’s  Holy Face of the Veronica Veil (also in Rome) and that of the Holy Face of the Holy Hemation/Sindon (i.e. Yeshua’s burial Sindon kept “tetradiplon” within a wooden reliquary-table or monstrance so as to leave only the face visible through a vast circular central opening on front side).
