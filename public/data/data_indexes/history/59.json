[{"title":"Eusebius on the Discovery of the Holy Sepulchre","post":"“It sounds like a human figure like the Shroud of Turin has.” I don’t follow this. The meaning of the passage seems to be that just as Jesus had been in darkness and then returned to light, so the sepulchre had been in darkness and was now exposed to light. There is no suggestion of any actual ‘human figure.’\nAnd yes, vast areas of the sepulchre and its surrounds are covered in marble. The chances that the ‘bench’ underneath is still covered in blood are, I think, rather slim.\n\n","date":"September 19, 2014 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/19/eusebius-on-the-discovery-of-the-holy-sepulchre/","cat":"history","id":"comment-152466","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Eusebius on the Discovery of the Holy Sepulchre","post":"Thanks, Dan for the link to the Eusebius translated text.  I found it a fascinating document and scanned quickly through most of the 75 individual chapters.\nEusebius has his critics;  some say he was undiscriminating and uncritical in the choice of some of his sources.  He is said to have been a little iconoclast in his consideration of images.  I have heard of no traditions saying that the burial cloths were ever left in the tomb.  On the contrary, there are a few traditions that others had them, including Peter, St Luke and PIlate’s wife.  If they were ever taken, it would seem unlikely they were ever returned to the tomb.  On the other hand, given Eusebius’ reputation against imagery, would he have been likely to have specifically mentioned the images if the cloths had been there? \nInterestingly, it is Eusebius, who in his Ecclesiastical History, mentions his discovery of the Doctrine of Addai with its reference to Abgar V Ukkama in the archives of Edessa, but again he does not mention any reference to the portrait mentioned in later versions. \nOn the other hand, he does specifically describe the details of Constantine’s battle standard in his ‘Life of Constantine’.\n\n","date":"September 19, 2014 at 4:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/19/eusebius-on-the-discovery-of-the-holy-sepulchre/","cat":"history","id":"comment-152544","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
