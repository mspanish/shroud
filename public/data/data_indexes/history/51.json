[{"title":"Comparison of Lirey Badge (Cluny medal)  depicting the Shroud of Turin in the14th century with the 1865 Forgeais drawing – for open discussion","post":"Hello again. Just a quick holding reply before I head off to see my new grandaughter, The question of what to make of the crucifixion hardware is a tricky one I grant you. It’s not made easier if one believes the accounts, set out by Knight and Lomas, that De Molay was not only slow-roasted at the stake – before that he had been hideously tortured during his 7 years of incarceration, and part of that torture featured being crucified to a door. If the latter were true then one has a rationale for lots of things to do with a later fusion (confusion?) of crucifixion and roasting – and the Lirey Badge may have played on that ambiguity and help to explain why the early Shroud was able to get a grip on the medieval imagination, incorporating two distinct but overlapping ideas.\nMy ideas are a watered-down version of Knight and Lomas, inasmuch as they have proposed that de Molay was placed in a shroud immediately after crucifixion, long enough for some kind of chemical image to have been formed. I don’t buy into that, preferring to think that a scorch was produced off a hot replica as a kind of grim metaphorical statement – this is what the King and the Pope did to the head of a rich and supposedly powerful order.\n","date":"October 11, 2012 at 7:28 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/comparison-of-lirey-badge-cluny-medal-depicting-the-shroud-of-turin-in-the14th-century-with-the-1865-forgeais-drawing-for-open-discussion/","cat":"arthur_forgeais","id":"comment-925","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Comparison of Lirey Badge (Cluny medal)  depicting the Shroud of Turin in the14th century with the 1865 Forgeais drawing – for open discussion","post":"Well spotted! The trouble with a really well explained hypothesis is that you get drawn into it! So, several squandered (but not necessarily wasted) hours later, have you seen the photos of the Lirey badge at http://www.culture.gouv.fr, or http://www.photo.rmn.fr, or (sorry) http://www.sindonology.org, where some details are massively enlarged. I found them by Googling “Lirey Cluny pelerinage” so as to avoid English. Some aspects of your interpretation of your photo will need adjusting, I think, especially the “air-hole in the barbecue” and the “bushes around the feet” ideas, which are, at least to me, quite obvious flaws or damages rather than intentional markings.\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is the so-called “instruments of the passion” which supposedly fill in the gaps between the shields below the image itself. On the far left and right we have two clearly mismatched poles of some kind, which even your photo suggests are the spear and the scourging pillar. At least one whip is very evident, and the wreath could at least be as easily of thorns as well as laurels. All that’s missing is the nails, which may have been under the box in the bit of the circle that’s broken off. Would the relic, fake or otherwise, of a man roasted on a griddle, have included these symbols?\nMore. Looking at the “chain” I do agree that it looks helical (your word), but still dispute that it looks anything like a chain. More like a thick rope? The stains across the back, and the wriggly bits around the feet (dorsal image) do look a bit like unravelled rope, and suggest to me that whoever made this badge did not make it from direct observation, but from notes, and maybe a sketch, that he took away before making the mould from which the badges were made. As for his figures – well, I don’t know if I could do any better when each is barely an inch long. It’s not clear to me whether these badges were made of liquid tin/lead poured into a mould, or hammered like a coin. One of the websites shows a picture of the back of the medal, which may be indicative, but I don’t know of what! Anyway, it was clearly made in a workshop, and a certain amount of licence (and simple forgetfulness or ignorance) must be allowed for. A less contentious example is the depicted size of the sheet, which is held by two people standing quite close together, an impossibility if it really depicted two life size men.\nNow that I’ve browsed this entire blog (and I do think it’s excellent, even if reciprocal ad hominem insults don’t, to my mind, enhance the respectability of either antagonist) I gather you’re firmly on the side of the scorch-mark hypothesis. For all I know you might be right, but surely to produce the shroud by heating a specially made life-size image to near red heat, transfer it to a sheet, wrap the sheet around it and then unwrap it to reveal the scorch (or any variation of procedure that would produce a similar image) would have been quite unnecessarily complicated, in an age when any old wreath of thorny foliage could be, if properly attested, considered the genuine crown of thorns, and any old tunic the genuine robe of Christ? What made pilgrims flock to look at the genuine this or that wasn’t, I think, so much the object itself as the provenance, which also needed to be prominently displayed, preferably covered in big red seals.\n","date":"October 10, 2012 at 10:26 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/comparison-of-lirey-badge-cluny-medal-depicting-the-shroud-of-turin-in-the14th-century-with-the-1865-forgeais-drawing-for-open-discussion/","cat":"arthur_forgeais","id":"comment-924","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Comparison of Lirey Badge (Cluny medal)  depicting the Shroud of Turin in the14th century with the 1865 Forgeais drawing – for open discussion","post":"Think of it from a forger’s point of view.

Moving on, I wonder if you have any ideas about why the shroud is long and thin, with the bodies end on, rather than squarer, with the bodies side by side, as would surely be the case if anyone were wrapped up nowadays. Without having a lot of other shrouds to compare it with, do we know if such a shape was more typical of the 14th than the 1st century, or vice versa?\n","date":"October 10, 2012 at 6:59 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/comparison-of-lirey-badge-cluny-medal-depicting-the-shroud-of-turin-in-the14th-century-with-the-1865-forgeais-drawing-for-open-discussion/","cat":"arthur_forgeais","id":"comment-922","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Comparison of Lirey Badge (Cluny medal)  depicting the Shroud of Turin in the14th century with the 1865 Forgeais drawing – for open discussion","post":"Hello there. Maybe I’m missing something here, Hugh, but why would I need to mention the herringbone pattern? Sure it’s important – because it creates a direct link between the memento and the artefact it represents – but I am not challenging that. Why would I?  I’ve acknowledged from the outset that the Badge was made as a pilgrim’s memento of the Shroud, as it existed in 1355 or thereabouts, residing in the Lirey church. My position is not that the Lirey Shroud, at least its body image, is something different from what is presently in Turin (though bloodstains may have come later): it’s to do with what the Shroud represented or was perceived to represent by its first cohort of viewers. Were those first pilgrims paying homage to the alleged burial shroud of Christ, or to an image of a celebrated Templar Grand master, hideously tortured and roasted over hot charcoal? Or was there some confusion in people’s minds, due to attempts by De Charny and his wife to present one or other of the executed Templar leaders, alleged heretics, as a Christ-like figures? Nope, the herringbone pattern makes it near 100% certain that the badge represented the present Shroud – but I thought that would be self-evident, which is why I did not mention it.\nSingle “blood-chain” across the back?  Well you obviously concur with Ian Wilson that it represents blood, i.e. from the spear wound from the side. But if so, why is it shown in so highly stylised a fashion, i.e. as a near-prefect helix. Nothing else about the man’s image seems to have stylised or even non-stylized representations of crucifixion. Where are the nail wounds, the crown of thorns, scourge marks, the reversed 3 of the present Shroud etc? If the casting technique allows a minuscule herringbone pattern to be reproduced, then why not these tiny details as well? I have to say that I regard the “blood chain” as nothing of the sort – it is simply a chain, i.e. a metal chain, one used to secure the individual to the stake before lighting the fires. Or maybe there was deliberate ambiguity, at least where the Badge was concerned, a preplanned attempt to morph a Templar-related  image into a biblical/crucifixion one, which if the case was stunningly successful, fooling both medieval and modern folk.\nDouble image? Again, representing what is on the Shroud, which in turn is indicative of an image left by someone enclosed within an up-and-over cloth. If it had not had dorsal and frontal images, would folk have perceived the cloth as a Shroud that had enveloped a dead body? I doubt it.\nThe empty tomb?  Well, it’s a very medieval-looking tomb, would you not agree, i.e. a sarcophagus, rather than a cave-like cavity in a rock face maybe with a simple shelf?  Again, the Badge artist may have been striving for deliberate ambiguity – one can view that feature either as a sarcophagus to represent the biblical sepulchre OR as a kind of barbecue grill on which the condemned was stood above glowing coals.\nWhat nobody seems to mention is how un-Christ like the figure on the Badge looks. Yet the Shroud is said to have given rise to the classical image of Christ that began to appear in art several centuries before the Badge was made. For all the symbols (ambiguous ones) on the Badge, and the details that confirm it as a keepsake souvenir of the Shroud, there is a fundamental disconnect where it really matters. The Man on the Badge does not obviously resemble the Man on the Shroud. Why? Because the latter was not intended IN THE FIRST INSTANCE to represent Christ, and it was not until strategically-placed bloodstains were added to the Shroud that people then made the connection that they were encouraged/urged  to make, abandoning all “erroneous”  indeed heretical (?) folk memories to do with Templar martyrs. \nThanking you for your interest.\n","date":"October 9, 2012 at 9:51 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/comparison-of-lirey-badge-cluny-medal-depicting-the-shroud-of-turin-in-the14th-century-with-the-1865-forgeais-drawing-for-open-discussion/","cat":"arthur_forgeais","id":"comment-918","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Comparison of Lirey Badge (Cluny medal)  depicting the Shroud of Turin in the14th century with the 1865 Forgeais drawing – for open discussion","post":"I enjoyed the exploration, but you’re surely clutching at straws here.
