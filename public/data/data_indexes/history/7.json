Thanks for the reply. What you mean to say is clear, it may not be concrete evidence but it does help narrow the search. More documentation would have been useful, and if it existed it was probably destroyed during the Fourth Crusade. Many of the documents Napoleon looted from the Vatican Archives are said to have been used by shopkeepers to wrap their goods. They probably obtained it from overloaded carts taking the material from Rome to Paris, with documents falling on the ground.\nI wish you success in your research!\n\n","date":"May 11, 2014 at 1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/11/drop-the-alexios-i-komnenos-letter/","cat":"history","id":"comment-116982","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Drop the Alexios I Komnenos Letter","post":"Does the order of the list of relics mean anything?

Interesting.\nNo, and I would say that this relic was in fact very problematic, perhaps even scandalous, for the Byzantines -at least from some perspective.\nThere are some reasons for this, which I will maybe explain later.\n\n","date":"May 12, 2014 at 8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/11/drop-the-alexios-i-komnenos-letter/","cat":"history","id":"comment-117732","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"}]
