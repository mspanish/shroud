The earliest one I saw on your Wiki ref was the Egyptian Ra of about 1200 BC.  It would seem to have entered Christian art from Roman and Greek representations, such as the Sol Invictus. \nHowever in the case of the Shroud, I think there is an inference that a halo effect could result from the action of light or fading from its prior presentation in the form of a Mandylion.  This could occur if the image was masked by a cloth covering leaving a circular hole to expose only the face, perhaps such as in some of the lattice-work images of the mandylion displayed in Ian Wilson’s 2012 Valencia presentation.  If the mandylion was in fact ever displayed in this way then over time the exposed part of the cloth would fade leaving a nimbus effect. \nBut as O.K. says, perhaps the alleged nimbus around the face of the Shroud image is only wishful thinking by those interested in promoting the Mandylion = Shroud hypothesis.\n\n","date":"November 9, 2014 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/a-detailed-response-to-the-halo-study/","cat":"history","id":"comment-170047","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Detailed Response to The Halo Study","post":"David, that’s right.

Pete Schumacher is an imaging expert and it is this expertise that is exercised in discussing Dr. Petrus Soons’ observations.  From the document: “While it is true that not everyone has a VP‐8 Image Analyzer system available to them; and, while they may not have all the images available to them that I used in this study; I am convinced that this evidence is conclusive and can be readily duplicated by anyone reasonably capable in the disciplines applied while using a variety of easily accessible tools and even some readily accessible images.”\nThis work has nothing to do with the halos as discussed here – the word is used to shorten “circular shading”.  I need to change the wording on the website to keep others from coming to the same erroneous.  \nIt has to do with a shading around the facial image on the Shroud which would link the Shroud with the Mandylion.  Concerning the historical implications of the results of this study, he writes this: “Thus, the Mandylion and the Shroud of Turin are on[e] and the same. Therefore, the Shroud of Turin existed at a time in accord with the known history of the Mandylion. I defer to the considered works of Ian Wilson and other accomplished historians as to the impact of the results of this study, as I am not a historian.”\n\n","date":"November 10, 2014 at 8:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/a-detailed-response-to-the-halo-study/","cat":"history","id":"comment-170375","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Detailed Response to The Halo Study","post":"Andy.\nNo matter that Pete Schumacher is an imaging expert, but as Mario Latendresse rightly commented, nowhere in the paper nor presentation slides there is evidence for his claims. There is nowhere clear illustration showing that there is indeed a halo around the face on the Shroud.\nPete Schumacher has written ” I am convinced that this evidence is conclusive and can be readily duplicated by anyone reasonably capable in the disciplines applied while using a variety of easily accessible tools and even some readily accessible images.” So as I consider myself “reasonably capable” in this field (at least I know a little bit in this topic) and have some “easily accessible tools” and images, I tried to verify Pete’s very bold (and significant,had it been true) conclusion. Unfortunately, I have found no basis for it -and should I had there been some. \nLook at those images. Can you see circular shading (“halo”) around the face? Can you see significant differences with other non-image areas on the cloth? Then draw your conclusions yourself. The fact that someone is allegedly an imaging expert, while he does not present compelling arguments for his conclusions, does mean nothing to me.\nAnd one another thing.
