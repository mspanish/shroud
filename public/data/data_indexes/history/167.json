[{"title":"Tersio makes an important point","post":"Hi Shroudies,\nTersio point is 100 % valid. The shroud is neither Forged nor a Copy. It is a miracle, to tell the Humanity, what God Almighty can do and lame science has still to prove, the scientific action of God Almighty. Pray to the living Almighty God, and He will guide you to understand the scientific phenomena. Why Almighty God preserved this image, to tell the Truth about the Holy Christ of History.\nAnd correct the story of Holy Christ of Faith.\n\n","date":"April 14, 2010 at 7:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/04/12/tersio-makes-and-important-point/","cat":"history","id":"comment-1255","author":"Noya","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tersio makes an important point","post":"Tersio, the logic of your argument is incorrect.  The Shroud cannot be forged because there was no mention of it in biblical texts and therefore would be unique?\nWhat is the evidence that yields that conclusion?  Your suggestion?\nIt is clearly a post first century creation. Some time post the year 1000. The fact that monestaries and churches would “forge” artifacts is not and was not new.\nThis is just one of them.\n\n","date":"April 24, 2010 at 11:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/04/12/tersio-makes-and-important-point/","cat":"history","id":"comment-1268","author":"notimefortrivia","site":"shroudstory"}]
