[{"title":"The Slanted Footrest of the Orthodox Cross","post":"Point of order. The two men who were crucified with Jesus were not thieves.  Romans didn’t crucify people for robbery; only insurrection. They were revolutionaries. The Greek word for robber is lestes but is also translated as brigand or insurrectionist. Interestingly, when Jesus is arrested in the Garden He asks if the mob came to seize him as a “lestes”.  But here the word gets translated as robber. The same word, “lestes” is used to describe the two men, but here it gets translated as revolutionary. \nIt appears that the Gospel writers sanitized the story of the arrest in order to gloss over the true reason as to why He was crucified.\n\n","date":"May 12, 2014 at 5:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/12/the-slanted-footrest-of-the-orthodox-cross/","cat":"history","id":"comment-118061","author":"Tom Devins","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Slanted Footrest of the Orthodox Cross","post":"They could be thieves involved in insurrection, sicarii stealing to support their movement, which, Josephus tells us, began in AD 6.
