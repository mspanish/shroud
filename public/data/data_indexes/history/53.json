Rather turgid prose, straining at gnats, swallowing camels, he doesn’t see the woods, too focused on the trees, twigs and leaves.  I can see why academic specialists are unsuitable candidates for jury trials.  There’s rather a lot more to it than he’s considered, I should say yet another victim of over-specialisation.  \nI first came across the Hymn of the Pearl in the 1980s while working on a Religious Studies major.  Sure, it’s essentially a gnostic work, and there’s a lot of fascinating arcane symbolism in it, open to a variety of interpretations.  However the particular poem referring to the image appears to be an interpolation, independent of the main work.  Hence it may well have Shroud image implications – it seems to fit too well to be anything else. \nHe would do well to check out Jack Markwardt’s paper presented at 2008 Ohio Shroud Conference:  ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET.  Markwardt’s approach is slightly different from Wilson’s, more comprehensive, and places the early location of the Shroud at Antioch, and only later at Edessa. But essentially he still considers Mandylion and Shroud to be one and the same object.  It is a very comprehensive study in my view.

It is astonishing what some people have read into non-existent documents and in some cases, statements have been made that  border on the fraudulent in that a careful reading of the documents  show the OPPOSITE of what is claimed. (There are too many cases where whole part of documents that contradict a case have simply been ignored, so one wonders whether there is deliberate deception in some cases. No names!)  Gregarius’  944 sermon, for instance, makes it quite clear, in the opening parts, that the image of Edessa which he was welcoming to Constantinople,  was, according to the legend that Gregarius believed, given by Christ to the apostle  Thomas while he (Christ) was still alive and then passed on from Thomas to Thaddeus (and then to Abgar). Gregarius makes it absolutely clear that the Image by-passed the tomb altogether and yet that sermon is often quoted as it if referred to a burial shroud aka the Turin Shroud.\n Keep up the scholarship!\nJesus Christ existed, he was undoubtedly crucified and buried. So once a burial shroud existed. Did it survive is the question.

I share your opinion that some people involved in this debate have misinterpreted, misused, and/or misrepresented the evidence. But I don’t think there is any reason to think of anything like deliberate deception. After all, these documents and images are (in one way or another) widely accessible today and there is nothing stopping anyone from examining them and forming their own opinion. And there is certainly nothing to be gained from such a ‘deception’ or ‘fraud’.\nMy image of an average sindonologist is, therefore, more like this: he has come to the (accurate) conclusion that the image in the Shroud is like no other in the history of human art, and that it, at least for the time being, escapes scientific explanation; he has, through various experiences in his life, become fed up (and rightly so) with the skepticism, rationalism, agnosticism, and the general disbelief that permeate the academic world today; he has done some research and has found a number of things in various scientific disciplines (in at least some of which he has no expertise of his own) that could conceivably be used to prove that the relic is authentic; he has most probably always had a healthy passion for mysteries; and he is, more often than not, passionate about his religion as well. Through a combination of these factors, he continues to been drawn to this enigmatic object. And, far from resorting to deception or fraud, he genuinely believes his own claims. He is often aware that experts have refuted some of his claims, but refuses to change his mind – because these experts are generally not very inspiring to him. Their skepticism, rationalism, and agnosticism, mentioned above, is in fact repulsive to him, and, to a great degree in deliberate opposition to them, he chooses to believe. He chooses a wonderfully mysterious fantasy over the dreary, cheerless reality. And who can possibly blame him? I certainly don’t – in the eyes of many, I am guilty of the same for my being a Christian. The one thing that I don’t understand about him, and cannot relate to, is that he somehow thinks that his study of this relic is directly connected to his Christianity. An ‘average sindonologist’ spends hours and hours on blogs and websites like this rather than to read his Bible, say his prayers, love and help his neighbors, and grow in the discipleship of Christ. One does not exclude the other, no, but we are only afforded so much time in this world and spending it on endless debates such as by what stretches of imagination the ‘Hymn of the Pearl’ can be seen to have anything to do with the Turin Shroud cannot be the best way of spending that portion that should be dedicated to religion. The Shroud is a fascinating object, but the study of the textual and visual records pertaining to it must be like any other – scientific. Belief should be left for other areas of human existence. Venerating the crucified Jesus, whether in the Shroud or in any other way needs no evidence. Studying the Shroud needs nothing but evidence. And if the Shroud is authentic, my guess (based on ‘spy-clues’ and ‘cyptographic examinations’ of how God seems to like to conduct His business) is that evidence for that will never be found. \nAll the best!\n\n","date":"June 23, 2012 at 2:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12973","author":"Davor Aslanovski","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Davor, Thank you for your response. I suspect that we are not that far apart and you deal with the motivations of those arguing for the authenticity of the Shroud very well. As you say, most contributors have no background in the enormously complex world of Byzantine texts, where legend and history mingle and there are immense linguistic problems as well. I m not a scholar here but have immense respect for the scholarship there is.\n  I wonder sometimes if some of the contributors to Shroud blogs know ANYTHING about the years of patient study of Byzantine art and language the experts have undertaken. Yet some Shroud enthusiasts are prepared to make the most authoritative statements about the meaning of difficult texts e.g. the Twin Pearls or the iconography of the Pray Codex. The debates here often gave the impression that the Pray Codex was the only entombment scene some convinced commentators had ever seen!\n‘Deceitful ‘ may be too strong but I think that if a contributor quotes from a document in support of their case for the authenticity of the Shroud or whatever when the full document they quote from actually says something very different, this kind of selective quoting does border on the deceitful. But I will name no names. And remember, and here I am NOT talking specifically about Shroud studies, some pseudo-historians have made a lot of money by jumping on bandwagons in the knowledge that their readers won’t check out the original documents.

There may have been occasional revivals of it during bouts of iconoclasm. \nGregarius may have believed the legend of Abgar, and that the Image of Edessa.predated the crucifixion, but more llikely he was mistaken.  Nor does the DA blog deal adequately with the description of the cloth as ‘tetradiplon’, that it was a much larger cloth than was apparently visible in its normal display form – its presentation in landscape aspect.fits no normal artistic convention for such an object.  Following earthquake damage to Edessa’s churches in 679 AD when the cloth was temporarily removed to Jerusalem, a French bishop Arculf reports seeing a ‘trial by fire’ on the sudarium at Jerusalem,  The cloth is evidently about 8 feet long, but possibly doubled over. \nA major argument that the Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object, has to be the appearance of the Vignon markings on so many of the icons and coins from about 692 AD onwards.

So can we please stick to the subject? \nByzantine Greek is full of peculiar neologisms, and the word tetradyplon is not a particularly interesting one. And I HAVE dealt with it, you just haven’t read my posts very carefully. I said: ‘What remains to be examined now is the impression that some authors have believed that the image of Edessa was preserved on a large cloth and/or that the cloth bore the imprint of Jesus’ entire body and not just his face. And the essential thing to notice here is that these two notions cannot be divorced from one another. In other words, it cannot add any credence to Wilson’s theory that John Damascene used the word himation, which does indeed denote a large cloth, if this fact is contrasted with the saint’s beliefs about the image’s appearance and formation. For how can a clear statement that the image was formed when Jesus washed his face with water, and an attendant absence of any mention of either blood or full-body image, be completely disregarded on the strength of a single word that does not normally denote a face-towel? If a text is to have any bearing on our conception of what the image of Edessa was, three elements need to be speaking in unison: (i) the narrative of the image’s formation, (ii) the words or phrases describing the cloth’s size, and (iii) the account of what the image really portrays. And if this filter is applied to the extant sources, it quickly becomes obvious that the only account which comes even close to corroborating Wilson’s theory is that of Gervase of Tilbury.’\nAs this is obviously not clear enough, I will briefly explain.\nThe ‘Acts of Thaddaeus’ mention the ‘sindon tertradiplon’, but the image is said to be formed when Jesus asked to wash Himself, upon which a towel was handed over to Him and He wiped His face with it. So that’s why this text cannot pass through my ‘filter’.\nThe Menologion entry for Aug 16 likewise says ‘tetradiplon’, but the account of the image formation is the same (Jesus wiping His face after washing it with water).\nNeither the full-body image nor the presence of blood is mentioned in any account, and both expressly state that the image was formed while Jesus was alive. \nGregory Referendarius is, just like Nicholas Mesarites, one of the few authors who have actually had first-hand, up-close familiarity with whatever the image of Edessa was. And they were both men of considerable learning. And their testimonies do not mention anything like the double imprint of a dead man on a 14-foot cloth. (Nicholas Mesarites in fact expressly distinguishes the burial shroud  (‘sindones Christou’) from the towel (cheiromakterion) with the prototypal image.) \nAs for the bishop Arculf, let me quote what Wilson himself says: ‘he had seen in Jerusalem “the sudarium of Our Lord which was palced over His head in the tomb”. (…) It was apparently about 8 feet long, so its measurements do not appear to match our Shroud (…) But Arculf mentioned no imprint.’\nHow Arculf’s testimony is then relevant to this discussion – you tell me. \nJust as in the case of tetradyplon, I HAVE addressed the Vignon markings – once again the problem is that you have not read my posts very carefully.\nI said: ‘As is immediately obvious upon close inspection of both the “icon-evangelizing” and the “Vignon markings” claim, Wilson and his supporters do not understand that certain copies in Byzantium were precisely not to be identical. Far from being a case of meticulous examination, exact replication, and zealous dissemination of a venerated archetype, the story of the Mandylion in Byzantine art is one of virtually inexhaustible variation.” And then I corroborated that claim with close inspection of precisely those images that Wilson (and other ‘sindonologsist’) offered as proofs of their theses.\nI have also pointed out that the two images that predate all the other Mandylion reproductions by several centuries do not show any of these markings. And I have stressed that a fresco of Abraham in the Karanlik Kilise ‘bears at least the following “markings”: quiffs of hair falling on the forehead; heavily accentuated owlish eyes; accentuated cheeks; asymmetrical nostrils; forked beard’.\nSo I don’t see how ‘the topic is not addressed at all’. \nYes, the report commissioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitos, if not in fact written by himself, says that the Lekapenoi usurpers were unable to see the image. And anyone who knows the story of Constantine’s struggle to regain the throne knows that this is most likely only his imperial propaganda. But, in any case, the account once again does not say that this was an image of a full body. \nAs for this part:\n‘One further aspect is that the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople was marked by a general rejoicing, the institution of a major feast day observed annually throughout Orthodox Christianity, but no corresponding feast day for the arrival of the Shroud, a much more notable relic, which only seems to have become slowly manifest in Constantinople over a period of time, very likely when the Mandylion was removed from its framework. However the Byzantines were not about to give up on their precious Abgar legends, the stories which had become woven into their liturgies, and so the myth of the Mandylion as a separate object persisted.’\nI have nothing to say other than that such an account depends entirely on your personal beliefs and not on any evidence.\nYou may be right.\nOr, to be more precise, Daniel Scavone may be right, because, if I’m not mistaken, it is his theory.\nIn any case, this may be right.\nOr it may be wrong.\nBut there is no evidence for it.\nAnd I could just as well, off the top of my head, come up with another theory: there was no feats day for the arrival of the burial shroud because the burial shroud was a relic forged in Constantinople itself. I have no evidence for such a claim, of course, but that doesn’t seem to matter here.\nOr, to be more serious, I could say ask you this: was there a feast day for the arrival of EVERY relic in Constantinople? Or this: was every relic transferred to Constantinople on the 100th anniversary of the Triumph of Orthodoxy, and was every relic so prominently mentioned by the iconodules during the iconoclastic controversy? Or was every relic used as a piece of imperial propaganda by an emperor who has been deprived of his birthright for a quarter of a century? \nIf you have any further questions, please first read my two posts and see if they haven’t already been dealt with there.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2012 at 8:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12980","author":"Davor Aslanovski","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin","post":"And see the article by Charles Freeman ‘The Shroud of Turin and the Image of Edessa, :A Misguided Journey’ which also deals with some of these issues.e.g the tetradiplon idea and the strange story of Arculf in Jerusalem- easy to pick up online.\n\n","date":"June 24, 2012 at 5:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12988","author":"Menedemus","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin","post":"and what is Freeman’s interpretation or explanation of ‘tetradiplon’?\n\n","date":"June 25, 2012 at 3:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-12996","author":"domenico","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Domenico- well, you need to read the article to get his full argument- it is not hard to find.\nFreeman suggests that the only way to fold the Image of Edessa without concealing or folding over the face of Christ is to have each of the four sides  of the Edessa image folded back under itself to make a smaller cloth for storing which would leave the face intact at the centre, in other words ‘four double foldings’.

In fact, it is very striking to note how close I am from his own point of view, while I’ve done a complete independent research from his own research and wasn’t even aware of this guy or his work while doing my research !\nFor anyone who’s interested to know the TRUTH versus Wilson’s hypothesis concerning the Mandylion, I truly recommend the reading of this paper from Freeman because it is very well done.  It helps to see how Wilson often “manipulates” the facts in order to comfort his personal hypothesis…  For a guy like me who has done a very extensive research on the subject, these “manipulations” from Wilson are evident to see, but for someone who didn’t do these kind of deep researches, it’s not so evident.

It is not just ‘a small towel’! \nYou are not only (partially) wrong in your opinion, your are iconographically (visually) philologically (textually) wrong in your facts! \nCan you really  understand what I am trying to tell you?\n\n","date":"June 28, 2012 at 8:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13163","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nYannick Clément :\nI really think he should read my open letter about the evidence of the bloodstains : https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/please-dont-forget-the-evidence-of-the-bloodstains/)…\n\nSorry Yannick: There is no evidence of blood in the Shroud. There is a controversial subject. Frache and McCrone used conventional tests for blood. The result was negative. Adler and Heller invented a personal test. They found traces of blood. Baima Bollone identifies the blood type, but Raymond Rogers denies this possibility. And so on. \nNo scientific archaeological lab has been in charge of the subject. They are who have something to say, and not experts in anything else. The detection of ancient blood is a very complex problem. Not for “amateurs”. And  Frache, McCrone, Adler and Heller were “amateurs” sensu strictu. (I do not think it’s useful to talk about what some doctors think they see or not see in the evanescent image of the shroud. That’s wishful thinking).\nThe bloodstains provide simpler evidence. No profound reflections or hyper-scientific hypothesis are needed.  «Blood never oozes in nice neat rivulets, it gets clotted in the hair. The anatomic accuracy is more what Michelangelo would have done in a painting than what actually happens to a body».” (Michael Baden, deputy chief medical examiner of New York for Suffolk County quoted by Marvin M. Mueller, reply to William Meacham “The Authentication of the Turin Shroud: An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology”, http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm ). \nThe “blood” is painted. Whatever it is, is painted. That is all.\n\n","date":"June 29, 2012 at 1:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13164","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin","post":"BREAKINK NEWS:\nThe wannabe Art Historian David Mo now AS an ARCHAEOLOGICAL blood pattern IMAGINARY/NON PROFESSIONAL expert!\n\n","date":"June 29, 2012 at 5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","id":"comment-13167","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Marvin M.
