Currently, and customarily, participants drop the wine into saucers, but I think that Rebecca says, or implies, that 2000 years ago, the participants would have simply dropped the wine on the table — or table cloth.\n– Then, I’m thinking that even if table cloths were not traditional back in those days, there are at least two possible reasons for a cloth covering the table of the Last Supper.  Maybe 1) They were used for Seders in general so as to catch the wine. And/or 2) This cloth was a Pharisaic Sacerdotal garment worn by a high priest (as suggested by Adrie — a follower of this blog — at http://www.jesusking.info/John%20Mark.pdf) and, for one reason or another, used for this special occasion.  Maybe, Jesus asked for it… \n– Whatever, I’m wondering if anyone might have something to add to, or subtract from, my meanderings above.\n\n","date":"August 31, 2011 at 10:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/31/paper-chase-was-the-shroud-of-turin-also-the-tablecloth-of-the-last-supper/","cat":"history","id":"comment-3746","author":"Jabba","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Was the Shroud of Turin Also the Tablecloth of the Last Supper?","post":"There’s nothing at all in the archaeological and historical findings that are linked to the time of Christ in Palestine to suggest such an idea…  The answer given by Rabbi Samson H. Levey says it all !  I’m always amazed (and also very sad) to see intelligent people like the Jacksons being fooled by their faith when it comes to examine the Shroud !  I dream of the day when scientists will examine the Shroud without any religious pre-concept in mind…  I dream of the day when scientists will examine the cloth as a potential burial Shroud of the first century and not as the potential Shroud of Christ and the only witness of his resurrection (and maybe a survival piece of the last supper) !  Because I believe it’s an authentic archaeological artefact, I think that’s what the Shroud really deserve !  \nThis idea that the Shroud would have been the tablecloth of the last supper is ridiculous, not based on real scientific evidence and, in the end, it’s a TOTAL NON SENSE !  Imagine 2 seconds the Jews using an unclean tablecloth as a Shroud for someone they thought was the Messiah !!!  Ridiculous…  And this idea that the disciples used a long tablecloth for the last supper (on one single and long table !!!) is influenced by our modern lifestyle and not based at all on the jewish lifestyle of Jesus time.  \nAs Ray Rogers once said (and he was dawn right) :  “Too much utter nonsense have been published (in Shroud research) and it has destroyed the credibility of Shroud science.”  THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO SAY…\n\n","date":"August 31, 2011 at 4:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/31/paper-chase-was-the-shroud-of-turin-also-the-tablecloth-of-the-last-supper/","cat":"history","id":"comment-3748","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Was the Shroud of Turin Also the Tablecloth of the Last Supper?","post":"Hi Jabba and Yannick!\nThanks for the reference, and I do have something to add and subtract: My thesis has nothing to do with a table cloth …\nIt says that the garment left by the young man who “ran away naked” (Mr 14,51-52) became the burial shroud of Jesus, because Joseph Arimathea, when he had just received  burial permission from Pilate in the temple fortress, bought it from the temple police who had snatched it off from this young man in Gethsemane. The properties of the Turin Shroud used for its identification as a garment, and more specifically a priest’s garment, are its Pharisaic enlarged border and (cut off) corner fringes, its threads’ Syro-Palestinian sacerdotal Z-twisting, and its images of a Jewish high priest’s oval ornament under the chin and cylinder seal with its cord on the hands. The most outstanding biblical fact that identifies Jesus’ shroud as a priest’s garment is the beloved disciple’s belief that Jesus had risen because he saw the shroud rolled up and placed aside (Jo 20,7-8), just as a priest’s garment was always rolled up and place aside in the temple. \nA shorter article than the one Jabba mentioned, and more specific on the Shroud (18 pages), is: http://www.jesusking.info/The%20seam%20and%20corners.pdf . And an even shorter excerpt (7,5 pages) is: http://www.jesusking.info/John%20Mark%27s%20garment.pdf . In it, for shortness sake, I reckon that the beloved disciple was the fleeing secret disciple John Mark, the Sanhedrin’s priest-secretary, for this has already been shown in my article/book (73 pages) http://www.jesusking.info/John%20Mark.pdf) .\nAdrie\n\n","date":"September 1, 2011 at 11:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/31/paper-chase-was-the-shroud-of-turin-also-the-tablecloth-of-the-last-supper/","cat":"history","id":"comment-3755","author":"Adrie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Was the Shroud of Turin Also the Tablecloth of the Last Supper?","post":"Well?
