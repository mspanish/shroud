[{"title":"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus","post":"Here is the list  of relics sent by Latin Emperor Baldwin II to king Louis IX ( via César Barta’s article http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n56part5.pdf ):\n1. – The crown of thorns as the most valuable\n2. – A piece of the cross\n3. – Blood of Christ\n4. – The nappies of the infant Jesus\n5. – Another piece of the cross\n6. – Blood from a picture of Christ\n7. – The chain\n8. – Sacred cloth inserted in a picture (Mandylion)\n9. – Stone from the tomb\n10. – Milk of the Virgin Mary\n11. – The spear\n12. – A victorious cross (this is most probably reference to Titulus)\n13. – The purple mantle\n14. – The reed\n15. – The sponge\n16. – A part of the shroud (sudarii) in which Christ’s body was wrapped in\nthe sepulchre\n17. – The towel used to dry the Apostles’ feet\n18. – Moses’ rod\n19. – A part of John the Baptist’s head\n20. – St. Blas’ head\n21. – St. Clement’s head\n22. – St. Simeon’s head.\nThe more you study the topic of relics, the more convinced you are that the major part of them may indeed be authentic -or “authentic” in some sense, and they are not simple forgeries for naive believers. Even the so called “milk of Virgin Mary”.\nAs to the Shroud, we can be certain that there were at least three distinct burial cloth stored in the Imperial collection of relics in Constantinople -one of them was most probably our Shroud of Turin. I have described this in my article  written (in polish) for Apologetyka.info http://ok.apologetyka.info/ateizm/ile-byo-pocien-pogrzebowych-jezusa-cz1,749.htm\n\n","date":"May 7, 2014 at 3:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-113964","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus","post":"“The more you study the topic of relics, the more convinced you are that the major part of them may indeed be authentic -or “authentic” in some sense.”\nEr…. not in my case.\n\n","date":"May 7, 2014 at 4:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-113994","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus","post":"I’ll second that.\n\n","date":"May 7, 2014 at 4:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-114021","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus","post":"Preconvictions out, instead I advise to trace back the history of several relics -and next think there think for a while: are there really any rational reasons that would certainly exclude their possible authenticity?\nIf yes, what are they?\nIf not, is it possible, or maybe even likely that those items could surviwe from the times of Christ?\nEven the “milk of Virgin” has some rational explanation -in some sense…\n\n","date":"May 7, 2014 at 5:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-114036","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus","post":"No it doesn’t.\nSorry, OK, I think you’ll have your work cut out to rationise even the most rational of these, let alone the nappies of the infant Jesus, or the 2000 year old rod of Moses.\n\n","date":"May 7, 2014 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-114079","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus","post":"2000 year old rod of Moses is not such a big problem.

If some accounts are accurate, the Jews would keep everything associated with a violent death in order to preserve the life’s blood for the general resurrection. So the crown of thorns, the Shroud, the cross, etc. may have been preserved. That may be why St. Helena found the cross and other relics in the Holy Sepulchre-they were buried with Jesus on Good Friday.\n\n","date":"May 8, 2014 at 8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus/","cat":"history","id":"comment-114551","author":"Chesterbelloc","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus","post":"Hello O.K!
