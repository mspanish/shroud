Anyone attending to the burial were given special leave of the law and time to atleast place the body in a preliminary state to a final burial, (i.e not a completed burial), even if it meant working INTO the sabbath. These person(s) attending to the burial would be deemed unclean for 7 days and would have to attend to ritual cleansing twice within the seven days to be deemed clean again. Hense they would be allowed to work passed sundown and partially into the night, into the sabbath, but in haste.
