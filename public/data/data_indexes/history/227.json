[{"title":"‘The Holy Grail’ on National Geographic Channel","post":"I have a serious problem with this interpretation of a phrase that was originally linked to the “Holy Grail.” That phrase was, “…a vessel containing the Holy Blood.” In short, a ‘Blood Vessel’ that was never meant to apply to a physical object, like a Chalice, or, even a Cup. It specifically referred to a Blood Vessel within a human body, in other words, a living descendant of the Holy Family of Christ, or, Christ Himself. It specifically refers to a young man that Jesus introduced to His Disciples as “Merovingi” (note suffix ‘i’). Merovingi is not a name, it is a Hebrew phrase meaning, “My Mary’s eldest.” He would never have said, “My Mary’s…,’ unless she belonged to Him in Holy Matrimony, He would have simply said, Meroving (absent suffix ‘i’), “Mary’s eldest.”\nThis is the young man that travelled to the Isle of Avalon with Joseph of Arimathea, and, founded the Merovingian line of Kings that ruled France for over 200 years, and, features prominently on my Family Tree. The last of the Merovingian Kings was “Dagobard IV,” whose son “Sigismarind IV” (aka – Sigmund) is the one that all the Royal Families of Europe want on their bloodline, the last name they list…Sigmund. Some will go so far as to list it as, “Sigmund-Meroving”\n\n","date":"September 30, 2010 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/24/the-holy-grail-on-national-geographic-channel/","cat":"history","id":"comment-1469","author":"Gordon DeSpain","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"‘The Holy Grail’ on National Geographic Channel","post":"Okay.
