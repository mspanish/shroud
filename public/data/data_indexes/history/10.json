It’s most certainly an error of those writers (I’m almost sure that all of them have never saw any of these relics) who simply mixed-up both relics with their different features…\nAs it is often said concerning the C14 dating of 88, if you got 99% of the data that point into one direction (in this case, it’s all the references and artworks that indicates the Mandylion was showing only the face of the living Christ without any signs of injury or bloodstains) and 1% that point in the opposite direction (in this case, it’s the very few references written by people who didn’t saw the relics of Constantinople that seems to indicates the Mandylion was showing a full body image of Christ), you simply forget this last tiny group of data and consider only the other huge group.  That’s how unbiased science is suppose to work.  Guscin seems to do exactly the opposite by focussing on this last tiny group of references instead of the numerous data indicating the Mandylion was only showing a face of Christ without any injury or blood and that this particular relic was NEVER considered as being a relic of the Passion, unlike many Passion relics that were all kept in Constantinople at the same time…\n\n","date":"August 10, 2015 at 12:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","id":"comment-207882","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa","post":"“Guscin seems to do exactly the opposite…” No, he doesn’t.

One of them was named “The image of Beirut”.  Another one appeared in Constantinople before the first mention of a miraculous image in the Abgar legend…  But, to me, the most probable explanation for these very few mentions of a full-body image come from the fact that, around the time of the first mention (I think it’s the 10th or 11th Century, there were both a shroud of Christ (probably the actual Shroud of Turin) and the Mandylion that were kept in Constantinople.  In that context, that there could have been some confusion between the two is more than probable.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2015 at 12:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","id":"comment-207982","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa","post":"The Image of Edessa became the most notable image of Christ at a very early age, and obtained the advantage of a widely accepted story believed to date from the time of Christ, even though the story went through several stages of later development.  The very many diverse examples given by Guscin suggest that owners of the several copies may have been anxious to establish a veneer of authenticity for their own particular copy, and to associate it with the Image of Edessa, but possibly reluctant to admit that theirs was only a copy.  Note that in a somewhat similar fashion, several ancient churches had claimed to have been founded by one of the apostles to bolster their claims of apostolic origin.   \nGuscin makes a passing observation concerning the Image of Camuliana, by noting that one particular case he refers to may have been the Camuliana.  In 540 AD Persian Chosroes attacked and destroyed Antioch, and then set his sights on Edessa.  An imaged cloth, not made by human hands, was subsequently discovered in Camuliania and a group of orthodox priests paraded it around Anatolia in 554.  In 574 Justin II brought it to Constantinople, and it became known as the Image of God Incarnate.  Markwardt claims that this is the object which was actually the true Shroud, and which accounts for those stories relating a full body image. \nGuscin who was closely associated with Ian Wilson in their visit to Sanliurfa (Edessa) during their investigations does not seem to make a distinction between the face-only image of the Mandylion, and the various stories relating a full-body image, but seems prepared to allow that they may have been one and the same.  He skirts around the problem of specifically associating stories of the full-body image with the Turin Shroud by claiming that this is beyond the limits of his thesis.  Clearly the Camuliana was not the Mandylion, as they are two distinct objects, their arrival in Constantinople being separated by some 400 years. \nOver the next few days, I hope to make a closer study of Guscin’s wide-ranging paper, and may then be able to comment on it in more detail.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2015 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","id":"comment-207993","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa","post":"Mark Guscin talks of the ‘features typical of the Image of Edessa; long hair and beard, oval shaped face  and large open eyes'( pp.293-4) and he appears .e.g on p.317 to suggest that these might be original to the Image of Edessa. I am amazed that his advisers did not point out the emergence of the bearded image of Christ much earlier in Rome. It is easy to access the digital version of Paul Zanker’s The Mask fo Socrates . Zanker dates the earliest surviving depictions of a bearded Christ to AD 300 and in illustration no. 162 you can see a good example from that date . By the sixth century the bearded image has transferred to the east.e.g Zanker’s illustration no 166, St.Catherine’s ,Sinai,  and it would seem that the face of Christ on the Image of Edessa derives from this.\nThere is no Zanker in his  Bibilography.\nI was also surprised that Guscin did not stress that tetradiplon only refers to the cloth when it did not yet have an image on it. There is no documentary evidence to show that it was folded with the image on it. Wilson has misled many here.\nAs I have mentioned before, it seems strange that Guscin describes the Image as vanishing in 1204 when it was always in the un looted Pharos Chapel throughout the sack.\nI also think Guscin is being rather rigid in assuming that references to images of Chirst in Edessa always refer to what was taken to Contantinople in 944. Not only were images of Christ quite common from the fourth century but often there was a sequence of the same relic . This was inevitable when so many were lost or destroyed.  Replacements either carried on the sacredness of the one they replaced ( e.g. The Volto Santo in Lucca) or were said to be the old one lost but then miraculously found again ( e.g. The rediscovery of the lost body of St Mark in a column in St.Mark’s.) One must at least consider that the Image of Edessa may have had different versions in sequence , perhaps some on wood, some on cloth.\n\n","date":"August 22, 2015 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","id":"comment-208721","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa","post":"Thanks Dan.

Even kept locked up in its case it would not have got any better. The sources ,that Guscin quotes,make. It clear any viewing was restricted- there is not a scrap of evidence it went anywhere else before Louis IX bought it in its box.\n Guscin has done important work in showing that the Image   is not the Shroud- if some of us ever needed convincing on that point.

By ‘ documented version’ I meant the original documents e.g the one by the crusader Villehardouin that categorically states that the Chapel of the Pharos where the Image of Edessa was preserved in its box was handed over intact to the new Latin emperors in 1204( which gave them the right to sell the relics). There is no documentation that any of the many relics recorded in the Pharos Chapel had been moved from there before the Fourth Crusade. Guscin only quotes secondary sources on the Sainte- Chapelle transfer. He does not quote the many documents that Andrea Nicolotti has found that refer pretty clearly to a box with the cloth in it in Paris.  Nicolotti also quoted the deed of transfer. There is not a shred of evidence that the Image   went anywhere else despite the attempts by some to link it to the similar- looking Veil,of Veronica.\nIf one wanted to earn anything from a relic it really had to be either in a superb reliquary or clearly visible in its own right. It is clear that the Image of Edessa had faded from its original state even by 944 and so was never exhibited in Constantinople. This probably explains why it was so low on the list of relics by the thirteenth century- the Crown of Thorns really could be shown off!\n\n","date":"August 23, 2015 at 11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","id":"comment-208782","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa","post":"It is evident that the image of Edessa-Turin Shroud link has not been established because the gap between the years 1204-1353 is being researched.\nWhatever, Father Pfeiffer’s contention about the Eastern Church’s liturgy and the change in the sermons has not been challenged.\nThe link to his interview is above, on this thread.\n\n","date":"August 23, 2015 at 10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","id":"comment-208781","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
