[{"title":"Over at History Today’s blog space","post":"I will try to make a long story short. I believe the Shroud of Turin to be the burial cloth of of Jesus Christ.  I had a little help. From who ?? My Guardian Angel.  A few words about my Guardian Angel. My first recall of my Guardian Angel – I was about 9 to 10 years old and the family, me included were on vacation at a small lake in Indiana.  I was playing in the lake in an inner tube at the small beach area that people swam at.  I seen more members of the family had arrived at the beach and I decided to get out of the inner tube and go to be with them. I did not realise that I had drifted further out into the lake and the water was several feet over my head and I did not know how to swim.  I threw my arms and hands over my head to slip down out of the inner tube to walk up to the beach from the water.  The water was maybe 10-15 feet deep and I no longer had the inner tube and could not swim and was literally in over my head. I tried to grab on to anything above me but there was nothing there so all I was doing was flailing mfield nex to y arms and my hands were out of the water sometimes.  I knew I was in trouble –  I then heard a voice inside my head that told that “You are going to die – Say your prayers”.  I was confused as I knew a few prayers but didn’t know which one to say say first.  Next thing in realise is that inside my mind I am saying the Lords Prayer also known as the Our Father.  I then saw pinkish or reddish colored clouds and then I had an image of the field nes to out house that was up in Michigan. and then the voice told me that this was all I was going to remember.  The next thing I know is that I am laying on a towel on my stomach on the beach and my brother 10 years older than me was pushing on my back.  The towel was wet under my face and there was a lot of mucus (snot) on my nose and lips.  My brother had performed CPR on me and I was alive.  I also now realise that I had an NDE but was told not to remember most of it. \nAnother strong interaction with My Guardian Angel happened in early 1964, I was in the USMC and my 4 years of active duty was almost over.  A couple of older more senior guys that I knew told me that when I re-enlisted I would be promoted to Sgt. E-5  (I was then a Crpl e-4).  Originally I was going to leave the Marines and go back to Michigan as I was stationed at the MCRD here in San Diego. So I started thinking about re-enlisting but I heard that voice say “do not re-enlist” . I didn’t think much about it and just continued living my daily life.  I thought about  I was reminded by one of the guys about being promoted on my reenlistment and heard the voice say the same again,  I ignored it and continued on with my daily life.  A few days later I was told by one of the Sgts at The headquarters building that I needed to “get on the stick’ and tell them That I was ready to re-enlist.  I thought about that  and then as I was seriously thinking of of taking the required action, that voice was very stern and loud inside my head “DO NOT RE-ENLIST”.  So I did not reenlist.  On Feb. 17th I left active duty in the Marine Corps. Well history tells us what happened for the next following several years. The war in Viet Nam.  With in a year I was married and never back on active duty, was released from the inactive reserves after 2 years and was a full blown civilian.  Alive.\nDuring the last few years I have been following the Shroud of Turin and had signed up to this site.  One day I was looking at a couple of the images of the Shroud that showed how it looked in it’s natural state and then what the 3-D imaging showed and then I heard some words in my head head telling me that this was the “real picture of the living Jesus Christ”. I accepted that it was my Guardian Angel consciously communicating with me again. While reading one of the articles I read about the ?Prince of Peace”, I looked it up and sure enough, my insides tell me the same thing – that this is a painting of the Living Jesus\nChrist.  I am a believer. You don’t know me but all I can say is to take my Guardian Angels words for it as I do. Peace and love to all of you.\n\n","date":"November 13, 2014 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/13/over-at-history-todays-blog-space/","cat":"history","id":"comment-171005","author":"Emmett McMahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Over at History Today’s blog space","post":"Yes I believe you Mr. McMahon.
