This cubit of commerce was carried with the lingua communis, the language of trade and diplomacy that stretched from the Euphrates to theMediterranean, the tongue that had become the common language of the Jew. Aramaic: the same language which Jesus spoke. Aramaic had been the communication medium of the Assyrian Empire and Israel had been a subject of Assyria.’\n But O.K. this article, that I HAD read, just says what I said : that the cubit had been ‘an international standard of that time for merchants of the Near East, and had been so for centuries.’ ‘This cubit of commerce was carried with the lingua communis, the language of trade and diplomacy that stretched from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean’. Greek (koine),the language of Paul was actually the main trading language by this period, four hundred years after Alexander had spread Greek influence over the Near and Middle East.\nSo if a piece of cloth is found to have been woven in Assyrian cubits -it could have been woven anywhere in these centuries and along these far flung routes. Just because the Temple authorities may have used Assyrian cubits ( this is not proven by anything in the article- I don’t know which of the many alternative cubits the priests used but probably one can find out) does not mean that the Shroud was made there because Jerusalem was only one of thousands of possible trading centres in the bustling first century Mediterranean.\nAgain, the fact that the Shroud may or may not have been deliberately woven in Assyrian cubits does not take us anywhere. Can you provide anything from the Assyrian cubit measurement that provides a link to Jerusalem rather than any of these other trading centres or specifically to the first century?\nIn fact, this is probably the most unhelpful cubit there is to be woven in. If it measured in Roman cubits  it would be datable to a much narrower range.\nSo what one ought to be saying is: ‘Unfortunately the Shroud is woven in Assyrian cubits and as these were used for so many centuries and across such a wide region, this gives us no help at all in placing the Shroud in either date or place of manufacture.’\n\n","date":"November 18, 2013 at 2:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-51913","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"So if a piece of cloth is found to have been woven in Assyrian cubits -it could have been woven anywhere in these centuries and along these far flung routes.

The problem was that  one could seldom weave more widely than 1.20 or 1.30m with one weaver, unlike the broader cloths of antiquity -often over two metres wide because two weavers worked the shuttles. So I assume that the longer ell developed as a typical measurement of the width of cloth from a treadle loom. Length was not such a problem because roller bars allowed finished cloth to be accumulated and cloth lengths of up to 25 or 30 metres are known.

The exact 4:1 aspect ratio of the TS, is suggestive of it being cut with its resewn selvedge to exact dimensions. Cubit measures varied widely between civilizations, one civilization may have used two or even three different cubits for different purposes, and there is also some confusion in the literature. Unless granite master standards are available (as in Egypt), the local cubit must be determined from measurements of buildings and monuments. Original Egyptian cubit was 457mm; Royal Egyptian cubit was 524mm; Some civilzations used a cubit of up to 560mm. \nCubit of the Assyrians derives from their conquest of Babylon 1350 – 612 BCE. Flinders Petrie & Jules Oppert, 19th c. pioneer archaeologists made numerous measurements of Babylonian buildings; Petrie wrote extensively on the several cubits in use (even including Stonehenge). The Petrie-Oppert Assyrian cubit is 546mm (+/- 5mm). Eleanor Guralnick 1996 measured several Sargonid slabs & monuments 721-705 BCE; Guralnick – standard late cubit 515mm, religious-royal cubit 566mm, King Sargon slab 550mm. \nMeasurement of TS is commonly taken as 4.34m x 1.09m, and is therefore consistent with the Petrie-Oppert Assyrian cubit. \nNearly all Egyptian thread is ‘S’ twist, and so TS is unlikely to be of Egyptian provenance. ‘Z’ twist does occur elsewhere in Middle East, despite comments by CF. Various cloth fragments of the sealed tomb of diseased family at Akeldama included both ‘S’ & ‘Z’; At Murraba’at, Grace & Elizabeth Crowfoot recorded seven twill-weave fabrics including herringbone twills with ‘Z’ spun warp and mixed ‘S’ & ‘Z’ spun weft, possibly imported. ‘Z’ spin seems to have predominated in northern Europe.\nMethchild Flury-Lemburg on examining the stitching of the TS resewn edge commented that she had only ever previously seen that stitch used at Masada and nowhere else. \nIt is also perhaps significant that only in the Raes corner (resewn?)is there any evidence of cotton, therefore TS is hardly likely to be medieval.\nNone of the above provides irrevocable proof that the TS is of ancient Assyrian provenance. However it is fatuous to assert in the face of the above that there is any conclusive proof that it is not. The evidence is at least not inconsistent with the TS being of Middle East provenance, even of about the 1st century.

The Egyptian is a litlle bit too short, 51-52 cm, medieval are too long, the shortest German with 57,9 cm (a Pole must have written this, as we use coma instead of dot) is still a little bit too long.\n\n","date":"November 18, 2013 at 6:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-51948","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"One might also mention that halophyte pollens unique to the Dead Sea(salt-loving flora) are hardly ever encountered in Scotland or Gaul!\n\n","date":"November 18, 2013 at 6:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-51947","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"the shortest German with 57,9 cm (a Pole must have written this, as we use coma instead of dot) is still a little bit too long., just as English ell, which was best proposed so far, 114 cm, is 2×57 cm\n\n","date":"November 18, 2013 at 6:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-51949","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"‘The same stitch for resewing selvedges as was commonly used at Masada, and has since become evident on the TS.’ We need the source for this as the excavation report on the textiles at Masada show that most were in wool and that the sewn ones were repairs of worn clothes.

Wilson refers to excavations by Israeli commander Yigael Yadin in the 1950s; he states that in 1994 Yadin’s successors published the technical report on the clothing scraps found; the report apparently includes a technical drawing of the unusual seam, one that Flury-Lemburg opined was essentially identical to the seam on the TS. Wilson cites a ref, ‘Sheffer & Granger-Taylor, 1994, pp 210-211, figs 111-113; p.169, fig 16; ‘Textiles in “Masada IV’, The Yigael-Yadin Excavations 1963-65,, Final Reports, Jerusalem, 1994. Wilson comments further: “Also found at Masada were examples of exactly the same two double thread selvedge as seen on the Shroud, a mode of construction which Gabriel Vial back in the 1980s had described as ‘tout a faite inhabituelle’ – most unusual.” [Gabriel Vial, Bulletin du CIETA, 67, Lyon, 1989, pp 27-29.] \nO.K. comment: I disagree that isolated pieces of evidence should be taken only on their own merits.

I am now quite used to following up a source quoted in Wilson and finding something very different from what he suggests (the classic remains the discrepancy between Wilson’s depiction of della Rovere’s actual portrayal of Christ in the Shroud and his own version, p. 28 of my 2010 edition of Wilson’s The Shroud in which Wilson even reverses the position of the arms!).\nSo while I was having a research day in the Cambridge University Library, I called in the Masada Report to check out the source references given above. In my edition of Wilson the discussion is on p. 109-110.\n P. 169, fig. sixteen does exist. It does show a selvedge on a goathair cloth. The excavators appear to have illustrated it  because it is woven on a tubular or two beamed loom. No other example of the use of this kind of loom or selvedge has been found this early in the Mediterranean . However, earlier examples are known in northern Europe from earlier so the suggestion is that either the cloth originated in northern Europe –more likely – see further below- – or is evidence for the first use of this kind of selvedge in the Mediterranean.  Wilson then gives a reference to Gabriel Vial’s 1989 report on the Shroud in which Vial talks of the construction of the Shroud’s selvedge as  ’tout a fait inhabituelle’.  He does not give the page number in my edition of The Shroud,  but it is p. 15 with an illustration on p.16 of the Shroud’s selvedge. (The article is in the CIETA Bulletin for 1989, Dave B quotes a reference for pages 27-9 from his edition of Wilson but this is a completely different article!) The problem is that the selvedge on the Shroud does not appear the same as the selvedge shown in the Masada report. So all we can do is agree with Vial –the article is his own report of his examination of the Shroud while they were choosing the sample for radiocarbon dating on 21st April, 1988, so is interesting and perhaps even important in its own right- that the selvedge on the Shroud is ‘very unusual’.\nWe next go on to the reference to figs. 111-113 on pages 201-11 of the Masada report. Yes these figs. do exist and on these pages. They all refer to the same fragment of wool. It is picked out and illustrated as it is wool, 2:2, Z twist spin, balanced diamond twill. So except for the Z spin being similar to that of the Shroud , I can’t see why this is relevant- it is not herringbone, linen or 3:1. In the discussion on the origins of the textiles found at Masada (p. 239), this cloth is placed in their group iv. The excavators’ conclusion is that these textiles probably came from northern Europe as this kind of twist (Z) and this kind of pattern is known from examples there. They suggest it may have come in with Roman soldiers who were involved in the crushing of the Masada revolt. I simply cannot see why Wilson provides a reference to a piece of cloth that has absolutely nothing in common with the Shroud except that its thread is Z spun (and thus as the excavators suggest probably spun in northern Europe).\nSo far nothing about stitching at all so I had to find my own reference to the stitching in the Masada report and it is found on pp 170-1 where they discuss the 45 textiles that have stitching on them. They illustrate six of these stitches on figs. 20-25 but they do not describe any of them as exceptional. So I was surprised to find that Wilson reproduces Masada fig. 23 (as his fig. 8)- which is a counter-hemming stitch- as one which the excavators ‘adjudged to be a very unusual seam’. I can’t find any reference to such a judgement but as Wilson has provided no references it may have been somewhere outside the accompanying text in this section.\nLuckily I had access to a higher authority- my wife who designed and sewed theatre costumes for her degree and then went on to work in the textiles department of the Victoria and Albert Museum. She took one look at Wilson’s ‘unusual seam’ and said in fact that this was the standard stitch for joining two pieces of cloth together when one wanted to make sure the ends did not fray. Nothing unusual about it at all!\nWilson does mention that Mechthild Flury-Lemberg is on record as saying that this stitch is similar to the one on the Shroud but he gives no reference for her opinion. In fact, it would seem that the stitch on the Shroud is the basic standard one  which one would use then and now to join two pieces of cloth.\nAnd so how much more time does one waste with Wilson? I have certainly better things to do but at least I can warn Shroud researchers to take anything that Wilson says with a large pinch of salt. I had only to read into the next page to find other issues that I could have dealt with in the same way as here but life is too short and I have far more interesting and accurate historians to work with. Hugh seems the man for the job of taking a critique of Wilson further – sorry Hugh but so long as people are going on quoting Wilson in their support it needs to be done.\n\n","date":"November 28, 2013 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-53077","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"Hi Charles,\nit is very interesting for me that your wife is working at the Victoria and Albert Museum, because:\n“A strange fact is reported by J.M.

On this subject, the simple presence of the side strip (which presence has never been fully explained beyond any doubts by textile experts) is enough to at the very least make us very cautious concerning the question of the Shroud’s original dimensions.\n\nYes, there are some uncertainities, but regularity of Shroud dimenisons expressed in integers is striking! It suggests that the original TS dimensions hasn’t changed much through centuries. The units that were used to measure the size of the TS were either cubits circa 55 cm long, or ell measuring 110 cm, that is 2×55 cm. Or, according to Ada Grosii:\nThus, the Shroud’s length would be 56 tefachim (436.8 cm) and its width 14 tefachim\n(13+1, that is 109.2 cm = 101.4 + 7.8 cm); on the other hand, always keeping in mind that\nthese measurements are approximate, we could also evaluate the Shroud’s dimensions by\nthe tefach sochek (9.33 cm), and we would obtain even more interesting numbers: 47\ntefachim (438,52 cm) by 12 tefachim (11+1, i.e. 111.96 cm = 102.63 + 9.33 cm).\n7 tefachim = 6 sochek =1 ammah (cubit).  \n7 *7.8 cm=54.6 cm =1 Assyrian cubit! \n6*9.33 cm =55.98 cm.\nThus the opinion of Grossi:\nThis line of reasoning certainly suggests great caution: playing with numbers, any result\ncan be achieved\nis unjustified, if we only keep some rules, only the results that Shroud dimensions allow can be obtained.\nOne more quotation from Grossi:\nAs far as the Hebrew cubit is concerned, it measures about 45.7 cm and corresponds to the ammah, the Biblical cubit; in addition, Jewish sources often mention the biblical and talmudic gomed, which, according to some, is actually shorter than the ammah;\nfurthermore, in the Mishnah we can find two other cubits (M Kelim 17:9). Thus, we can\nsay that Rabbinical knowledge basically deals with two cubits, the Mosaic cubit, 45.7 cm\nlong, and a longer one, which varies between 56.018658 and 58.352 cm\nThe information derived from TS dimensions, “accidently corresponding to the units of measure used in the ancient Middle East is not a final proof of its authenticity, but neither it is meaningless, as the sceptics try to convince us, and can be used as an argument for pro-authenticity.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2013 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-51997","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"Quote: “The information derived from TS dimensions, “accidently corresponding to the units of measure used in the ancient Middle East is not a final proof of its authenticity, but neither it is meaningless, as the sceptics try to convince us, and can be used as an argument for pro-authenticity.”\nI agree with you to some extent. but it’s surely not the most important data coming from the Shroud that point in favor of authenticity, for the simple reason that there are too many unknowns related to it (what was the original dimensions of the Shroud?, what was the real dimensions of the cubit unit that was potentially used by the persons who have manufactured the Shroud, etc.).\nLet’s say that this 2 X 4 cubits dimensions is one circumstantial evidence that must be backed-up by other more solid évidences in order to really mean something versus the question of authenticity.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2013 at 11:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-52025","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"There are too many unknowns related to it (what was the original dimensions of the Shroud?, what was the real dimensions of the cubit unit that was potentially used by the persons who have manufactured the Shroud, etc.).\nThe funny thing is that actually reasoning is going in opposite way- it is the Shroud , with almost ideal 4:1 proportions of length towidth, that teaches us what were real dimensions of the cubit used in the Middle East trade of textile, and, what is more important, that it was not shortened, by cutting portions of it for relics, as it was suggested in some older literature.

I am planning to write some paper about the old hypothesis connecting TS with Arculfus Shroud , which can be treated as an alternative to the usually accepted Mandylion hypothesis, as suggested by Wilson (howeve I still prefer the latter).\n\n","date":"November 19, 2013 at 5:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-52050","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"According to some manuscrpits, the Arculfus Shroud was not 8 feet, but 8 cubits long\nSee http://faculty.colostate-pueblo.edu/beatrice.spade/seminar97/arculf/arculfus.htm , Book I , Chapter XI.-THE NAPKIN WITH WHICH THE HEAD OF THE LORD WAS COVERED IN THE SEPULCHRE foootnote 36\n\n","date":"November 19, 2013 at 6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-52055","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits","post":"‘A certain trustworthy believing Jew, immediately after the Resurrection of the Lord, stole from His Sepulchre the sacred linen cloth and hid it in his house for many days; but, by the favour of the Lord Himself, it was found after the lapse of many years, and was brought to the notice of the whole people about three years(32) before [this statement was made to Arculf].’\nO.K. Thanks for bringing this up -as it challenges Wilson’s story that this ‘linen cloth’ was the Image of Edessa that was temporarily transferred to Jerusalem. By tradition, and you are more trusting of this than I am, it had always been in Jerusalem , which at least gives it a more plausible heritage than anything Wilson can put together.\n\n","date":"November 28, 2013 at 11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","id":"comment-53225","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"}]
