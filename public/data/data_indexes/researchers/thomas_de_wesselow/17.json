This is the fatal error made by STURP but as they did not seem to have anyone on their team who had ever dealt with an ancient object let alone an ancient textile that is perhaps understandable. I am surprised that de Wesselow seems to have made this same error but perhaps painted textiles in not his area of specialism.\nI and others start from the opposite premise ,that what we have now is the Shroud after centuries of decay with images of a very different kind from the original creation.

The question is whether he can find specialist support from his fellow art historians. Somehow, from  my own conversations with art historians who specialise in painted linens and medieval weaves I doubt it, but I shall be interested if he can.\nThanks for brightening my day with your comments,Nabber.

My interest lies in finding out what the Shroud images looked liked originally.”\nYes, and it can be proved that your premise is wrong.\nWhy don’t you comment the many true copies (copies painted from the original and very often put in contact with it (see Luigi Fossati)? Or did I miss something ?\n– Faintness of the image ? See the 1527 Noalejo copy (a wonder !) where it is obvious that the artist tried to reproduce the faintness and the lack of borders of the image. There are  other examples showing that the artist tried to reproduce this property with less success: Guadalupe 1588, Rome 1605(?), Rome 1643.\nI add that in the Museum of the Shroud in Turin, I have seen 2 months ago a small (perhaps 20 cm in length) reproduction painted on a cloth (16th or 17th century, I don’t remember).\nIt’s obvious that the image had been painted in order to reproduce the faintness of the TS image: it is nearly invisible!\nUnfortunately, it’s forbidden to photograph in the museum.  \n– Thumbs: contrary to what you wrote elsewhere, no thumb is visible in any of the copies.\n– Crown of thorns: in most of the copies, it is not seen: Santiago 1585, Naples 1652, Lisbon, Laguna de Cameros 1790, Alcoy 1571. \n– Loincloth: it’s true that a loincloth is clearly depicted in most of the copies. In some cases it is difficult to decide if a loincloth is present or not (Alcoy 1571, Moncalieri 1634, Rome 1643). Probably not.\nBut the oldest copy, the Lier copy as well as the Lisbon copy clearly show the rounded shapes of the buttocks. No loincloth.\nSo what ?\nAccording to Charles, the TS is a painting from the 14th century. The image we see today is “of a very different kind from the original creation.” because of century of decay.\nAt the beginning the image was not as faint as it is today.\nI do not know if it was exactly as faint as today.\nBut I do know that during the 16th and 17th century, some artists tried to reproduce the faintness of the image.\nWhy, if the image was not faint?\nAt the beginning, there was a loincloth.\nIn this case, how to explain that some of the earliest copies show the buttocks (no loincloth), exactly as we seen them today ?\nThe loincloth was added later and then again disappeared?\nIs it credible ?\nThe same is true for the crown of thorns, the thumbs etc..\nNo, the image we see today is not very different from the original creation.\nThe study of the copies shows that.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2015 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","id":"comment-201808","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist","post":"Thibault, exactly!

I would put forward the 1583 fresco of the exposition of the Shroud in the Vatican where onlookers are sitting a long way off and can see the images clearly. Again there is the Tempesta engraving of 1613 and many many more. We need a database of them all.\nPeople have wondered why the patch on the buttocks is today lighter than expected. That is probably because the loincloth was painted on later and the evidence is strong that this was to comply with the decree of the council of Trent that nudity had to be covered up, and then faded off.\nThe only way to prove all this is to build up a data base of all the depictions and work through them carefully. Obviously not going to happen on this site! De Wesselow obviously has not even begun a serious study of the Shroud or he would at least have made some comment on all these depictions.\nMeanwhile I shall rely on the wise advice I was given some time ago- if the only response to something you say is abuse, don’t worry, it is because they cannot provide a reasoned reply.\n\n","date":"June 14, 2015 at 2:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","id":"comment-201913","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist","post":"Just watched it…wonderful presentation\n\n","date":"June 13, 2015 at 1:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","id":"comment-201762","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist","post":"Freeman’s anonymous experts and travelogue are an insult to the intelligence’ Did I ever tell you about the great hot dog vendor outside the New York County Courthouse at 60 Centre St. in Manhattan.

It was clearly dropped there many years ago.I get it home and open it in the hope of finding out who once owned it. It is, of course, very faded and disintegrated but I find some letters in it which might  explain who once owned it. Unfortunately you can hardly see the lettering as the ink has disappeared over the years.\nIt might be possible to reproduce the faded letters. Perhaps I could find some suitable paper, perhaps I could try and reproduce the faint lettering with one of Colin’s concoctions, or perhaps I could scorch it, or have some raised letters from a printer’s block and place the paper on top of them and rub them. Perhaps I might even apply short bursts of radiation with a laser beam.There may be all kinds of ways I can dream up of reproducing what we have now. Even if I succeed I only have a copy of what I have found and it gets me nowhere because what I want to know is what was the lettering originally.\nDe Wesselow, Colin, di Lazzaro are trying to explain/reproduce the images on the Shroud as they are now and even if they succeed they won’t have proved anything-they would simply have found a way of reproducing the images faster than decay and disintegration caused by the passage of time.  I am totally amazed that after all his research de Wesselow does not seem to be aware of the earlier depictions of the Shroud which help provide clues as to how the Shroud looked originally.\nMy work is trying to find the original images, just as with my wallet I would be trying to reconstruct the original lettering on the letters in the hope of unlocking the secret of the writer of the letters.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2015 at 9:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","id":"comment-201792","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist","post":"More drivel.

Pathology is not his discipline so in a sense he can ignore it.\nIt is the pathologists who have examined the Shroud in the past 80 years have made two observations: (1) the image is a man in a state of rigor mortis and (2) there is no evidence of significant by-products of putrefaction. The two are related: the process of putrefaction releases rigor mortis. What this means is that image was probably created with 48 hours of the death of the man in the image; before 3:00 pm, Sunday.\nIf you go to Shroud.com and search for the word “pathologist” it will generate 102 hits. Among the most thorough are the reports of Dr. Robert Bucklin.\nWe should all be thankful for De Wesselow giving his insights as an art historian.

Its first few expositions at Lirey in the open air were sporadic events.  For perhaps a few decades during the 15th century there were annual expositions on the banks of the Doubs River, and it was also taken to Liege and to Macon to be exhibited there.  From 1453 to 1983 it was under the care of the House of Savoy, since when it has been in the care of the Turin custodians.  It was brought out for public veneration on particular occasions, and not left hanging freely on a wall in some cathedral, to be damaged by continual exposure to the light.  It is also known that during these seven centuries, the Shroud was cared for, maintained and repaired with some skill.  \nIf the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Christ, then its initial environment would have to be in the Middle East, Judea or Syria, a climate conducive to preservation.  Those who have studied the clues have it stored in an earthenware jar, or bricked up in a wall, or else stored safely in a deep well.  The written clues are few and only occasional, so it is evident that it was seldom exhibited or else used as a banner against invading armies, but kept as a secret to be known only to a select elite.  At some time it would have been taken to Constantinople to become part of the imperial relic collection.  This is not the story of an object subject to the damaging effects of exposure, moth or mildew, but an object that was carefully preserved.  \nWhat of other linen objects? \nAt an upper-Paleolithic excavation site at Dzudzuana Cave in the eastern-European country of Georgia, archaeologists discovered flax fibers that were preserved inside pollen chambers for 34,000 years. To date, they are the oldest evidence of man-made textiles ever discovered. The fibers at Dzudzuana showed evidence of having been knotted and dyed bright colors like turquoise and pink, consistent with the style of other artefacts left behind.\nFast forward a few thousand years of evolution and innovation and we find, at an ancient site in eastern Turkey, a piece of 9,000 year-old, simply-woven linen cloth clinging to a bone tool—presumably once wrapped around the handle for a better grip. Archaeologist and ancient textile expert Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood supposes this rudimentary fabric was produced on a crude loom of only four sticks, and woven in a manner derived from the already well-established practice of basket-weaving.\nWhen the mummy of the boy-pharaoh Tutankhamun was unearthed in 1922 CE, portions of the linen wrappings that covered his remains were almost perfectly preserved, the hieroglyphed dates still legible despite the millennia. \nThere are other examples, see: http://www.decktowel.com/pages/linen-history  \nThiebault’s review of artist’s copies of the Shroud as given above indicate that all of them endeavoured to replicate the faintness of the image that they saw.  The image of the Shroud was never a painting, and there is not a single piece of evidence that can support the notion.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2015 at 11:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","id":"comment-201900","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist","post":"There are times when this blog is truly educational and other times when the trolls blather.

There are two distinct and incompatible traditions of depiction of the image on the Shroud, and any explanation of how it was made must at least attempt to reconcile them. Thibault has very rightly drawn attention to the fact that many of those reproductions of the Shroud classed as ‘extractum ex originale’, dating from the 16th century onwards, show an indistinct, nude shape, with its feet together. This surely implies that from the 16th century the original was not very different from how it appears today, and Charles really ought at least to suggest an explanation for this version. I am not taken with the rapid painting on and off of crowns, loincloths, open legs and so on, which, if every copy is accurate must have occurred several times. On the other hand, almost every depiction of the Shroud being exhibited, also from the 16th century onwards, shows a very well defined shape, clearly visible for a long way, with legs apart and feet splayed. If the image was barely visible, then Charles’s detractors really ought to suggest a reason for this version. The idea that it was drawn clearly both so as to fit in with the technicalities of engraving, and to show people who bought it what they should have seen had they only got close enough does not explain the differences in posture and apparel very well. Did none of these eminent artists actually see the artefact they were representing, and did they all copy something else?\nBoth versions are as likely to have crowns of thorns as not, bloodstains may or may not be present and are almost invariably different from the original, and where illustrations of the burn patches are included at all, they are often reduced to mere symbols, as if the artist had no idea of what they really were. Not until Carlo Cusetti’s image of the late 19th century is it obvious that any of the copyists were attempting an identical representation.\nThomas de Wesselow, whose lecture I attended, agrees that painted linen cloths were very common, and that, being mostly ephemeral, there are only about eight extant today. He gives three different methods of painting them, with the suggestion that there may be others. I agree with him that comparing the Shroud to an illustration or portrait or even deliberate faked relic, makes little sense, but he does not explore the idea that it could have been one of the ‘ephemeral’ paraphernalia of liturgical ritual, of which no examples at all remain.\nWhichever side of the debate one chooses to support, there are serious anomalies in the evidence which need at least to be discussed, not dismissed, or ignored.\n\n","date":"June 14, 2015 at 4:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","id":"comment-201932","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist","post":"Hi Hugh,\n                   Nice to read your comments.

The distinction between first century linen and medieval linen’s manufacturing processing of the linen was one point Rogers made in his book a Chemists Perspective. He put the cut-off of the ancient linen at circa  1000 CE. Among other things, the Medieval linen had a lighter weight and that certainly is relevant to the degradation issue.\nI hope Freeman covers that in his book and let us know how this physical evidence is irrelevant naming sources other than his musings..

Inevitably the surface would often crack up and the cloth was then discarded although in cases where there was some value given to the painting it was repainted.\nClearly the pigments varied in thickness and consistency but after some centuries in place -the evidence suggests that for the Shroud they really only began to break off completely in the mid-nineteenth century as the lithograph in Beldon Scott of the 1868 exposition suggests- then the linen immediately underneath the gesso would have been discoloured. The discoloration would vary according to the thickness of the paint on top and possibly its colours. Hence you have the resulting ‘three-dimensional’ aspect of the Shroud.\nThe best way to settle this will be through finding other examples of former painted linens whose pigments have fallen off. The best example I know is the central panels of the Zittern Veil as the pigments have gone ( steamed off by Russian looters in WWII) and there are images similar to those on the Shroud on the linen underneath, but I would like to find more.\nAlthough I am told that my theories have been totally debunked,- not sure quite where and by whom- I can at least set them out clearly.

He shows no sign of having studied the iconography of the Passion. I need to do a lot of looking for my study tours and also for illustrations of relic cults. That is why I shall be seeing the Niccolo dell’Arca Lamentation in Bologna three times in this year alone.\n His examples are from high class art as one would expect from a Courtauld trained art historian- he does not see the relevance of more down to earth art such as the illustrations of the naked Christ with all over scourge marks and squiggles of blood like those on the Shroud to be found in the Holkham Bible of c.1330 which actually match the images on the Shroud. I can’t help it if I have had experiences that he has not had.\nHe simply appears to have missed the evidence from the early depictions of the Shroud as if he had never seen them. One crucial divide in Shroud studies is between those who believe the Shroud now is as it was originally created and those who don’t. That is the main difference between de Wesselow and myself- I think  the early depictions are the vital clues. And the more I study the Lirey copy the more I see it as a set of images that have themselves faded.  This is not to exclude it from my database of early Shroud descriptions but to realise that it is not representative of the spectrum of original depictions.\nThe Shroud images only make sense as linen discoloured by being overlaid by gesso and paint for centuries. We know that they were ONCE painted , there is evidence that the paint disintegrated in the nineteenth century and not surprisingly there  is some discolouration just on the surface of the Shroud underneath as the result of the overlay .I have never seen any alternative explanation that makes any kind of\nsense. And listening  to de Wesselow, it is clear that he hasn’t any satisfactory explanation for something that may look mysterious but is not actually mysterious when you look at it systematically as a creation of time and decay.\n\n","date":"June 16, 2015 at 4:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","id":"comment-202395","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist","post":"Can someone tell me what is the definition of ‘imprint’?
