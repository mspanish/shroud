[{"title":"Sky News Interview with Thomas De Wesselow","post":"Before anyone gets their dander up about de Wusselow’s thesis about the Shroud being taken as the real Christ, check-out the U-Tube Dan posted.  Again, discounting the principal thesis it’s superb. And, a real plus for Shroud authenticity.\nHis problem is his agnosticism and rejection of miracles leads him to construct the Shroud as Jesus appearance. Frankly, that’s were the quantum level kicks in. It’s at that level creation interfaces with creator.\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/sky-news-interview-with-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","id":"comment-9694","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sky News Interview with Thomas De Wesselow","post":"I do agree with your first comment, as in “discounting the ‘principal thesis’ it’s superb, a real plus for the Shroud”, only partially (see last comment below). But the problem IS his thesis. He is assuming that 1st century Jews were not ‘accustomed to visual stimulation’ although there may be some truth to this, BUT seeing as they were under Roman rule; I could make the assumption, quite easily, that they had been subjected to many images; paintings, statues and the like, in knowing full well, the Romans were big on visual images and had been around for alteast 80 years!….I can see atheists, opponents of the Shroud jumping all over this, and giving them much new material in which to downplay the truth of the Christian religion and our faith. As the facts he mentions such as; radiocarbon dating being “not a magic bullet” and the Shroud image being a “non-representative artistic style of the medieval period” have already fallen on depth ears.\nRon\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/sky-news-interview-with-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","id":"comment-9708","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sky News Interview with Thomas De Wesselow","post":"It doesn’t take a rocket scientist.\nThe proof that the Shroud of Turin is Jesus is in the stars!\nIf you download the “Hand of God” image taken by the NASA Chandra telescope, which is 17,000 light years away (1700 years old), you will see this image is the same facial image as that on the Shroud of Turin.  Then, download the picture of the head napkin of Christ that has been in Oviedo, Spain since the 700s.  Once you download this picture, take a picture of the downloaded picture with your camera.  The same image as that of the Shroud of Turin appears.  Both the Shroud image, the Chandra image and the Oviedo image are the same face.  This IS the face of Jesus.  The Chandra image even details the crown of thorns in red.\nSee links.\nChandra :: Photo Album :: PSR B1509-58 :: 3 April 09\nBlog: A Young Pulsar Shows its Hand … ray nebula that spans 150 light years.

And this is the face we see today with the photo image taken by Barrie Schwortz.\nI did the same experiment. \nDownload an image of the Sudarium of Oviedo and print it out, and then take a picture of the printed image with your camera. The face that appears is the exact image as that facial image on the Shroud.  And I mean exact, with the long nose, small lips, eyes, beard, etc.   \nSo, in conclusion the face appears on the Oviedo cloth, dated 700s.  The same face appears on the Sudarium (Carbon dating was off) and the same face appears in the sky somewhere around 300 AD (CE).  \nWhat one should wonder is what happened around 300 AD that Jesus found it so necessary to appear in the sky? \nI haven’t researched this extensively, but I did find in 303 AD, according to Michael Baigent in “The Jesus Papers,” that it was the beginning of the Christians being persecuted by Diocletian, Emperor of Rome, and there was massive destruction and deaths.\nWith that in mind, I wondered if the Chandra image could be dated to 303 AD?  I suppose NASA could do the calculations.\nWhat needs to be shown is all three images side by side.  There is no doubt all three are of the same man.\nBest,\nTamara Beryl Latham\n\n","date":"March 31, 2012 at 11:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/sky-news-interview-with-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","id":"comment-9824","author":"Tamara Beryl Latham","site":"shroudstory"}]
