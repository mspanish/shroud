[{"title":"Quote for Today by David Rolfe","post":"I think this comment is true but, at the same time, I have some difficulty to really understand well the last part.  How can “basic authenticity” could be a dividing issue among those who believe the Shroud is authentic ???\nMaybe I didn’t understand well what M.

It’s true.  Thanks for the translation.  That proves I’m not 100% bilingual yet !
