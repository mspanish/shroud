[{"title":"David Rolfe:  The Shroud image makes no concessions to art","post":"David’s comment is excellent and to the point. I differ in one regard, as he has demonstrated with a deeps sense of irony, the concept that the Shroud is of medieval origin is not just wrong but supercilious. I believe humanity is in desperate need of Christ because it is facing a crisis of a magnitude unlike any other in the past. \nI believe, and I have written, that “If the Shroud of Turin is authentic, it is arguably the important object on the face of the earth with the possible exception of nuclear weapons.” \nHumanity now faces an apocalypse. Last year, there was a flood of of scientific reports confirming that selfish exploitation of the environment has unleashed processes that will ultimately render human life untenable.\nChrist sacrificed himself but he did so because it is his Resurrection that promises to each of us that selfless sacrifice is the path to the primordial consciousness from which our existence sprang, in other words God.\nPray now, that Pope Francis lives a longer life than one might expect. He realizes that. In fact he is a modern John the Baptist crying in the desert; “Make ready the way of the Lord.”\nhttp://johnklotz.blogspot.com\n\n","date":"January 12, 2015 at 8:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/12/david-rolfe-the-shroud-image-makes-no-concessions-to-art/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-182806","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe:  The Shroud image makes no concessions to art","post":"Could lead to some inter-Church unity.\n\n","date":"January 16, 2015 at 8:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/12/david-rolfe-the-shroud-image-makes-no-concessions-to-art/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-183721","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"}]
