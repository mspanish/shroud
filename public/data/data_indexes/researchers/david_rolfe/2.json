And concerning the unscientific aspect of your paper, I see at least one thing: You agreed in that paper with Jackson’s ludicrous hypothesis that pretend that some blood clots on the skin of the Shroud man have projected themselves at a distance and have left their images on the Shroud!  Sorry but blood don’t project itself in the air!!!  It’s scientifically impossible.\nThe truth is this:  All the bloodstains on the Shroud came from DIRECT CONTACT and this is a scientific fact my friend that you don’t seem to understand.  And when someone understand that FACT, he also understand that, in order to get so many bloodstains on the cloth in so many places, you must have a very tight compression of the cloth on the corpse.  And here’s another truth: The undistorted image that we see on the Shroud is TOTALLY INCONSISTENT with this kind of tight compression position of the cloth around the body!  If the Shroud would have stayed that way around the body until the image formation process began, it’s obvious that the resulting image would have been seriously distorted, especially laterally.  Consequently, a change of position from a tight compression position to a more looser and natural position MUST have occurred.  But you’re right about the fact that there is no need to call for a miraculous intervention concerning such a change of position!  All you have to do is understand that the body wasn’t placed in the Shroud in his final resting place inside the tomb (a stone bench), but was most probably placed inside the cloth in a central room (the tradition of the Holy Sepulchre call it the stone of the anointing).  That mean there was at least one transfer done with the enshrouded body from that central place to the stone bench and it is easy to assume that such a manual transfer would have placed the shroud very close and tight with the body, which would have caused the formation of many of the bloodstains we see on the Shroud (including some located in places where there is no body image at all!). Then, you just have to assume that after the enshrouded body had been placed in his final resting place inside the tomb, the Shroud would have been replaced in a more natural and loose position by the people in charge of the burial.  And only after this had been done, the image formation process really became active.  Unlike Lavoie, such a rational scenario would not call for any divine intervention but nevertheless, I have to agree with this medecine expert that in order to get the bloodstains we see on the Shroud AND a undistorted body image, a change of position of the cloth MUST have occurred!!!\nFinally, concerning your belief versus the Shroud, no offense but I remember that, in one exchange of emails you did with me some years ago, you really seemed to favored some supernatural process to explain the image…  I remember this because hearing that from a scientist like you was a shocker!  But if my memory is wrong about that, then I will say the same thing I said to M. Rolfe: I’m sorry and I hope you will share with me your real belief regarding the Shroud.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2013 at 7:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21573","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"You misunderstood (comment #11) what was written in my paper. Unfortunately, you (Yannick) do not quote my paper. So we have to read your interpretation of it, not my original writing. \nObviously, bloodstains on the Shroud are due to contact with blood! Stating otherwise would be idiotic. By definition, a bloodstain is due to contact with blood! Nowhere in my paper do I state that bloodstains are not due to contact. So, I do not understand why you are stating otherwise. On the contrary, my paper says that the bloodstains prove that the Shroud cannot have undergone a complete loosening or flattening during image formation after being in contact with the blood on the corpse, since that would create major incorrect vertical alignments of the bloodstains vs the images. That’s the main point. All the details are in the paper.\nThere are many other points which you are quite wrong in the interpretation of Lavoie’s published work. For example, Lavoie never used the argument that the blood cannot come from the hair due to a lack of pressure. Indeed such an argument would be expected, but he did not use it. \nCan you provide a quote from Lavoie’s papers (Shroud Spectrum or the Frascati conference), on the subject of the bloodstains around the face, that states that you need a significant amount of pressure to transfer the blood from the hair to the cloth? \nIn essence, Lavoie does not prove that the bloodstains cannot come from the hair, he proves that they can come from the face. This is quite different. But to do so, he does not analyze the problem of the vertical alignments of the bloodstains vs the images and at the end has to rely on a supernatural flattening of the Shroud to “explain” the phenomenon because indeed it no longer makes geometrical sense.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2013 at 10:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21577","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"To continue my answer to comment #11, you wrote “you really seemed to favored some supernatural process to explain the image”. \nI think this is a contradiction of terms. I do not see how you can “explain” a phenomenon by relying on a supernatural process. By definition, a supernatural process has no explanation attach to it, since if you had an explanation of that process it could not be called “supernatural”. \nIn any case, I will try to explain what I think of Shroud research.\nEssentially, the artifacts (images, bloodstains, water stains, etc.) found on the Shroud can be studied in very precise terms. And you can formulate some possible explanations about their formation. You could say for example: “this image is created by the deformation of the linen fibrils”, or “this image is created by biochemical reaction X on compounds Y and Z found on top of the linen fibrils”, or “it is possible, by using a laser of frequency X at energy level Y to modify the linen fibrils as found on the Shroud”. But in all cases it may not be possible to state more precisely how these phenomenon did happen in the context of the Shroud covering a corpse in a tomb. \nAll scientific theories have limits in their power to explain and predict. It is true for General Relativity (it does not work at the nuclear level), for the Big Bang theory (where does the energy of the Big Bang comes from?), evolution (how did the first bacteria originated, was DNA or RNA from out of space?), and so on.\nThis is going to be the same for the Shroud and its images. \nLate in his life, when Rogers worked on formulating a theory to explain the images on the Shroud, he relied on the Maillard reaction. This was for a good reason since the coloration of the impurities he found on the fibrils were similar to the products of a Maillard reaction and such a reaction could occur at low temperature given enough time. On the other hand, he was aware of the limitation of that theory since it was difficult to explain how to form precise images based on heat convection. This is the limit of that theory. It explains some observations, but not some others. We could simply say “the color observed on the fibrils is very similar to the color we would find if a Maillard reaction occurred on the impurities that were detected”.  And that’s quite interesting in itself. But some other researchers are not so convinced that there is not a better explanation. They try other experiments to show that other type of physical phenomenon could create a similar color on fibrils. This is research: You try different routes so that you might actually go as far as possible in covering the observations. In some cases, these experiments are done to simply show that the coloring is possible despite what some other researchers have written. I think this is the case of Di Lazzaro and his colleagues at ENEA: I think Rogers stated that a laser could not produce such a coloring without destroying the fibrils. They wanted to show otherwise. And I think they succeeded for that specific goal. (Of course, the media got into it and turned things around completely, creating a huge confusion.) In the case of Giulio Fanti, his corona discharge experiments were also to show that a similar coloring is possible. This is research.\nBut to remain coherent, we also have to admit that the phenomenon and circumstances that created the Shroud images are quite unique and probably very difficult to reproduce, if reproducible. This is so since we essentially have only one (recorded) such shroud in the history of mankind. If the phenomenon we are proposing occurs frequently, then it is suspicious that this phenomenon is the right one since we should have more shrouds like the Shroud of Turin. On the other hand if we propose an experiment that we cannot (ethically or otherwise) reproduce, that cannot be useful. That’s the  dichotomy of the Shroud.  \nIn essence, Shroud research is quite uncharacteristic compared to many other fields since you have to find some phenomenon that cannot happen on a regular basis but also that you could reproduce.\nI hope my answer was not too convoluted!\nAnd I hope to see real research around the Shroud, not continuous bickering and personal attacks.\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 3:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21584","author":"latendre","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"Great video.

Daveb also has a point in that either scenario may be tenable when it comes to the tomb narrative. Translation of the scriptures is a sticky point when dealing in such matters. I tend to disagree with Augustine’s interpretation and feel it tends to run along the lines that the apostles or in this case in particular, John, were idiots. To me, John at that precise moment, after viewing the status of the burial cloths knew exactly what had occured and as Jesus had told them he would rise again on the third day. The other apostles still hiding were not prevy to this knowledge and possibly didn’t believe John either when he got back and told them.

It was the post-Easter appearances in general that were decisive. The problem with de Wesselow is that although his book called attention to the unique image on the TS he did not seem to understand that for the Palestinian Jewish-Christians who formed the Jesus movement resurrection meant bodily resurrection and not the Greek philosophical dichotomy of body/soul. He therefore dismisses many of the Gospel accounts as “fantasies.”\nThere is another problem, and that is with J.P. Meier, whose series will end without the Resurrection because he thinks that that is beyond the scope of the historian. It is like judging what is less historical to be beyond the purview of the historian. So he simply says that “Jesus rose in the fullness of his humanity into the full presence of God.” That is fine for him as a Catholic priest, in fact a monsignor, who believes in the Resurrection, and who also says mass and preaches at a parish in New York.\nBenedict XVI, whose book “Jesus of Nazareth” has also been appreciated by important Protestant scholars, and is a theologian and no historian, puts it more succinctly: “The Resurrection is not above and beyond history. It points beyond history but has left footprints in history.” Shroud studies will have to determine if the relic is ONE of those footprints.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2013 at 5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21560","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"\nYannick Clément :Ron wrote: “It is quite reasonable to assert that when Jesus appeared to the disciples in the room that evening, John was already fully aware and a believer of Jesus’s resurrection, yet not the others.”\nMy opinion: Oh I’m far from being sure of that Ron.

The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.”  This part of the text really seem to suggest that the disciple only became happy AFTER Jesus show them his side and hands so they could finally recognize him, which is exactly what happened to Thomas…\nAnd this incapacity to recognize the Resurrected Christ can be found in almost every single Resurrection account, from the apparition to Mary Magdalen in St John to the apparition to the disciples of Emaus in St Luke to the final apparition near the lake in St John, etc., etc.  Someone who don’t understand from all these texts that the glorious body of Jesus was not  exactly the same as it was during his lifetime (i.e. the same as we can see on the Shroud) has a MAJOR PROBLEM of understanding.

Sorry Yannick, but a theory that can account for a smudge cannot be extrapolated indefinitely to explain the Shroud image.

He never even thought the TSM could have been subjected to any specific burial ritual. What he coud at best thought is the TSM could have been subjected to the 1st c. CE Jerusalem cave-tomb temperature early in Spring.  He totally overlooked/ignored (at least) two possible archaeological parameters/scenarios that just cannot be totally ruled out here namely a purifying and drying-out ritual implying the use of a fumigation (the Sindon being used as a long INNER burial cloth) and/or a corpse buried still in hyperthermia. Hence archaeo(crypto)logically speaking, his observations either could be or are biased. The true fact is Ray Rogers never  explored  3-4 possible archaeological scenarios (fumigation of a tightly wrapped up corpse; corpse in hyperthermia; corpse fumigation associated with hyperthermia) through state of the art experimental archaeology. Actually, the ritualistic approach is the only one left totally unexplored so far.\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 9:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21601","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"BTW my reconstruction of the TSM’ burial DOES NOT contradict at all Ray Roger’s opinion: “This also suggests that, if a body was involved in image formation, it was dry at the time the color formed.”\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21602","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"BTW YC, do you really know  what a purifying and DRYING-OUT ritual is all about?\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 9:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21603","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"BTW YC, do you really get the real purport of Ray Roger’s observations?\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 9:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21604","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"YC, actually, it is not so much Ray Rogers’ opinion/observations that is/are biased but the way you interpret it/them as far as my reconstruction is concerned.\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 9:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21605","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"Typo: …as the way you…\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 9:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21606","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"Reminder ;-): Looking for a full body silicone medical mannequin realistic replica of the Sindon Man with water chamber (to be filled with heated water to simulate body and body hyperthermia temperatures) and fully jointed neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles (to provide a deathlike range of similar rigor mortis positions) + 3-4 sets of ad hoc linen cloths (both medieval and late antique replicas) so that the Sindon’s Man specific burial could be reconstructed.\n\n","date":"January 4, 2013 at 9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-21607","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England","post":"Second reminder: According to my thesis, the Sindon Image is a cryptovolumetric bloody-body-cloth-CONTACT-AND-GRADUAL-LOSS-OF-CONTACT 2D to 3D IMAGE resulting from a collimated/auto-regulated light (or pre-)mordanting of a thin carbohydrate layer of impurities.
