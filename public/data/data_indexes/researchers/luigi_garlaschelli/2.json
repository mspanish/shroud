It’s a fiol of the blood of Saint Januarius that liquefy once a year.  You can read more on this saint here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Januarius\nLook like our friend Garlaschelli is the Joe Nickell of Italy !!!  A professional miracle and relic debunker !  And you know what I think ?  It’s good that there is people like that because if there was not, people would be like those of the Middle Ages when every relics were considered authentic and almost every healing was considered an act of God !  And, for the Shroud, those guys forces the pro-authenticity to work more precisely.\n\n","date":"December 23, 2011 at 6:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/22/quote-for-today-luigi-garlaschelli-on-the-enea-report/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6061","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Quote for Today: Luigi Garlaschelli on the ENEA Report","post":"But guys like Nickell’s and Garlaschelli can and do hurt the studies of the Shroud, and in a big way! Do you know how many times I’ve heard people “ignorantly’ reference them in thier arguments against the Shroud? …There are alot of simple minds out there that would and do take these guys seriously and hang on to every word they say!!. People like Nickells and Garlaschelli are a huge hurdle to these people understanding the scientific truths about the Shroud, and unfortunately even the media still see it worthy to get thier opinions….go figure!\nR\n\n","date":"December 25, 2011 at 7:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/22/quote-for-today-luigi-garlaschelli-on-the-enea-report/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6108","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
