Jackson, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\" (1991)\n","post":"\n\nHi Steve,This is pretty interesting. In addition to reading your blog, I've also been poking around Dan Porter's blog, where you posted on this hypothesis here, as well as the finding that the Shroud actually does have a faint image on the back side of the front image, as predicted by Jackson.I think it's increasingly obvious that, at the bare minimum, the Shroud image *must* have been caused by a real human body, and that skeptical arguments, if they are to have any merit at all, must start with that premise. We already went into the sheer absurdity that results when you try to imagine what it would require for some medieval artist to forge such an image.With that said, what do you make of Ray Rogers' hypothesis of some kind of \"naturalistic\" image formation caused by some sort of chemical reaction of the Shroud to the corpse of the man on it? Personally, I find several things wrong with it. First, if the image was created by the Shroud folding into the crevices of the dead man's body and undergoing some sort of chemical reaction as it made contact with his skin, it seems to me that you would expect the image to come out distorted when the cloth was removed made flat again.Second, it strikes me as wildly implausible that such a \"naturalistic\" process would just happen to occur on the body of Jesus, and nobody else in history that we're aware of. Alternatively, if we wish to propose that it's not really Jesus' body, but some other body, we must suppose that some forger knew about this mysterious \"naturalistic\" process that still eludes us, found some guy who looked like Jesus in the artwork, then whipped him, crucified him, stuck a crown of thorns on his head, and speared him in the side to make his injuries look like Jesus', then put what would become the Sudarium of Oviedo on his face, then removed the Sudarium and put the Shroud over him, and performed whatever type of chemical wizardry was necessary to make the man's image transfer to the Shroud (but unknown to everyone else of his day and still unknown to us), then somehow passed the Shroud and Sudarium off as legitimate.Still, from reading Dan Porter's blog, there seems to be some disagreement between Ray Rogers' description of the image and the ENEA's, with Ray Rogers claiming that the image only exists in some sort of film of impurities on the surface of the Shroud, without perturbing the actual linen fibers at all, and the ENEA team postulating that the image is burned into the primary cell walls of the linen fibers. Do you have any insight into this?\n\n","author":"The Deuce","date":"January 24, 2012 at 5:32 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nJohn P.

Hamon attributes it to \"more pressure\" on the cloth by the hands and face. Personally, I find Hamon's idea problematic because if the reverse-side image were the result of more pressure, then there should have been a *much stronger* image of Jesus' back on the reverse side of the back image than there is of his face and hands on the reverse of the front side. After all, the back is the side of the Shroud he was laying on, with the full pressure of his body weight! And, finally, why do we see Jesus' hair so clearly on the Shroud, which shouldn't have exerted any significant pressure at all (actually, it occurs to me that the hair is just as serious and maybe fatal a problem for Ray Rogers and any other possible \"naturalistic\" explanation involving chemical reaction with a dead body as well)? In any event, the idea that the reverse image was caused by pressure presupposes that this is a real body we're talking about. In fact, the existence of the reverse-side image puts further paid to the notion that this was some sort of paint job.Btw, I got a bit of a chuckle out of sciencebod's objection that started the thread at Dan Porter's blog that I linked to. He tries to argue that the image isn't really 3D because the burn holes create a 3D appearance under topological analysis as well, and he seems to think that this is some sort of major revelation. Um, duh. Isn't it obvious that the 3D image arises from differences in hue caused by the different intensities of \"burn-in\" on the image, so that anything else that causes a gradation of hue (such as a burn mark) will produce a \"3D effect\" in an analysis that estimates depth based on hue? What was sciencebod expecting? An actual hologram on a linen cloth?! Anyhow, by making the argument that the 3D image is fake, and that it's actually some sort of 2D image masterfully made to look 3D, he's implicitly committed himself to precisely those absurdities that we covered earlier. In fact, he seems to compound the insanity by insisting that the image was made with \"a converging lens, concave mirror, or even pinhole camera\" (just try to imagine a medieval forger performing such a feat)!\n\n","author":"The Deuce","date":"January 24, 2012 at 5:33 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nJohn P.

I didn't see it. But Jackson's paper I posted predicts that any reverse side image would be \"less intense\":\"It is likely, however, that if a frontal image discoloration exists on the reverse surface of the Shroud, it would be somewhat less intense than the discoloration which is observed on the normal viewing side because that side presumably entered the body first.\"Besides, it is not necessarily so that \"the image on the reverse side of the Shroud contains ... not the rest of the body.\"The second image's discoverer, Prof. Giulio Fanti, says that a second image of the rest of the body may be there, but \"masked by the noise of the digital [sic. frontal?] image itself\":\"`Though the image is very faint, features such as nose, eyes, hair, beard and moustache are clearly visible. There are some slight differences with the known face. For example, the nose on the reverse side shows the same extension of both nostrils, unlike the front side, in which the right nostril is less evident,' Fanti said. But the enhancing procedure did not uncover the full body image as it appeared on the front side. `If it does exist, it is masked by the noise of the digital image itself. But we found what it is probably the image of the hands,' Fanti said.\" (\"Turin shroud shows another mystery face,\" (Rossella Lorenzi, Discovery News/ABC Science, 12 April 2004).Since Jackson's theory is that the intensity of the image is a function of how long was the time a body part fell through the radiation:\"The initial draping configuration of the Shroud over a body establishes the initial cloth-body distances. If, then, the Shroud overlying the body falls into the body region, different points on the cloth will intersect the body surface at different times depending upon how far that point was originally away from the body. Thus, each cloth point will receive a radiation dose in proportion to the time that it is inside the emitting body region.\"the head and hands would be expected to show up more clearly on the reverse image because they were the highest body parts of the Man in the Shroud (due to His bent forward crucifixion position, fixed by rigor mortis) and therefore they received the most radiation.Stephen E.

It is amazing, as is everything related to the shroud. The shroud has greatly strengthened my faith. I was like Thomas, and prayed for God to help me somehow with something concrete. He led me to the shroud as sure as the sun rises in the morning.I wonder if the UV/X-ray light particles were somehow stationary as the shroud collapsed through the space where the body was. It seems that the radiation would have to be stationary for a relatively long period of time - enough time for gravity to pull the sheet through the space.I wonder whether the sudden transformation could have created a vacuum? Did air remain where previously there was a material body? If not, then perhaps the sheet halves were sucked together even more quickly?Perhaps the same physics occurred when Jesus passed through the walls of the closed room to appear to the 11.\n\n","author":"Stephen E.
