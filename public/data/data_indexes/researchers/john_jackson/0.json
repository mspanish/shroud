[{"title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender","post":"The first what I think Dan, is that the Shroud image must be carefully analysed, by those who really have experience with it. And no hasty and too far-reaching conclusions should be made without carefully thinking eveything.\nNow, the second is that bony or veiny hands happen: \n\nor just look on mine.\nThird, here you have a 3D plot of hands area, with a very rough subtraction of blood (as you can see some contours remained):\n\nIt is hard to interpret 3D plots of such tiny details, due to several issues I mentioned in my last paper. Some gaps between metacarpals seem nevertheless evident.\nThe point is: how deep they are.\nThe maximum range for imaging is in my opinion (based on analysis of distances of my facial features), as well as Vignon’s  no more than 1-2 cm (Jackson & Jumper 3.7 cm is clealry untenable). Based on 3D plot we see that the metacarpal gaps have a greyscale intensity of ~ 90-100 (they are white), while metacarpals, and fingers are about 150-160 (green-yellow). This would indicate level difference of maybe ~5 mm. Quite possible, especially for dehydrated hands. No X-ray is needed here.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2015 at 9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-213561","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender","post":"I see that Whangers, after 15 years, updated their website: http://people.duke.edu/~adw2/shroud/index.html \nAnyway, as to the teeth images, they are real.

No, the reason is simpler and much more terrible; the rictus grin due to the tenure muscular spasms as result of of extreme strain and suffering during crucifixion. Though the teeth are clamped, the lips are open due to the spasm, resulting in visible teeth.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2015 at 10:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-213563","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender","post":"Hey O.K.

The image is halftone, made of “dots” of different sizes, made of bundles of fibers roughly the same colored. These dots give the impression of body image and its various features: hands, fingers, hair, face, nose, eyelids and teeth. But physically, they are nothing but dots. Our mind gives them interpretation.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2015 at 3:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-213577","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender","post":"https://video-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xtf1/v/t42.1790-2/1302577_10201833918752323_39539_n.mp4?efg=eyJybHIiOjMwMCwicmxhIjo1MTIsInZlbmNvZGVfdGFnIjoibGVnYWN5X3NkIn0%3D&rl=300&vabr=80&oh=64f9f214545f1b5582e675f0cdb0dace&oe=562D7F87\nFrank Zappa’s?\n\n","date":"October 25, 2015 at 5:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-213582","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender","post":"Oh Boy, I am not a scientist.  My skills are as knowing that it is easier to find your way around in the daytime with the light somehow provided by the Sun than it is at night time with or with out moon light (reflected sun light). As I had said before, I do not see coins covering the eyes but I do see the pupils of the eyes.  As others I can see the teeth image, and what almost appears to be some x-ray effect in some of the body image of Jesus.  I have just accepted the fact that what I see is the remaining image the all powerful infinite Soul of Jesus Christ as it is entering and restructuring (instead of a mostly physical body with the God Soul it is being changed into a mostly God Physical body with the God Soul) the body and whatever the energies /forces involved they also produced the image on the cloth that everyone wants to fight about.\nSo many people are just sure that the Shroud is photo of a painting of a photo that was sprinkled with some residue gathered from all around the world.  They are sure that anyone believing that God had anything to do with Shroud are nuts.  They are trying very hard to get to the bottom of this so-called con job.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2015 at 6:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-213588","author":"Emmett McMahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender","post":"I think the difference between pareidolia and a true representation is that a representation is intended to resemble, or has been made by, the reality it depicts. A painting of the Mona Lisa looks like the Mona Lisa, and a shadow on a wall looks like the tree that caused it. The man on the shroud either left a representation of himself – consciously or unconsciously – or was depicted by an artist who wanted to create an image of that man. On the other hand a cloud which looks like an elephant is a pareidolia, and the shadow of a tree that looks like an octopus is another. If the teeth on the Shroud were caused in some way by actual teeth, then they are not pareidolia, but accurate observation. If they are mere artefacts of the imperfections on the cloth, then they are pareidolia. The image of the man is not pareidolia unless it is a random collection of discolourations which coincidentally resemble a man. The fact that an image is made of halftone dots, paint or photographic emulsion does not make it pareidolia, in my opinion.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2015 at 3:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-213613","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender","post":"I believe Hugh is correct in his interpretation of the meaning of “pareidolia”.  It seems to be a fairly recent word that has come into the language.  My Collins of about 1990 does not include it, nor is there an entry in my Encyc Brit of 2006.  My Collins does include the word “eidolon” from the parent Greek, – “1. an unsubstantial image; apparition; phantom; 2. an ideal or idealized figure  [C19 from Greek; phantom, IDOL]  On-line Collins gives the following meaning for pareidolia: “the imagined perception of a pattern or meaning where it does not actually exist, as in considering the moon to have human features”  \nIt would be a wrong use of the word to apply it to a published photograph of an easily recognisable scene or person, and yet the photograph would almost inevitably be made up of a series of closely spaced dots which the eye resolves as a clear pattern, as a result of an artifact of the printing process.  An ink-jet printer in fact produces a similar result but on a much finer resolution.  This is fairly close to what we see on the Shroud image.  However to see writing on the Shroud as some have asserted, would quite likely be a true pareidolia, if in fact the writing was not truly there.  The reports of a face on the surface of Mars resulting from mountain shadows is clearly a case of pareidolia.  But merely because the eye is capable of resolving a series of dots into a coherent image is not sufficient for the image to be classified as a pareidolia, if in fact it is a true representation of an objective reality.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2015 at 4:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-213616","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
