[{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"Interesting read. Reading this does raise a curiousity in my mind of how the hair left any image. I say this because I am of the opinion that it was a natural process that caused the image. I’d have to wonder though if that would also apply to the hair. Wouldn’t it take far longer to start breaking down and give off gases or whatnot? Are gases from the decaying body below the hair somehow affected by the hair causing the image? These are probably all questions that won’t necessarily be resolved until the image causing mechanism is positively identified but they do cross my mind.\n\n","date":"January 18, 2012 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7137","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"Nice comment Chris.

However, my immediate problem with Jackson’s hypothesis is that, at least in the version he has on video tape, he is clear that it leaves no room for 3D properties on the back image, and I think it’s clear that these properties do exist on the back image, even if to a lesser degree than on the front image.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2012 at 5:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7163","author":"Robert","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"If Jackson’s “collapse theory” was PHYSICALLY true, most if not all of the body front image should  have been recorded not just the head and possibly the hand areas on the back surface of the cloth.

Chris, you impress me…  \nPierre Barbet noted that the undisturbed aspect of the blood stain on the Shroud was scientifically unexplainable (Barbet add prudently : in the present state of our knowledge) and, for him (and for me also), this is the only “clear” sign of resurrection that a faithful can see on the Shroud.  In other word, you search for a sign of the resurrection on the Shroud &  Don’t look at the body images, look at the blood stains !!!  But sadly, most people always do the opposite !!!  \nAs Barbet point out : If the body was taken out of the Shroud by someone (after the blood had dried, that should have been pretty fast after the draping), then we SHOULD NOT SEE complete blood stains with sharp edges and without missing parts.  \nIn other word, the high quality of the blood stains (and the fact that they are not “broken”, if I can use this term) makes the scenario of a removal of the corpse by someone almost impossible and it really “look like” the body simply disappeared !  As crazy as this observation seem(for someone who don’t believe in the resurrection), this is the REALITY of the blood stains on the Shroud, as noted by a medical expert like Barbet !  It’s not just a pseudo-scientific idea here…  This is a solid fact !  The quality and the aspect of the blood stains just don’t fit with the scenario of someone who remove a dead body from\na Shroud.  The only way it could be possible, would have been a removal of the corpse almost immediately after he was put in the Shroud, while the blood clots were still humid.  This scenario is highly improbable.\nFor the lenght of time that the corpse remains into the Shroud, it could not have been more than 36 to 40 hours because after that, the first liquids from the rotting process appeared and they would have destroyed the images and the blood stains.  Now, for the minimal lenght of time that the body had to be in the Shroud in order for the image to be formed, it is, as you say, impossible to say for sure, not until we can be sure of the image formation mechanism.  Vignon, who proposed a vaporographic theory in the beggining of the 20th century said that the body should have been in the Shroud for at least 24 hours, in order to produced an image via his “vaporographic” image formation process.  This is just an example.  If the image formation process is a natural phenomenon, we can be almost sure that the body should have been in contact with the body for at least this lenght of time (24 hours), but this is just a wild guess…\n\n","date":"January 19, 2012 at 11:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7177","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"Thanks for the reply, Yannick, I appreciate it.

Jackson hypothesis postulate the opposite :  That the dorsal image is only (or mainly, I don’t remember is exact words during his presentation in St-Louis in 1991) the result of a direct contact process, on the contrary to the frontal image the is not just a direct contact process, but both contact and at-a-distance process.  Jackson needs that in order for his hypothesis to work.  But the thing is :  there’s really distance information in the dorsal image, just like the frontal image !  The only thing is that this distance information is less evident because a bigger portion of the back part of the corpse was in direct contact with the cloth.  By the way, this is a proof that Gilbert Lavoie’s hypothesis is wrong also :  the image formation occurred while the body was resting in an horizontal position (normal for a dead body) and not when he was lifted up in the air in a vertical position.  In the end, this fact that there is distance information in the dorsal image is somewhat like the the Achilles heel of Jackson hypothesis…\n\n","date":"January 19, 2012 at 11:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7175","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"Yannick, all through your postings you keep saying the Shroud was just loosely draped  over the corpse.

Since the double imprint might well result from an overall gradual pressure release of the soaked long interior linen cloth drying up next to the crucifixion victim’s stiff body, a project in experimental archaeology would be most appropriate to reconstruct this specific late ancient Judean burial rite.”\n\n","date":"January 20, 2012 at 11:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7231","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"Typo errror: you should read ” “In case of innocent blood shed by the Sanhedrin” instead of “In case of shed of innocent blood by the Sanhedrin”.\n\n","date":"January 20, 2012 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7232","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"I also wrote: “A linen bandage or a (diagonally?) rolled up napkin tied at eye level in a knot at the back and over the veiled enshrouded head might well have stopped the lepton simpvlvm from slipping further along left eyebrow arch that is between the body and the internal face of the Shroud.

Hamon attributes it to “more pressure” on the cloth by the hands and face.” \nDeuce immedialte adding: “Personally, I find Hamon’s idea problematic because if the reverse-side image were the result of more pressure, then there should have been a *much stronger* image of Jesus’ back on the reverse side of the back image than there is of his face and hands on the reverse of the front side. After all, the back is the side of the Shroud he was laying on, with the full pressure of his body weight!”\nI would have hoped both Deuce and Steve had more carefully read what I wrote. I wrote; “…his (Rabbi Yeshua’s) tightly enshrouded stiff body was placed first on his left side and then on his right side (at head and knee level?) upon two stones and in extra height above a slab to be submitted to a myrrho-aloetic fumigation.” During the image formation process, his body was not laying on his back (in a suspine position)!

Do you have proof that the images you mention run completely through the material as would be the case with capillary action? From what I’ve read, those whom have investigated the images FIRST HAND, have stated these images are only ‘superficial’ on the back, same as found on the frontal image and do not run through as found with most blood images.\nR\n\n","date":"January 26, 2012 at 3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7566","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\"","post":"The hair, eyebrow arch, beard and moustache images are in the thickness of the linen fabric and do completely run through it.
