So then some sort of process should have taken place during the resurrection.»\nThis time I don’t agree with you.\nNo matter what can be said about how the Image formed on the cloth the FACT is that whatever the «agent» responsible for the chemical changes that produced discoloration of the linen fibers THIS HAPPENED ONLY ONCE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND and with one Man whose name was Jesus Christ.\nTill now even the most sophisticated essays for duplicating the IMAGE OF THE SHROUD have not achieved a reliable result, I mean for example Professor Luigi Garlaschelli’s image, Professor Fanti’s (this one obtained by a process of corona discharge was quite grotesque…) and so on.\nI’m convinced that the so called process of image formation acted through the laws of nature which were established by GOD the creator of the Universe, no matter if it was a «naturalistic» process like a Maillard reaction, emitted radiation or some kind of supernatural event.\nThe fact is that whatever happened in that tomb with Jesus dead Body left an imprint on the Shroud and what else can it be but a MIRACLE?\nThis imprint on the Shroud is by itself a miracle and was produced as a by-product of the biggest miracle, the Resurrection of Christ.\nWe’ll never know what the Resurrection is from a scientific point of view because miracles are beyiond the realm of science but we do know that the Image of the Man of the Shroud is a miracle granted by God to mankind.\nWell these are just my thoughts.\n                                                                  GOD bless you\n                                                         Antero de Frias Moreira\n                                                (Centro Português de Sindonologia)\n\n","date":"November 9, 2015 at 4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-214434","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Process of Resurrection","post":"Dear Mr. Frias Moreira\nThank you for your comments. Yes resurrection is a miracle. However unlike in other miracles, Jesus left us his battered image on his burial cloth for the future generations to believe. \nBut unlike other miracles performed by Jesus, during the resurrection some sort of process had occured and this extra ordinary process created the image on the linen cloth. That is why no one can give a reasonable explaination about the formation of Negative Image. (during the first century or 14th century no one knew how to paint a negative image of a full size person or even did not have technology to uniformly scorch full image of a person) \nImage formation can not be explain by today’s scientific knowledge. So for any laymen resurrection image formation also a miracle.\nGod Bless You\nSampath\n\n","date":"November 9, 2015 at 7:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-214448","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Process of Resurrection","post":"So, if I understand the non-process (meaning that the process does not exist) in my way of thinking- it either is or it isn’t – or maybe, it isn’t or it is.

The evangelists were concerned to proclaim Jesus as Lord, not writing history as we now know and understand it.  The Cana miracle of turning water into wine is only recorded in Luke, a gentile, probably Greek.  A contemporary engineer and resourceful inventor, Heron of Alexandria had created a device giving the illusion of turning water into wine.  It is a temping thought that Luke had heard of it, borrowed it, or ascribed it to Jesus.  The guarantor of Luke’s gospel in the late 2nd century was said, somewhat ambiguously,  to be Paul, although there is no Papias fragment concerning Luke.  \nCollins has a very long definition on the meaning of the word “process”.  Simply put a “process” is a series of actions that produce change, and involves time.  Probably describing the resurrection as a process is therefore likely incorrect as Dan indicates.  The only essential known requirements for resurrection seem to be that one has to be dead at the outset, and afterwards the same person has to be alive in a particular sense, but resuscitation does not count.  However there is only one known case of resurrection and how it came about is a true mystery. \nI shrink from the idea that the Shroud image was in some way a byproduct of the resurrection.  If it was a miracle, it was so in its own right,  Meantime I prefer to think a naturalistic explanation by some as yet unknown “process” was the likely cause.\n\n","date":"November 9, 2015 at 1:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-214425","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Process of Resurrection","post":"No. The miracle of the water changed into wine at the wedding feast in Cana was recorded by the Evangelist, St. John, 2:1-11.

Otherwise you are like a lost sheep.”\nI don’t agree, I think it is quite obvious that the Gospels are a mix of fact and fable, or literal description and figurative / metaphorical text. There is a lot of research to back that up, and it would seem that generally speaking it is Christians of a fundamentalist nature who would believe every miracle story in the Gospels is literally true.  \nThere are some who quite convincingly argue that the Virgin Birth is myth. I’m agnostic on the Virgin Birth. I think it could be myth, or literally true – or both. Because I believe in the resurrection, as a supernatural event, I believe it is logically consistent to consider that another miracle at the START of Christ’s life COULD have occurred. \nI think it’s a logical fallacy when Christians who believe in the resurrection (unless they believe it in some ‘metaphorical’ sense) say they cannot believe in the Virgin Birth because of its supernatural nature. \nHaving said that the Virgin Birth stories have a lot of mythic qualities. But that doesn’t mean the whole story is myth – maybe it really did occur but was embellished within a mythic framework. I think the resurrection stories are similar, especially Matthew’s account which seems to be embellished with legendary elements.\n\n","date":"November 11, 2015 at 4:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-214485","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Process of Resurrection","post":"Thank you very much Thomas. \nMy opinion about Holy Bible is quite different. I think Holy Bible was given to Christians by Constantine as a political solution to satisfy various Christian groups existed at that time. As an example, to satisfy Jewish Christians compilers included Old Testament, although Moses plagiarised the Creation story, the Flood story and also the Ten Commandments from other nations. Also to satisfy Pauline Christians they included Epistles of Paul. Surprisingly those who compiled the Bible did not use any records of majority of other Apostles. They did not include anything about Thomas especially what he did in India and neighbouring countries of India. In addition they burnt many books inherited by other Christian groups.\nJesus never mentioned anything about the creation story and/or the great flood. Only thing Jesus mentioned from the creation story is that at the beginning Father made man and woman and when they united they become one. Also Jesus told that no one knows the end but only the Father.\nMost of the Epistles written by Paul contradict the new commandment of Jesus and the two Great Commandments mentioned by Jesus.\nSo as a follower of Jesus either Old Testament or Epistles give me no help to understand the Kingdom of God. (or the Kingdom of Love). Only four Gospels tell about the Kingdom of God and how can we enter into it.\nAs a follower of Jesus (not as a Christian or fundamentalist Christian) I believe all stories of Jesus from 4 Gospels. I have to believe those stories because I believe that Jesus really resurrected from death. Although there are many sceptics, my wisdom always tells me that Shroud of Turin is authentic. So the Shroud of Turin is the main and first Gospel for me. From 1st April 2010, the day I was introduced to the Shroud, I believe that Jesus really existed, died on the cross and resurrected. So to believe other Gospels and its stories are not a problem for me.\n\n","date":"November 11, 2015 at 6:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","id":"comment-214514","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"}]
