The reach of his influence in many venues including connecting the right people and creating alliances the sum of which was much greater than the parts was essential to the success of the task. For example there was the Rolfe (and Wilson) plus Jackson et al plus Harry John’s money. And, a portion of Silent Witness proceeds was fed back to Father Rinaldi to help fund STURP. And hovering in the background was the ghost of  Fr. Rinaldi’s uncle whose memory opened doors for David Rolfe. He  was eventually beatified by the Church (the uncle, not David) :-)\nBut we have to realize we don’t have a Father Rinaldi right now. What we need are some serious scientists. Maybe even an historian or two.

As a Jesuit he is a man who understands the role of science and reason. Allowing a balanced new study of the Shroud would be a great way to further this type of respectful (fingers crossed!) dialogue. What a fitting way to practice what we preach — and this Pope is certainly trying to be a ‘practice what I preach’ type of leader.\nIf only I had his phone number!\n\n","date":"November 1, 2013 at 10:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/01/stephen-jones-on-antonaccis-latest-the-vatican-would-probably-want-to-see-a-broad-consensus/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-49447","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones on Antonacci’s Latest:  the Vatican would probably want to see a broad consensus","post":"What we may need is a clerical champion, although there will never be another Rinaldi.

I remember reading that the lab set up in Florence after the floods was now in danger of closing and all its expertise being scattered but perhaps it is still going and it would have enormous credibility when it produced results.\n\n","date":"November 2, 2013 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/01/stephen-jones-on-antonaccis-latest-the-vatican-would-probably-want-to-see-a-broad-consensus/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-49549","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones on Antonacci’s Latest:  the Vatican would probably want to see a broad consensus","post":"Before to work perhaps you have to be able\nto look something in Italy … (or in Europe !) …\nThere are the following links :\nhttp://www.nanoxm.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/depliant_en_small.pdf \nhttp://www.nanoxm.it\nor (better) :\nhttp://www.nanotechitaly.it/\n>The sixth edition of NanotechItaly opens a window onto so-called KETs, the Key Enabling Technologies defined by the Horizon 2020 program.
