[{"title":"My ranking of spurious and/or unsupported claims made by Shroudologists","post":"Hi.\nI assume you meant to say ”real corroboration’   😉\nA single experiment describing loss/non-loss of colour from fibres that have scarcely any colour to start with, as seen under the microscope when wetted with enzyme solution, hardly constitutes definitive evidence for the view that blood came before body image. It’s non-quantitative evidence, and one is being asked to take too much on trust.\nA great deal hangs on the truth or otherwise of the blood-first claim, yet it has been raised to the level of dogma, and dogma that is cited at every opportunity by those keen to reject any idea of forgery.\nSorry, but I don’t think there is any place for dogma in science, and that applies not just to this particular claim of Adler’s, but to two others of his as well – the weird bilirubin conjecture – now elevated to dogma – and his equally weird clot-retraction/serum exudation suggestion – also dogma.\nThe blood first dogma needs re-examining from as many approaches as possible. I suggested one a while ago, based on mechanical abrasion and microscopy.\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/my-immediate-response-to-a-comment-on-did-the-bloodstains-really-precede-image-formation-on-the-shroud-of-turin/\n","date":"August 28, 2012 at 9:04 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/my-ranking-of-spurious-andor-unsupported-claims-made-by-shroudologists/","cat":"league_table","id":"comment-560","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"My ranking of spurious and/or unsupported claims made by Shroudologists","post":"I’m intrigued by your claim #1.\nCould you post up just why there’s no real collaboration for this?\n","date":"August 28, 2012 at 6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/my-ranking-of-spurious-andor-unsupported-claims-made-by-shroudologists/","cat":"league_table","id":"comment-559","author":"Jean","site":"colinberry"}]
