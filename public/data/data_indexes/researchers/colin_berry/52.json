[{"title":"Colin Berry: Hello, all you Shroud sceptics out there (What about us?)","post":"Thank you for the mention Dan. I am gradually getting to grips with WordPress as a blog-hosting site (having previously used others) and knocking it into shape. Shame WordPress could not have allowed me to select the blog title before putting up that monstrosity with no spaces before going live. Do these web designers EVER assemble panels of new users to test out their products?\nAnyway, here are the questions that I am currently addressing in my first real post (yes, it is a work in progress rather than  a fait accompli)\nPOINTS TO BE ADDRESSED\n•Lack of fluorescence of Shroud under uv\n•Strippability with adhesive tape\n•Faintness of the image, so-called half tone effects.\n•       Superficiality/thinness of the image. Failure to see damage in medullas of fibres.\n•Response to a chemical reducing reagent (diimide) or oxidising agent (H2O2)\n•The fact that the image is a negative, suggestive some say of photography\n•Encoded 3D information\n•Image not in the cellulose itself (?) but some kind of surface coating.\n•Heat would have produced pyrolytic change in the blood stains. \nPS:  While it is not for me to tell you how to organize your site, Dan, have you not considered using the Add Latest Comments widget to display them in the sidebar?\n\n","date":"February 15, 2012 at 7:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/13/colin-berry-hello-all-you-shroud-sceptics-out-there-what-about-us/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-8277","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"}]
