[{"title":"A new take in pictures on an old artefact  – the (not really a) Shroud of Turin,  more an imaginative 14th century marketing wheeze.","post":"Well, that’s all very interesting, worldwide, all part of life’s rich pageant one might say. But you and I are diametrically opposed on at least one thing – namely Secondo Pia. He did what you and I can do with the many photographs available of the Shroud ‘as-is’ image (e.g. from Shroud Scope) namely  to put it into ImageJ, and “Invert” in the Edit function, i.e. reverse tones such that black becomes white and vice versa. Hey presto – a distinctly unattractive image suddenly becomes a kind of positive “photograph” of a real man, except it’s not a photograph, of course, merely a tone-reversed negative imprint.\nI’ve proposed a novel hypothesis on my science buzz site for how the TS image might have been produced by a medieval artisan. It involves a two stage process: imprinting the image off a real human being or replica using some kind of carbohydrate or protein paste, and then developing that imprint in nitric acid fumes (strongly oxidizing, with some additional chemistry, e.g. nitration of proteins,  for creating a yellow imprint that even if it subsequently flakes off may still leaving a ‘ghost’ imprint underneath). \nhttp://colinb-sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/\nThanks for your interest.\n","date":"April 12, 2015 at 8:31 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/a-new-take-in-pictures-on-an-old-artefact-the-not-really-a-shroud-of-turin-more-an-imaginative-14th-century-marketing-wheeze/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-6046","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"A new take in pictures on an old artefact  – the (not really a) Shroud of Turin,  more an imaginative 14th century marketing wheeze.","post":"April 12 at 2 pm (EST) – Dear Mr. Berry, your research is far more important than you realize. The face of TS is actually worshipped by many Catholics, both the conservative-leaning ones and those of the ‘Pope Francis is so cool’ variety. You may not realize that there was an entirely different “Holy Face” both venerated and supported by documented Church miracles, with devotions promulgated by the following: St. Therese of the Holy Face (aka St. Therese of Lisieux) 1873-1897, Carmelite nun and Doctor of the Church; the Venerable Leon Dupont of Tours, 1797-1876; and a Carmelite nun whose diary records personal messages from Jesus Christ regarding a Holy Face not pictured during her lifetime, Marie of St. Peter of Tours (1816-1848); plus Pope Pius IX and Pope Leo XIII. The Popes authorized this other “Holy Face” as a result of “The Miracle of 1849” where the almost blank cloth of the Vatican’s relic, Veronica’s Veil, before hundreds of shocked witnesses, assumed human features when it was displayed to the public for a Christmastime exhibition on December 28th, and which artists quickly sketched for posterity during the unique 3-hour manifestation. The two different “Holy Face” renditions bear very little resemblance to one another. If your hypothesis about the culpability of the Knights Templars in manufacturing a fake shroud is correct, this has been a deception which has been an evil act of defiance against Heaven. The individuals who prepared the hearts of hundreds of thousands of Catholics to revere the true “Holy Face” had conveniently died before the 1898 photograph taken by Secondo Pia became famous. Pia was a lawyer and city councillor of Tours who I suspect may well have been a Freemason and so privy to the havoc his work would create. As someone who believes in God, in Christ, and in the spiritual dimension of satanic activity against the Catholic Church, which Pope Pius X already recognized at the turn of the 20th-century was being shaken to its foundations in both doctrine and practice thanks to concerted activities of modernists and Freemasons, I would ask you to consider that the horrors of the French Revolution left a rich legacy for those who relished holding the Church’s supernatural claims up to ridicule and contempt in the era concerned. Far from seeking to dissuade you from your research on that account, I instead wholeheartedly applaud your dogged approach, because it lays bare the total spiritual blindness of the Catholic Church today. How quickly the real “Holy Face” was thrown aside in favor of a modern photographic counterfeit. Long before the traitorous teachings of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), new agents for the Devil’s attacks came in the form of young Communist men who strategically infiltrated hundreds of Catholics seminaries before the beginning of World War II. Yes, we are living in a revived Dark Ages. Your own efforts expose that reality.  In fact, I am sure God is helping you.\n","date":"April 12, 2015 at 7:47 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/a-new-take-in-pictures-on-an-old-artefact-the-not-really-a-shroud-of-turin-more-an-imaginative-14th-century-marketing-wheeze/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-6045","author":"worldwide2late","site":"colinberry"}]
