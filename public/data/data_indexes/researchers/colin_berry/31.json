[{"title":"Colin Berry offers a definition of Pseudoscience","post":"Colin Berry has resorted to mean and nasty personal attacks. What is he trying to achieve?One needs to load up the ridiculous http://bit.ly/YWrfKJ posting of his and scroll down 4/5 of the way to his personal attacks on Jones and Jackson and the whole of STURP. Did he mention that the rating of a professor that he shows was 1 of 1 and that such ratings are often by disgruntled students. “no Limeys. Frogs, Krauts, Itals, Dagos, Polaks,  Ruskies etc?  You know, those dodgy unassimilated foreigners with their strange  accents,” he writes of STURP. Yeah, right. The Royal Society is going to listen to this elitist, angry man. I say it is time to boycott his blog altogether.\n\n","date":"March 12, 2013 at 6:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/12/colin-berry-offers-a-definition-of-pseudoscience/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-27126","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"}]
