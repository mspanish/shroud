I know there may have been thousands of man-made images of Jesus, after all, thousands of people had first hand healing.  They likely shared wha He looked like.  Even if He were ebony black, I would accept Him, would you, if He were truly God, in the flesh.  And some, healed,  were not even near Him, but had intercessionary representatives.  All women, especially, should love Jesus, as He, alone, was always good to them, and the children.  Whatever this Shroud is, it does represent a man of sorrows, whose only crime was he loved sinners as they were, not demanding perfection in them, then, in order  to receive favor and grace, and to you, too.  A challenge:  Ask Him for truth, or anything else of you personally need.  I have seen such a granting of those who are a Doubting Thomas, to start with.  They do get an answer and confirmation, as long as your request is not silly.  Such would be to jump off a bridge and expect no body injury.\n","date":"September 8, 2016 at 7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/11/25/mr-barrie-schwortz-president-of-stera-inc-please-stop-proselytizing-incomplete-prematurely-abandoned-narrative-driven-so-called-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7772","author":"Donna Young","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Mr. Barrie Schwortz, President of STERA Inc: please stop proselytizing narrative-driven so-called¬†science.","post":"Hello there.\nYou‚Äôve come to the wrong site, I‚Äôm afraid,  given your uncompromising pro-authenticity stance ‚Äì not that I hold that against you.
