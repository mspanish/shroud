[{"title":"Was the Shroud image imprinted from a medieval life-size version of a crucifix?","post":"If you mean the gap between the top of the template head, and the top of the scorch imprint in my photo, there’s a simple explanation. I made no attempt to economize on fabric. In other words, there was a generous amount of linen above the head before folding it back over the template. That is the situation with the real TS of course, where there is a gap between the frontal and dorsal heads, with no imaging of the top of the head. I hope that answers your question.\n","date":"November 20, 2013 at 5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/was-the-shroud-image-imprinted-from-a-medieval-life-size-version-of-a-crucifix/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2487","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Was the Shroud image imprinted from a medieval life-size version of a crucifix?","post":"Why is the top of the head on the SOT conected front and back but not on the other one?\n","date":"November 20, 2013 at 5:50 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/was-the-shroud-image-imprinted-from-a-medieval-life-size-version-of-a-crucifix/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2486","author":"Mutant Buzzard","site":"colinberry"}]
