[{"title":"Today is the day the gloves comeÂ off..","post":"Hereâ€™s a question that has just been addressed to me by Matthias elsewhere\nhttp://shroudstory.com/2013/11/25/running-out-of-options/#comment-52806\nMatthias\nNovember 26, 2013 at 8:06 am | #9\nReply | Quote\nre: hot statue â€“ QUESTION\nSurely if a hot statue was used we would see image on the top of the head? Colin?\nIâ€™m stuck on the idea of dematerialization of Christâ€™s body for now ,as the basis for image creation. And no I am not proposing radiation. I am theorising that the instant act of dematerialization created some biological process that created the image. I donâ€™t know if we can ever create a model for that process, given (ordinarily) bodies do not instantly dematerialize.\nMy reply: No Matthias, itâ€™s everyone else who has the problem, at least those who assume it was a real corpse with the shroud  doing a tight U-turn at the top of the head, thus maintaining body-linen contact.\nWith thermal imprinting by this new method of mine (and previous one too for that matter) one can only efficiently imprint one side at a time. So itâ€™s left to the operative(s) to decide on how much space to leave between the two images â€“ frontal v dorsal.\nI must now go back to Shroud Scope to see how accurately the two images are aligned on the long axis ðŸ˜‰\n","date":"November 26, 2013 at 12:20 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/11/24/today-is-the-day-the-gloves-come-off/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2517","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
