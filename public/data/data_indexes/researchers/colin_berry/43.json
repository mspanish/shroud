But there is someone called Kelly Kearse who is making a big thing of it – I don’t know what his qualifications for doing this are as there does not seem any evidence that he has analysed the sample himself. If I was arguing the ‘Shroud is authentic’ case , I would certainly be very cautious about making definitive statements about AB, always a minority grouping, on such poor samples in case they were used against me,  but there you go.\nSimilarly if I was looking at how a first century Jerusalem relic might have got to Europe, I would start with the three most likely routes as there is documentation and evidence from all three.\na) The early recorded relic trade between the Holy Land and Europe documented by Michael McCormick in his Origins of the European Economy.\nb). The documented  transfer of relics from Jerusalem to Constantinople from 330 onwards, including those relics brought in by Pulcheria, the emperor’s sister in the early fifth century. Then transfer to Europe as a result of the massive looting of relics by the Crusaders\nc) The documented transfer of relics collected in the Holy Land to Europe from the Crusades.\nWhen we have so much evidence to explore here, why did Ian Wilson ever dream up the Image of Edessa idea as a means of getting the Shroud to Europe? It has been condemned by every Byzantine scholar who has discussed it and, due to the sheep -like nature of those who have accepted it, has diverted attention from far more relevant areas of research in the early relic trade. However, virtually none of these ‘shroud researchers’ have any background in the period 350 to 1100 which, and I still see myself as an outsider to it, is extraordinarily complex  as a result of poor sources and complex literary conventions in the Greek and Latin texts.So they swallow Wilson and ignore the most likely ways in which an authentic first century relic, if any such exist from a period when relics were not collected anyway, might have reached Europe!!\n","date":"January 22, 2013 at 12:59 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","id":"comment-1774","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?","post":"Postscript to your comment above re Dr. Kelly Kearse: have you seen this sentence with which he concludes his most recent comment elsewhere: “Given the relative unknowns on the origin and appearance of ABO blood types in humans, it is probably not the best yardstick in terms of possible evidence for non-authenticity.”.\n“Non-authenticity” note, which I find somewhat rich, don’t you?

Was that to prevent me acquiring by default a wholly undeserved status as the only blood expert in the village? Did Kelly just happen on that thread by chance, or did one of the godfathers of shroudology tip him off that a real immunologist was needed as a matter of urgency, one who could be trusted to be sympathetic to authenticity, as indeed Kelly seems sympathetic to authenticity?  In passing, is that how the STURP team was recruited – by recruiting those considered to be generally sympathetic to authenticity?  If so, it is any wonder we are currently knee-deep in PDFs and personal memoirs with their special pleading and dodgy half-truths etc etc (not to impugn KK).\nYes, KK’s was an skilful summary, and I was the first to say so, but the case he was arguing was arguably pro-authenticity, inasmuch as he was keen to explain how a  counter-authenticity claim had come into being through a methodological quirk.  I refer to his addressing the claim that all old blood reverts to AB, which as he rightly points out  could be true but only if relying on reverse serological typing (see my previous comment).\nSorry, must run, and have probably said more than is wise…    😉\n","date":"January 23, 2013 at 9:00 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","id":"comment-1778","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?","post":"There’s only one thing worse than a can of worms, from a scientific point of view Charles, and that is a can  devoid of contents, worms included. I refer to the fact that testing for AB, at least serologically, is totally dependent on the presence of red blood cells, i.e. the forward test, since there are no antibodies for A or B in the plasma for reverse testing.  So one may well ask how anyone managed to get a serological test for AB on Shroud “blood”, given it was said by Adler et al to have no visible red cells. As if that weren’t enough of an analytical roadblock, we were also told by Adler that it cannot even be described as haemolysed  aged whole blood, but a pale shadow thereof (“serum exudate from retracted blood clots”). So I for one take any so-called positive test for AB on Shroud “blood” with a hefty pinch, nay fistful of salt.\nThe real focus should arguably be not simply on ABO blood groups, but on the mystery connective tissue that presumably accounts for Rogers’ finding hydroxyproline (HP) in Shroud “blood”, the latter a marker for collagen and elastin.  I  think towards the end Rogers was on the point of acknowledging (in a throwaway sentence) there was some contaminating animal protein there, since there should be scarcely any HP in human blood, except for traces from  connective tissue breakdown . Elsewhere I have proposed that the Shroud was painted with the semi-digested contents of medicinal leeches that had gorged on human blood (having numerous advantages over freshly-drawn blood, like not clotting, due to the leech’s anti-coagulants.).  Leech tissue just happens to be  choc-a-bloc full of connective tissue fibres, aka collagen, and thus its specific marker HP. \nThink AB, certainly, but don’t overlook HP !\n","date":"January 22, 2013 at 11:47 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","id":"comment-1772","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?","post":"A good project. While you are into genetics, which is not my field, you might look at the AB blood grouping of the Turin Shroud. I have my doubts about the analysis of the blood anyway but now it is firmly argued that it is blood group AB. The general consensus is that this was not known before AD 900 and was the result of incoming B groups from the east mingling with  native A groups on the Hungarian plain, with AB becoming genetically embedded in the population by 1100-1200. That the initial encounter was here is backed by the Hungarians having the highest percentage of AB of any native population in Europe, suggesting a longer period of interaction.. Analysis of Hungarian graves has also failed to find any evidence of AB before 900.  Like many consensuses I have found it stated by various people including a Hungarian professor summarising these findings in an online interview but haven’t got the original research.\nI have asked around for any evidence of earlier AB and there has only been ONE example provided, a very small Israeli sample of 1977 which found  AB among a family group there. However, some other early  testing suggesting  AB in Egypt  has now been redone and found invalid  ( I think it turned out to be A not AB) and without some replication here this does not seem to be firm enough evidence to overthrow the presumption that AB is post 900..\nAs I already believe that the Shroud is medieval, partly because, despite all the mud thrown at the radiocarbon labs, no one has come up with any plausible reason why the tests were invalid and there is not an ounce of scientific evidence that the Shroud is first century, then the AB grouping is at the moment for me, merely supportive evidence which needs much more backing than i can give it. It may be that whatever is on the Shroud anyway is not blood from the AB group but the ‘Shroud is authentic’ believers have nailed it to their mast so they must be prepared for the obvious objection that AB blood is almost certainly medieval. Over to the scientists! meanwhile I will keep on asking my medical contacts – so far no one has come up with anything earlier than 900.\n","date":"January 22, 2013 at 11:16 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","id":"comment-1771","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?","post":"Thanks Charles.

Why equate English with Anglo-Saxon if the heritage has scarcely any genetic component, and is based on an imposed social and economic system from the Continent*, with a question mark over the true origins of the English language (pre-or post Roman.)

What is the likelihood that we are both descended from Saxons, Anglo-Saxons, call them what you will, who arrived post 420AD, i.e. the orthodox view, the view we were taught at school. ? What of the alternative idea, mooted notably by Stephen Oppenheimer, that we are more likely to be descended from pre-Roman occupation Britons, and not necessarily Celts either, but truly indigenous Brits, ones who colonised Britain shortly after the ice receded some 15000years ago (Basques?).\nBeware.

Good of you to look by again. \nAs I say, the term “expert” is almost meaningless when applied to an unsolved enigma, even for those of us who have few reservations about the medieval dating. It was Professor Luigi Gonella I believe who was largely responsible for abandoning the pre-agreed sampling protocol  at the eleventh hour AND for quietly sequestering a thread or two from that single corner sample that he subsequently gifted to Ray Rogers. What price then Rogers’ claim  that the thread was an end-to-end splice of two initially separate ones, implying re-weaving? Who’s to say that it was not Gonella who did the splicing – having pulled too hard on his forceps or whatever and snapped the thread?.\n As for Rogers’ bizarre report being described without hefty qualification as  “peer-reviewed”, I’ve no doubt you are not unaware of his choice of journal – Thermochimica Acta – one which he helped to set up and for which he served as  Editor for many years. For my sins, I used to referee scientific papers. I would not have declined to referee a paper submitted by one of its own Editors – but would have sought reassurances that my involvement and report was totally anonymous. Did that happen with Rogers’ paper? Is anyone on the present Journal prepared to state categorically that was how it was handled? If not, then the review process was seriously flawed. Personally, I don’t think Rogers  should have chosen his own journal anyway for so controversial a paper.  And while he may have described himself as a thermochemist,  that particular speciality was somewhat peripheral to a critique of the radiochemical dating, unless that   white-rabbit-from-hat called Vanillin was an attempt to substitute dodgy chemistry for good physics.\n I’ve chuntered away for too long and will now take a break. Keep an eye on this thread, however. I may have one or two other observations to make, not about Stephen Jones’s site, where I try not to linger any longer than absolutely necessary, but Ian Wilson (for what he wrote about the Lirey Pilgrim’s Badge).\nOh, and while I’m loath to call anyone an expert, there are sound scholars and others less so. You I regard, and have always done so,  as one of the Shroud’s soundest (and most cogent) scholars…\n","date":"January 21, 2013 at 2:40 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","id":"comment-1757","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?","post":"Thank you, Colin.

I have been surprised by the number of people who describe themselves as ‘shroud researchers’ and list over twenty years experience but who simply seem to reproduce the ideas of others with no original input of their own. So Stephen Jones ( who has accused me of knowing that the Shroud was authentic but casting doubt on its authenticity simply to make money – and for an article for which i was paid nothing!) merely parrots Ian Wilson (Saint Ian of the Holy Shroud) and so far as i can see from his website provides nothing original of his own while seeing off anyone who dares to comment unfavourably on what he has written. No wonder Dan Porter’s blog flourishes while Stephen Jones’ stagnates.\nMy expertise on the Shroud is marginal, as the author of the only full length history of medieval relics on the market (Holy Bones, Holy Dust, Yale UP, 2011), one which has been well received. The two and half years of full time research I have done on medieval relics makes me believe that the Shroud is almost certainly medieval but, as there was once a burial shroud in the tomb of Jesus, there is a tiny, and really tiny, outside chance that it could be it. \nHowever, I have also earned my living professionally as a historian for forty years and it was from this ‘expertise’ that I saw the immense weaknesses in Ian Wilson’s work on the Shroud. Is he an expert on the Shroud who,however, fails miserably as a historian? Certainly the real experts on Byzantine history, religion and literature unanimously condemn his argument about the Image of Edessa, so I am in good company. (If it were proved that the Shroud is authentic, it is much more likely that it came to Constantinople with the other relics from Jerusalem that we know arrived in the fourth and fifth centuries- see the wonderful ivory (now in Trier) of the relics of St. Stephen being brought into the city from Jerusalem c. 420.) I would also rate Madame Flury-Lemburg, who is an acknowledged expert on textiles and who has worked closely on the Shroud, when she says there is no reweaving, over Ray Rogers, whose views, never confirmed or replicated by any later research, seem to be based on threads that he claims, without any further authentication, to come from someone who was present, years before, at the cutting up of the Shroud. How he got this one past his peer reviewers I cannot imagine! All kinds of contamination could have got into those threads in the years after they were cut off and before they were forwarded to him ( and why him when there were so many laboratories in italy where the level of expertise in textile analysis would have been many times greater?). So which experts decide who are the real experts? A good question.\n","date":"January 21, 2013 at 11:08 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","id":"comment-1756","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"colinberry"}]
