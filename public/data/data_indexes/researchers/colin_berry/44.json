[{"title":"Why is the Shroud image so superficial? More on the ongoing battle between science and pseudoscience.","post":"On the off chance that Hugh Farey might pass by here today, I have a suggestion for him. Next time he sees what may look like penetration of a light contact scorch to the reverse side, he should try doing three things. \n1. Compare the appearance of the reverse side against white v matt black surfaces.\n2. Examine the fibres with a hand lens, and see whether there really are scorched fibres on the reverse side.\n3. Place a scorched piece of linen on a white surface. Then place another unscorched piece of linen on top. What do you see?\nI’ll do a posting, probably tomorrow, on what I and the camera see when doing those 3 things. Beware incoming jargon, like “ghost images generated by back-reflection/scattering of light”.\n","date":"March 7, 2014 at 9:04 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/why-is-the-shroud-image-so-superficial-more-on-the-ongoing-battle-between-science-and-pseudoscience/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-3249","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
