[{"title":"Colin’s New Blogging Style","post":"Why would anyone post comments on Colin’s blog, much less read his obnoxious, arrogant, insulting postings? Dan, did you actually read what he wrote in that long ridiculous posting? Here is what he previously wrote to Dr. Thibault Heimburger when Dr. Heimburger tried to make comments on Colin’s blog. Dr Heimburger, by the way, is one of the nicest people in the field of shroud research. \n“That is simply unscientific Thibault, and defies commonsense too” \n“With reluctance I have to say this Thibault – you don ‘t have the first clue as to the scientific modus operandi. Everything you write confirms that again and again”.\n““Much more interesting”? Have you any idea how condescending and arrogant you sound, Thibault? What gives you the right to decide what is or is not interesting? For your information I find little of that section above interesting at all, and of dubious relevance.”\n“You are seriously testing my patience with your barracking and false insinuations…”\n“PS: And I see you have repeated your ridiculous allegations on Dan Porters’ site. Contemptible. And you have the nerve to bandy around the term “gentleman”. It is you, Thibault, who needs to look at the way you interact with others online. You need to stop talking down the whole time, or posturing as if you know all the answers. You don’t.”\n“” Is the banding effect (which is a fact) consistent with the scorch hypothesis? I wonder..\n Thibault.  You feel free to wonder,Thibault. Every second spent wondering is a second less spent promulgating your goal-directed brand of pseudo-science”.\nDr. Heimburger wrote, “No more comment on this blog.” Meaning, of course, Colin’s blog. And that is why so few people visit Colin’s blog. It has nothing to do with style.\n\n","date":"February 20, 2013 at 8:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/20/colins-new-blogging-style/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-25021","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin’s New Blogging Style","post":"Paulette. I am talking about the reading style. I love it. As for the excessive acerbity, you may be right. A change in that might result in improved readership and participation. One of my original goals when I started blogging was to include skeptics or the shroud in open conversation. I am not, as Colin says, “providing a billboard for the promoters of Shroud authenticity and all the proselytising baggage that comes with it.”\nI find it puzzling when Colin writes of me, “Why should it matter to him where the Russ Breault Shroudie roadshow is next appearing, or whether STERA  Inc. gets voluntary donations on top of its licensing copyright fees?” Does he think that I wouldn’t advertise a skeptic’s “Shroudie roadshow,” as well? Russ and Barrie Schwortz are good personal friends and so I do care. They know I am more about wanting the truth about the shroud than anything else. And by-the-way, my wife and I have only met Thibault once, in Ohio in 2008; what a great guy, we said to each other after we parted. \nI’d love to sit down with Colin for a drink and some talk. Who knows, we might become friends.  I have good friends and familiy members who are 100% skeptical about the shroud. So what? So, let’s hope.\n\n","date":"February 20, 2013 at 10:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/20/colins-new-blogging-style/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-25037","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"}]
