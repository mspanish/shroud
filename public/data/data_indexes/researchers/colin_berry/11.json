Also, I find it irritating that they try to mix science and religion… they are immiscible, like water and fat… that’s why they use pseudo-science as an emulsificator lol.\nIn order to make claims like those, they need evidence for every aspect of it, not mixing stuff from here and there just to make it look good… oh well.\nWell ’twas a good.

You can also learn more about this blogger simply by taking the trouble to read this or some of his other 113 postings on this site or the attached comments. \nWhy not simply stick to the topic under discussion, and avoid asking personal questions at least until you have established your own credentials.
