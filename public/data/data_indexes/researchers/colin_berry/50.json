[{"title":"Colin Berry:  Getting the Royal Society involved is now my top priority.","post":"LBJ has an expression about futility: “Hollerin down a rain barrel.” Expecting that the Vatican would allow the Royal Academy unique access to the Shroud is absurd. Get over it CB, the days of empire are over.\nI also would not expect the Royal Academy would be trusted to give an independent appraisal that would call into question the verisimilitude of Oxford Dons and the British Museum. I think on both sides of the Pond, there is skepticism of the established authority that looks after its own.\nColin, safe in the embrace of Mother England, needs to get out in the world more.\n\n","date":"March 2, 2013 at 7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/02/colin-berry-getting-the-royal-society-involved-is-now-my-top-priority/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-26151","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry:  Getting the Royal Society involved is now my top priority.","post":"“as the author of well over 150 Shroud-related postings” who in the process invented more conspiracy theories and promoted more pseudo-science than anyone, I’d say send it to the Times, right away.

In other words, despite his scientific profile, he has not succeeded by himself to demonstrate the scorch theory. Now he wants a highly reputated institution (RS) to take over this task, focus the research according to his instructions and put the whole devices of RS at work. Obviously, he wants the RS to finish up his research by saying “Colin was right. It was a medieval scorch”.\nIf he knew -as he continuosly claims- which the standard scientific protocols for -in this case- putting up a research, evaluate its feasibility, its relevance, find finantial help, and so on are, he should know that “writing a letter” is just not the way.\nPerhaps he  thinks that due to his high scientific profile and to the interest of the subject all these usual steps will not apply to the proposal in that letter.\nGood luck, Colin!\n\n","date":"March 2, 2013 at 9:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/02/colin-berry-getting-the-royal-society-involved-is-now-my-top-priority/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-26161","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry:  Getting the Royal Society involved is now my top priority.","post":"This is simply laughable (I mean that literally because it made me laugh). Colin is naive if he thinks the Royal Society would want to re-open the can of worms that in their view the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud closed, by providing “conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval … AD 1260-1390” (Nature, Vol. 337, 16th February, 1989, p.611).\nGoing by polls of the equivalent to the Royal Society in the USA, the National Academy of Sciences, the members of the Royal Society would probably be 90-95% atheist/agnostics.\nTherefore like most atheist/agnostics they prefer to ignore the Shroud on the `ostrich with its head in the sand’ principle. That is, if they can’t see it, it isn’t there. Colin is one of the rare exceptions to that rule and he deserves credit for that at least.\nMy guess is that if the Royal Society even deigns to reply to Colin, that is, in more than a standard `canned’ response, it will be with words to the effect:\n“the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud provided conclusive evidence that the Shroud of Turin is medieval. There is therefore no need for the Royal Society to become involved in requesting further testing of what in the Society’s view is merely a medieval artifact.”\n\n","date":"March 2, 2013 at 9:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/02/colin-berry-getting-the-royal-society-involved-is-now-my-top-priority/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-26163","author":"Stephen E.
