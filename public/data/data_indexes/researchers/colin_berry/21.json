That would surely be too cramped.\nI‚Äôm more inclined now to think in terms of a rotating open spit, with the linen wrapped in cylindrical or spiral fashion around a horizontal timber or metal pole,with turning handle, supported above a long tray of glowing embers (charcoal). That might explain the curious black specks one sees in the Mark Evans photomicrographs that I commented on back on late 2014:\nhttps://shroudstory.com/2014/10/31/those-dark-specks-in-the-mark-evans-photographs/\nAt that time I thought the specks might be toasted flour particles, but I‚Äôve gone off that idea ‚Äì there being too few. Flecks of carbon (soot) from a charcoal fire seems more likely, sticking preferentially but not exclusively to the image-imprinted areas for a variety of reasons.\nIt was actually hot cooking oil I checked out as an alternative means of heating using my thermostatted deep oil fryer (which irritatingly stops heating at approx 190 degrees C).. Yes, the folded and rolled-up linen was deep-fried as if battered cod!  I‚Äôve abandoned it at least temporarily, but there was useful scientific spin-off as indicated earlier. The ability to get a good primary image (Maillard) but failure to see a decent ghost image after abrasive washing to remove oil and crud can be seen as supporting my ‚Äòblotting paper‚Äô theory for the superficial TS image. The latter depends on limited penetration of tiny amounts of hot reactant efflux from browning flour into and between the fibres (condensing chemically on the surface of the fibres to form a thin yellow film of adsorbed Maillard products). If the spaces between linen fibres are already blocked with cooking oil, then there can be no blotting paper effect via capillary action!\nI think we‚Äôre getting there ‚Äì being able now to account for the superficiality and other subtle properties of the TS image due to the blotting-paper properties of linen.\n","date":"August 13, 2016 at 5:13 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7605","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"The Shroud of Tandoori? üôÇ\n","date":"August 12, 2016 at 6:59 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7603","author":"David Goulet","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"From Ian Wilson‚Äôs history of the Shroud, displayed on the STERA ‚ÄúShroud History‚Äù page:\n‚ÄúLalaing adds that the Shroud‚Äôs authenticity has been confirmed by its having been tried by fire, boiled in oil, laundered many times ‚Äòbut it was not possible to efface or remove the imprint and image.‚Äô (1503)\nThere‚Äôs a clue there David to an alternative means of heating the linen that does not require  a large oven, or indeed any kind of oven, but maybe a cauldron instead  (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).

For my part, I can supply two good reasons for thinking that it‚Äôs just 600-700 years old (again, approximately) and a few dozen not-so-good reasons.\nI too believe there‚Äôs a connection between the Shroud and the biblical account of the road to Calvary, but not for the pro-authenticity reason you  cite, i.e. imprinting with real mineral dust from the road. I believe that medieval artisans, probably the clerics employed by Geoffoi de Charny for his private monarch-financed chapel at Lirey, hit on the idea of modelling an icon along the lines of the fabled Veil of Veronica (the imprint of Christ‚Äôs face which, according to legend, was captured en route to the cross) but with a difference, It would be the imprint of the entire body, both sides,  captured shortly after death in sweat and blood en route from the cross to tomb, wrapped in Joseph of Arimathea‚Äôs ‚Äòfine linen‚Äô (NOT intended one might add as the final burial shroud).\n Flour, or something similar, was used as the imprinting medium, but only because it achieved that ‚Äòauthentic-looking‚Äô sweat-imprint appearance AFTER oven-roasting and thorough laundering, leaving the faint yellow image but no trace of the inspired choice of imprinting medium.\nThank you for rescuing my site from the Google doldrums.

If TS is a forgery, then the forger is a really a genius, and a scientific, and a forensic, and a scholar, and a torturer. It means he invented a printing technique not known before and after him (until you arrived), had to make a lot of testing like you do, he had to torture and crucify a bearded man with long hair, did it with nails in the wrists although all artistic depiction in his time and in the past have always been in the hands (I‚Äôm very skeptical the forger used a sculpture for the imprint, due to the blood stains that are very subtle and in the right physiological layout).\nMaking such a forgery with no mistakes, with the means and knowledge of middle ages is very impressive (to me). But why not, if the C14 says so.\nOn the other hand, I wonder if TS is not the Mandylion? What is your opinion about it?\nBut anyway. I am now still wondering if your model works only with flour or also with any powder material?

Your major objection, or at any rate reservations re forgery, will have to wait for a day or two. Dealing with your last point: no, white flour is not necessarily the only imprinting medium that works, or might work. Similar results might (or might not) be obtained from other milled grains, or maybe milled seeds or nuts, especially oily ones. The important property is that they should all of them ‚Äòsweat‚Äô a yellow or brown-tinted fluid when heated at temperatures up to around 200C (which linen amazingly tolerates). In a forgery model, such as the one I propose, one may never know for certain what was used as imprinting agent, given that all traces of it could/would have been removed in the final laundering that is needed to obtain the final attenuated image (essentially a weak ‚Äòblot‚Äô mark left by a heat-induced oily exudate). \nTo summarize: whatever the imprinting medium, heat from an oven or open charcoal fire made it ‚Äòsweat‚Äô  and permanently mark linen so as to model the notional ‚Äòlook‚Äô of a human sweat imprint. There‚Äôs a neat symmetry there, no?\nAfterthought: When using white wheaten flour as the imprinting medium, I used a thin smear of oil on the skin first to assist adhesion and to ensure an even powder distribution when the surplus was shaken off. It‚Äôs just possible that if a milled oil-containing seed or nut was used, then there would be less need for the preliminary smear of oil ‚Äì the powder could/would stick to skin using its own oil! Either way, oil assists colour development in the oven, mechanism still to be determined.\n","date":"August 14, 2016 at 6:02 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7608","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"Thanks for these explanations Collin.

What attracted me in the first instance was the claim that the image characteristics (superficiality, 3D properties, microscopic features etc) were ‚Äòenigmatic‚Äô  and/or beyond the ability of any known man-made technology.\nWhat seems clear right now is the remarkable similarity between the technology now being proposed and ‚Äúinvisible ink‚Äù for writing secret messages using milk or lemon juice to write an invisible message that can then be developed by holding the paper over a light bulb or candle.  In both instances it‚Äôs probably Maillard reactions that produce most or all of the brown colour.

My question is: could judean fine dust be a possible replacement for flour to make a body print on linen shroud? Would it have similar properties, as fine particles?\nI‚Äôm not trying to defend shroud authenticity here, just investigate!

Would it require an imaginative leap, preceded by putting oneself in the place of a medieval artisan, wondering how he might set about simulating (less politely, ‚Äúfaking‚Äù) an ancient sweat imprint on linen. \nYes, on reflection, that‚Äôs the way to go. I‚Äôll address David‚Äôs question first, which should be sobering if nothing else, then invite new ones.

See my posting done a long time ago, gently taking the late Raymond Rogers to task for thinking that his hydroxyproline result was diagnostic for the presence of blood, more specifically unheated blood:\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/i-think-i-now-know-why-sturp-chemist-raymond-rogers-thought-there-was-hydroxyproline-in-the-blood-on-the-shroud-and-its-to-do-with-those-medicinal-leeches/\nFollowing some clues from contrast-adjustment in my photoediting program that suggests the presence of a faint yellow component that spreads out from underneath the TS bloodstains into the surrounding linen, which I had initially thought might be serum proteins, I got to wondering if I might be seeing evidence for that unphysiological out-of-area collagen instead.\nExperiment: make a viscous solution of gelatin in warm water, use before it sets to a gel as if ‚Äúartificial blood‚Äù (though yellow, not red). Apply to my hand AFTER coating with oil and flour. Bake the linen as per usual (approx. 200C) when the gelatin becomes visible as light brown stains. Then, and only then, apply red dye (commercial beetroot juice) by dabbing onto the gelatin stains. The result was most gratifying, the dye tending to stay put on the gelatin  stain instead of spreading out into the surrounding linen which would have looked most unblood-like.\nIf the bloodstains had been ‚Äòmanufactured‚Äô  this way by a medieval ‚Äòmodeller‚Äô would the result be compatible centuries later with STURP‚Äôs blood-before-image sequence of imprinting? Answer? It depends. It depends on whether the roasted gelatin, i.e. collagen, still behaves like a typical protein. Had that been the case the yellow brown gelatin/collagen stain (plus attached red dye) would  presumbly have been digested by the Adler/Heller protease, on the assumption that their source of enzyme had broad specificity towards a range of proteins (collagen as well as blood albumins etc) and that heat denaturation did not alter the susceptibility towards the protein-digesting enzyme.\nI can supply photographs of the above experiment if anyone‚Äôs interested.\n","date":"August 2, 2016 at 6:59 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7550","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"Interesting train of thought.

Anyone who focuses on the colour of the blood, investing the time that Adrie has put into analysing spectral characteristics etc has to be exceedingly careful if coming from a pro-authenticity point of view. Why? Because even if the TS were 1st century, and the original bloodstains genuine, who‚Äôs to say that most if not all that original blood has not flaked off and been subsequently ‚Äòtouched up‚Äô? And if touched up, what was used? More original blood, or fake look-alike blood?\nThe question I would put to Adrie is this: what does she make of Rogers finding a peak for hydroxyproline in his mass spectometer. Is that not a marker for collagen? Isn‚Äôt collagen a marker for connective tissue, not blood?  And isn‚Äôt collagen, in the form of gelatin  (either as a solid gel or viscous liquid) precisely the kind of substance that might be in the medieval tool kit? I can show her photographs taken after dribbling mixtures of red dye and viscous gelatin solution onto linen. The gelatin runs in rivulets a short distance, with no obvious soaking into linen, with plumped up blood-like beads, sharp meniscus etc, which then set solid, freezing the ‚Äòright look‚Äô. One can then overpaint, either with real or fake blood, and straightaway one has an answer to the blood-before-image conundrum in the flour-imprinting model (details another time).\nI had said last year I wasn‚Äôt planning to research blood, feeling it was a separate issue from body image, assuming there was a means of imprinting so as to look as if blood had arrived first (as indeed there is, indeed more than one). But since discovering the versatility and potential of gelatin as a component of ‚Äòfake blood‚Äô, not only for touching up, but for simulating the original blood in an initially unpromising blood-degrading thermal-imprinting model, I may do a separate posting on it, maybe using your question as the posting‚Äôs title.  It‚Äôll also be an opportunity to respond to Adrie in greater detail. \nFor now the focus has to stay on that ‚Äòwashed-out‚Äô looking body image (see today‚Äôs addition to the present posting).

They applied it to individual fibres from that region. Why? Because that‚Äôs all they had (working from Rogers‚Äô sticky tape samples with detached, i.e. stripped-away individual fibres). So why expect there to be yellow (image) colour under the blood, given that a minority of fibres in an image zone are/would be coloured, as Hugh points out (recalling that image colour is an averaging by the human eye of a few uniformly coloured fibres and a lot of uncoloured ones ‚Äì the so-called half-tone effect.\nRandomly sampled, only a few fibres from an image zome can be expected to be coloured.

Indeed, it‚Äôs deeply suspect, and I now have no hesitation in opting for what I consider a more commonsensical chronology, at least in the context of medieval provenance and man-made technology, namely that the body image was imprinted first, and the blood second (the latter by a second round of post-oven imprinting or maybe even painting), either with real blood or some blood-like or blood-derived substitute.\nSee also the images (mine, from adjusting contrast on ShroudScope)  that accompanied that posting on Dan Porter‚Äôs site.

The absence of shadows makes it ‚Äòeasier‚Äô for the software to render in 3D strictly according to image density, which in turn depends partly (but only partly) on the 3D nature of subject being imprinted (flour tending to settle on the higher FLATTER contours, and scarcely if at all on the vertical planes, notably sides of the subject).\nBeware those who resort to digital oneupmanship  (‚Äúyou‚Äôve used too much smoothing‚Äù, ‚Äúyou should have converted natural colour to black-and-white‚Äù, ‚Äúyou should have used ImageJ‚Äôs Thermal LUT-mode‚Äù etc etc. All these and other factors have been patiently investigated and found, without exception, to be red herrings, an attempt to make this user of ImageJ seem like a rank amateur compared to their total professionalism.

But the medieval modelling of the ;‚Äôtransport linen‚Äô  with a pseudo-sweat imprint is not bound by those considerations. It envisages linen being PRESSED down manually onto the elevated contours (not sides) of the subject, with decisions as to which parts one wished to be imprinted, and, just as important, which parts one did not.\nIt doesn‚Äôt stop there. The flour imprinting model gives the artisan TOTAL CONTROL over which part to imprint or not imprint, simply by deciding which parts of the subject‚Äôs anatomy  to coat with flour, which parts to leave uncoated.

By that I mean the resort to  comments that my approach is an irrelevance and waste of everyone‚Äôs time, on account of so-and-so (the latter invariably unrelated to experimental model-building, which is this researcher‚Äôs speciality). Off the top off my head, there are some 10 standby  ‚Äòso-and-so‚Äô interventions that I‚Äôve come to expect. Here they are, listed with a bare minimum of detail:\n1.The deployment of the term ‚Äúburial‚Äù shroud. There‚Äôs no evidence that the TS, whether authentic or of medieval manufacture, represents a ‚Äúburial‚Äù shroud. It‚Äôs the uncritical use of that term ‚Äúburial shroud‚Äù that introduces irrelevancies (putrefaction products, as in the Rogers‚Äô model, miraculous flashes of radiation etc etc ). The biblical description of the linen in the three synoptic gospels suggests it was intended and used merely as an impromptu means of transporting the crucified body from cross to tomb, where the account in John then takes over (winding strips etc). The TS was a transport shroud for an unwashed body (thus the idea of a ‚Äòsweat imprint‚Äô of the body accompanied by bloodstains).\n2. Re the claimed references in art of writing to the TS prior to the Lirey display in 1355 or thereabouts, consistent with the radiocarbon dating. There are no reports that this researcher is aware of for the existence of the iconic  ‚Äòtwo-fold‚Äô,  head-to-head, frontal v dorsal image that one sees on the Lirey badge.There may have been any number of images of a face ‚Äì or whole frontal image even-  prior to Lirey, but it is misleading to say the least to claim they were representations of THE Shroud, and thence to claim that the radiocarbon daters got it wrong or have ignored ‚Äòcompelling‚Äô historical evidence.\n3. Likewise the evidence for the TS being older than the radiocarbon date is rendered invalid if based on claims that the fibres are chemically or mechanically older (i.e. weaker)  than 600-700 years. If the TS image was produced by thermal technology as per my model, then the heating step would produce changes that are comparable to those resulting from age, except they would produce in minutes what would normally take centuries at ordinary environmental temperatures, given the nature of chemical kinetics (a mere 10 degree rise in temperature generally doubling the rate of most chemical reactions). I typically use 200 degrees C to develop the flour imprints, which is approx 18 consecutive doublings of rate (2,4,8,16 etc).\nThere are seven more of those pitch-queering so-and-so obstacles in the pipeline  (expect them later today).\n","date":"July 27, 2016 at 9:40 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7515","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"Next step? Next posting? Here or elsewhere?\nI had decided to make my pitch more strongly, namely that the TS is a flour imprint, made to seem like (and later promoted as) a 1300 year old sweat imprint left on Joseph of Arimathea‚Äôs linen.\nNote that word ‚Äúpitch‚Äù, a colloquial alternative to message, thesis etc.\nBut then I recalled the expression ‚Äúqueering the pitch‚Äù, and realized why I have felt discouraged from ‚Äúmaking my pitch‚Äù more strongly these last 12 or so months. That‚Äôs due to the inevitable attempts by defenders of authenticity to ‚Äúqueer my pitch‚Äù by bringing in a range of standard ‚Äúrebuttals‚Äù that attempt to undermine any notion of medieval manufacture.\nHere‚Äôs how one internet source describes the meaning of  ‚Äúqueer the pitch‚Äù:\n(Originally) interfere with or spoil the business of a tradesman or showman.\n (More recently) spoil the business at hand.\nOrigin\n‚ÄòQueer‚Äô has been used as a verb meaning ‚Äòto spoil‚Äô since the early 19th century. Putting those two together we get the meaning of this little phrase. It was first recorded, in the vernacular speech of 19th century London, in The Swell‚Äôs Night Guide, 1846:\n(I‚Äôll spare readers the details). Further on we read:\nTravelling showmen and market hawkers also called the place they set out their stalls a ‚Äòpitch‚Äô. ‚ÄòQueer the pitch‚Äô was frequently used it those circles, and later amongst travelling theatre groups, as meaning ‚Äòdistract the paying audience from the show‚Äô. Directing the public away from one trader‚Äôs business and towards one‚Äôs own was an important part of street trading of any sort. There was and still is an established pecking order of positions where a stallholder may ‚Äòpitch up‚Äô on any site. It is a difficult to explain but none the less established fact that a crowd, when entering an open space through an entrance, will veer to the right. The stallholders whose stalls languish on the left-hand side were likely to try any sort of ‚Äòqueering‚Äô of the right-hand ground to redirect traffic.\nSo don‚Äôt be surprised if I produce a posting here, or maybe on my sciencebuzz site, with the title ‚ÄúUnqueering the pitch on the Shroud of Turin‚Äù.  Then, and only then, I‚Äôll proceed to blow my ‚Äòflour imprinting‚Äô trumpet, spelling out the technology that I previously considered might have been used, but am now firmly of the opinion WAS used to produce the TS body image. \nOne possibility that has just this minute come to mind is to post the ‚ÄúUnqueering the pitch‚Äù preliminary here, then following up in short order with a detailed appraisal and indeed promotion of my (not so) new technology on sciencebuzz. It will then be possible to flag up those postings to one or more of those MSM outlets that invite ideas for new stories (the BBC, Mail etc) where all the crucial details are to be found in just two postings, one strategically-defensive background, followed by the more innovative discoveries from well over 4 years of experimentation.\nOne has only to look at the first listing one ALWAYS sees when googling (shroud of turin) to see what this researcher is up against. I‚Äôm simply nowhere to be seen on that particular radar screen ‚Äì a non-person one might say. ‚ÄòSindonology‚Äô is an exclusive club, members only. But this researcher sees no place or useful role for ‚Äòclubbishness‚Äô where pursuit of knowledge is concerned, so is not unduly bothered on that score. Being treated not just as an outsider, but as a ‚Äònon-person‚Äô, indeed pariah one suspects, judging  by some of the stray remarks one encounters from time to time, is something else entirely. As I‚Äôve said before, the gloves are finally coming off, kidgloves that is. I shall now be telling things the way they are where ‚Äòsindonology‚Äô is concerned. The words ‚Äúself-serving‚Äù and ‚Äúagenda-driven‚Äù will undoubtedly appear from time to time.\n","date":"July 26, 2016 at 10:39 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7514","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"Hi Colin, loving your ongoing research!

The image fibrils showed no signs of capillarity. If your images were analyzed, would they also show this?\nNo, they do not show signs of capillarity, but I have to add  an important proviso. There are no signs of clogging of the relatively large  interstitial pores of the weave, ones that can be seen by holding the fabric up to the light.  What may be present is coloration that migrates between the closely-apposed fibres of the weave ‚Äì where the gaps are so small that capillarity really comes into its own. But STURP did not examine that aspect of between-fibre migration when addressing the question of artists‚Äô pigments. One would not expect paint medium to penetrate BETWEEN fibres within a thread ‚Äì only between threads.\n 2. The darkened color was only present on the very crowns of the fibrils. Under a microscope, would we see the same thing on your samples?\nYes, I do. See the link above, then scroll down to the end (‚ÄúTopic 1‚Äù). The concentration of colour on the crowns of the weave is precisely what one might expect from inprinting with a powdered solid (white flour) as distinct from a solution or liquid suspension.\n3. Heller also reported that there was no variation in the color of the image fibrils‚Äìareas where the color seemed to be more intense on the linen was due to a greater number of fibrils in a given area being colored‚Äìalmost like the digital images on an old black and white Macintosh computer.\nYes, I see the so-called half-tone effect, where image fibres all have the same degree of coloration, differing only in the number. What‚Äôs more, my model can explain that. The colour is due to a migration of a liquid along the fibres, leaving even coloration as it goes.  I initially thought the migrating liquid was due to the natural oils within flour which on heating ‚Äúfried‚Äù the fibre carbohydrates as they spread. I‚Äôm now more inclined to think that the conjectured mobile migrating liquid represents high temperature Maillard reaction products (liquid) which polymerise in transit to yellow or brown substances, staining the linen fibres, probably on their external surfaces, at least initially. So we have an explanation for the ‚Äòfuzziness‚Äô of the TS image ‚Äì liquid migration from hotspots, only getting so far along each fibre, then abruptly stopping,  producing a ragged edge due to different distances of migration between adjacent fibres.\n","date":"July 22, 2016 at 4:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7503","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"Hi Colin:\nI happened on your site today and was fascinated by your work here.

The latter then reacts with the ferric chloride (acidified with HCl) to form Prussian Blue. For quantitative work, the absorbance of the Prussian Blue is measured at 700nm.\n","date":"July 15, 2016 at 1:08 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7464","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"Another successful day at the coalface of experimental sindonology. \nOne of the practical snags where imprinting off real people is concerned is how one ensures that  the frontal image aligns exactly with dorsal image on the long axis. That‚Äôs easier said than done if imprinting off a single person, whether doing both sides simultaneously or sequentially.\nSolution: don‚Äôt use one person ‚Äì use two of roughly the same height and build. Get them to lie head to head on a sheet of sacking or similar with the required gap between the heads, one face down, the other face up, and then get them to adjust their positions as instructed till in perfect alignment. One can then sprinkle white flour (imprinting medium)  from a sieve onto their upper surfaces, then pull out  and dispose of the sacking with surplus flour from the edges, then cover the elevated contours of both subjects with wet linen and imprint manually.\nI have modelled the above using my brass crucifix to represent one subject (frontal) and plastic toy (see banner) the other (dorsal), both fortuitously having roughly the same size.\n\n The resemblance of the final heat-processed image with the Lirey badge and TS is striking. As previously stated, one can also see how the ‚Äòbaked in‚Äô creases of the TS result from rolling up the imprinted linen with blank spacer linen to get a compact package for heat-processing and resulting Maillard colour development (final golden-brown image). In fact the ‚Äòtwin track‚Äô ‚Äòcrease‚Äô  is reproduced almost exactly (two brown bands of unequal width separated by a pale central zone, as described many moons ago in an earlier posting that argued the case, correctly I now consider, for those ‚Äòbaked-in creases‚Äô).\nTime maybe to go to press after 4.5 years model-building R&D?

Up until now I‚Äôve assumed that was because someone making a medallion felt obliged to show the man on the shroud as semi-3D, despite being a flat image on the linen, in order to do justice to the semi-artistic metal-casting medium. Yet that‚Äôs an awful lot of  extra work in making the mould, having to scoop out the soft stone and smooth the hollows of sunken relief (recalling that final raised relief has to be generated ‚Äòin reverse‚Äô so to speak).\nBut what if the Mark 1 Shroud image, the one that Bishop Henri de Poitiers heartily approved initially, WAS a striking and indeed enigmatic bas relief, obtained accidentally by use of a particular means of thermal processing, still used to this day I might add, and which spawned the Lirey badge to advertise that novel and unexpected outcome?  Later, when the image deteriorated (flaked off etc) the make-or-break decision was made to wash and gently abrade with more soap, when it was then discovered there was a permanent ghostly image still there, one that was deemed ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô looking. Thus we have the Mark 2 Shroud, for which we also have the Machy mould with the added word SUAIRE  (‚Äúshroud‚Äù) beneath a Jesus-like face (Veronica-reminiscent), and it was the re-display of that icon-morphed-into-‚Äògenuine‚Äô-relic that caused the Bishop to erupt in fury, perhaps suspecting it had all been pre-planned and that he was the fall guy.\nYup,the scenario proposed  may all seem a little far-fetched at first sight, but I for one consider it fairly plausible that my not-so-new technology was indeed deployed some 6 centuries ago to create the kind of bold and arresting bas relief image that you see on the main posting, and that the final attenuated image was not part of the initial plan. The Shroud image we see today was an ‚Äòaccidental‚Äô forgery, maybe too good an opportunity for the recently widowed Jeanne de Vergy to throw away, encouraged maybe by the 5 or 6 clerics-cum-artisans of the de Charny chapel in tiny Lirey founded by her knightly husband from the seedcorn gift of land from his warrior monarch.\n","date":"July 9, 2016 at 7:54 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-7434","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: ‚ÄúShroud of Turin ‚Äì and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic)¬†science‚Äù","post":"The one negative about the new thermal-processing regime (details of which I‚Äôm still not ready to reveal just yet) is reverse-side coloration.

I‚Äôve been exploring novel strategies for reducing reverse-side coloration.\nThe one that has yielded unexpected dividends these last few days came through investigating a different question ‚Äì like how to obtain a good imprint when heating a rolled or folded up length of linen ‚Äì compactness being an advantage in any heating system that involves a 4.4m length of linen.  Simple rolling up was not an option, since it put the flour imprint in direct contact with the reverse side. So an EXTRA sheet of ‚Äòblank‚Äô linen was placed over the imprint before rolling up. Hey presto, reverse-side coloration disappeared almost entirely. But there were intriguing new effects seen, like  (1) ‚Äúbaked-in‚Äù creases due to kinking of the primary linen on rolling up, like (2) image-fibre breaking and ‚Äútufting‚Äô due to adhesion as a consequence of the two sheets of linen becoming stuck together by the ‚Äòcooked‚Äô imprint during heating, and needing to be pulled gently apart. \nIt remains to be seen whether these new observations, chiming with comparable oddities re the real Shroud (creasing, tufting) are relevant or not.
