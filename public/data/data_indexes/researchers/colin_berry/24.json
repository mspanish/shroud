[{"title":"Have you seen the new Wikipaedia (UK) entry on ‘scorchophobia’? It’s a must for all Shroudies!","post":" February 12, 2013 at 5:09 am | #2 \n“Subject exhibits a fascinating pathology of obsessive fixation, possibly as a means of displacement behaviour in overcoming a fear of the mysterium tremendum, challenging his misplaced faith in agnostic rationalism, an occupational hazard resulting from over-exposure to various chemical processes, and manifested in surrounding the subject’s web-site with repetitive icons of the principal phobic object.”\nYup, that’s the kind of crap that appears routinely on The Other Site, and why I no longer bother engaging with its regular clientele.\nIn fact, I had decided a couple of weeks ago to replace the pink background with additional images that would complement the sequence in the banner. The latter shows the 3 steps that convert a thermal imprint, aka scorch, off a heated bas relief template into an enhanced 3D image. So why not demonstrate the same, but applied to the Shroud’s scorch-like sepia image? \n But when I uploaded the 3 images (sepia, blue, green) it was impossible to get them all to display left and right of the editorial content. Good ol’ WordPress came to the rescue with its tiling option, which our amateur psychiatrist has seized upon for composing his oh-so hilarious put-down. So I went back to my template, and thought what I  could do by way of tweaking  to give the tiling a more obvious raison d’être.  I hope he likes the end result, which I dedicate to him personally.\n","date":"February 12, 2013 at 12:33 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/spoof-wiki-scorchophobia/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-1842","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
