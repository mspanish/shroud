His habitually biased and obnoxious approach in shroud studies are enough to defrock him of any objective scientific ‘credentials’ he is ever so keen to remind you of at every passing chance; frankly, it’s childish. He appears to be little more than a shill for the typical shallow-minded hypercritics and militant atheists to thoughtlessly lap up and regurgitate on message boards across the web when confronted with the hard facts and serious scientists like Rogers. He seems to generate noise designed to drown out the good information and slow the progression of knowledge. In short, he’s a career troll.\nI for one will ignore this nuisance from now on.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2012 at 4:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/07/shame-on-you-dr-colin-berry-phd-or-ray-rogers-consummate-researcher-excellent-scientist/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-17303","author":"EGM","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shame on you, Dr. Colin Berry, PhD or Ray Rogers, Consummate Researcher, Excellent Scientist","post":"Bravo Dan !\nRegarding Adler, it’s the same : one has to enter “Adler” as “author” in the advanced search engine of Google Scholar to find many peer-reviewed papers from him about porphyrins.\nIncidentally, I have just finished my paper about the famous Scorch hypothesis (including about 25 microphotographs) that will convince anybody of the fallacy of Berry’s hypothesis..except of course Dr. Berry himself.\nFor the time being, it is written in French.
