[{"title":"Glad to be of service,  “anonymous”…","post":"Thanks Hugh. I look forward to hearing the result on that “steam distillation” hunch, It’s a long shot, and would be amazing if one could get rid of the fluorescence by letting steam escape easily (it comes up through the damp overlay after a minute or two) but I won’t be surprised if it turns up negative.\nYes, I agree completely re your reasoning for the toasted v yellow colour. This is why I think the reversed geometry is so important. It reduces toasting by conduction and increases generalised cooking and diffuse yellowing by forced convection. In fact, when linen is laid over a hot template there may be very little conduction, because the first formed steam (linen is said to be approx 8% free water) will create a steam cushion that prevents atom to atom contact, so most of the heat transfer is then by the action of superheated steam and later by additional pyrolysis gases.\nThanks for the tip re the rust pictures. I’ll take another look.\n","date":"November 21, 2013 at 10:38 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/glad-to-be-of-service-anonymous/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2501","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Glad to be of service,  “anonymous”…","post":"Hi Colin,\nI’m just running up to an end of term, so a bit busy, but I’ll certainly carry out the UV experiment before Christmas. As for the Evans photos, I see the “toasted” area as a conduction (contact) scorch, and the general yellowish background as a convection and/or radiation (non-contact) scorch. Does that seem reasonable? Incidentally, for a true “topmost fibres only” illustration, there is an Evans photo of some rust on the shroud among Barrie’s collection, and the unchanged blue-white silky background is very visible there.\n","date":"November 21, 2013 at 10:30 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/glad-to-be-of-service-anonymous/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-2500","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"}]
