[{"title":"Dear Colin Berry","post":"What’s happened to this site? Where are the commentators? Things have come to a sorry pass when it’s Colin this or Colin that every hour of every day.\nBut thanks nevertheless for the appreciative comments Dan. I’ll even excuse you that child with his technicolor handprints. \nI say the key to understanding the TS imprint (yes, IMPRINT!) is in the choice of imprinting medium, the crucial aspect being its ADHESIVE properties that stick and mould linen to body anatomy, ensuring a sharp and detailed “take”. A plain flour paste or glue has to be a prime candidate.\nAnyway, that’s me done where shroudology is concerned. New horizons call, like researching and writing a travelogue (a 6th trip to Greece by this hellenophile is on the cards to tackle the big one – Confusing Crete).\nBye.\nPS There’s another meaning of ‘stoopid’  – at least in the UK – a playful and lighthearted alternative to stupid.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2015 at 10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/07/dear-colin-berry/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-201245","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dear Colin Berry","post":"Good Afternoon Mr. Collins:  You wrote,  “the crucial aspect being its ADHESIVE properties that stick and mould linen to body anatomy, ensuring a sharp and detailed “take”. A plain flour paste or glue has to be a prime candidate”\nMyrrh resin does exactly what you described.  When it exposed to the open air it becomes sticky like glue and eventually hardens completely.   It is not unlike tree sap. It does exactly what you described t it “moulds linen to body anatomy”     If used in pure form it will color the linen a sepia, caramel color. There are many different grades of myrrh. When it dries it can become transparent, glossy and light reflective. But not all myrrh resin is like, this . Some grades are opaque when it dries.\nWhen the object and cloth has myrrh applied to it, and then wrapped in it, the linen will take on the shape of that object and make a 3D replica.  Very detailed.  If for any reason you actually purchase some,  make sure you are getting the high grade pure version, not the cheap watered down version with other oils in it.  There are only 2 companies on line I could find that have pure linen made from flax, herringbone weave fabric. One is in the UK, the other in Belgium.\nMyrrh resin is the substance you seek to do what you want to do.  It will also be in agreement with what is written scientifically peer reviewed journals as to what the thin layer of carbs is on the Shroud.  Sugars.   I made a video demonstrating it.  It works.\nThis is a bit of a down time for Shroud interest.  Music videos are getting 600,000,000 million views and my myrrh and aloes Shroud image theory video has less than 1000?!\nIf you are not getting a lot of interest in some of your new image theories it has to do with the time of year.  June and July are vacation months. People don’t want to be thinking about bloody mutilated bodies being wrapped in burial shrouds and leaving images behind.\nRemember the James Bond Movie, “Never say Never Again”    Good luck with your future research. Try not to be to hard on the Man in The Shroud.  See you again in a few weeks.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2015 at 3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/07/dear-colin-berry/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-201253","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dear Colin Berry","post":"PS:  That list of reasons for thinking the TS can only be an imprint has now been extended from 10 to 15.

Myrrh and Aloe Experiment.  Wrapping a 3 D figure.  Obviously you know I am pro authenticity.  No need to go into that discussion.  I feel strongly what you are looking for is myrrh resin. It does all the things you mentioned. “ADHESIVE properties that stick and mould linen to body anatomy, ensuring a sharp and detailed “take”.   For whatever reason it works better with a combo of myrrh and aloes. Not just myrrh resin.
