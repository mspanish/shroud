I would like your thoughts on my live processing of the Shroud face showing holographic elements. I can do the same with your hand and compare the 2. In 2011 I discovered the encoded second shroud image in the Rome Veronica get back here is the live holographic processing using an lcd screen as a form of infrared negative processing quite simple but effective. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9vX-IWmXT0\n","date":"July 26, 2015 at 12:56 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2015/07/17/heres-an-updated-version-of-my-iconoplastic-modelling-of-that-turin-so-called-shroud-probably-a-misnomer/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-6177","author":"Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello","site":"colinberry"}]
