[{"title":"More on McCrone’s Role in Shroud of Turin Studies (ii)","post":"I also attended the Elizabethtown Shroud conference.  During the question and answer session, I asked McCrone how his supposed forger was able to incorporate details that weren’t even discernible for several hundred more years until various scientific devices were even invented.  His “answer?”  He said “I’m not going to answer that–he just did it.”  That’s scientific?\n\n","date":"September 23, 2011 at 6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/23/more-on-mccrones-role-in-shroud-of-turin-studies-ii/","cat":"science","id":"comment-4013","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on McCrone’s Role in Shroud of Turin Studies (ii)","post":"This has to be the McCrone quote for the year:  If you just line up the scientific papers and look at the data it is a slam dunk that McCrone’s work is irrelevant and ultimately somewhat unprofessional.\n\n","date":"September 23, 2011 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/23/more-on-mccrones-role-in-shroud-of-turin-studies-ii/","cat":"science","id":"comment-4016","author":"MouseInTheHouse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on McCrone’s Role in Shroud of Turin Studies (ii)","post":"Who would have thought that as of today we would still be talking about McCrone? Hasn’t his studies on the Shroud been overturned countless times? Hasn’t it been shown, ultimately, how wrong he was? Yet sceptics will and are still using him as the savior of all level headed people…It’s completely dumbfounding! It also shows how little people take the Shroud seriously. Atleast serious enough to study it in detail. Personally I wish more people would, and maybe this earth would be a better place for it.\n\n","date":"September 23, 2011 at 6:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/23/more-on-mccrones-role-in-shroud-of-turin-studies-ii/","cat":"science","id":"comment-4020","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on McCrone’s Role in Shroud of Turin Studies (ii)","post":"McCrone assertions made STURP lose a lot of time and energy that could have been better invested in exploring different natural processes for image formation…  It’s a very sad story and it’s incredible to think there is still people who think the Shroud is a painting !
