But I don’t think that the Shroud is not suitable for C-14 dating.I think exactly contrary -the Shroud is fully suitable for C-14 dating -but the choice of the sample location in 1988 was very unfortunate. My gut feeling is had another location been sampled as well, we would have at least one 1st century reading beside 13th-14th century we obtained.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2015 at 6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191227","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In","post":"The pity is that neither Rinaldi or the STURP team either put the Shroud before art experts.

Jim Drusik of the Los Angeles County Museum was a formal member of the STURP team and participated in the planning of our experiments before we left and in the evaluation of the data after we returned. STURP was a scientific research group so instead of calling an art expert, they acquired a database of the spectral characteristics of every paint, pigment and binder used from medieval to modern times and performed careful spectral analyses across the entire Shroud. They found no traces of paint, pigments or binders. It’s called SCIENCE.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2015 at 8:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191231","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In","post":"STURP team members did not find any evidence of painting, that being the reason why no painted linen was examined.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2015 at 10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191199","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In","post":"So McCrone who claims to be a scientist claims the Shroud is a piece of art.  This.  This in spite of the fact that there is no scientific evidence evincing the Shroud’s origins.  The danger of the Shroud debate – is that of so called scientists – being too anxious to claim infallibility in their analysis.  Even the popes have been careful not to weigh-in with their judgements on the Shroud. It is a  mystery for the time being.  A mystery that speaks to our own mystery.  I suspect the widsom of the Catholic Church – if it is wisdom – and I suspect it is – is that there will likely always be a debate about the authenticity of the shroud – regardless of evidences.  It is too confounding.  The  debate itself is quite edifying and clarifying even if there are no conclusions.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2015 at 10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191202","author":"Stan Walker, MD","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In","post":"Walter McCrone should not weigh in.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2015 at 2:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191212","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In","post":"He can’t.

I’ve told this before but it’s worth telling again, if nothing else   for anyone recently new to the blog.  For the 2005 conference in Dallas,   Barrie was interviewed by a local reporter.  McCrone’s name came up in the   conversation.  Barrie made it clear that McCrone was deceased (about 3  years  at that point), but when the story came out the reporter mentioned him  with  the phrase, “…McCrone, who did not attend the conference…”  I  think it  would have made some headlines if he had.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2015 at 10:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191243","author":"jmarino240","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In","post":"Joe that was a pun. Of course he’s past away. However, the letter brings him back to life.  I too was at Dallas in 2005 selling his book, Judgment Days”  for the Holy Shroud Guild to finance the event.

He gave a presentation at the 1986 Elizabethtown, PA conference.  In the question and answer session, I asked him how his putative forger was able to incorporate details that weren’t even discovered for several more hundred years.  His answer:  “I’m not going to answer that.  He just did it.”  He just expected people to take his opinion on faith alone.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191278","author":"jmarino240","site":"shroudstory"}]
