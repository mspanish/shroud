To john; it’s no use getting upset over these type of people, I know cause I used too. Dealt with the same ignorant types on youtube and elsewhere. I’d give it one shot and if they don’t want to listen, move on. Thats all thats expected of us anyways.\nRon\n\n","date":"March 24, 2012 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/24/someone-who-is-not-a-fan-of-russ-breault-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9582","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Someone who is not a fan of Russ Breault and the Shroud of Turin","post":"I expect anyone that says it is a forgery to show a replication of the shroud produced by someone until that happens their judgement is fallacious and has no basis.\n\n","date":"March 24, 2012 at 7:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/24/someone-who-is-not-a-fan-of-russ-breault-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9602","author":"paul","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Someone who is not a fan of Russ Breault and the Shroud of Turin","post":"I am reminded of His admonition: “Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.

And he’s got all this seed, like;  But he wants to get the most out of his property and maximise his yield.  So he scatters the seed all over the place!  But what do you know!?  It only ever took root on good ground.  Not sure if there’s a lesson in religious economics there or not!  Maybe it’s over to us to cultivate the ground first.\n\n","date":"March 25, 2012 at 5:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/24/someone-who-is-not-a-fan-of-russ-breault-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9612","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Someone who is not a fan of Russ Breault and the Shroud of Turin","post":"I don’t quite grasp what your saying Dave.\nR\n\n","date":"March 25, 2012 at 5:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/24/someone-who-is-not-a-fan-of-russ-breault-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9615","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Someone who is not a fan of Russ Breault and the Shroud of Turin","post":"R: Don’t worry, the disciples had to have it explained to them too.\nCheck out the original version, Parable of the Sower – Matt 13:3-8; Explanation – Matt 13:18-23.\nTo hear and accept the message, you need the right disposition, whether it’s the gospel, or any other truth whatsoever, even such as “What is the Shroud?”  A closed mind won’t make it – see the lampooning of Christians in the original heading.\nBut God still wills that all may hear his message.  Maybe we can help those with crippled minds and attitudes, but that kind of soil needs some fairly tough and harsh cultivating.  Hope I’ve made it clearer.  We have a lot of rural countryside in NZ.\n\n","date":"March 25, 2012 at 6:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/24/someone-who-is-not-a-fan-of-russ-breault-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9616","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Someone who is not a fan of Russ Breault and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Hey I understood the parable, from even back when I was a kid, and I’m a city boy ;-). I just wasn’t clear on what you were saying. As for tough and harsh cultivating, I’ve tried that, doesn’t sink in, trust me. God may will all hear his message but God gives free will also. So as Jesus taught his deciples; tell them, if they don’t hear, walk away…and I try to follow that model.\nRon\n\n","date":"March 25, 2012 at 8:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/24/someone-who-is-not-a-fan-of-russ-breault-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9618","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
