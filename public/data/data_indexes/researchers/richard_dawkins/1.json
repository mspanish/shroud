They set no store on the cultural heritage from which we are all beneficiaries, if we only knew it.  They have abandoned the teaching of history, they set no store on the ancient classics, and the teaching of religion even in the senior classes of our Catholic schools is unduly juvenile, if it still exists there.  Even the teaching of science is barely rudimentary.  The King James Bible if nothing else was a major milestone in the development of our language.  Recently I attended a U3A lecture given by a popular retired Prebyterian DD speaker.  He reported that his university undergraduate grandson had asked him “What was the Reformation?”  Gasps from the audience were palpable.  Our young people are being trained in ignorance, and civilzation is going down the drain!\n\n","date":"May 25, 2012 at 4:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/25/richard-dawkins-famed-atheist-supports-free-bibles-in-schools/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11601","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
