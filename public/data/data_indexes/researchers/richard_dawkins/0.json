I think you have definately pushed the boundaries insulting many here. I amongst others could have said the same to you, but we showed some restraint (for the most part). Insulting Mr. Rolfe definately was not warranted and I would back Dan, at this point, if he blackballs you from this blog, wholeheartedly. I’m sort of getting sick of your rediculous, errogant arguments anyways, to tell you the truth.\nRon\n\n","date":"June 3, 2012 at 1:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/02/does-dawkins-even-know-he-has-been-challenged/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11847","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Does Dawkins even know he has been challenged?","post":"Oh and I think Dan as been more then fare in allowing you to continue to post here.
