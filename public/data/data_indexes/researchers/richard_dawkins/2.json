Conciliation and cooperation is good, but ONLY if this is done with the only goal of seeking the TRUTH.  These days, I really don’t think that most of what we see in Shroud research is ONLY oriented in that direction.  Sorry.  On the contrary, I have a deep feeling that most of the present research (I don’t want to make any kind of personal accusation here) is done (conciously or not) with some kind of “religious agenda” that lies under a real quest for truth.  That’s something I call “religious pollution” in scientific research regarding the Shroud !  Because of the subject matter, that don’t surprise me much, but I have to say that, for a guy like me who only seek the truth, it’s very sad to see.  And that’s the principal reason why Shroud science has lost most of is credibility in recent years.  I think it’s easy to note that we’re VERY FAR from the good old days of the STURP team, where everything was done with one major goal :  the seek of TRUTH !  Since then, we have seen a big bunch of Jesus freaks, of lunatics, of opportunists, and/or of pseudo-scientists came in the Shroud research and destroy most of his credibility in regard of the international scientific community.   This situation have a very bad effect that is :  Everytime someone put out a new scientific paper about the Shroud, suspicion is always there because we never know the real motive of the person that can be hidden behind his research !  Very sad !\n\n","date":"May 11, 2012 at 10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11277","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sentence One in the Richard Dawkins Challenge is Wrong. Period.","post":"David, we are clearly not communicating. You wrote, “There was definitely no intention to exclude any of the major contending image formation theories from consideration.” \nIn my reply to you at SSG I wrote, “It is not about a favorite body image hypothesis.” I repeated the sentence three or four times throughout the letter. I used the word favorite because you had used the word favorite instead of major as you now do.\nI tried to make it clear that it is about the impurity layer that Rogers concluded was on the fibers. I think Yannick makes this clear as well. Impurity layer, which is a characteristic, does not necessarily mean a Maillard reaction, which is a body image formation hypothesis. Nor, for that matter does a Maillard reaction necessarily mean that an impurity layer of starch and saccharide is required. Isn’t that what Paolo Di Lazzaro was trying argue? \nDavid, characteristics of the image, whatever they are, ultimately dictate what image formation theories/hypotheses are acceptable. You don’t exclude or include hypotheses when literally report characteristics. You report observed characteristics, which should be factual.\nNow it may be that there are differences of opinion. Some SSG scientists have claimed that the image that was formed lies very superficially within the fiber. Others have claimed, Ray Rogers most notably, have claimed that the image that was formed lies within a very superficial impurity layer of starch and sugar. \nIn other words there is no consensus on the statement that reads: “The body image is created by molecular change of linen fibres.” Yes there is a consensus by a cabal of a few scientists who met in Valencia. But the public is not going to accept that. And Dawkins after a few minutes of Googling by one of his volunteers is not going to accept it. Their commentary is likely to be that people behind the challenge don’t know what they are talking about or are promoting a one-side view. The correction to sentence one should be “The body image is created by molecular change of linen fibres or to a chemical impurity layer adhering to the fibers.”\nYou say that I rejected your offer to go back to the signatories or whatever they are. I didn’t. Go back. But it is not about a favorite or major image formation hypothesis. It is about the impurity layer. Go back. Discuss it. Get consensus on the non-consensus. I have not objection to that.\nWhat I also stated is my objection to science by consensus and the foregoing is why. Science should be driven by facts. And if there are differences of opinions about what is factual, then and until they can be ironed out, openness and candor must be the norm.\nIt is easy to get a small number of scientists together and present a consensus about just about anything. How different would be the consensus about the Anthropic Principle by a dozen or so members of the Society of Ordained Scientists and a dozen or so scientist members of the Council for Secular Humanism. Tell me the consensus group from Valencia isn’t a group of scientists who are not perceived to have a bias. \nPermit me to quote Jos Verhulst who, in regard to this matter, wrote: “But there nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong, with this lacking of a ‘consensus’. If people want to debate the shroud, they should do so as rational individuals, with each individual thinker pondering the evidence and developing careful reasoning. That’s all that there is to a scientific discussion. Thinking that the position of a protagonist moves somehow closer to the truth, or becomes more trustworthy or reliable, when it is backed by a ‘consensus’, is completely absurd. ‘Consensus’ is for those who believe, not in the power of truth and reason, but in the power of number and amount. This whole consensus thing should be dropped.”\nWhat has happened to Shroud Science? Is it now the tossing down of gauntlets and daring skeptics to knock blocks off of our shoulders rather than pursuing the truth of the shroud with open candor.\n\n","date":"May 11, 2012 at 7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11276","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sentence One in the Richard Dawkins Challenge is Wrong. Period.","post":"I’am going to guess no on picked up on my comment in the post “The body image is a created by molecular change of the linen”.

And their assumption is that the coloration affected the primary cell wall instead, which is made of other kinds of carbohydrates.  No matter what the list of Dallas said in point A4, I don’t think any credible scientist will state that one hypothesis or the other concerning the chromophore of the image is completely proven without any doubts for the moment.  Even for Rogers, I don’t think he ever wrote that his hypothesis regarding the thin layer of impurities was completely proven without any doubts.  In fact, that’s precisely why it is called a “hypothesis” and not a “theory” !  The carbohydrate layer that was colored on the surface of the Shroud is so thin and his chemical structure is so common (this fact was clearly mentioned by Rogers himself) that it is easy, for someone who is not an expert in chemistry, to get fooled.  Look, even Rogers himself was fooled by it when he analyze the question during his investigation with the STURP team !  He and the other members of STURP thought that the coloration affected the linen fibers themselves and that’s exactly what they wrote in their conclusion (published in peer-reviewed journals) !  This example show you how complex and unresolved this question can be !  For the moment, Rogers hypothesis can really look like the right answer to the mystery, but no credible scientist can state that it is a proven FACT !\nThat’s precisely why this list of “facts” presented in Dallas in 2005 didn’t received praised from all the scientists involved with the Shroud…  And I think these critics were right because this list contains some “facts” (even in part A) that are still waiting to be fully demonstrate and proven !!!  Rogers hypothesis about the thin layer of impurities was present in the part A of the list in 2005 and, in 2010, Fanti take this list and present an updated list by himself.  And in his own list, Rogers hypothesis wasn’t there no more !  You can see that this question is still debated today.  But, I’ll say it again, in regard of all we know about the Shroud, it seem to me evident that Rogers hypothesis is the best we have to explain correctly the body image on the Shroud.  M. Rolfe and all the others who signed the list of Valencia don’t seem to agree with that…  But the bottom line is this :  For the moment, no one can be 100% sure, scientifically speaking, of the real answer.  The ONLY thing science can say right now is this :  The body image on the Shroud results from a dehydration-oxydation process involving some kind of carbohydrates on the top-surface of the cloth.

And what he did was to put suspicion in the mind of many Shroud researchers (many of which are not expert in chemistry by the way…).  That’s the situation and I want to say that this question of the chromophore is crucial in regard of any proposed hypothesis of image formation.  That’s why the debate right now is pretty intense.  The Di Lazarro’s experiments with laser and Fanti’s hypothesis of the corona discharge are much more easily backed-up with the primary cell wall as the chromophore than an external layer of impurities on top of the fibers.  That’s why they push this hypothesis of the primary cell wall and, scientifically speaking and to stay honest, it’s impossible to totally reject their proposition for the moment.  But, I’ll say it again, in regard of all the observations and facts we know about the Shroud now, the hypothesis of Rogers really seem to be much more credible than the one of Fanti and al.  That’s what I think.  That’s not what many people on the Shroud Science Group and in Valencia seem to think.  That’s their opinion but, on that particular question, I think differently and I know there’s other experts who also think differently and still favored Rogers hypothesis (no matter what M.

It was based on Adler’s two observations, quoted by Dan from Rogers:\n    1) diimide rendered the fibers colorless and undamaged again, and\n    2) cross sections of the fibers didn’t show color in the cellulose.\n(https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/05/07/the-body-image-is-created-by-molecular-change-of-linen-fibres-really/ )\nThen, Rogers didn’t say that the colorlessness of stripped fibers confirmed that diimide-treated fibers were colorless and undamaged again, but that it confirmed that “the cellulose” was not colored. \nI agree with you that Rogers’ words suggest the primary cell wall was not colored, but he didn’t and couldn’t say it, because Adler’s two observations plus the colorlessness of the stripped fibers don’t prove it. They only imply the colored layer could have been linen and/or impurities. \nAt your point 11- : The continuity of the cloth’s banded appearance through the image does not prove there are impurities that influenced the image formation. Because the image consists of colored and not-colored fibers as in a pixel image, the bands of the background simply ‘shine through’ the image via the not-colored fibers in it (addition to http://jesusking.info/Internal%20selvedge.pdf p. 32).\nNevertheless, I agree with you and Ron that there were impurities, based on other scientific observations.\n\n","date":"May 11, 2012 at 2:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11280","author":"Adrie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sentence One in the Richard Dawkins Challenge is Wrong. Period.","post":"Yannick’s point 11-, got changed into point 16-, so he added at least 5 points, after I printed Yannick’s first guest posting.\n\n","date":"May 11, 2012 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11282","author":"Adrie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sentence One in the Richard Dawkins Challenge is Wrong. Period.","post":"Yes.

For the first point, what you say is some kind of a play on words.  When you read Rogers papers and his book, it is clear that the stripping of color was a confirmation of the reduction of color with diimide.  Maybe he didn’t say it EXPLICITELY in those terms, but nevertheless, for him, those observations were a great indicator that it wasn’t the fiber itself that was directly affected by the image formation process.  And this is confirmed by what he said in page 86 of his book versus the result he obtained with corona discharge.  Even if the internal part of the fiber didn’t seem to be affected by the oxydation process and just the external part was, for Rogers, this was DIFFERENT from the image fibers from the Shroud that he analysed.\nAnd for Rogers, it is very clear that the banding effect was another great evidence that the body image reside only on carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers.  Of course, you can have a different opinion than Rogers on the subject (and you’re surely not alone).  But for him, the banding effect is a very important evidence in favor of his hypothesis concerning the thin layer of impurities that would be present on top of the fiber. \nHere’s my point #16.  Read again what Rogers said : “16- Bands of different-colored yarn can be observed in the weave of the cloth. Where darker bands intersect image areas, the image is darker and where lighter bands intersect image areas, the image is lighter. THIS PROVES that the image color IS NOT SOLELY a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen. Something ON THE SURFACE of the different batches of yarn produced color and/or accelerated color formation. This suggests that significant VARIATIONS in impurity concentrations existed among yarn batches. The observations of bands of color agree with historical reports on the methods used to produce ancient linen.”  Here, you can see that he’s quite prudent in his affirmation.  But nevertheless, for him, this was a great observation that contribute to comfort his hypothesis concerning the chromophore of the image.  \nFinaly, I don’t understand how you can, at the same time, agree that there is a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers (Rogers hypothesis) and believe that “the image consists of colored and not-colored fibers as in a pixel image”.  If there really is a thin layer of impurities, then it is sure that this layer was colored during the image formation process and all the other observations (ghosts, diimide, bands, etc.) indicate that, if it is really the case, this was the ONLY thing that was colored during the process !!!  You’re 2 ideas on the question seem to be in contradiction.  Unless you think that the coloration affect both the layer of impurities and the fiber itself ?  But then, how can you explain the diimide and the ghost that leave a colorless and undammaged fiber behind ?\n\n","date":"May 11, 2012 at 3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11284","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Sentence One in the Richard Dawkins Challenge is Wrong. Period.","post":"\nRon :Yannick it isn’t that complex, they have made it complicated by not simply using the A list, which alot of time went into deciding what or what not should be there.

But I disagree with him one what he said here : “ALL the facts are consistent with both possibilities.”  For the moment, I don’t think this is true.  Rogers as showed with good scientific arguments that his hypothesis CAN be correct regarding ALL the observations and facts concerning the body image on the Shroud.  But I’ve NEVER seen one single scientific paper published by a real Shroud expert who is also an expert in chemistry and microscopy that do the same than Rogers did with his papers, i.e. to DEMONSTRATE that the hypothesis he defend CAN be applied to what we know about the body image on the Shroud.  I still wait for a paper like that to be published in order to properly defend the hypothesis of the primary cell wall being the true chromophore of the image.  I’ve never saw one so far.  For the moment, I consider this hypothesis of the primary cell wall more like a personal opinion of some researchers than a real hypothesis that have been correctly DEMONSTRATE with solid scientific arguments, like it was done by Rogers for his own hypothesis.  \nSorry Thibault for having a different opinion that yours on the subject !!! ;-)  In fact, we both agree that there is no way to be scientifically certain about the correct chromophore of the image but, where I defer from him, is because I favor Rogers hypothesis well before the one about the primary cell wall.  But that just my opinion, based on a long reflection…\nAlso, you have to know that Thibault Heimburger, a friend of mine, is one of the co-author of the paper published in 2010 with Fanti, Di Lazzaro and some other members of the Shroud Science Group that pushed the issue of the primary cell wall.  That’s why I’m not really surprised by the fact he put the hypothesis of the primary cell wall on the same level of credibility than the one of Rogers.  As I said, that’s where I defer from him.  On the general principle, I agree with him but I don’t think it is scientifically correct to think those 2 hypotheses have the same credibility, simply because the hypothesis of the primary cell wall has never been studied (in regard of what we know about the body image on the Shroud) to the SAME in-deep level as the hypothesis of Rogers…  \nFor example, can someone give me a solid and credible scientific explanation for the FACT that the ghost and the diimide leave a clean uncolored and undamaged fiber behind ?  At first sight, that doesn’t seem to really fit with the idea that the primary cell wall would have been colored instead of a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers !!!  If the color would be in the primary cell wall, then the ghosts would be composed mainly of a dehydrated and oxidized primary cell wall that surely would have left a DAMAGED fiber behind.  You understand what I mean ?  This is PURE LOGIC thinking !   If you take away the colored primary cell wall of a fiber, how in the world the resulting linen fiber can be considered undamaged ???  It just doesn’t seem to fit. \nAnd the reduction of the color with diimide, leaving an undamaged linen fiber behind, is also one of the main argument of Rogers (among many other) to show that the whole linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) WAS NOT colored at all during the image formation process, because the resulting fiber seem to be undamaged.  Don’t you think that chemist experts like Rogers and Adler (also expert on the Shroud) would not have noticed the absence of the primary cell wall of the fibers after the use of diimide ?  I just can’t imagine that !  For me, it’s pretty evident that experts like them would have note a significant change in the physical aspect of the resulting fibers.  That’s just my opinion of course but I don’t think it’s idiot to think that way…\n\n","date":"May 12, 2012 at 7:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","id":"comment-11313","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
