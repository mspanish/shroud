Now who is seeing what he wants to see?\nAs a general rule, the areas imprinted on the Shroud are bodily extremities, not details on plane surfaces. The latter would include any kind of shallow wound or puncture, real or imaginary. In this case I believe your wrist wound to be entirely imaginary…\n","date":"July 8, 2012 at 4:36 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/certainly-theres-a-blood-stain-on-the-wrist-but-wheres-the-puncture-wound-exit-or-otherwise/","cat":"bucklin","id":"comment-350","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Certainly there’s a blood stain on the wrist.

I am right ?. \nYou will not find it on the wrist for reasons that could be explained and even expected in the context of crucifixion (incidentally, something that a medieval forger did not know : I’ll explain that later).\nBut the location of the exit wound on the wrist can be easily deducted (and seen) from the blood rivulets.\nOnce again (you never answered, why ?) : how is it possible to display some photograph in a reply on this blog ?\n","date":"July 8, 2012 at 11:47 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/certainly-theres-a-blood-stain-on-the-wrist-but-wheres-the-puncture-wound-exit-or-otherwise/","cat":"bucklin","id":"comment-352","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Certainly there’s a blood stain on the wrist.
