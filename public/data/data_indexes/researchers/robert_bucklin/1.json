But I don’t think the cursory inspection of a couple of photos which appears to lead to Dr Bucklin’s detailed forensic conclusions was seriously meant to make us think he was performing his ‘autopsy’ there and then. It would be interesting to know how he really worked before writing, and mostly learning, the clearly scripted commentary he gives here. Was the mise-en-scene really necessary? Or true? We see corridors lined with corpses on trollies, only to arrive at a conveniently empty room in order to examine a piece of paper. (We also notice the Dr Bucklin marches through the corridors gloveless, and then quickly, off camera, puts some on so that he can take them off again as he enters the room – why?).\nThere’s an interesting form of words in Dr Bucklin’s comments on the nail hole. “An injury to this part of the wrist will invariably damage the median nerve, whose function is to flex the thumb across the palm.” So what happens if you damage it? You can’t move your thumb across the palm, and you get ‘ape hand deformity’. I have scoured the internet looking for median nerve damage that might result in the thumb vigorously flexed across the palm as described with no success.

What he fails to state in his introduction is that he was in fact described by himself and others as a sindonologist for the duration of most of his 50 years or working life. Indeed it didn’t take long to dig this article from the archives that he penned in 1970 – 8 years before STURP, and 7 years before “Silent Witness”. (Incidentally, I have not claimed or even implied that his appearance in that video clip was the full extent of his “autopsy”, given what follows, where he said he had been working on Enrie and other photographs for many years previously).. Note carefully the IMPLICIT belief in the authenticity of the “Shroud” (my bolding) which I consider renders his “autopsy” valueless as a SCIENTIFIC document, lacking as it does scientific objectivity (e.g. by failing to question the means by which the image came to be imprinted, effectively treating it as though a photograph, which we know it is not).\nR.Bucklin: The Legal and Medical Aspects of the Trial and Death of Christ, Medicine, Science and the Law, Vol. 10, No. 1, 1970.\nThe body lay in the sepulchre for an unknown period of time and was gone from the place early on Sunday morning when the burial party returned to complete the embalming procedures. At that time only the wrapping cloths were found in the sepulchre. The long linen cloth in which the body was wrapped has been preserved through the centuries and it is this cloth which is known today as the Shroud of Turin. It has a most colorful history which has been traced in detail by a number of European authors. ………. The cloth was first photographed in 1898 by Secondo Pia and again in 1931 by G. Enrie. The photographs of Enrie are remarkable for their clarity and it is the study of these photographs, including life-size enlargements, which are the basis of my medical interpretation of the events of the Crucifixion.\nMy conclusion (admittedly harsh): Robert Bucklin should never have been copted to STURP as consultant pathologist. Robert Bucklin was not just a pathologist. Robert Bucklin was a sindonologist convinced of the Shroud’s authenticity while other sceptical STURP team members were asking more mundane questions like “Is it just a medieval painting?”. There should be a preamble added to Bucklin’s “autopsy”, a warning that its author had a long-established belief in authenticity that clearly coloured much of his observations (which were based anyway it seems mainly on B/W photos, not the Shroud per se).\n\n","date":"July 28, 2015 at 11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-206783","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin","post":"Could CB read Bucklin 1981 research paper before passing harsh comments?\n\n","date":"July 28, 2015 at 12:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-206786","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin","post":"Posted on another thread:\nHow one can take seriously a “mise-en-scène” autopsy for the real thing?

I still await some confirmation that the flexed thumb suggestion is not a myth.”\nRigor mortis is irrelevant in this case, as flexure occurs immediately on nailing.  Whether the muscles relaxing after death would make any difference, so that the palms are merely hiding the thumbs in a natural position, the fact remains that Barbet demonstrates that the flexure definitely occurs, and his attributing it to damage to the median nerve seems credible as his amputated arms were fresh. \nOne might speculate a severe case of psychosis scrupulus dubitationis scepticissimi.\nThe following extracts from Barbet, or better still read the full original, or else merely jump to the last three paragraphs.  If experimenting, it is important to use freshly amputated arms immediately! \nBarbet:\n“I did not appreciate the importance of all this till I had made the following experiment: having amputated an arm two-thirds of the way up, I took, immediately after the operation, a square nail with sides of 1/3 of an inch (like those of the Passion), the length of which I had reduced to 2 inches for convenience of radiography.  The hand was laid flat with its back on a plank, and I placed the point of the nail in the middle of the bending fold of the wrist, the nail being vertical.  Then with a large hammer, I hit the nail, as an executioner would do who knew how to hit hard.” \n“I repeated the same experiment with several men’s hands (the first had belonged to a woman) .  Each time I observed exactly the same thing.  Once it had passed through the soft parts, and the nail had entered fully into the wrist, I could feel it, in spite of my left hand holding it firmly, moving a little obliquely, so that the base was leaing towards the fingers, the point towards the elbow;  it then emerged through the skin of the back of the wrist at about a centimetre above the point of entry, which I observed after removing the nail from the plank.  Radiographs were taken at once.  I had thought, a priori, that the nail would dig deep into the wrist, and would probably pass through the semi-lunar bone, crushing it on its way.  The movements of the nail while it was sinking had, however, made me suspect that it had found a more anatomical path.” \n“In fact, in the radiograph taken in profile, the nail, which is a little bit oblique, in a backwards and upwards direction, passes between the projections of the semi-lunar and of the capitate, which remain intact. The radiograph taken from the front is even more interesting;  the shadow of the square nail appears to be rectangular, on account of its obliquity.  The nail has entered into Destot’s space, it has moved aside the four bones which surround it without breaking one of them, merely widening the space.” \n“The dissection of the hand confirmed my radiographic results.  The point of entry, being a little outside and medial to Destot’s space, the point of the nail reached the head of the great bone, slid along its mesial slope, went down into the space, and crossed it.  The four bones were pushed aside, but were intact and by reason of thus being pushed were closely pressed against the nail.  Elsewhere the latter was resting on the upper end of the transverse carpal ligament.  (Etc). …” \n“I have in fact repeated this experiment a dozen times since then on the hand of an arm which has just been amputated, moving the point of entry all round the middle of the bending fold.  In each case the point took up its own direction and seemed to be slipping along the walls of a funnel and then to find its way spontaneously into the space which was awaiting it.  (Etc) …”  \n“But these experiments had yet another surprise for me.  I have stressed the point that I was operating on hands which still had life in them immediately after the amputation of the arm.  Now, I observed on the first occasion, and regularly from then onwards, that at the moment when the nail went through the soft anterior parts, the palm being upwards, the thumb would bend sharply and would be exactly facing the palm by the contraction of the themar muscles, while the four fingers would bend very slightly; this was probably caused by the reflex mechanical stimulation of the long flexor tendons.” \n“Now dissections have revealed to me that the trunk of the median nerve is always seriously injured by the nail;  it is divided into sections, being broken sometimes half-way and sometimes two-thirds of the way across, according to the case.  And the motor nerves of the opponens muscles and of the short flexor muscle of the thumb branches at this level off the median nerve.  The contraction of these themar muscles, which were still living like their motor nerve, could be easily explained by the mechanical stimulation of the median nerve.  (Etc) …”  \nPierre Barbet, “Doctor at Calvary”, Doubleday Image Books, 1963, ex pp. 116-119\n\n","date":"July 29, 2015 at 4:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-206829","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin","post":"Yes, I thought you’d say that.

I learned this in a lecture at my alma mater – Notre Dame.  There are other kinds of contractures – such as a trigger finger or Dupuytren’s contracture. This has been debated at length and we had this discussion in gross anatomy lab in medical school.  It is well understood that injury to a nerve can cause contractures.  Every joint has flexors and extenders.  If the extensor muscles are weakened by an injury to the nerve – the contracting muscles will have no resistance – causing continuous contraction.\nThe other curious issue to me is that it has almost always been the custom to place the deceased person’s hands/arms crossed over one’s chest or one’s abdomen.  Look at King Tut’s sarcophagus.  Or for that matter – any of the people with crypts in any cathedral in Europe.  Hands are folded – over the chest – never the pubic area.\nSo here comes the Shroud with hands covering the pubic area.  This would not be what a forger would try to do – if he was indeed trying to replicate the standard burial customs.\nIt is also fortunate that the hands are indeed covering the private parts of the Crucified One.  We would not – nor would God the Father, Son or Holy Spirit want us to be talking about Jesus” private parts.  \nSo too, if the thumbs were not contracted – but folded – over the pubic area – it could easily be misconstrued that the thumb sticking up was actually not the thumb.  Rather something else.  Not good for discourse.\nThe obvious reasons for a physician to see the Shroud as authentic is because of all the other forensic detail on the Shroud.  Very fine detail that is easily overlooked.\nAs an eye surgeon I have also a strong interest in the neuro-cognitive sciences – particularly in regards to reading.  It is rather obvious that from this stand point – the shroud was produced outside the normal precepts or visual perception.\nFirst and foremost is that fact that the Shroud is indeed a negative image.  Perhaps not a perfect photographical negative – but a negative nonetheless.\nSecondly, the size/scale of the image is such that the artist would need to have produced the image – standing at least 6 feet from the cloth – this according to Barry S.  and his background in photography.  This would be nearly impossible.  \nThirdly, the image does have 3D qualities.  Perhaps not totally understood yet.  But beyond the 3D nature of the Shroud is the fact that there is the quality of “linear perspective” in the image of the Shroud.  You can perceive how the legs are bent.  You can see the hollow of the back. It is obvious to see how gravity affected blood flow. This is different than 3D.  Yet we also know the linear perspective was not introduced accurately until  Giotto with his frescoes during the Renaissance.   Professor Freeman may want to talk about this.  It is his area of expertise I expect.  Even the carbon dating predates the introduction of linear perspective.  \nThe Shroud is not the construct of an artist.\nAs for how the brain reconstructs the image in the brain – that is a long and drawn out discussion.  Suffice it to say – the brain can best perceive the image of the Shroud from a distance.  The actual image – up close – does  comply with normal neuro-processing.  I suspect something is in play regarding contrast sensitivity.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2015 at 3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-206897","author":"Stan Walker, MD","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin","post":"Thank you so much, Stan.

His analysis is the best I have read.  \nNo one can know if this finding is due to trauma to the muscles or the nerve.  Another possibility is that the nails put the flexor muscle/tendon on stretch causing this contracture.\nWe know from the scripture that the guard lanced the side of Jesus after he was already dead.  How long had he been dead – minutes, hours?  And by the time Joseph of Arimathea got permission to take the body of Christ down it was likely hours – that is plural – after his death.\nRigor mortis sets in about two to six hours after death.  Earlier in the heat.  \nWhen I did my training at the Mayo Clinic the ophthalmology residents were responsible for harvesting the eyes for transplantation.  I believe it is only the eyes and the marrow that are taken after death.  The other organs are harvested before the heart stops beating.  We were called to the morgue to enucleate the eyes anywhere from 2-6 hours post mortem.  It was apparent to me that rigor mortis had clearly set in in almost every case.  The small muscles are affected first – eyelids, jaws, facial muscles, fingers, toes.  Large muscles last.  \nIt is certainly consistent that the thumbs on the Shroud would still be contracted at the time of burial.  There is no reason they would become un-contracted.  The rigor mortis may have abated by the time the image was created but there would be no reason for the thumbs  to straighten.\nOn a side note, the Shroud has a serene quality to it.  Very serene.  This is a subjective observation.  Nonetheless, I have read other opinions sharing this impression.  Having enucleated many eyes and dissected a number of cadaver heads – I am still struck with the details on the Shroud.  I believe only someone like Da Vinci had an appreciation of anatomical details revealed in the Shroud.  The study of anatomy – the dissection of cadavers – came about during the Renaissance.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2015 at 9:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-206911","author":"Stan Walker, MD","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin","post":"Stan, the time of death is the time the person is declared brain-dead after a clinical/paraclinical examination.\nThen, if accepted by the family/donor, the organs to be harvested are chosen.\nTechnically, the second “death” occurs when you remove the heart, first to be taken if harvested, or shortly after you stop the mechanical ventilation.\nLungs, liver, kidneys… corneas and vessels last are then harvested.\nNow, back to the issue:\nPain is a central mechanism, and one of the confusing factors.

We have already spoken in this forum about the Zugibe’s refutation of Barbet’s claims. I copy here some remarks about the fantastic “respiratory gymnastics” that, according Barbet, the crucified man had to do for breathing.\n“Experiment One demonstrates that the position on the cross of our volunteers corresponds to the sagging position hypothesized by Barbet and that it is not physically possible to straighten from Barbet’s sagging position. This appears to be due to the fact that with both feet secured to the stipes or with one foot on top of the other and the knees bent , the range of motion limitation for straightening has been exceeded which precludes any type of straightening or pushing mechanism. It is also obvious that it would be virtually impossible to straighten the body from the sagging position since the arms of the crucarius were so far extended. This experiment also demonstrates that if volunteers who were in good physical condition were unable to push or pull up to straighten themselves no matter how hard they tried when the feet are secured to the stipes or with one foot on top of the other, how could an injured, exhausted person particularly one in severe pain and nailed through the hands and feet have the strength to straighten from a sagging position. This should completely repudiate the theory of straightening and sagging as proposed by Barbet. Therefore, it doesn’t matter how long the crucarius was on the cross and in what physical condition he was in, because it is not possible to straighten as proposed by Barbet and even if it were possible, there would be no reason to straighten because simply stated, there is no problem breathing in the sagging position (…)\nAnother fact to mull over is that the average respiratory rate is 12 to 16 per minute and in the scenario proposed by Barbet, the crucarius would have had to straighten himself by pushing against the nails in excess of 360 times during the 6 hours on the cross even if he took only about one respiration per minute”.\nFrederick T.

Nothing “irrebatible”, Carlos. \nBut, once again, I advertise that this debate can be interesting from the point of view of forensic medicine but it is absolutely irrelevant to the matter of the authenticity of the Shroud. The medieval painters used to represent the crossed hands with the thumbs hidden. Dan Porter was kind enough to put one of my comments with pictures in this forum.

My reading of Barbet is that it is mere hammering of the nail into the wrist through the Destot space, which Barbet claims results in damage to the median nerve, thus stimulating thumb flexure.  I do not recall that Barbet discusses the median nerve in connection with breathing efforts, which is the phenomenon challenged by Zugibe.  Perhaps David Mo’s distaste of such clinical details, has resulted in some confusion.  \nA few paragraphs towards the end of his discussion concerning the hands, Barbet does state the following:\n“But, alas, the median nerves are not merely the motor nerves, they are also the great sensory nerves.  When they were injured and stretched out on the nails, in those extended arms, … they must have caused the most horrible pain.

Barbet was not to my knowledge an ophthalmologist but an extremely experienced forensic pathologist.  Regardless of whether a person on this site is an ophthalmologist or not, I should assume that if he can affix the initials MD after his name, he knows rather more about anatomy than one who is unable to stand the site of gore.  \nZugibe’s scenario appears too contrived to me.  He has a volunteer step up to a simulated cross and binds his hands into gauntlets fitted with strain gauges and binds his feet.  On that basis he claims that arm tensions do not exceed 67 lbs as against Barbet’s 207 lbs. He does not appear to have considered the mechanics of the actual process involved in crucifixion.  The most efficient way a Roman soldier might be expected to direct this operation, would be to nail the prisoners arms on the cross-beam while lying on the ground, and then a squad of no more than 5 soldiers can lift the beam on to the upright (stipes).  During this procedure the full weight of the body is taken by the arms, and it matters not if the feet are nailed subsequently, the arms have had to bear a tension of about 207 lbs each as correctly calculated by Barbet.  Hence wrist nailing would be required.  A scenario of requiring the binding of the prisoner to an upright cross, and nailing his arms to the cross-beam in situ presumably requiring the assistance of ladders, sounds altogether too clumsy and unreliable.  To obtain Zugibe’s figures requires the body to be supported by some unknown means (soldiers?, pedestal? ropes?) until such time as the feet are nailed.  \nI interpret Anoxie’s claims that because the amputated arms of Barbet were severed from the central nervous system, that damage to the median nerve could not have caused the thumb retractions observed by Barbet, and that therefore his interpretation of that being the cause is faulty.  I should like to be more persuaded about this point.  Barbet is careful to say that his nailing occurred immediately after amputation, claiming that there was still life in the arms(?).  Is it not possible for the nerve cells to respond to such a stimulus in that situation, i.e. as soon as they are severed from the central nervous system?  I should like a professionally competent based response to that question.\n\n","date":"July 30, 2015 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-206939","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin","post":"Attempting to hammer an 8 mm thick square nail into a man’s arm to near the end of an unbraced cantilevered cross-beam which is supported only at its mid-point, while standing on a ladder leaning against the cross-beam would be a rather hazardous and clumsy way of doing the job.  The cross-beam would tend to pivot on its central support, would vibrate and offer a most unsatisfactory surface for hammering.  Far better to lay the cross-beam on the ground where it can offer proper resistance, and hammer the nails in there.  Ask any friendly builder.  I have known research workers who did all their correct scientific calculations, but failed to take into account the basic engineering requirements of their project, occasionally with near-tragic results.

The best he can do is to show an illustration of some poor woman the victim of a stabbing, with a needle through her hand where she just happened to be stabbed, not a deliberate aimed act of hammering a nail into a wrist at all, a pure random act.  He has some volunteers step up to a supposed replica of a Roman cross, binds them into position, very comfortable they are, and claims they have no difficulty in breathing, as if that was the way executions were carried out, and there’s no need for wrist nailing.  He shows no dissection of wrists to prove his point, and one might think he is getting all his anatomy out of text books.  Barbet hammered nails into amputated wrists, always with the same result, and dissected them afterwards, and reports in some detail.  I see no good reason to prefer Zugibe’s theoretical interpretation over Barbet’s detailed analysis of actual experiments carried out by him.  No-one else has attempted to replicate Barbet’s experiments, and unless and until some other professional makes the attempt and reports otherwise, they must surely stand.\n\n","date":"August 2, 2015 at 4:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-207237","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin","post":"I’m inclined to agree with Daveb here. I cannot think that Barbet deliberately falsified his observations, although I don’t think it impossible that he over-accentuated them. So, the thumbs flexed.
