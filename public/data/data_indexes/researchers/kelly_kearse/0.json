[{"title":"Remembering Shroud Blood Scientist Dr. John H. Heller–A Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse","post":"Kelly Kearse is a serious scientist in his own right. See http://www3.cancer.gov/intra/eib/kearse.htm\nPerhaps we should ask any critics of his science to state their own qualifications or the  or the qualifications of the authorities they rely on. I have relied on Heller and Adler who consulted their own colleagues. In Heller’s book after he and Adler had reached a conclusion based on upon their investigation,using  a microspectrophotometer for which  they had to go through two colleagues to arrange a test. The results indicated old acid methemoglobin an clear indicia of old, ancient blood. \nAs qualified as they were, they each consulted with another expert. Two more opinions: ancient blood.\n“Then they called Bruce Cameron on a speaker – phone. His double doctorate was dedicated to hemoglobin in all its many forms. After they had given him the numbers and\nplotted them, Cameron was a little sharp. “You both should know what it is. It’s old acid methemoglobin. I don’t know why you wanted to bother me with something you know as well as I do . . . Hey, wait a minute. Are you two idiots working on the Shroud of Turn?”\nThis is drawn from Heller’s book as cited and quoted in Chapter 9 of my work in progress. The working title of the Chapter is “The Blood of the Lamb.” \n“These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They\nhave washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\nRevelations 7:14\nThe white robes of today are white coats of the lab technicians.\nI have my own expert I consult who is a physicist, not a chemist, but he did a little checking and before I researched any of  the above he advised me that ancient blood would degrade to methemoglobin. I was stunned when I read the passage from Heller. It confirmed what my own “expert” had told me thirty-four years later.\nI second Kelly’s suggestion that if you are serious about the Shroud, you must read Heller’s book. The one who suggested I read it was Barrie Schwortz – nearly two years ago.\n\n","date":"December 1, 2013 at 12:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/01/remembering-shroud-blood-scientist-dr-john-h-hellera-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-54343","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Remembering Shroud Blood Scientist Dr. John H.
