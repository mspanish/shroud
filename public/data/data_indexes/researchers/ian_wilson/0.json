But a problem is that few opponents of the Shroud's authenticity would take the time and expense to read it, as Guy Walters' hasn't and probably won't. >Also in Spain most media never deal with shroud matters seriously (and many times making jokes). I have seen jokes about the Shroud in the English-speaking media also.>At the bottom, they don’t want to recognize the authenticity of the shroud because, if they do it, they would also have to recognize the resurrection of Jesus.Agreed. The Shroud does bear witness to the resurrection of Jesus, and those who are opposed to that (either consciously or unconsciously) tend to reject the Shroud's authenticity without even considering the evidence.Hopefully pro-Shroud blogs like mine, because they don't require the time and expense of reading a book, and can be stumbled upon while Googling the topic of \"Shroud of Turin,\" will be read by those who are at least open to the possibility that the Shroud could be authentic, even they are not (yet) Christians.

It was Guy Walters' `review' that was junk, because on his own admission he had never read any of Wilson's books. It is significant that the Daily Telegraph pulled Walter's `review' after Wilson responded. Walters' `review' was defamatory to Wilson personally and the Telegraph would not have a legal leg to stand on because Walters had never read any of Wilson's books.>I recently read his 1998 book the Blood and the Shroud, having read his 1978 book about thirty years ago. I was again struck by his balance, his generous treatment of those who believed it to be a medieval forgery. In my opinion Wilson is too generous towards some Shroud critics. For example there is good evidence of fraud in the radiocarbon-dating (I plan in the near future to write a blog post setting out that evidence) but Wilson refuses to entertain that possibility.>All in all a disgraceful article but not untypical nowadays.

Those who study this piece of cloth grandly call themselves sindonologists, as if concocting crackpot theories about a 13th or 14th century hoax were a legitimate branch of academia. Their high priest is one Ian Wilson, who the BBC flatteringly refers to as a \"historian\".Quite why Wilson deserves this job description is unclear, because his works have little to do with history, and instead are books that hail from a strange sector of publishing nicely captured by Peter Wilson in The Independent in 2001:Pick an ancient riddle to unravel. Mix together a pinch of history, a splash of archaeology, a soupçon of theology, lashings of first-person travelogue and a hefty dose of maps. Then flavour it with talk of the pyramids, the Inca sacred sites, the truth behind the Bible and obstructive, conspiratorial clerics. Finally, garnish in a bold cover with gold letters and a sensational title about a lost civilisation, a missing continent or extra-terrestrial life. Watch the copies walk out of the bookshops.A look at Wilson's back catalogue sheds little light on why he should be labelled a historian. My favourites are The Turin Shroud: The Burial Cloth of Jesus Christ? (1979); The Evidence of the Shroud (1986); Holy Faces, Secret Places: An Amazing Quest for the Face of Jesus (1991); The Blood and the Shroud: New Evidence That the World's Most Sacred Relic Is Real (1998); The Turin Shroud: Unshrouding the Mystery (2000); and his latest shlockbuster, The Shroud : the 2000-Year-Old Mystery Solved (2010). Are you spotting a patten here?Wilson has also written about stigmata, reincarnation, and yep, you guessed it, Nostradamus. It's clear that Wilson's \"historical\" enquiries are little more than excuses to peddle the type of bilge that appeals to those who believe in The Da Vinci Code. I don't have time to read Wilson's books, but it's clear from their reviews that his imagination easily outstrips that of Dan Brown. For example, in Before the Flood (2001), Wilson speculates on the existence of Atlantis. But my favourite is The Blood and the Shroud, in which Wilson wonders whether the resurrection of Jesus took the form of a small thermonuclear reaction that corrupted the carbon-dating tests made on the Shroud.You couldn't make it up. Neither could I. But Mr Wilson can.© 2010----------------------------------\n\n","author":"Stephen E.

This therefore makes it all the more galling that Walters should have chosen me, Ian Wilson, as his number one target, lumping my books into this category without, on his own admission, having bothered to read a single word of them.  By Ian Wilson, M.A. (Oxon.)The first rule of the professional historian is surely to familiarise himself with what he is writing about, thus avoiding the sort of \"ignorance and misconceptions\" that Walters says he so abhors. Yet Walters clearly saw no need to follow this rule when he rushed out his blog about me, condemning my standards as a professional author. First, Walters questioned my right to be \"labelled a historian\". The facts are that I am a history graduate of Magdalen College, Oxford, where I studied under A.J.P.Taylor and others. I graduated with honours in 1963, and was conferred an M.A. in 1977. Walters fails to mention the historical biography of Shakespeare, Shakespeare: The Evidence, which I wrote in 1994. No-nonsense Oxford historian the late Dr. A.L.Rowse, reviewed this in the London Evening Standard as: \"Full of good sense. The reader will not go wrong with it  Ian Wilson is conscientious, as a good Oxford man should be.\" Second, and compounding his ignorance, Walters has assumed that I must be a card-carrying adherent of every topic that I write about. Had he actually consulted the books he might have found this to be very far from the case. In my book on reincarnation (Mind out of Time? 1981), I debunked the then popular myth that hypnotic regression could lead back to past incarnations. In Stigmata I showed this phenomenon to have a psychological rather than any spiritual origination. In Nostradamus: The Evidence I expressly showed the falsity of Nostradamus' prophetic reputation. Third, Walters is completely misinformed in supposing that Before the Flood speculated on the existence of Atlantis. I am no more a believer in Atlantis than Walters is. Likewise my The Blood and the Shroud did not argue for a \"thermonuclear reaction\" having corrupted the carbon-dating texts. Nor in four decades of Shroud researches have I ever called myself a \"sindonologist\", a term I dislike as much as he does. Professing Christianity these days does not court popularity, and some of the subjects that I write about are undeniably controversial. However if Mr. Walters actually deigned to read my latest book The Shroud, published last month by Bantam Press, he would see that, although it is directed to the general reader, I maintain the critical standards appropriate to a trained historian. The extensive historical references that I have cited are not the garbage sources that typify true \"junk history\". They are solid academic publications in every instance. Mr.Walters has acted recklessly and in complete ignorance - thereby abandoning his own professed historical standards. © 2010----------------------------------\n\n","author":"Stephen E.
