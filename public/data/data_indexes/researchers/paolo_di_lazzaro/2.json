He found John Brown of Georgia Tech and ask him to do a confirmation analysis, which he did succesfully.  He also ask some of his colleagues at Los Alamos to do more testing to also see if they could confirmed (and maybe improve) his findings, which they did.  Now, it’s time for Di Lazarro and his team to do the same and find an independent scientist that will be able to test their findings and see if they are correct and also see if there’s really a connexion to be made with the Shroud (a connexion which is not so evident than Di Lazarro and his team are thinking).\n\n","date":"December 20, 2011 at 12:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/20/shroud-of-turin-quote-for-today-paolo-di-lazzaro/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-5783","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin Quote for Today:  Paolo Di Lazzaro","post":"Ron, you wrote : what is important is that the research is done ‘truthfully’ and ‘accurately’.\nI’m with you on that.

In his favor, I would say that it seems that the very institution (ENEA) is the one which is taking this research to the media and perhaps he cannot avoid it but unfortunately we are seeing again that what could be a serious scientific effort, is being taken away from the scientific forums and brought -once again- to the media. If his team follows this path and becomes a new “Shroud star” is the end of their credibility and of their research, no matter how promising once could have looked like when it was nothing more (and nothing less) that a scientific paper in a JCR journal.\n\n","date":"December 20, 2011 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/20/shroud-of-turin-quote-for-today-paolo-di-lazzaro/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-5794","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin Quote for Today:  Paolo Di Lazzaro","post":"What I thought from the start when I eard that M.

With these two conditions, it would be reason enough for his hair to be the way it shows on the Shroud.

Thus the blood in the hair would dry quite completely leaving the hair in position and quite stiff, once the Sudarium would be pulled off, when in the tomb.
