[{"title":"An Open Letter from Yannick Clément about ENEA’s experiments","post":"Yannick, I am reading his book and your post is a very good summary of Roger’s positions. Congratulations for that.\nHowever, honestly, when we discuss these things I always reach the same dead end: I have to trust the conclusions of Rogers, Danim or anyone else who has at some moment had direct access to the Shroud.\nSome of these persons and their theories – in some cases like Rogers, very reasonable theories- have a lot of followers who believe them for any reason. But if we want this to be scientific, and not a competition on which of those who have ever had access to the Shroud sounds more convincing or popular, I won’t believe anyone’s explanations 100% unless independent researchers when analyzing the same facts, reach the same\nconclusions.\nThat also applies to DiLazzaro and Fanti.\nI have recently written a few comments in this blog on this subject, and I don’t want to repeat again the same ideas, but I do hope that the outcome of all the exchange we are having here (thanks a lot Dan for all your hard work in keeping this blog going) is a new comprehensive roadmap for a truly scientific & breaking-edge research to be developed in the next years.\n\n","date":"January 5, 2012 at 6:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/05/an-open-letter-from-yannick-clment-about-eneas-experiments/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6579","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Open Letter from Yannick Clément about ENEA’s experiments","post":"Gabriel, that’s why I underline the use of the term “IF” in my letter !  In the present state of our knowledge, the truth is : nobody have a definitive proof that the chromophore is a thin layer of impurities or is the primary cell wall of the linen fibers.  But what I point out is the FACT that IF Rogers is right about the chromophore of the body images, then the ENEA’s experiments and results are irrelevant to the Shroud of Turin.  Period.  Again, the “if” is important here.  \nBut, at the same time, I wanted to state in my letter that, from my point of view, if I submit both chromophore hypothesis (the one by Rogers and the one by Fanti and Di Lazzaro) to Occam razor (while I consider the whole picture of the body images : their relationship with the banding effect, the fact that they are confined to the most external surface of the cloth, etc.), honestly, I come to the conclusion that Rogers hypothesis is better because it need less “special assumptions” in order to explain everything we know about the colored fibers of the Shroud.\nSo, before people start to think that the ENEA’s experiments prove anything about the Shroud, I just say : Calm down people and please be prudent because those experiments can well be completely irrelevant to the body images we found on the cloth.  M. Di Lazzaro would like that we believe his hypothesis for the chromophore is true (and we can understand that after he put so much efforts in those experiments), but the reality is that his hypothesis could well be completely incorrect and, if it is so, the results he obtain are irrelevant to the Shroud of Turin…  Only new direct chemical researches could help science to be completely certain about the image chromophore.  So, you can see that, presently, M. Di Lazzaro walk on a VERY THIN ICE with his experiments because it is far from being proven that the coloration of the primary cell wall of the linen fibers have anything to do with the reality of the Shroud body images.  That’s all I say.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2012 at 9:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/05/an-open-letter-from-yannick-clment-about-eneas-experiments/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6660","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Open Letter from Yannick Clément about ENEA’s experiments","post":"OK\n\n","date":"January 8, 2012 at 6:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/05/an-open-letter-from-yannick-clment-about-eneas-experiments/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6676","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Open Letter from Yannick Clément about ENEA’s experiments","post":"Too bad most Christian Shroud researchers have a blind not an enlightened faith.
