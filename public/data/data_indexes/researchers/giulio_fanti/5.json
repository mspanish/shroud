[{"title":"An Inevitable Dispute?  Fanti and the Archbishop?","post":"Given that the Archbishop’s official website tells us, “Recent experimental studies (by Leoncio A. Garza-Valdes in San Antonio (Texas) and by Dmitrij A. Kouznetsov and Andrej Ivanov in Moscow) have furthermore opened the sientific debate about the tissue dating once again, with results seeming to prove a possible and considerable chemical and biological contamination of the tissue and therefore making it fundamental to start a wider research program to study and value the problem of introduction of a correction factor to the radio carbon date,” who would you trust?\nIt’s a mindset. A canonically unauthorized scientific experiment cannot produce results.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2013 at 10:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/28/an-inevitable-dispute-fanti-and-the-archbishop/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-28610","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Inevitable Dispute?  Fanti and the Archbishop?","post":"No matter if Fanti’s sample are truly coming from the Shroud or not or if those samples are truly representative of the main body of the Shroud, the problem is elsewhere…\nNo credible, profesionnal and honest scientist would ever dare to use this kind of very ancient dust samples (these samples were taken from the backside of the cloth 35 years ago folks!) that are very volatile (nobody can be certain what proportion of this dust went on the Shroud at the time of the entombment of the Shroud man and what proportion of this dust became in contact with the Shroud at a much later date during all the vivicissitudes of the cloth and also what proportion of this dust is a modern contamination that happened after the sampling was done) in order to prove anything regarding the Shroud!!!\nAt best, the conclusions of the analyses done on this highly questionable material should have been presented to the public by Fanti et al. as being only interesting CLUES (NOT PROOFS) regarding the authenticity of the cloth and it should have been specified that such clues cannot prove anything (scientifically speaking) regarding the Shroud.  Fanti and his gang should also have specified that these clues are truly waiting for a proper scientific confirmation that could ONLY happen when a new series of direct testing can be allowed on the Shroud by the Vatican.\nUntil that happen, sorry but the results of Fanti’s study of that very old dust material can only be considered as anecdotal at best and highly questionable if we want to stay scientifically sound.  In the end, I put these results in the same category than Max Frei’s conclusions regarding the pollens and even then, I think I’m generous because Frei’s samples were at least fresh samples just taken from the cloth’s surface, on the contrary to Fanti’s very old samples.  And people should also consider the fact that Fanti’s material was taken by Riggi on the BACK SURFACE of the cloth, which was back then in DIRECT CONTACT with the Holland cloth, which could have lead to some contamination and could also have facilitate the trapping of some more recent material in between the 2 cloths that had nothing to do with the origin of the Shroud or with the places where the cloth could have been kept.\nI think any unbiased, honest and intelligent person should agree with me about all this.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2013 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/28/an-inevitable-dispute-fanti-and-the-archbishop/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-28612","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Inevitable Dispute?  Fanti and the Archbishop?","post":"In the event that Fanti and his colleagues positively demonstrate that the age of linen can be accurately determined solely by its elasticity, then they have done a service to science regardless of any consideration of the shroud. If, by their method, they have identified a linen fibre as being 2000 years old, then there is a fairly limited provenance to such a fibre. If that fibre comes from anywhere in the vicinity of the shroud, back or front, authorised or not, then a substantial piece of evidence has been added to the shroud corpus of knowledge. The same applies to their IR or Ramon spectroscopy dating procedures.\nIf.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2013 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/28/an-inevitable-dispute-fanti-and-the-archbishop/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-28615","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Inevitable Dispute?

Fanti and the Archbishop?","post":"The translation above contains some delightful but somewhat misleading idiosyncracies (Translating Prof. Fanti as “infantryman” or “footsoldier” for example; and translating “sottoscrito” as “yours truly”), so I hope a clearer, if slightly freer translation of Fanti’s riposte to his critics may be helpful:\n“1. The correspondents to Vatican Insider have not been able to read the appendix to my book which clearly explains the provenance of the samples.\n2. The samples are from what Cardinal Saldarini specifically refers to in his point d): “material taken with the explicit permission of the Custodian during the STURP investigation in October 1978.”\n3. According to the requirements of Cardinals Saldarini and Poletto, the undersigned has contracted for the return of his samples.\n4. The results of his published research are reproducible and could be confirmed by parallel tests conducted by the CIS. The undersigned is ready to share his knowledge and experience for this purpose.”\nIt seems clear the Fanti felt obliged to point this out as the article to which he was replying implied that he was using samples taken without permission either in 1988 or 2002. His declaration has been quickly followed by some nervous backtracking by the Archbishop of Turin, Cesare Nosiglia, to the effect that even if the taking of the samples was authorised, the length of time since 1978 has rendered their provenance insecure. Which indeed may be correct.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2013 at 12:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/28/an-inevitable-dispute-fanti-and-the-archbishop/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-28620","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Inevitable Dispute?
