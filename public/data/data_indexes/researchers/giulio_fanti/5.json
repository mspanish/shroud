I have serious doubt that this method will be used a lot in the future.  Maybe it could be used to back-up and confirm C14 dating tests ?  I don’t see this going any further than a back-up test to a C14 test.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2013 at 8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/fanti-et-al-s-paper-for-free-at-least-for-now/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-31594","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fanti, et al.’s Paper for Free, at Least for Now","post":"I disagree. Even this raw paper looks fairly persuasive, and Fanti appears to have done a thoroughly professional piece of research in this case. Gabriel has frequently commented on the suspect nature of C14 results in the case of textiles, and has advocated that other more reliable methods are available.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2013 at 4:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/fanti-et-al-s-paper-for-free-at-least-for-now/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-31663","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fanti, et al.’s Paper for Free, at Least for Now","post":"As I know Gabriel is not an expert in C14 dating and as I know, there is no other largely accepted method to date ancient textile than C14.  And by the way, my comment was a question more than anything else.  Only the future will tell if Fanti’s method will eventually be used by archaeologists, textile experts, C14 dating experts, etc.  No one can tell about that right now.\nAnd even if this method could be used on a large scale one day, that doesn’t mean Fanti’s dating result about the Shroud is valid.  There are other important issues regarding that particular dating test that has not be addressed in the paper recently published like the representativity of the sample used.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2013 at 4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/fanti-et-al-s-paper-for-free-at-least-for-now/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-31664","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fanti, et al.’s Paper for Free, at Least for Now","post":"Dating of Fanti’s Shroud sample is not cited in his paper.

There’s a reasonably good case for the relic’s authenticity. If true it should date no later than the 1st century. I wonder what Fanti’s test would date it to?

We cannot say so for the Sudarium.  There are many conflicting pieces of evidence and the brownish aspect of the blood is only one of those.  \nI don’t pretend the Sudarium is a forgery done with a real human body for sure, but right now, this is an hypothesis that is truly possible (unlike the Shroud, which can highly unlikely be a false relic done with a corpse), especially when you consider the fact that there was a big market of false Christian relics during that period of time (around the 6th century).  You just have to look at the Mandylion, which appeared during that time to be convinced…\n\n","date":"April 24, 2013 at 4:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/fanti-et-al-s-paper-for-free-at-least-for-now/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-31794","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fanti, et al.’s Paper for Free, at Least for Now","post":"I would think the logic of Occam’s razor would give the answer as; The C14 is in error.
