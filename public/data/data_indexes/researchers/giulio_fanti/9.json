After a while he published a paper in Vibrational Spectroscopy, in which all mention of the shroud and all his dating methods were omitted, except for FTIR spectroscopy. He subjected 12 samples of known age from 3000BC to the present, and observed a noticeable progressive change in the spectra recorded. Flax, it appears can be shown to degrade with age. In ideal situations (permanent storage in a single place of constant environmental conditions) his findings suggest an ascertainable age band of 400 years, which might be narrowed if further ressearch was carried out. Although this method is unlikely ever to be better than C14 dating, it has the merit of being wholly non-destructive. In more variable conditions however (and the Shroud springs inevitble to mind) this does not seem a promising line of research.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2013 at 12:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/revisiting-fantis-dating-methods/","cat":"science","id":"comment-57112","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Revisiting Giulio Fanti’s Dating Methods","post":"And well done, Tristan, for pointing out two newer papers which were unknown to me, one dealing with a machine for testing the mechanical parameters of single fibres of flax, and another hoping to establish that these too are dateably age related.

On this subject, this is exactly what is thinking an expert in C14 dating like William Meacham, who wrote in his book The Rape of the Turin Shroud that, in 1988, he was expecting a result around the 4th or 5th century, even though he was convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud.  Why?  Because there are too much possibilities of contamination with a relic like the Shroud who was held by numerous hands (many of which we don’t know anything about) in numerous conditions (again, many of which we don’t know anything about) and I think this is ever truer in the particular case of Fanti’s highly suspicious samples (taken with a vaccuum from the space between the Holland cloth and the backside of the Shroud, which could well have traped a lot of alien material that have nothing to do with the original cloth over the centuries).  So, in such a context, it is almost scientifically impossible to expect the dating result will give a pretty 30 AD result!  \nAnd in the particular case of Fanti’s dating, here’s a very good question that I don’t think was ever asked:  Why in the world he did not ALSO dated his samples with the well-accepted C14 method in order to compare the results and see if his new method could have some chance to yield accurate results in the case of ancient textiles?\n\n","date":"December 7, 2013 at 6:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/revisiting-fantis-dating-methods/","cat":"science","id":"comment-57165","author":"Anomymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Revisiting Giulio Fanti’s Dating Methods","post":"Why in the world he did not ALSO dated his samples with the well-accepted C14 method in order to compare the results and see if his new method could have some chance to yield accurate results in the case of ancient textiles?\nWhich samples?

To be fair to Fanti, I do not think he continues to press his new dating systems as relevant to the Shroud any more, although they may have value in other circumstances.\nThe reponse I’m wondering about concerns an ‘adjustment’ made to the FTIR date, to ‘compensate’ for the 1532 fire. The original date of the FTIR analysis (p.90 of Il Mistero della Sindone) was 752 BC +/- 400 yrs. This was adjusted by adding about 450 years to arrive at 300 BC +/- 400 yrs, according to some experiments carried out by heating moden cloth. The original date of the Raman Spectroscopy analysis was 200 BC +/- 400 yrs. However, it was not felt necessary to correct this date: neither Fanti nor Rinalsi comment on it further. The third set of results, the mechanical deformation set, gave a range of five dates from about 750 BC to 900 AD, which were averaged to 400 AD +/- 400 yrs. Rinaldi thought that the 1532 fire was likely to have affected the mechanical strength of the cloth to an extent that this result should be adjusted accordingly, but Fanti said that experiments had shown that the effect of the fire was negligible in this case and also that “the effect of the fire was further reduced by the particular position from which [the fibres he studied] were collected.” I find both those statements strange indeed, considering he was using fibres hoovered up from between the shroud and the backing cloth.\n\n","date":"December 8, 2013 at 9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/revisiting-fantis-dating-methods/","cat":"science","id":"comment-57244","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Revisiting Giulio Fanti’s Dating Methods","post":"‘ Hugh. ‘To be fair to Fanti, I do not think he continues to press his new dating systems as relevant to the Shroud any more, although they may have value in other circumstances.’.

Fibers have, in the course of time, detached from the back of the Shroud and become trapped inside the cavity between the cloths, but those that have would be either weaker or more damaged than those which remained in the threads. For example they could be fibers that originally came from areas of stitching or burning or soaking in water or any other places that had suffered damage for some reason.\n“In addition to the fibers that had already become detached in the past, Riggi’s vacuum cleaner could have detached others while it was working, and those fibres, too, would be weaker or more damaged than those which remained. Fanti’s material is thus shown to be unrepresentative in being particularly deteriorated, so it is no wonder that the age he calculated is more apparent than real.”\nFanti did not address this point in his reply to me.\nThe situation is not better if one reads the recent article by Fanti and Malfi:\nhttp://www.aimetatorino2013.it/cdrom/cdrom_pdf_fullpaper/001200008502.pdf\nIn section 4.2 they write:\n“Eight different TS fibers have been recognized as such by the first author among others using a petrographic microscope and a particular technique based on cross-polarization. TS fibers in fact present a greater number of transversal defects (kink bands) than other more recent flax fibers and it is therefore relatively easy to detect them.”\nThese “kink bands”, if I understand well, are twists or bends that denote a weak or deteriorated fibre.

However it is excellent anecdotal evidence supporting the premise that the 1988 tests were flawed. For that reason, Fanti’s contribution is significant. In view of the fact that it has been 25 years and no additional carbon date has been authorized, what are researchers supposed to do—sit on their hands? I applaud Fanti for pursuing a different tact.”\nDespite the dispersion of his results, Fanti’s would seem a lot closer to the mark than the 1988 tests. The mere fact that fibres closest to the surface are more likely to be displaced may have as much a bearing than any inherent weakness in them as asserted by Rinaldi.\n\n","date":"December 8, 2013 at 3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/revisiting-fantis-dating-methods/","cat":"science","id":"comment-57284","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Revisiting Giulio Fanti’s Dating Methods","post":"Dear friends,\nI believe that Giulio Fanti can improve the system using the NEMS …\nThe nanoelectromechanical way !\nWhat is yourt opinion ?\nDo you know the NEMS, the NanoElectroMechanical Systems ?\n— —\nHere the World’s Smallest FM Radio Transmitter  …\nlink :\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131118091502.htm\n> … … Graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon, is the strongest material known to man, and also has electrical properties superior to the silicon used to make the chips found in modern electronics.
