[{"title":"Hugh Farey Takes Over as BSTS Newsletter Editor","post":"Thank you, Dan. Taking the bull by the horns, so to speak, may I say that I shall be contacting as many of the members of the BSTS as I can on the off-chance that, even if their interest in the shroud is only peripheral, they may have areas of expertise which could inform those of us who are more interested in the shroud but have less expertise at our fingertips. Chemists, Art Historians, Hand-Loom Weavers, Nuclear Radiation Physicists, Geologists, Theologians – I’ve got lots of questions!\nFrom this blog’s point-of-view, I have become familiar with many of your specialist fields (well, more specialist than mine, anyway), but don’t know if you are members of the BSTS, or would think of becoming one, and enjoy composing an article for it. Can you get a personal message to me via this site? You could aways go through Dan, initially, I suppose.\n(Now I must go and re-read Mark Guscin’s “The Role of An Editor” in the latest edition…!)\n\n","date":"September 17, 2013 at 12:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/17/hugh-farey-takes-over-as-bsts-newsletter-editor/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44530","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
