[{"title":"Update: Hugh Farey Takes Over as BTST Editor","post":"This is a good move as Hugh has shown that he is able to sort out the dead from the living wood of Shroud research and I am sure he will initiate research into areas where very little work on the Shroud has yet been done e.g. the early  trade in relics between Jerusalem and Constantinople in the fifth century as masterminded by Pulcheria, the sister of the emperor Theodosius II, and the direct relic trade between Jerusalem and northern France in the second half of the first millennium AD. Both these routes had documented relics from the Lord’s Tomb or Calvary so need to have further work done on them.\nI look forward to seeing what comes up in the Newsletter!\n\n","date":"December 14, 2013 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/14/update-hugh-farey-takes-over-as-btst-editor/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-59349","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"}]
