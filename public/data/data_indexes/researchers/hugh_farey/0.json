I find The Van Haelst article extraordinarily difficult to read. However, this quote is interesting: “The burn marks of 1532, caused by a CLOSED fire, with a lack of oxygen, [which we now dispute – HF] reflect a dark REDDISH colour.” I wonder if this is in turn from Pellicori’s paper, or was he at the 1978 investigation? I ask because a dark reddish colour is in fact what you see if a cloth does not fluoresce at all, and is caused by the dark red visible light that is inevitably part of an ultra-violet lightbulb, however well shielded. Maybe the whole pink fluorescence thing is a myth?\n","date":"December 22, 2012 at 10:40 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/guest-posting-from-hugh-farey-yipee-another-science-bod-heres-a-snapshot-of-his-current-studies-of-scorching-and-uv-fluorescence/","cat":"hugh_farey","id":"comment-1549","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Guest posting from Hugh Farey (yipee – another science bod!): here’s a snapshot of his current studies of scorching and uv fluorescence.","post":"There’s a wealth of fascinating comment there, Hugh, and much food for thought. I’m especially intrigued by your ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking as regards the pink fluorescence of the 1532 burn marks, and the possibility that it might be due to something other than the scorching per se, like an attempted repair.\nAre you familiar with the peculiar literature on the Belgian Lier copy of the Shroud as regards the “poker holes”? There is some ambiguity there re what was perceived by the copyist, i.e. burn holes or blood stains?  Were the burns an attempt to obliterate some unwanted blood stains? Might the same be true of the 1532 burn holes?\nHere’s one I did earlier with a link to the Belgian paper.\nHeat-degraded blood -> porphyrin – > pink fluorescence?\nPS  I have checked and rechecked my email inbox and outbox. The address I gave you was exactly as given to me, so there must be a bug somewhere.\n","date":"December 22, 2012 at 7:14 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/guest-posting-from-hugh-farey-yipee-another-science-bod-heres-a-snapshot-of-his-current-studies-of-scorching-and-uv-fluorescence/","cat":"hugh_farey","id":"comment-1547","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Guest posting from Hugh Farey (yipee – another science bod!): here’s a snapshot of his current studies of scorching and uv fluorescence.","post":"Well, I started experimenting in about 1978, so there have been a few, but I think the single thing that started me off again after a long pause – and made me use the shroud as an inspiration for children – was Guerreschi’s and Salcito’s discovery that the water stains didn’t match the burn holes; so obvious that a child could have noticed, and yet unobserved for so long even on the ‘most studied artifact in history’ as it’s sometimes called. It just made me want to question everything, and try to notice something of my own that nobody else has spotted!\nLatest news – I soaked a piece of linen in soapy starch and hung it to dry on a bush, then dropped it over a bas relief over which I’d poured a weak ammonia solution, roughly a la Rogers. For a start the contact places just absorbed the liquid into big round splodges (I think Roger’s only used vapour), and for a second there was absolutely no change in colour when the cloth dried out. But here’s the killer, on warming the cloth gently afterwards, it did go slightly brown – AND FLUORESCED JUST LIKE A SCORCH! Ho ho ho, how I laughed…\nI tried emailing Thibault with the address you gave me but I don’t think it can have worked, so if you’re reading this Thibault, mine is hughfarey (at) hotmail (dot) com.\nAnd finally. Quite by accident I labelled a piece of linen with a different pen today, and guess what – pink fluorescence all round the edges! On the off chance that maybe the pink on the shroud was actually formed by an organic solvent rather than heat, I tried a few I had in the lab, with no success, and even set fire to a piece of pine and then smothered it with cloth, hoping the resin might make it fluoresce pink. No joy yet, but I’ve a few things still to try. Maybe the nuns tried gluing the scorched fabric together before they patched it?\n","date":"December 21, 2012 at 11:02 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/guest-posting-from-hugh-farey-yipee-another-science-bod-heres-a-snapshot-of-his-current-studies-of-scorching-and-uv-fluorescence/","cat":"hugh_farey","id":"comment-1545","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Guest posting from Hugh Farey (yipee – another science bod!): here’s a snapshot of his current studies of scorching and uv fluorescence.","post":"In just over a week, it will be the anniversary of my first posting on the Shroud, Hugh.
