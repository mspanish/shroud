[{"title":"Photos from HughÂ Farey","post":"Hugh, thank you for photos. I think that it would also be most interesting having access to the photos from your own scorching experiments. You are reinterpretating Rogers photo from another perspective which to me seems estimulating.\nIf I understand your point correctly, it is the shroud image fibers that are coloured throughout their diameters (VI-2) while the scorched fibers get coloured only on their surfaces (VI-1 outer and inner). If this is the case, and the image fibers are coloured beyond their surface and this is not only an exceptional example, what happens with the impurity layer theory? Also, if this is the case, images VI-2 and VI-1 seem to be too different as to explain as a scorch  also what we see in the image fiber VI-2.\n\n","date":"January 15, 2013 at 1:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/15/photos-from-hugh-farey/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-22066","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"}]
