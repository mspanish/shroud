Art historian Thomas de Wesselow says in his book, \"The Sign\" (2012) that the modern art world simply ignores the Shroud, as though it doesn't exist. But as John Walsh pointed out, the Shroud is either authentic, or it is the greatest work of art of all time:\" Only this much is certain: The Shroud of Turin is either the most awesome and instructive relic of Jesus Christ in existence-showing us in its dark simplicity how He appeared to men-or it is one of the most ingenious, most unbelievably clever, products of the human mind and hand on record. It is one or the other; there is no middle ground.\" (Walsh, J.E., 1963, \"The Shroud,\" pp.xi-xii)>Whether or not any o' this's true what amazes me's how readily an' unquestioningly many members o' both sides o' the argument rush t' embrace an' promote any \"intense and sometimes absurd speculation\" which claims t'confirm their preciously held beliefs.This is too sweeping a generalisation. But it certainly is true of Freeman in regards to the Shroud. In Freeman's atheist/agnostic worldview the Shroud simply MUST be a fake and so ANY argument, no matter how weak, against the Shroud's authenticity will suffice! Stephen E.

Except that Farey with his \"an accidental 14th century origin\" of the Shroud:\"Unlike my predecessors, whom I think are more or less committed to a pro-authenticity point of view, I myself currently incline more towards an accidental 14th century origin for the cloth now preserved in Turin.\" (\"Editorial - by Hugh Farey,\" BSTS Newsletter No. 78 - December 2013)is even more an extreme anti-authenticist than Freeman, who at least believes that the Shroud was forged by an unknown 14th century painter.

It's an old rhetorical trick, declaring oneself to be in the middle and everyone else on either side is an extremist (which could even include me if that was Borky's intent). That is basically the Fence-Sitter's tactic. He sits on his fence, claiming not to believe the Shroud is, or is not, authentic, so he can criticise all sides as he sees fit.That's why I answered Borky's \"members o' both sides o' the argument ...\" (has he got a keyboard problem where his \"f\" key returns an apostrophe?), by pointing out it was a \"sweeping generalisation,\" too general to be useful. It is the EVIDENCE that matters.>It took me 2 years to even consider having an opinion on the shroud, and when I first studied it I made myself only visit anti authenticist shroud sites to make sure I wasn't wasting my time researching the shroud. It took Shroud.com's Barrie Schwortz 17 years:\"Mr Schwortz referred to the scientific evidence that is `the basis for my opinion that the shroud cannot be an artwork. STURP's data provided empirical evidence to that effect, although the sceptics of the world continue to deny it'. He continued: `Remember that I am Jewish (not Messianic), and it took nearly 17 years after our direct examination of the cloth before the scientific evidence actually convinced me of the shroud's authenticity. It was the science that did it.\" (Barrett, D.V., \"Expert dismisses historian's claim that Turin Shroud was made for medieval ritual,\" Catholic Herald, 29 October 2014).>So no, not all people on both sides embrace any theory as true.Agreed.>Im sure it took Stephen jones even longer to come to a conclusion on the shroud, not without much research and contemplation. Actually, after I was midway through reading Stevenson & Habermas' book, \"Verdict on the Shroud\" (1981), in January 2005, which only took a few days, I provisionally accepted the Shroud was authentic, subject to it passing the tests of further evidence. Which is still my position today. Except that after 9 years of continually exposing myself to all the evidence for and against the Shroud, and it passing all tests with flying colours, it is extremely unlikely that there is any evidence out there that would negate the MOUNTAIN of evidence for the Shroud's authenticity that I now know.Indeed, the WEAKNESS of the LEADING anti-authenticist's (like Freeman) evidence and arguments is itself evidence that the Shroud is authentic. They are these days just a RABBLE of mutually CONTRADICTORY theories (e.g. Freeman's 14th century painter and Farey's 14th century accident), who are united only in their antipathy towards the authenticity of the Shroud!Stephen E.

I have encountered them not only in evangelical circles but in Catholic circles as will and it seems.that they are motivates by emotions then the evidences .It is understandable that Protestants may be opposed to the authenticity of the Shroud as part of a general opposition to Roman Catholic relics. But what seems surprising is that some Roman Catholics are also opposed to the authenticity of the Shroud, and two in particular were among the most zealous (if not fanatical) opponents of the authenticity of the Shroud.Canon Ulysse Chevalier (1841–1923) who \"In the controversy on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin ... he worked by tracing back the history of the cloth, which was undoubtedly used as a shroud, but he argued was not produced before the 14th century and was probably no older\" but \"In 2006 French historian Emmanuel Poulle wrote in a peer-reviewed journal that Ulysse Chevalier showed in this case intellectual dishonesty. According to Poulle, Chevalier deliberately did not correctly mention the Papal bulls of antipope Clement VII issued in 1390. In fact Clement VII never opted for the forgery thesis.\" (\"Ulysse Chevalier,\" Wikipedia, 2 June 2014). And in fact Chevalier's intellectual dishonesty regarding the Shroud, was much worse than that. He forged a crucial heading to Bishop Pierre d'Arcis 1389 Memorandum that wasn't there. Read Markwardt, J., 2001, \"The Conspiracy Against the Shroud,\" BSTS Newsletter, No. 55, June 2002).Fr Herbert Thurston (1856–1939) was another Roman Catholic leading opponent of the Shroud, although Wikipedia doesn't say much about that:\"Fr. Herbert Henry Charles Thurston, S.J. (15 November 1856 – 3 November 1939) was an English priest of the Roman Catholic Church, a member of the Jesuit order, and a prolific scholar on liturgical, literary, historical, and spiritual matters. ... In his day, he was considered something of an expert on spiritualism. ... Thurston wrote more than 150 articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia (1907-1914) [including the online article on the Shroud of Turin]... He was a close friend of the Modernist theologian, Father George Tyrrell, who was harshly sanctioned by the Church. Many of Thurston's articles show a skeptical attitude ... about holy relics [especially the Shroud of Turin] and his treatment of spiritualism and the paranormal was regarded as `too sympathetic' by some sections of the Catholic community.\" (\"Herbert Thurston,\" Wikipedia, 8 October 2014. My words in square brackets)Read Markwardt BSTS article above for details of Thurston's intellectual dishonesty also in further `improving' on Chevalier's already `improved' d'Arcis Memorandum.>I never knew about the shroud until 2009 and I found out about it from atheists of all people . Oh the ironyWhen I `discovered' the Shroud in 2005 and posted a comment to a news article about it shortly after, on my now closed CreationEvolutionDesign Yahoo group, I found the atheists in the group knew a lot about it. Having only read Stevenson & Habermas' 1981 \"Verdict on the Shroud\" I didn't know anything about the Shroud's 1988 C14 dating, but I was in the midst of my Bachelor of Science degree, so I answered them using what I knew about C14 dating in general, until I could catch up on my reading about that.Stephen E.

I really think what we have here are 2 possibilities .>>1. They have a very liberal theology kind of stance towards the supernatural orFrom what I have read of Chevalier and Thurston, they were `progressive' Catholics who sought to rid the Catholic Church of its links with `embarrassing' medieval relics.They had their contemporary counterparts in liberal Protestant theologians who wanted to rid the Protestant Church of links to `embarrassing'  Biblical miracles.I don't disagree that most RC relics are fakes and it is dishonest that the Vatican refuses to state which relics are authentic, like the Shroud, and which are fakes. But the problem with Chevalier and Thurston is that they sought to `throw out the baby with the bathwater.\" Indeed, they LIED in order to discredit the Shroud, which shows that concern for truth was not what motivated them.>2. They are afraid of being embarrassed in front of their materialistically leaning colleagues .That may have been true at the beginning of their careers, but so powerful is the indoctrination in Naturalism in Science, and Academia generally (including many theological colleges), that from my experience of over a decade (1984-2005) debating Creation/Evolution, these `Theistic Naturalists' are VERY enthusiastic in denying the supernatural, even Biblical miracles.>It's clear that something emotional is motivating this anti authenticity or anti super naturalism bias of theirs.The emotion probably comes from the inner tension of trying to serve two incompatible masters. Mt 6:24: \"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.\"in this case supernatural Biblical Christianity and Naturalism (\"nature is all there is: there is no supernatural\").And so Christians like me, who try to be consistent supernaturalists (i.e. accept supernatural causation when the evidence points to it and naturalistic explanations don't work), presumably make them feel guilty deep-down, which is why the Fence-Sitter and his `Christian' ilk are so opposed to me, and tolerant of, if not actually on the side of, Anti-Christians like Charles Freeman.It doesn't bother me, indeed on the contrary it confirms to me that I am on the right track:Jn 15:18-20: 18 \"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. 19 If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. 20 Remember the word that I said to you: `A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.\"And I know that if they don't repent, the Lord with repay them for any evil:Rom 12:19. \"Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, `Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.'\"they have directed at me for simply seeking to serve Jesus as the Man on the Shroud.[continued]\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"November 3, 2014 at 8:43 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual\n","post":"\n\n[continued]>Hughes slandering posts and then his inability to back them up just smacks of hidden intentions and diversionary tactics.I presume you mean Hugh Farey? I haven't read The Fence-Sitter's blog since 8th May, so I am blissfully ignorant of any \"slandering posts\" against me on that site, since then.They might consider that if the Shroud is authentic (as the evidence OVERWHELMING indicates), and bears the RESURRECTED image of Jesus, then Satan might be using them to try to silence my witness to that fact.But of course they will probably scoff at that, because, being anti-supernaturalists, they probably wouldn't believe in the reality of Satan, let alone that he could be using THEM. But:\"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\" (McQuarrie C., 1996, \"The Usual Suspects,\" Faber & Faber: London, p.89)!>I usually see these tactics by pseudo skeptics not from believers.What makes you think they are CHRISTIAN \"believers\"? Again, \"don't believe what people SAY. Believe only in what they DO.\"And what they DO is act like anti-Christian \"skeptics\" as you noted.And oppose me, who seeks to be a consistent Biblical Christian, in my support of the authenticity of the Shroud, and they support ANTI-Christians like Charles Freeman.Jesus warned that there would be MANY on the Day of Judgement who THOUGHT they were Christians but WERE NOT:Mt 7:21-23. \"Not everyone who says to me, `Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one WHO DOES THE WILL OF MY FATHER who is in heaven. 22 On that day MANY will say to me, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' 23 And then will I declare to them, `I NEVER KNEW YOU; depart from me, you WORKERS OF LAWLESSNESS.'\" (my emphasis).Who are those \"many\" if it does not include them? Was Jesus wrong? Or did the Apostle Matthew wrongly report what Jesus said? But they will probably just scoff at that too. In particular, The Fence-Sitter will probably dismiss it yet another \"metaphor\"!Stephen E.

Have you ever done a blog post on the fire in 1997 that almost destroyed the shroud.No I haven't done post on the 1997 fire that nearly destroyed the Shroud. But there is a Shroud.com article by Barrie Schwortz on it: \"The 1997 Fire\" with photos and links to news articles about it.>was there any information gleaned by the local turin authorities as to who was involved in that arson?From memory, arson was suspected, but not proved. However, Wilson in 1998 (see below) says the 1997 fire was arson. Here are quotes about the 1997 fire on my system mentioning \"arson\" (my emphases below):\"Then, in the hour before the midnight of April 11, came the highly publicised fire. Although the Shroud itself was saved, all that had been its environs during the last four hundred years lay a tangled, blackened and water-drenched mess. The once gleaming bullet-proof display case had had to be most energetically smashed in order for the Shroud to be rescued. Where once there had been a three hundred year old wall of glass separating the Royal Chapel from the main body of the Cathedral there was now empty space. The Royal Chapel's dome was now in a far more dangerous state than before the restoration work began. Worst affected of all was the actual lining of the walls of the Royal Chapel. Likewise the adjoining part of the Royal Palace where STURP did its testing work in 1978, much of its splendid baroque ornament and valuable paintings having been ruined beyond repair. And BEHIND THE WHOLE EPISODE LAY THE DARK SPECTRE OF ARSON and sabotage on the part of as yet unidentified enemies of the Shroud, the Church and all that these represent. ... The Cause of the fire. According to the latest available information, as given at a Press Conference on 24 April, the exact cause of the fire is not yet known. However an overloading of the Palace electrical circuits has been ruled out, and ARSON SEEMS STRONGLY SUSPECTED. Some reports have spoken of a cryptic telephoned warning shortly beforehand, also signs that it started seemingly in two separate places at the same time (i) in wooden and aluminium scaffolding just above the roof of the passageway connecting the palace with the Royal Chapel, and (ii) inside the Chapel itself. The finding of a discarded petrol can has also been mentioned. The difficulty lies choosing between the several plausible categories of possible suspects. ... Whoever was responsible, if the fire was arson, then it will certainly not have been the first attempt to destroy the Shroud is this way. There was another in 1972, in which an intruder broke into the Royal Chapel after climbing over the Palace roof.\" (Wilson, I., 1997, \"Editorial: When Everything Seems Against You...,\" BSTS Newsletter, No: 45, June/July).[continued]\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"November 3, 2014 at 11:22 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual\n","post":"\n\n[continued]\"Yet less than two decades since the Shroud came into the Church's ownership, and less than a decade since radiocarbon dating declared the Shroud a fake, the Church has begun to behave as if it has the genuine article, against all the odds, including a determined attempt to destroy that article (for all THE LATEST FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE CHAPEL FIRE WAS INDEED ARSON). So why this sudden volte-face? Does the Church have some very good reason for believing that the radiocarbon dating was wrong and that the Shroud may be genuine after all?\" (Wilson, I., 1998, \"The Blood and the Shroud,\"  p.12).\"The Guarini Chapel, totally guttered by fire, was left a smoldering, blackened ruin, and its entry wall adjoining the rear of the Cathedral was extensively damaged. Although the fire could have been caused by a short circuit, POLICE INVESTIGATORS SAID IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ARSON. A mystery telephone caller had given a warning a half an hour before the blaze that there `might be a fire in the cathedral'. A petrol can was found later in the gardens. Whatever the cause of the fire, Cardinal Saldarini said the rescue of the Shroud was `a miracle'.\" (Whiting, B., 2006, \"The Shroud Story,\" p.176)>Thanks and God bless You're welcome.
