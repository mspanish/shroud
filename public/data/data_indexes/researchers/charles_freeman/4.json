[{"title":"Catching a Wonderful Response to Charles Freeman","post":"As I read Freeman’s essay I respected him for at least trying to be scientific.  But it did seem he was arguing from his desired conclusion.  I’d like to see examples of how woodcut printing on cloth was done.  Are there any examples of ink that left a chemical change on a cloth resembling the shroud?  Colin Berry shows integrity in this case, even if his style is more snarky than is needed.\n\n","date":"February 23, 2015 at 11:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/23/catching-a-wonderful-response-to-charles-freeman/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191660","author":"Matt Kowalsk","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching a Wonderful Response to Charles Freeman","post":"These are hypotheses but they are ones which are making sense to people who know about these things and so eventually something acceptable to the scientific community may emerge. No other hypotheses about the making of the images have gained any widespread support, certainly not in any scientific circles, so why not try another in a field that is still open?\n\n","date":"February 23, 2015 at 1:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/23/catching-a-wonderful-response-to-charles-freeman/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191663","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching a Wonderful Response to Charles Freeman","post":"is the  space alien field still open\n\n","date":"February 23, 2015 at 9:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/23/catching-a-wonderful-response-to-charles-freeman/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191702","author":"Paul","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Catching a Wonderful Response to Charles Freeman","post":"snake oil\n\n","date":"February 23, 2015 at 1:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/23/catching-a-wonderful-response-to-charles-freeman/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-191665","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"}]
