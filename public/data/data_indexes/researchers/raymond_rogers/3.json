For his part, what does Thibault have? Nothing – no hypothesis to account for a sheet of linen with an unusual sepia-coloured image – but  a material object nevertheless.  All he has to offer is a pseudo-scientific pdf attacking a plausible and promising hypothesis defended with known physics and chemistry,  simply because it doesn’t fit with his preconceptions of authenticity.\nThe Thibaults of this world are not part of the solution. They are part of the problem. That is why I set up this site, a spin-off from sciencebuzz.com, to root out the pseudo-science of Shroudology – and for no other reason. Pseudo-science makes a mockery of the scientific method, the latter depending on people willing to go beyond the known facts and advance a hypothesis. Repeat: a hypothesis cannot be demonstrated. To suggest otherwise betrays a profound ignorance of the scientific method. A hypothesis is a construct, a working model, one that serves to stimulate new thinking, new experimental approaches.  This blog has over the weeks and months proposed any number of suggestions for new experimental approaches, based on the unproven supposition (i.e. hypothesis) that the TS image is a thermal imprint.\nThat is all I have to say to Thibault for now. He can rest assured that I will not hesitate to speak  again should he produce any more pdf reports that lack the essential objectivity of science, ones that simply attempt to dismiss an existing hypothesis with phoney argument, creating difficulties, nay, insuperable problems,  that are entirely in the mind of the author.\nRepeat: there is NO insuperable problem regarding scorch contrast or intensity, as the photograph below demonstrates. The faintest scorches, close to the limit of visibility, give very satisfactory light/dark reversed and 3D-enhanced images. It was galling in the extreme  for Thibault to propose otherwise, based on a totally unsuitable choice of template, and failing to mention anywhere the scores of postings I have done using more carefully-chosen bas relief templates. But then they undermine his simplistic and absurdly dogmatic thesis, don’t they?\n\nLeft: scorch imprints with decreasing intensity, obtained by serial imprinting from heated horse brasses as they cool down.\nRight: the same photograph, after negative->positive conversion and semi-3D enhancement in ImageJ software.\n Scorches of fainter or intermediate intensity give the best 3D facsimiiles – there is no problem due to one part of the scorch image being too intense relative to another. The “contrast problem” is a total red herring – one that needs to be quickly retracted by its sponsor(s). It only exists due to unsuitable choice of template or the manner in which it is deployed.\n","date":"January 28, 2013 at 10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1802","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"I ask everybody to read my previous message in which I ask CB to show or at least to provide some explanations and demonstrations regarding his hypothesis: ” I have no problem whatsoever with your scorch photomicrographs.

The TS image might possibly have fluoresced under uv when first formed, but if that were due to furfural, say, which you cite, then it’s unlikely there would be any still around after centuries of storage, especially after exposure to high temperature (1532 fire). \nFurfural is a small molecule (C5H4O2) with a relatively low boiling point (162 degrees C) and thus an appreciable vapour pressure at normal temperatures. More importantly, you made no attempt to monitor fluorescence in your own paper, so had nothing new to offer. Why then introduce fluorescence into your Introduction, except to signal that there was in your view a corpse called the scorch hypothesis, one needing a decent burial, and you were about to bang the last nails into the coffin?\nSorry, I have no time for your brand of agenda-driven pseudo-science Thibault.

The repeating images in that previously blank space were obtained by taking a ShroudScope image of the face, adding some contrast, then showing the result of light/dark reversal (“inversion”) in ImageJ, followed by 3D enhancement. So folk can see at a glance the iconic features of the Shroud image  that arise through modern stepwise processing (conversion of the “photographic negative”, correction, thermographic negative,  to a positive, as per Secondo Pia, then the demonstration of so-called “encoded 3D information”.  Forget the mystique: in fact nothing is encoded – certainly not digitally – except by via analogue/tactile reproduction, like a gramophone record in a groove. The ImageJ software simply reads image intensity as height on the z axis above the xy plane). More importantly, one can see that the same transformations are attainable in principle by starting with a thermal imprint (“scorch”) from a heated template (see banner, with my Ghanaian trinket as bas-relief template).\n","date":"January 28, 2013 at 4:38 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1798","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"Colin,\nYou are right in writing: “The key question is how BOTH our scorch images compare with the Shroud.”\nThe only problem is that you never showed your scorch image at fabric and thread level.\nThis is the key.\nYou can compare my scorch image with the TS at fabric and thread level.\nI can not compare your own scorch image with the TS at fabric and thread level.\n","date":"January 27, 2013 at 7:48 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1794","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"Part 2 of my reply to Thibault.\n“Apparently, CB did not read my paper. Otherwise he would have seen than the major part of it is dealing with the microscopical characteristics of ANY KIND of scorch at fabric and thread level and not with the problem of contrast or relief.”\nOK, now we have addressed the macroscopic aspects, we can deal with the microscopic. It’s immaterial as to which is the major or minor part of the paper. They are both important, but it’s customary to start with the macroscopic aspects first, especially when we are asked to see things from a forger’s point of view – someone wanting to get subtle gradations of contrast.\n\nHere btw is a  “macroscopic” view of a scorch off a horse-brass template (beats a chunk of discarded steel anyday) that has been 3D enhanced in ImageJ. I see no problem with contrast. Do you, does anyone, apart from a blotch on the nose – that could be pixellation noise.\n“Because my model has no slightly rounded relief, CB thinks that all my observations and photographs are not reliable.”\nCorrect. They are not reliable. Why, when others have used bas-relief with recognizable images, with subtleties of shading and contrast, do you decide to use a flat chunk of metal with no image as such, merely a sunken plane. It makes no sense to embark on the microscopy if the macroscopic modelling is wrong. By you own admission you have excessive contrast, so it’s hardly surprising that the microscopy should exaggerate differences between scorched, unscorched and lightly scorched. Intentionally or otherwise, you have arranged matters to get a negative result, namely that a scorch is a bad model of the Shroud. No, a bad scorch is a bad model for the Shroud,\n“Does CB think that with a slightly rounded relief rather than with a flat template, the microscopical characteristics of the color distribution (and all my observations) at fabric, thread and fiber level should be very different ?\nWe are talking about modelling a subtle image, so it’s anyone guess what is meant when you ask if I would expect a difference at the microscopic level between a rounded bas relief and a flat piece of metal. If one image has subtle contrast differences and the other has harsher differences, with excessive scorching, then yes, of course one would expect differences. But at this stage, we are not trying to make predictions, since we have little or no experience of scorching. Where are there published papers?  So let’s put our ideas and presuppositions to one side, and simply look at the model scorches in THIS paper, with its methodology, and see how they compare with the Shroud. Are there irreconcilable differences?\n“In order to produce an imprint one has to apply a hot surface on the linen.\nI did it with the kind of “crudest bas-relief” I used because it was the only mean to test different temperatures, different pressures and different contact times.”\nEven if that were the case, i.e. that a proper bas relief could not have been used, that would not justify a model that was unsuited to the task in hand. But I don’t accept anyway the claim that one had to use a flat sheet of metal. What is it you were not able to do with a bas rellief that you could do with your quirky flat iron.? Different temperatures? Simply do serial imprinting as the template cools down, as I have done, to get a range of scorch-intensities. Different pressures? Press the hot template into an underlay with a metal implement applying light or heavy pressure. Different contact times?  Have a pair of pliars or similar handy to remove the template from the linen at different times. Grab it edge on it necessary.\n“Using a “better” bas-relief (in the sense of CB), one can certainly obtain a better “image” but its characteristics at fabric, thread and fiber level cannot be different than the characteristics showed in my paper because the fundamental mechanisms are similar.”\nThe fundamental “mechanism” may be similar at the molecular level, but image imprinting is not just about fundamental science, anymore than any other kind of image-making. It’s as much to do with technique. Much emphasis was placed earlier on alleged differences in “contrast”. But they can arise without any difference in the mechanism of scorching  at the molecular level– merely by differences in application time, pressure, temperature and ANGLE of contact, as determined by the contours of the template (admittedly out of the operative’s control, once the template has been cast, but by the same token making the image technique highly reproducible – imprinting as opposed to painting or other artwork.\nAnd in any case, these characteristics are very different from those observed on the Shroud. \nYes, but we are not comparing like with like. Your image was probably a few hours old before being photographed. The Shroud’s image is centuries old. One has had negligible wear and tear. The other has probably had extensive wear and tear. We know from STURP’s work with sticky tape that the (surviving) image fibres are weaker  and more prone to breakage than non-image areas (a major and much-neglected observation). It is hardly surprising that the Shroud would have lost much of its image by now if the latter were, as I believe, a scorch, simply via random breakage and detachment of the more scorched, more brittle fibres. That explains why the modern Shroud image is now so indistinct. It was not always that way. It would not have been the crowd-puller if that had been the case (scores of people occasionally died in the crush to see it, even glimpsed from a distance).\n“Looking carefully at the slightest King George VI horse brass picture (on the right), I can predict what follows:\nWith a microscope:\n1) In the darkest parts (nose, hear, crown etc.) one will find all the characteristics of the “scorch” as described in my paper;\n2) in the lightly scorched areas, one will find all the characteristics of the “light scorch” as described in my paper\n3) In the white areas, one will find..no color (contrary to the shroud) or perhaps some fibers described as “very light scorch” in my paper.”\nYes, my image is a model scorch, and so is yours, so there are no grounds for thinking there will be a major qualitative differences between yours and mine at the microscopic level. I have never questioned the veracity of your images of the scorches under the microscope. Why should I?  Mine differ little from yours. Why should they? A scorch is a scorch.  The key question is how BOTH our scorch images compare with the Shroud.\n“To summarize, with a “good” template, one will find all the characteristics I found with my “bad template” but on a single image. \nMeaning what precisely?\n“I challenge CB to prove that I am wrong but now with photographs at fabric and thread level.”\nYou have ducked (here) out of the major question – why you have rejected scorching, based on model scorches v the Shroud.\nI can easily summmarise my position: at the gross (macroscopic) level the Shroud image has many of the characteristics of a scorch, as STURP members noted. At the microscopic level there may be differences, but whether they are the result of the image being something other than a scorch or whether they represent the effect of ageing and degradation is a moot point.  You have done nothing to throw light on that question. What one cannot do is dismiss scorching without considering ageing differences. (It is possible that with time (no pun intended) ageing differences can also modelled after a fashion, e.g. with accelerated ageing, induced by chemical agents, and/or accelerated mechanical wear and tear.\nI shall write a third instalment, commenting on the organization of Thibault’s pdf, with its partisan comment not just in the Conclusions, but from the very start, in the Introduction no less, and even intruding into so-called Results. It’s not a top priority for me – having published a detailed rebuttal of Thibaults paper back in October/November and having been totally ignored all these weeks.  It’s now Thibault’s turn to wait – I have other interests to pursue (see current posting on that alleged Anglo-Saxon conquest) and to be honest am not hugely enamoured of Thibault’s kind of “science”. It lacks objectivity. Science without objectivity tends to morph imperceptibly into pseudo-science, as is painfully apparent to at least one retired scientist (me), reading that pdf of his.\n","date":"January 27, 2013 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1793","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"Hooray, a response at last to points made back in October/November. Better late than never.\nI propose to deal with them in a series of bite-size instalments. Here’s the first:\nThibault’s pdf: Page 3/24\n“The goal was to try to answer to the following question: How could a forger get the shading necessary to obtain an image?”  \n(Note: he says “shading”, not microscopical characteristics)\n“It is clear that the parameters are: the temperature of the hot bas-relief, the contact time and the contact “intensity”. \nYes, the contact intensity, which depends among other things on the angle of contact. There are only two angles of contact with Thibault’s template – 0 degrees (the two facing planes) and 90 degrees (the shallow ledge between the two planes). There is nothing between those two extremes to give the subtle bas relief effect from what a physicist might describe as resolved force/pressure vectors – one that I was as such pains to describe in my reply, using home-made graphics in MS Paint to ensure that my point was not lost. \n\nImage from part 1 (October 23) of last year’s 3 part response to Thibault.\nClearly my point was lost, in spite of all my best efforts.\n“What is interesting here is that this can be obtained naturally by using a bas-relief.”\nYes!\n“If the forger used a uniformly heated bas-relief and applied a linen on it, it is possible to have a\ncontact everywhere (necessary condition). Naturally, the contact in the flat areas or small\ndepressions of the bas-relief would be light while the contact with higher areas (like the nose)\nwould be more intense.”\nYes, but it’s not only height differences  above a reference plane that one has to consider with a bas relief.  It’s the angle that each point on the template makes with the linen, which can take any value between 0 and 90 degrees.  0 degrees means “square on”, maximum pressure. 90 degrees means tangential to the linen, in contact perhaps, merely brushing so to speak,  so virtually no application pressure. That’s a major blind spot being revealed here.\n“This last experiment shows how difficult it is to manage the temperature to obtain something\nresembling the TS image shading. On the image on the right, the lateral bands have the right yellow…”\nWe’re only on page 5, and here we see the author attempting to demolish the validity of the scorch model. He does not have a proper bas relief with rounded contours presenting a full range of contact angles to produce a subtle image with gradations of intensity and contrast, yet here he is making invidious comparisons with the TS images which he has not even presented at this stage (they appear much later in the pdf, ie. the Mark Evans micrographs on page 15-17). \nPage 6: “This problem of contrast has already been discovered by Jackson….”  \nHe is now looking to another author to support his unsupported case, based on an inappropriate template. This is the kind of thing one would expect to find in Discussion, not inserted into Results, Page 6 of a 24 page paper no less. This is  clear impatience on Thibault’s part to  start his summing up and dismissal of scorching.  This is why I say his paper is agenda-driven. Scientists evaluate all the evidence in their results before arriving at a conclusion: they don’t go proselytising or even hinting at conclusions until the …  Conclusions section. Premature conclusions have no place in a Results section. They place a huge question mark over the author’s objectivity.\n“This high intensity of shading at contact points was necessary in order for the more distant parts of the bas-relief to record their patterns on the cloth”\nWith a proper dome-shaped bas relief, it is not necessary to rely on heat conduction for the less superficial parts of the template to make contact. The cloth drapes around the contours allowing contact in most places. The only places not make contact would be narrow and/or deep grooves (“crevices”) where the cloth bridges the gap. But there are plenty of examples on the TS where there appears to be bridging, and I don’t just mean the gaps between fingers but that sizeable  non-image-bearing area of abdomen around the crossed hands. Note that I am referring to macroscopic aspects that everyone is familiar with. Microscopic characteristics can wait till later.\nReminder from earlier (Page 6): “This problem of contrast has already been discovered by Jackson”\nThere is NO self-evident problem of contrast. Any problem,  if it exists, is likely to be due to use of a crude template without a dome shape and gentle rounded contours (we’ll address microscopic aspects later).\nSo far I have addressed the issue raised at the start, namely whether a forger could get the shading necessary for the image. One should address this issue first,  and separately, before microscopical details. Repeat: we are discussing the macroscopic shading and contrast. There is no need to introduce microscopical criteria at this stage. They can wait.\nThibault needs to repeat his experiments with a proper template, and review his opinions re shading and contrast. He should keep his microscope in the cupboard for now – one thing at a time.\nI’ll add another instalment tomorrow, or Monday at the latest.

Thanks.\nReply: with pleasure Adrie. Here it is (I’ll read and, if need be, comment later):\nHere’s a comment to FAQ 15 on first-century features, and FAQ 13 on starch evidence:\nSTARCH\nBoth Kohlbeck and Rogers found starch in an image area and a non-image area. They both got a positive standard starch test (deep red) from non-image fibers. These fibers were from 14 Raes threads – not C14 threads –, which Rogers got from Gonella in 1979 (A Chemist’s Perspective, p. 64), and which I assume authentic and not part of a repair). Kohlbeck’s photo slide #42 shows that all ca. 15 fibers in view are completely red-brown; better visible on the third slide on this HSG-page (HSG password request form). Also McCrone and Adler independently reported the presence of starch on the Shroud. For details see Internal Selvedge, 2.2 and 4.2.1. Rogers found that the starch was insoluble in concentrated HCl = hydrochloric acid and that the coating completely surrounded all surface fibers of his Raes sample and even was sometimes inside the fiber, as if wiped on as a viscous paste (Scientific Method, p. 17-20, cf. my comment of Jan 3 and the SEM fiber cross sections in Brown, Microscopical Investigation, p. 7-8, and, if you like, Baldan’s SEM photos of Shroud fibers furnished by Riggi di Numana on Fanti’s homepage). So, the starch indeed did not have the shape of an uneven exsiccation layer or of a trace contamination. However, the use of a “warp sizing paste” of starch during weaving is not specific for the first century, for it is still used today (products 2-1 and 2-2). \nSAPONINS\nSaponins from Saponaria (soap-weed) is more specific for ancient technology. For some reason, Rogers didn’t search for saponins (the washing molecules) but only for certain hydrolysis  products of Saponaria saponins: reducing pentose sugars. He didn’t find them on non-image-non-scorch fibers (A Chemist’s Perspective, p. 40). Schwalbe&Rogers reported that saponins were not found by PMS (Physical and Chemical, p. 14), but PMS was not really done on controls – the only control was a Raes sample (PMS-paper, p. 2) which released early furfural, the Raes corner being a scorch area ( Internal Selvedge, 2.5.1.). On image or scorch fibers the saponins could or would have been broken down by image formation or scorching. So, in fact, we don’t know whether there are saponins on the background of the Shroud.\nSEAM AND STITCHING\nTechnique\n“Dr. Flury-Lemberg found the cloth’s finishing, at its hems, and in the joining seam to have been done using an unusual type of stitching very nearly invisible on one side, and as such closely resembling that of ancient Jewish textiles as found at Masada, the Jewish palace-fortress that was overthrown by the Romans in AD 73, never to be occupied again” (BSTS-newsletter 51). In the Proceedings of the 2000 Turin symposium, Flury-Lemberg shows a drawing of the type of seam (visible in Soons’ presentation, slide 11), and calls it ‘seam type Masada’: “Abb. 3 a Zeichnung: Nahttyp Masada” (Proceedings, p. 34). It might be described as a kind of rolled seam, secured with two lines of tiny overcast stitches. It is interesting that the ancient Egyptians specifically used two lines of overcast stitches to sew on a fringeless braid along an edge of a garment:\n “Only a limited range of structural details, such as seams and hems, were used in ancient Egypt. The most common of these were: simple hems, rolled and whipped hems, simple (open) seams, and lap-over seams. Other seams known from the Dynastic period include a form of run-and-fell seam and overcast seams (see Fig. 11.11), but these were rarely used on items of clothing. When a braid was added to a garment, one of several techniques was used, depending on the nature of the braid and the place where it was to be attached. If it was a fringed braid placed at the lower edge of a garment, it would normally be secured with one line of overcast stitching (e.g. Carter no. 367i; Cairo JE 62625). On the other hand, two lines of overcast stitching were used to sew on fringeless braids, whether along an edge of a garment or down the middle” (Ancient Egypt materials and technology, p. 282-283). \nThe type of seam for the Egyptian fringeless braids is not described or depicted, nor is the Masada-type seam among the depicted seams (Fig. 11.11, p. 283). The Egyptian mending stitches – whipped stitch and running stitch (p. 283) – are different from the non-whipped overcast stitches of the TS seam. Note that the cloth of the Egyptian braids were woven differently from the garment they were sewn on to, as they were meant to be clearly visible decorative elements ( p. 276, figure 11.6).\nMoment and reason of seam application\nX-ray photography showed “the absence of any evidence of any frayed thread ends along either side of the seam image”  and a “detailed thread matching” across the seam (Adler&Whanger, Concerning the Side Strip, with X-ray photos). Also Miller&Pellicori reported the near perfect match in UV, backlight and X-ray (Ultraviolet Photography, p. 85). Flury said that the seam was applied before the lateral hems were, and both were stitched by the same professional hand probably in a single operation (Proceedings 2000, p. 24). Also, the stichting was done from the backside of the cloth (the weft side, where also the hems are), in such way that on the front side the stitches are hardly visible and the seam is invisibly flat (p. 24-25). Moreover, the seam was already planned before weaving, for it is in an internally woven-in selvedge of warp threads that have spun-in cotton (Internal Selvedge, 2.1). The seam thus would have been made at manufacture. It wouldn’t have been a mending, or a rejoining of the two outer parts of the cloth from which an inner third strip had been removed, or even the adding of a decorative braid: it was merely done to have been done. This deliberate extraordinary procedure fits with the strict observance of the religious law of Nu 15,38, which in the Bible that was generally used in first-century Judea literally read that a margin (‘kraspeda’) had to be added to every robe (Nu 15,38 LXX). The first-century Gospel of Matthew says it was custom for Pharisees to “enlarge the borders (‘kraspeda’) of their garments” (Mt 23,5 KJV and WH).\nONE TIME DYE\nAs a yellow plant dye was found in the starch/starch gum coating (Scientific Method, p. 17-20), and Madder lake particles on the main Shroud (Internal Selvedge, 2.3 and 2.4), it is probable that the Shroud was starched, washed, and then dyed as cloth, without completely removing the starch first. The starch would protect the cloth from wear and tear, but it would not allow warm laundering the dirty cloth without removing the starch and dye together at once. Bleaching or laundering was not allowed for Jewish temple garments – they would simply be cut into wicks for the temple’s oil lamps (Mishneh Torah, Kli Hamikdasch 8, Halacha 4-5) – and the temple was destroyed in 70 AD.\nPETALON\n3D displays of the TS show a flat, more or less oval object beneath the chin, with protuberant marks that can be read as the Hebrew characters ayin-aleph-nun, almost similar to l  X  Y in Times New Roman characters (cf. the 1978 photo 210×250 pixels and its 3D display with isolines showing the flatness and the three protuberent characters). The object may be a ‘petalon’ (Ex 28,36 LXX): the distinctive petal-shaped golden ornament of the Jewish high priest (see third-century AD mural) and probably all members of the ruling Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin, consisting of 71 members. The characters l X Y may be the Hebrew numerals 7 and 1 and letter N, an abbreviation of “71 Nesiim” = 71 rulers. First-century historian Josephus said the petalon still existed in the first century (Jewish Antiquities 3,7,6 and 8,3,8). The Jerusalem Gemara (a 350-400 AD commentary on the Mishnah, a 220 AD written version of oral traditions dating from Pharisaic times = 536 BCE – 70 AD) said it was two fingers broad and reached from ear to ear and had protuberant letters (book Kli Hamikdash 9,1-2). Epiphanius said it was worn by James the Just, brother of Jesus (Panarion 29,4,4, p. 125), and Polycrates, stressing the Jewish origin of the Christian Passover date by referring to the evangelist John’s Jewish authority, said in 189-199 AD that the petalon was worn by the priest John the evangelist (Eusebius, Church History 3,31,3), apparently with a different inscription than the two words reserved for the liturgical high priest. The petalon with three letters would be exclusively first-century (6-70 AD), as before 6 AD the petalon was still only worn by the king and the high priest (Epiphanius, Panarion 29,3,3-6 p.124) and after 6 AD the Jews didn’t have a king anymore and the high priest’s liturgical petalon was kept locked up by the Romans (Jew. Antiq. 15,11,4 ad 18,4,3). After 70 AD Jerusalem was devastated by the Romans and there wasn’t a temple or Sanhedrin that ruled Judea anymore.\nA petalon on the Shroud would strongly associate it with Jesus, for no other crucifixion victim is known to have been buried in the presence of one, let alone two or three members of the Sanhedrin: Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and John the evangelist. Only John – not Peter – believed Jesus had risen because he saw the shroud (his own temple mantle) rolled up and placed at the head end of the stone bench of the tomb, just as a priest’s temple mantle was always rolled up and placed at the head end of the stone bench in the dormitory of the temple (see my articles The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud as characteristics of John Mark’s temple mantle and John Mark – Author of the Gospel of John with Jesus’ mother).\n","date":"January 21, 2013 at 3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1759","author":"Adrie","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"I forgot to stress that the seam rejoins two sections cut from the same cloth (Flury, Proceedings Turin 2000, p. 24 and fig. 3 a, drawing and photo of open TS seam, of which the drawing is also in Soons’ presentation, slide 11).

It’s not the existence of corona discharges I question. It’s the claim that they created an image some 2000 years ago on the length of linen currently residing in Turin Cathedral. \nThe TS image has at least some of the major characteristics of a thermal imprint, as though produced by direct contact with a hot solid template. A thermal imprint off a bas relief template could account for the negative light/dark reversal.  As for the ‘encoded’ 3D, that could be nothing more than applying software that converts image density to height on a 3rd dimension. – hardly rocket science (even if was NASA that supplied the original software!).\n Granted, there are some unexplained differences re fluorescence or lack thereof between the Shroud image and its own scorch marks from that fire, the so-called “poker holes” etc (1532 provenance and earlier). But the latter were not scorches produced under known laboratory conditions, and in any case the precise chemical nature of the fluorescent species on the Shroud is unknown. \nThe extreme superficiality of the Shroud image (200-600nm?) is interesting, but I have little doubt that some of the faint scorches that one can produce on linen, assuming one’s parents did not christen one Paolo Di Lazzaro, are also superficial (where’s the evidence to the contrary, not counting ENSA scientists working on the TS as a side-line?).\nFeel free to raise extra points re Rogers FAQ.

Once he gets his confirmation that the Shroud really is 2000 or so years old, then mainstream science bods like myself might be forced to give a second or two for considering some of the off-the-wall claims, corona discharges, seismic activity, radon etc etc.\nI’m still in the process of tidying up my responses to those FAQs, Adrie, and will probably repost in standard format.\n","date":"January 10, 2013 at 2:05 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1687","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"As a response I invite you to take a look at this photo of a corona discharge or at fig. 3 of the CD-paper (p. 5). They show deflecting streamers. The streamers are initiated by electrons, hitting air molecules/atoms, knocking out a free electron and leaving a positively charged ion behind. The positive ion and the negative electrons will subsequently preferrably move along the electric field line at the point of collision, but in opposite directions. When somewhere on its pathway one of the new free and electrostatically accelerated electrons collides with another air molecule, this molecule will in its turn ionise and produce a new free electron and ion, which start a new path way, in the direction of the field line at the point of this second collision. Then, somewhere on this new pathway a next collision will occur to the next air molecule, and so on. The glow of the corona is caused by electrons recombining with positive ions to form neutral atoms, which are not accelerated by the electric field (Mechanism of corona discharge).\nThe streamer is not a long continuous flow of molecules, but a chain of short pathways of separating and recombining ions and electrons along the local electric field line. The air pressure effects are minimal and wavelike: a corona discharge produces accoustic emissions.\nYour responses to Rogers’ FAQ-paper are thorough and in a way necessary, Colin. Nevertheless, I have a few more points I have to address, among which one about first century Jewish provenance.\n","date":"January 10, 2013 at 4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1691","author":"Adrie","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"I’m sorry, it’s fig. 3 of Fanti’s second CD-paper of 2008.\n","date":"January 10, 2013 at 4:27 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1692","author":"Adrie","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"Hello Colin, here’s a comment on FAQ 17 point 3 on electromagnetic radiation vs corona discharges:\nIn an electrostatic field the locations of preferred discharge are the most protruding and pointed places: a lightning bolt will rather strike a bell tower than a house standing beside it. “A discharge may exist in the vicinity of a sharp point, or other place with a small radius of curvature where the electric field is increased significantly from its average value” (Dr. Calvert on electrical discharges). The electrostatic field lines are not straight but curved lines that bend to the most protruding, most pointed points, also if these are threads or even fibers that are just slightly more protruding than others (see again fig. 5 p.7 of CD-paper). The geometry of the cloth surface determines the distribution of the “surface electrostatic stress (surface electric field intensity)” (CD-paper p. 4, points 3, 4 and 6) and therefore determines the distribution of the filamentary streamers of electric charge toward the cloth. Electrostatic field lines and discharge streamers are not the same as electromagnetic radiation that ‘fires’ along straight lines. Discharge streamers don’t penetrate the cloth either. In the CD model and experiments “The glow-CD layer is interrupted by the presence of the TS and re-starts on the outer surface of the TS” (CD-paper p. 9). Any discharge that hit the reverse of the Shroud would have come from the reverse side, from the outside of the doubled Shroud.\nIn a corona discharge, the accompanying UV luminescence is generated inside the streamer, also where it hits the cloth: it would not radiate from the body itself. A CD is also accompanied by heat and “aggressive chemical by-products” (CD-paper p. 18-19).\n","date":"January 10, 2013 at 1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1686","author":"Adrie","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"I don’t think I have a working hypothesis at the moment, but feel that the rejection of non-working hypotheses might help, whether they are mine or someone else’s. The importance of it is simply that it occurs at all. Is fluorescence a feature of all old linen? Has anybody asked a museum? If not, then how did it occur? I thought it might be in association with the body image, but it seems to be spread too widely over the cloth. Then I thought it might have been due some anointment, as the M&P images seemed to show it concentrated in the middle of the cloth – however, as I now see that the top, bottom and left edges of every photo are dark (not just the famous corner where the C14 came from) I think the fluorescence may cover the whole cloth after all, and the fringe darkness is an artefact of the photography. So is it a common feature of 1st century middle eastern or 14th century French cloth? Has anybody checked? If not, then the unusual preparation of the cloth may be significant. M&P say that they can replicate the background fluorescence with heat (which they don’t believe happened), but they do not demonstrate that it can be achieved by ‘aging’ (whatever that means). Since the shroud has spent most of its life rolled up, I would expect some sort of banding, darker on the outside and lighter in the middle, if light, heat, oxygen or other gas were responsible for ‘aging’ the shroud over hundreds of years. If it was used as the famous mandylion, then there should be a stripe across the face, if as a Byzantine altarcloth (folded in four as per Lirey holes) then one quarter might look more ‘aged’ than the other three, and so on. None of this seems to be the case.\n","date":"January 7, 2013 at 10:37 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1660","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"Dear Hugh,\nWhy is the question of the background fluorescence so important ?\nWhat is you hypothesis to explain it ?\nBest regards.\nThibault.\n","date":"January 7, 2013 at 9:05 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1659","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"Feel free. The evidence is available. Pellicori and Miller distinguish very clearly between the 1532 scorches (which fluoresce red – but check out the enhanced photo from ohioshroudconference) and the Lirey poker holes, which don’t. They attribute this to the Lirey holes being more burnt than scorched. However they also find a couple of ‘donut-shaped’ areas which ‘appear to be scorches’ although they are ‘brightly fluorescing yellow-green.’ In laboratory tests, they found that “scorches emit a bright greenish-yellow fluorescence if produced in air and reddish if produced under conditions of limited available oxygen.” It is not clear to me if this means that they found that the brown scorches in visible light (darker than the background) were yellow in UV, lighter than the background.

However, to conclude that this observation precludes a scorch is, I think incorrect. My scorching experiments on linen invariably result in something very similar – a dark scorch surrounded by “background” fluorescence. On the shroud, this background fluorescence extends well beyond the image, so was probably produced separately, but not necessarily by a different mechanism. Pellicori and Miller suggest that it is due to aging, but admit that exactly the same effect can be achieved using heat. What’s more, their photographs show the background fluorescence decreasing at the edges of their photos, and especially at the corners of the cloth, which may suggest that it is not as uniform as would be expected if the whole cloth had been similarly treated. (It may also suggest that the UV light was spotlighted in the middle and didn’t reach the edges, but they don’t mention that possibility. There is a whole subsection of the literature about what this ‘edge-decrease’ might mean regarding the C14 sample, but it might not really be there at all!)\nThey also observe that the big scorches on the shroud (but not the minor ones) actually fluoresce themselves, and there is a massively enhanced photo (ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p07.pdf) which does show red fluorescence from the darkest parts of the 1532 burn marks. The rest of the discolouration, image, blood or scorch, does not fluoresce, although there is a bright halo around the outer edge of the spear-wound. I still find this red fluorescence very odd, and wonder if it is not simply the reflection of the red visible light shining off the wholly (shiny?) carbonised areas.\n","date":"January 7, 2013 at 9:03 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","id":"comment-1653","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres).","post":"Surely it’s the background only that glows, Hugh, with that fluorescence being quenched by the body image?
