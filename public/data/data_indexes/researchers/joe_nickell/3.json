Talk about having a swelled head lol, this guy thinks he’s God’s gift to this planet without actually believing in a God. To prove my point, of his “swelledness”, every point he makes in the above comment against the Shroud’s authenticity; Even I, a simpleton, non scholar type, can prove everyone of his points wrong and possibly in doing so, show his determination to ridicule without proper study!…..It’s a mystery how people believe this guy…He should have stuck to being a magician, or maybe he still is, as he seems to be able to convert people to his notions of utter nonsence.\nR\n\n","date":"December 28, 2011 at 5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/28/put-another-nickell-in-in-the-nickelodeon-2/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6245","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Put another Nickell in . . .

Anyone who studys the facts will undoubtably realize what the true situation was; D’Arcis was desperate for money, his chapel was falling apart, just a few miles away we have the Shroud being visited by many and making money hand and foot. He was grasping at straws, and yet there is no proof his papers where even sent to the reigning Pope at the time and no record in the Vatican libraries of such correspondence….It was a desperate act by a desperate soul.\nR\n\n","date":"December 31, 2011 at 5:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/28/put-another-nickell-in-in-the-nickelodeon-2/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6382","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Put another Nickell in . . . In the nickelodeon","post":"The letter exchange was made between D’Arcy and the Anti-Pope of Avignon Clément VII (I dont think he was related to me directly !!!).  There was A LOT of politics involved in this.  The pope was a relative of the widow of Geoffroy de Charny !  And it’s pretty clear that, like you said, the Bishop D’Arcy was outraged by the popularity of the public showing of the Shroud in Lirey (not far from Troyes, in France, where the Bishop was).  In the end, the reality is that the pope maintain the right for public showing, but at the same time, surely to calm the Bishop, he ordered that, at every public showing, the cleargy mens in charge of the showing would clearly state that it was just a representation of the true Shroud of Christ.  When you read between the lines, it was a way for the pope to calm the war of words that was going on between Troyes and Lirey and that doesn’t prove one bit that the pope really believed the accusations of D’Arcy.  In fact, we can think that if the pope would have really trust D’Arcy’s accusations, he would have simply stoped the public showing of the relic, period.\n\n","date":"January 2, 2012 at 12:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/28/put-another-nickell-in-in-the-nickelodeon-2/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6446","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
