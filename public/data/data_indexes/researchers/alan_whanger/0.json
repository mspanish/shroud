Whanger tried to cover too much ground, brought up a lot of dubious arguments (e.g., the appeal to alleged images of coins, crowns of thorns, etc.), and often wasn’t responsive enough to the questions he was being asked. I was glad, though, that Whanger brought up the dating tests done by Giulio Fanti and his colleagues. But he brought it up too late for it get much discussion. Any mention of the 1988 test should be accompanied by mention of things like the 1982 and Fanti tests and Ray Rogers’ vanillin argument. And Hugh should have mentioned how closely the 1988 test coincides with the Shroud’s first explicit appearance in the historical record, which I don’t think he did. I wish all of that had been laid out, followed by a discussion of how to best make sense of the totality of those dating methods. The 1988 test gets too much isolated attention. It’s superior to the other dating efforts in some important ways, but the other ones have some significance, especially cumulatively.\nOne of the problems with programs like this one is that they tend to spend too much time reinventing the wheel. Instead of giving so much attention to introductory issues and matters of such common knowledge, most of the time should be spent breaking new ground or discussing issues that tend to receive much less attention than others. There was some of that during the program (mostly because of Hugh’s efforts), but not enough. More of the program should have been spent discussing Fanti’s tests, Charles Freeman’s arguments, and other issues of a newer and less common nature.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2015 at 10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-195279","author":"Jason Engwer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"I understand your position, Jason, but that was not really the point of the program, which was more of an introduction to the controversies surrounding the Shroud than a detailed analysis of them.

All the experiments that have attempted to reproduce the Shroud image copies produced by chemical-physical characteristics very different from those of the original… and Prof. Barberis concluded:\n “In short, the process that caused the formation of the image remains unknown”\nThis is what we have always heard…\nAlthough there are systems of investigation which have become refined [For example: I have pointed out the possibility of using the CFM (= Chemical Force Microscopy) and AFM-Raman techniques…], I certainly don’t pretend to reveal exactly how it was formed the Shroud (ie: what was the exact process of the formation of the Imprint), what interested me in 1998, and the main point for which I am still very interested, is the problem of the dating of the Shroud.\nWe can see ourselves the strange fact: after the intervention of Freeman (and its stress on the stories “Quem Queritis” …) and after the publication of this interesting book by Andrea Nicolotti, the assumptions on the date of origin of the Shroud now are made to converge to the Middle Ages because of a dating occurred on one corner of the Ancient Sheet …\n One angle can deny everything else we know?\n But is it a serious approach to the relic behave this way? I do not think so.\nThe claim to date the Shroud talking about\nthe transition from the Quem Queritis ceremony\nto the first claims by the de Charny family …\nI think it is a bit too.\nBut Freeman does not seem to have these claims (if I am not mistaken),\nhe merely states the historical problems, the same approach is taken by Nicolotti.\nSo my proposal (ie: the use of advanced microscopies,\nin order to determine a credible historical range\nabout the textile material) wants to be an answer\nalso to these new claims (which I can not believe).\nI see that I am another time a bit vague (about the measurements for\ncellulosic DP using the AFM techniques.

Curiously, in view of the eminence of the translation you used, none of these words commonly meant strips of cloth. Linteum, in particular, is used to mean the towel that Jesus dried the disciples’ feet with, and also the huge sheet that descends from the heavens in Revelation. It is true that ὀθόνια is used to mean bandages, which supports the idea of strips, but then it also means a sail, which doesn’t.\nWhen you have a moment, you might like to see what words the other evangelists used in the same context.

Based on that, and the ideological premise that Jesus couldn’t predict the fall of Jerusalem (because Jesus cannot be God himself) the scholars claimed that the Gospels were written post 70.\nBut this is purely nonsensical argument. The prophecy of destruction of the Temple is clearly stated for example in the Old Testament Book of Daniel (Dn 9:26 NIV  After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary.

On the whole, I am inclined to believe that the Shroud is not the authentic burial cloth of Jesus on various grounds, but biblical exegesis isn’t one of them. However, I don’t like flawed arguments wherever they occur, and although your convictions regarding the Shroud are no doubt sincere, they are based on shaky ground.\n“To claim that the Shroud cannot be accommodated within the Gospel texts is to deny the word of God.” Yes. The gospels describe the various cloths left in the tomb in various ways, and those ways do not exclude the Shroud. To claim that they do is to misread the gospels. This appears to be exactly what you are doing.\n“How can you claim the shroud as being accommodated by the word of God? What scriptures do you cite?” In my comments above I actually cited the gospel of John, which you yourself chose as an advocate against the Shroud, and demonstrated that it does not deny the possibility that Jesus was covered with a sheet.\n“You are saying that Jesus was not wrapped with strips of cloth but simply covered with a sheet,” Not at all. The gospel of John would support Jesus being wrapped either in strips of cloth or a sheet. Neither is precluded by the words of St John.\n“Why I this so important to you?” It is not important to me at all, It was a response to your airy denial of the Shroud solely on biblical grounds, which is unjustified. \n“Is your belief in the shroud the only source of belief in Jesus you have?” Not at all; quite the reverse. My belief in Jesus has nothing to do with this blog, but for what it’s worth, it does not rest on the authenticity or not of the Shroud.\n“Are you concerned that if the shroud were not authentic then you would no longer believe in Jesus?” Not at all. As a matter of fact I don’t think the Shroud is authentic. It does not affect my beliefs at all.\n“I am familiar with the Word of God and I know what it means.” Well no, you’re not, as we have seen. You are familiar with an English translation of the word of God, which is good enough in most cases, but if you want to demonstrate a specific and rather precise meaning, then you need to explore a little deeper. Your simplistic assertion: “These verses describe the fact that Jesus had a separate cloth wrapped around his head, again, not one complete sheet.” and the question:  “Does not even the Pope read the Bible?” were a little arrogant, if I may say so.\n\n","date":"April 19, 2015 at 11:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-196831","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"My apologies, I thought you were a believer in Christ Jesus and were deceived regarding the shroud.

You appear to have read one translation of one Gospel, and are clinging to that as a way of discrediting the authenticity of the Shroud. Go back to your bible and this time read what the evangelists (all of them) actually said. Matthew, Mark and Luke all use the word sindon to describe the sheet which covered Jesus. Luke uses othonia as well, for the same thing. Luke uses the word keiriais to describe the swaddlng clothes of the infant Jesus. John also uses the word keiriais, to describe the burial wrappings of Lazarus, but not for the burial wrappings of Jesus, which he calls othonia.\nKeiria  are thin bands of cloth – such as for swaddling clothes\nOthonia are wide bands of cloth – such as for stitching together to make sails\nA Sindon is a sheet\nIn some circumstances – as used by Luke – othonion and sindon can be synonyms.\nHad you made any attempt to understand the Gospels as a group, you would understand that the Shroud is certainly not precluded, although it is also not positively confirmed.

Using standard way of dating text (which, strangely is not applied to the New Testament by the most “scholars” contrary to other classical texts) this firmly dates Acts to 62 AD (had they not been part of the Bible, no scholar would ever question this dating).\nNow to the Gospels. As we know that the Acts were written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke, as a second volume, we know that Gospel of Luke must have been written before Acts, perhaps about 60 AD. As the Gospel of Luke seems dependent on Gospel of Mark, it must have been written earlier, perhaps in the 50s or even 40s. As to the Matthew, as it is also dependent on Mark, but not directly dependent on Luke, it must have been written parallelly to the latter, circa 60 AD.  The aramaic prototype of Matthew, mentioned by several Church Fathers may be earlier, perhaps dating to the 40s. \nAs for John, he must have written after the death of Peter (64-67 AD) -but there are no direct indications about destruction of the Jerusalem, so it is likely to be written in 67-70 AD.

There are several arguments against it, but I shall attempt to confine my comments to a few brief remarks.  \nIt seems clear enough that Mark was the first of the gospels to be set down fairly close to its present form, although it seems the final original chapter may been lost and replaced by a later addition.  Occasionally some have argued for a Matthean priority, but it seldom withstands scrutiny.  Examining the common material in Matthew Mark & Luke, one finds a closer affinity between Matthew & Mark, and between Luke & Mark, than between Matthew and Luke, and this therefore argues for Marcan priority.   There is additional common material found in Matthew and Luke, not found in Mark, and this has argued for an additional separate Q source.  All four gospels closely follow the Marcan narrative of the passion death and resurrection, with only minor changes of some details, according to the specific author’s proclamation intent.\nInterestingly there is a concluding literary discrepancy between Matthew/Mark and Luke.  Thus Matthew’s narrative begins at Bethlehem, (the Nazarene origins of Mary and Joseph seem unknown to him), and following Mark’s cue, the apostles are instructed to go to Galilee where Jesus will meet them there.  Luke on the other hand knows of the Nazareth origins of the family, and has his own separate nativity narrative with a journey to Bethlehem.  However Luke concludes his gospel by having the apostles remaining in Jerusalem.  In Acts, Luke continues with his Jerusalem location, (literary continuity), the first half of the work being devoted to the Jerusalem church, and the second half on Paul’s mission to the gentiles.  It concludes with Paul going to Rome, the centre of the empire, the centre of the world.  Thus Luke’s mise-en-scene traverse is Nazareth – Jerusalem – Rome!  The church is now “global”, has “arrived” and this makes for a satisfying conclusion.  Luke is not interested in recording the death of either of his leading characters Paul or Peter, it is not part of his “proclamation” and its omission is a weak argument for assigning either Acts or Luke a prior date.  \nTurning now to the Pauline epistles, it is evident that Paul devotes much focus to the tensions between the Jewish origin of the apostles and his own “subversively regarded” mission to the gentiles.  The tensions between himself and Peter are recorded.  Luke, companion of Paul, also devotes some attention to it in the Acts, such as at the Council in Jerusalem, and elsewhere.  Luke has Peter seeing a large sheet descending from heaven with many “unclean” animals who he is instructed to eat, a partial resolution of this tension.  \nHowever this tension is not reflected in the gospel accounts.  The gentile church is fully established, Matthew’s gospel is clearly directed to a gentile community, probably Syrian, but perhaps not necessarily Antioch.  His gospel is used in the Syrian church.  We do not see the Jewish-Gentile contentions evident in the Pauline epistles, nor in Luke’s Acts.  The contentions are now in the past, and the church is essentially gentile.  As early has his nativity account Matthew even has gentile wise men visit the infant in the manger.  Contrast this with Luke’s Jewish shepherd visitors.  It is reflected even in Matthew’s concluding discourse where the apostles are instructed to preach the gospel “to all nations”.  I think all these are strong arguments for a relatively late compilation of the gospels. \nThe actions and sayings of Jesus would have given rise to many oral traditions, and typical of such societies would soon have acquired a set form to be learned by rote by those trained to proclaim them.  They would have soon been committed to writing.  The distinctive pericope form of nearly all of the gospel narratives, clearly indicate that this would have been the case.  Most of them are terse, brief episodic accounts of individual separate incidents, and are not in the form of a fully integrated continuous narrative.  The various authors of the gospels would have assembled their sources, giving them a form and using them to express their own individual particular proclamation intent.  Their integrity can be deduced by the relative consistency of the four separate accounts, and reliance on a social tradition well used to critical appraisal of formal oral recitation by rote.   This last cannot be over-emphasised, but is still evident in other present primal pre-literate societies.  It is not necessary to assert an earlier compilation into their present final form.\n\n","date":"April 20, 2015 at 4:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-196969","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"Hello Dave.\nMostly agree, but:\nThus Luke’s mise-en-scene traverse is Nazareth – Jerusalem – Rome!

One does not have to resort to anti-christian conspiracies to do so.  I use several sources, one of them for instance is John Bowden former editor and managing director of the SCM Press, London, and he is hardly likely to be anti-christian in sentiment.  An article by Bowden I have before me, gives a date of authorship of Acts as “probably between 85 and 95 AD”, likely towards the end of Luke’s life.  \nThere are several significant omissions in Acts, so that of the deaths of Peter & Paul is hardly noteworthy.  Apart from chapters 1 & 2, we hear nothing of what happened to most of the original apostles, even though there are many other traditions concerning them.  We hear nothing of the Alexandrian church although it was clearly very healthy and significant, and there are only occasional references to the church in Antioch, although it became a principal early centre of christian scholarship.  \nNevertheless the tensions between the Jewish and Gentile wings of the early church are sufficiently memorable for Luke to draw attention to them in Acts, and are frequently evident in Paul.  A further example of this tension might be seen in Luke’s mentioning the neglect of Hellenistic widows and orphans, necessitating the appointment of gentile deacons, as it seems the Jewish members were still not prepared to minister to them.  So this attitude held sway for quite some time.  \nWhen we come to the gospels, all of this seems very much in the past.  Thus it is the specifically Jewish rejection of Christ which is at fault, whereas there seems to be an attempt to attenuate the fault of the gentile Roman authorities.  Thus ‘Pilate knows that it out of jealousy that the chief priests had delivered Jesus and he seeks to free him’, possibly to be seen as the author’s attempt to minimise the true responsibility of imperial authority in the final condemnation, and to excuse it by placing the blame on the Jewish authorities.   \nFurther evidence is suggested in the destruction of the temple, omitted in earlier Mark, but which seems to have already happened “as prophesied” in the other three gospels, although perhaps it might not have been so difficult to foresee.  \nWith the expectation of an early Parousia, little point in committing the account to writing would be seen, as everything was soon to come to an end.  When this didn’t happen and as the first witnesses passed on, this perception would clearly change, and the need for leaving a written record proclaiming Jesus as the Christ then became more compelling.\n\n","date":"April 20, 2015 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-196983","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"When we come to the gospels, all of this seems very much in the past.\nThe Gospels are stories about Jesus, not the problems (greater or smaller) of the early church.\nFurther evidence is suggested in the destruction of the temple, omitted in earlier Mark, but which seems to have already happened “as prophesied” in the other three gospels, although perhaps it might not have been so difficult to foresee. \nThere is nowhere a mention that the prophecy has already fulfilled -contrary to for example, prophecy of Peter’s death in John 21:18.\nWith the expectation of an early Parousia, little point in committing the account to writing would be seen, as everything was soon to come to an end.\nParousia.

All of them have very interesting stories, yet I don’t see industrial production of fake shrouds.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2015 at 3:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-197019","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"OK: The only argument you seem able to muster for a pre-70 AD compilation of the gospels is that the death of Peter and Paul are omitted in Luke’s book of the Acts.  I have already given reasons why this is an inadequate argument.  \n“The Gospels are stories about Jesus, not the problems (greater or smaller) of the early church.”  Yes, but you’re not reading the sub-text, and you are not applying any principles of form-criticism.  We could equally say that in Paul, his epistles are directed at admonishing his converts to follow the Christian way of life, yet the tensions between the Jewish and Hellenistic wings of the early church are very much to the forefront and are frequently mentioned, Luke recalling them in Acts.  These tensions are clearly in the past when we come to the gospels, which are generally addressed to a fully Hellenised church.  \nThe consensus seems to be that Mark’s gospel was probably written between 64-70 AD.  This is in agreement with a tradition that Mark wrote his gospel after the death of Peter.  In Mk ch 13, Jesus foretells the destruction of the temple, but it still seems to be standing at the time of writing, and this leads on to a discussion of the end-time when the Son of Man will come in glory.  Matthew and Luke, depending as they do on Mark, were clearly written at a later time.  Matthew’s “prophecy” of the destruction of the temple seems to already have occurred.  The “abomination of desolation” is a phrase adopted from Daniel which refers to Antiochus Epiphanes erecting a statue of Zeus Olympus  there, and is equated with a similar subsequent desecration of the temple by the Romans, which seems to have already occurred.  \nI cannot see how you can call the Parousia a pseudo-theory.

Clearly when the Parousia did not happen as expected, this perception changed.  \nThe consensus of all main-stream New Testament scholars is that the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were all written at some time after 70 AD.  Your hypothesis that they were set down before this time is singular to yourself and finds no good support from elsewhere.  I suggest that the literate character of your modern western experience blinds you to the strength of oral traditions in pre-literate societies, which traditions and pericopes formed the basis of the original gospel sources.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2015 at 4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-197023","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"Dave:\nOK: The only argument you seem able to muster for a pre-70 AD compilation of the gospels is that the death of Peter and Paul are omitted in Luke’s book of the Acts. I have already given reasons why this is an inadequate argument.\nYou have given potential reasons why Paul’s death is omitted, a HYPOTHESIS (very weak) invented to defend a priori assumption that Gospels were written after 70 AD. But this is turning everything upside down.\nMeanwhile Acts end this way (28:30-31, NIV):\nFor two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance! \nSee? Those words would have been extremely bizarre, had they been written after Paul’s death, a fact well known to the readers of Acts. That’s why the so-called New Testament scholars produce impressively sophisticated “justifications” why author of Acts decided to put an end here (a sufficiently capable idiot may produce extremely complicated and advanced justifications for pure absurds to sound “wise”). I don’t claim that dating Acts to 62 AD is absolute -yet given this passage, it is a very solid evidence. It is a normal practice to date ancient text by looking for known facts which are mentioned there, and which are not mentioned there, giving chronological boundaries.\nAnd there are more arguments to support pre-70 dating of the Gospels (although not as strong). For example, only John, writing after Peter’s death mentions that he was the the disciple that cut High Priest servant’s ear -which suggest that the Synoptics omitted this to protect (still alive) Peter.\n cannot see how you can call the Parousia a pseudo-theory. If everything was going to come to an early end, there would seem to be little point in leaving any kind of early record for any posterity. Clearly when the Parousia did not happen as expected, this perception changed. \nYes, this is pseudo-theory. Nonsense invented to justify claimed non-existence of Gospels before 70.\nFirst of all the Gospels were not written merely for posterity, but contrary, as a written record for contemporaries.\nSecondly: The apocalyptic believes of any group are no reason at all for this group to abstain from writing down (and propagating in a written form) their views. This is just pure nonsense invented by some wise guys, completely detached from the every day experience (see for example Jehovah’s Witnesses and their production of literature).\nMatthew’s “prophecy” of the destruction of the temple seems to already have occurred. The “abomination of desolation” is a phrase adopted from Daniel which refers to Antiochus Epiphanes erecting a statue of Zeus Olympus there, and is equated with a similar subsequent desecration of the temple by the Romans, which seems to have already occurred. \nThere is nothing in the New Testament that this has already occured. The Jesus’ eschatological speach is strongly derived (almost copycat) from Daniel, who predicts destruction of the Temple:\nDn 9:26 NIV After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.\nOf course the Anointed One (and the Son of Man), according to Jesus is Himself. He will be put to death, and after that, the Temple will be razed down, as Daniel prophesized. And that’s all. As this eventually happened, modern so-called scholars claim that this was prophecy ex eventu. disregarding Daniel completely (because it is inconvenient for them). But this purely ideological stance.\nI suggest that the literate character of your modern western experience blinds you to the strength of oral traditions in pre-literate societies, which traditions and pericopes formed the basis of the original gospel sources.\nBut this was not pre-literate society, contrary this was relatively highly literate society, and the message could have been put to write almost immediately. No obstacles there.\nThe consensus of all main-stream New Testament scholars is that the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were all written at some time after 70 AD.\nThe consensus… the worthless consensus, based not on the hard data, but on the authority of the scholarship “priests” and intimidation (if you support dating before 70 AD then you are not a scientisct but religious fanatic). \nI recommend you one thing: read some scholarly works on the New Testament, then read some apologetic works (without a priori prejudice for neither group), compare their arguments and decide which are more rational and make more common sense.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2015 at 6:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-197030","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"I am rather more informed on New Testament scholarship than you seem prepared to give me credit.

They do not have any conclusive evidence for dating Gospels post 70, yet they claim it as a fact. You claim the Gospels were written before 70 AD -you are religious fanatic. You claim the Gosples were written after 70 AD -you are “objective”.\nSimilar issue with the Shroud. You dispute 1988 C14 tests, and maintain it is authentic -you are mindless fanatic. You claim that 1988 C14 tests ultimately exposed the Shroud as a fake -you are “scientific”.\nThis is a mafia way of handling things…\nYou are concerned that a later compilation of the gospels compromises the argument for their factual reliability\nI didn’t claim that. My point is entirely different. It is about how easy they would have been to undermine, had they been written either before or after 70 AD.\nIf they were written before 70 AD, when the Temple stood still, there were Jewish authorities, many witnesses alive -then claims that Gospel image of Jesus has been fabricated by the disciples would be virtually pointless case.\nBut if the Gospels were written after 70 AD, after destruction of the Temple, wiping out the system, destruction of archives, and when there were few witnesses alive -then the critics have much easier job in claiming that the Gospels were late, fabricated documents, with no reference to historical Jesus. That’s what the critics need, and that’s why they insist on post 70 AD dating. For me, it is largely irrelevant, whether the Gospels were written before or after 70 AD they still may be true. But for them, it is crucial.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2015 at 4:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-197091","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio","post":"I am rather more informed on New Testament scholarship than you seem prepared to give me credit. \nDave, I am sure you are more informed on NT scholarship -but, in my opinion, you still have not released how corrupt and intimidated by the faulty ideas this society is… No disrespect.\nI once also thought -dating the Gospels before 70 AD?
