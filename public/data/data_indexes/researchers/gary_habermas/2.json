[{"title":"You might think St. Louis was all about Gary Habermas","post":"We have discussed teeth issue here: https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/11/teeth-reconsidered/\nI stay on the position that teeth are almost certainly visible on the Shroud face negative.

No magic here -except for the magic that created image.\n\n","date":"September 3, 2014 at 12:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/03/you-might-think-st-louis-was-all-about-gary-habermas/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-148311","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You might think St. Louis was all about Gary Habermas","post":"It seems to me that the mouth-is-open-so-teeth-can-be-seen theory goes directly against the\nmouth-is-held-closed-by-a-jawband theory.\n\n","date":"September 3, 2014 at 2:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/03/you-might-think-st-louis-was-all-about-gary-habermas/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-148327","author":"Nabber","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"You might think St. Louis was all about Gary Habermas","post":"No, I don’t think so.
