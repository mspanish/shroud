[{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"I don’t how accurately the Christian Post is reporting Habermas’s lecture, but one or two statements strike me as peculiar.\n“One of the discoveries based on enhanced images of the Shroud presented is that the person’s teeth were showing through the skin – possible signs of the resurrection for those who believe that the man is indeed Jesus Christ. […] This is one of the best indications that the man in the Shroud, who was dead and was crucified, (has) radiation coming out. [… (The teeth) are on the inside, but on the photo they are showing outside. Whichever way (the radiation) is coming, it dragged the image from the inside to the outside.” Even if there was the slightest evidence that the teeth are visible on the shroud image, which I deny, this explanation is, as have often remarked in other contexts, literally scientific non-sense.\n“Further radio carbon dating tests conducted in early 2013 by Padua University scientists established that the Shroud was likely made somewhere between 280 B.C. and A.D. 220, which is around the same time many Christians believe Jesus walked on Earth.” Established? Really? These were highly speculative spectrographic tests that made an interesting contribution to non-destructive radiocarbon analysis. To say they “established” anything at all is grossly overestimating them.\n“Furthermore, traces of dirt on the man’s feet, which have been subjected to chemical analysis published in a peer-reviewed secular chemistry journal, were noted to be from a species of limestone that is found almost exclusively in Jerusalem.” Aragonite is the second commonest form of limestone on the planet and although there is indeed aragonite limestone in Jerusalem, detailed isotopic tests would be needed to identify a specimen of limestone found on the shroud as from that particular area. No such tests have been conducted on the very few alleged particles that have been found, and without them, it could have come from almost anywhere.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47353","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"Professor Avinoam Danin’s “Botany of the Shroud” has some excellent colour illustrations, from which it is possible to see at least one thorn and something like a stem and perhaps some flowers. With his trained eye he seems to have spotted some of these things on the Shroud during the private showing (photograph in one of the BSTS newsletters) after the Round Table in Turin, and showed them to Cardinal Severino Poletto. The authorities do not seem to have cooperated with him to continue the work he was doing, which went beyond Turin, which is why this topic has come to a standstill.\nThe Aramaic, Latin and Greek letters some scholars see on the relic are even more controversial and I am working on the rationale behind the claim and should have some news soon.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47373","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"\nLouis :\nThe Aramaic, Latin and Greek letters some scholars see on the relic are even more controversial and I am working on the rationale behind the claim and should have some news soon.\n\nLouis, they are not controversial, they (or at least some of them) ARE REALLY THERE. Only biased opinions of some well known figures in the Shroud world make them controversial.\nSee some scans from two books:\n1.MARION, André – COURAGE, Anne-Laure – Nouvelles decouvertes sur le Suaire de Turin\n\n2. FRALE, Barbara – La sindone di Gesů Nazareno:\n\nThose are the results of  André Marion work in 1994. But also see the results of Thierry Castex in 2009:\nhttp://thierrycastex.blogspot.fr/\nYou see. Some of them (NAZARENNUS,m IH(SIGMA)O are hard to guess), but others (PEZw and particularly SB) are obvious for every child! Letters C and E in the word ‘INNECE’ are also beyond discussion. The whole talking about pareidolia is NONSENSE!\nSo why the existence of the letters is disputed by many, for example Dan and Barrie Schowrtz? I think the reason is simple (Dan please forgive me that criticism!). Because the existence of letters is FACT that the so-favored by them Roger’s Maillard Reaction CANNOT EXPLAIN! That’s why the existence of letters, flowers, coins etc. MUST be disputed. Because their eventual existence would be  inconvenient fact for that theory.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 12:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47378","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"Louis, they are most certainly controversial, whether they are really there or not. You do not need biased opinions, OK, to create a controversy; honest ones will do, if there are enough of them on both sides to establish disagreement. Dan’s and my honest opinions are that the face of the image “is really there,” and that the coins, flowers and letters “are really not there.” I believe that the first view is uncontroversial, and second one is. I have looked closely at the negative of the face in the light of Thierry’s paper and utterly deny that any of the letters are so obvious a child could spot them. The existence of the letters does not become a fact by writing in capitals, nor by the addition of exclamation marks; it becomes a fact by general acceptance, and this, so far, it certainly does not have.\nWhat’s more, denying the letters does not necessarily constitute a rejection of authenticity, or a slavish adherence to the Maillard reaction hypothesis, or any other conclusion about the shroud. If they were clear, then they would certainly add to the information we have about it. But they aren’t, and thus remain controversial, at least for the time being.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 1:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47381","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"Hugh, you forgot that the pictures were numerically cleared form most of the noise and background.

Things could have become easier for us if the Turin archdiocese had released the almost 2000 microphotographs in its possession and it seems that the inner circle in that city helps decide what can and cannot be done. This is apparently a protective measure, to a large extent due to lack of unity in the realm of Shroud studies, which does not generate confidence in the eyes of the Church. The message of Pope Benedict XVI, read out by Bishop Kevin Vann of Fort Worth, Texas at the last Shroud conference in Dallas has fallen on deaf ears. Worse, have a look at what has been published  in Shroud newsletters or posted on some Shroud websites. How on earth can anyone expect something more from Turin when the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing in these newsletters and sites?\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 2:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47387","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"I think some apparently clear letters would appear as false positives if almost any sheet was manipulated digitally in the same way.

I see that you have a good collection of Shroud material and books and that is good because at this rate you will make it to the top of the new generation of Shroud scholars.\nThanks for the two scans, duly downloaded and stored, Thierry’s excellent images having been analysed a long time ago. My inquiry goes a little beyond these and hopefully there should be some news soon.\nRogers never tried to impose the Maillard reaction theory because he was wise enough to understand that there were shortcomings and replications have not been successful not least because an ideal scenario is not easy to find. So there is no reason why some things others see on the relic should be dismissed only because they clash with what is proposed by the Maillard Reaction theory. If everything that is said about the Shroud must conform to what Rogers thought then we will be on the wrong track because that is like appealing to a Procustean bed.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 1:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47385","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"Hugh, let us have your views after you have seen the book by Marion and Courage.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 4:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47398","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday","post":"Why should anyone have to pay to read someone’s views?
