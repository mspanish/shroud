[{"title":"Thanks to Joe Marino and Barrie Schwortz","post":"Thank you for your kind words! I am glad to hear you found the page so useful. The Shroud Centers & Organizations page was built over the past 18 years and has grown continuously as interest in the Shroud has expanded around the world. The only problem with large numbers of links on a web page, is that links are often changed, moved or deleted over time and it is almost impossible for us to always keep every link up to date (there are thousands on shroud.com). So I really appreciate you letting us know about the broken links you found and making suggestions on how to keep them more current. Whenever anyone finds a broken link on http://www.shroud.com, just send us an e-mail (via the Send Us E-mail page at http://www.shroud.com/email.htm) with the broken link copied into the text, along with the specific page upon which the link was found. We’ll take it from there! Thank you again for helping us make the website more complete and accurate. Watch for the next website update on December 14th.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2013 at 3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/thanks-to-joe-marino-and-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-57133","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"}]
