[{"title":"Letter from Joe Marino","post":"Quote : “I think that the ENEA report concluding the Shroud couldn’t have been faked might have a more powerful effect for some than saying the Shroud is authentic (of course some of the articles managed to twist the former into the latter.)”\nIt’s an interesting comment and I have no doubt that, for some people, it will be that way, but the important question that come into my mind after reading this :  IS IT REALLY THE TRUTH.  I don’t think so personally because the experiment of Di Lazzaro can only be linked to the Shroud of Turin after an EXTRAPOLATION made by those who believe in the supernatural image formation process.  So, I ask the question :  Is it a good thing to try to convince people that doubt in the authenticity of the Shroud with an EXTRAPOLATION which have good chances in the end to have nothing to do with the Shroud ???  Again, personally, I don’t think so…\nIt’s important to understand that Di Lazzaro’s experiment cannot prove one bit that UV lights had something to do in the image formation process.  It’s a stretch (or an extrapolation if you prefer) made only by those who wants to confort their idea that the body images MUST have been produced by some burst of energy during the resurrection.  \nNote : this comment is not adressed directly to M. Marino but I only react to what he said.  I don’t know him enough to know if he fits under the category of those who desperately wants to confort their view about a supernatural image formation process…  But I know many people in the Shroud world fits into that category.  Again, I don’t want to give names because they know who they are !!! ;-)\n\n","date":"December 25, 2011 at 11:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/24/letter-from-joe-marino/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6123","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Letter from Joe Marino","post":"Joe wrote: “It is amazing what kind of comments and logic people use to discount the Shroud”. I personnally have been studying the Shroud for nearly a quarter of a century and I am NOW convinced it is authentic. However one should not forget HOW AMAZING TOO Christian scientists, scholars, pseudo-scientists and pseudo-scholars are all too willing to explain the Shroud image formation process only via the supernatural AT ALL COST (against facts and reason). Strangely enough, many many Christian professional and amateur “Shroud researchers”  have theories while  IGNORING the Greek version of the Gospels, the Judean funeral practice of the Second Temple period and… sheer common sense.\n\n","date":"December 27, 2011 at 7:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/24/letter-from-joe-marino/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6168","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Letter from Joe Marino","post":"Quote : “However one should not forget HOW AMAZING TOO Christian scientists, scholars, pseudo-scientists and pseudo-scholars are all too willing to explain the Shroud image formation process only via the supernatural AT ALL COST.”\nThis is maybe the best comment Max ever wrote on this blog.  BRAVO !  I really think you were right on the target this time.\nBias my friend…  Many people in the pro-authenticity camp have great bias, just like many people in the anti-authenticity camp.  Unfortunate, really.  And this situation just do harm to Shroud science.\n\n","date":"December 27, 2011 at 6:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/24/letter-from-joe-marino/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6197","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Letter from Joe Marino","post":"Joe-I applaud your work and diligence in regards to the Shroud.
