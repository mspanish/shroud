Then there are Joan of Arc, the Sts Theresas, the Sts Catherines and so many other women who witness to Jesus as Saviour.  Then remember Donald Soper of Hyde Park Corner fame, the Wesleys and Blessed John Henry Newman etc etc etc.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2013 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/26/barrie-schwortz-isnt-it-funny-how-god-always-picks-a-jew-to-be-the-messenger/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-32880","author":"P Paige","site":"shroudstory"}]
