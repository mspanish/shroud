Even though I still belive there are at least 2 other possible explanations for the Shroud beside the one that involved the authentic shroud of Jesus (one involving an accidental ressemblance with the Jesus of the Gospels and another involving a natural forgery done with a real crucified corpse), I have to say that those 2 other possibilities are so improbable that it is very rational to conclude that this relic is authentic.  Honestly, the odds for the Shroud being the real thing must be close to 99%.\n\n","date":"April 27, 2013 at 6:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/26/barrie-schwortz-this-has-to-be-what-it-appears-to-be/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-32089","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz: This has to be what it appears to be","post":"Agreed Russ.
