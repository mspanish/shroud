It is possible to take a photo of an image or anything, “doctor up” the photo then reproduce the “doctored” photo and say it is an original photo.  I have not seen or observed all of Barrie’s works but I highly doubt that he would resort to flim flaming this.  Especially with him being Jewish and this being a Christian Miracle Relic.\n\n","date":"April 4, 2014 at 12:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/barrie-schwortz-so-why-is-a-good-jewish-boy-like-me-doing-this/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-96354","author":"ekmcmahon","site":"shroudstory"}]
