[{"title":"Barrie Schwortz responds to Colin Berry’s Rude Criticisms","post":"One of the really gratifying, if not edifying, events in my life of the past few years is having made the acquaintance of Barry Schwortz through the web and an occasional telephone conversation. He has always been open and helpful.\nJFK concluded his Inaugural address saying: “that here on earth God’s work must truly be our own.” In preserving the work of STURP, and since STURP making accessible the work of so many others, Barry is “truly” doing God’s work.  \nSo too are many so many others for if the Shroud is authentic, it is not only the most important physical object in the world at this time, it may be the most important physical object ever.\n\n","date":"July 24, 2012 at 6:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/24/barrie-schwortz-responds-to-colin-berrys-rude-criticisms/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14158","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz responds to Colin Berry’s Rude Criticisms","post":"I do confirm: although I don’t share Barrie’s opinions (and even some of “his facts”) as far as the Turin Sindon is concerned, he kindly allowed me to use one of  his Sindon face negative photographs in my research for inscriptions.\n\n","date":"July 24, 2012 at 7:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/24/barrie-schwortz-responds-to-colin-berrys-rude-criticisms/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14163","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz responds to Colin Berry’s Rude Criticisms","post":"I do confirm that Barrie Schwortz has probably the biggest heart in all the Shroud world.

Barrie is a first class human being whom I consider to be a close personal friend.  He is very warm and generous with everyone he meets and his reply shows his class as he did not attack, but rather gave a unique perspective to the issue explaining the reasons why they do what they do.  Obviously, those who have no idea of the copyrights applicable to the Schwortz photos erred.  Perhaps we ought to try to be charitable towards one another, or simply give each other the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise.  \nI was cautioned when I got involved with the Shroud through creating the website that there are those who are not civil in the Shroud ‘world’.  Presuming this is Jesus, the Prince of Peace, this is a terrible irony (I believe from the evidence I have seen and the tremendous affect it has had on my life personally, but hold no ill will toward those who do not believe similarly, rather I only wish them the best).  Each person should be permitted to hold their own beliefs about this and many other subjects.  The world is a big place and there is room enough for diversity of personal opinion on this and many other subjects. After all, we are human.  Imagine how boring it would be if we all thought the same and believed exactly the same?  That doesn’t sound like a race of human beings, but of robots.   \nLarry and Yannick, nice to see you in here.  As Tiny Tim would say, “God bless us, everyone!”\n\n","date":"July 24, 2012 at 7:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/24/barrie-schwortz-responds-to-colin-berrys-rude-criticisms/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14194","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz responds to Colin Berry’s Rude Criticisms","post":"Andy Weiss: “Presuming this is Jesus, the Prince of Peace, this [people not being civil in the Shroud ‘world’] is a terrible irony”\nJust remember what Yeshua said  :\n‘I did not come to bring peace.

This blog (and the Shroud world in general) is a very big proof that Jesus words concerning the sword was completely true !  When he said those words, he knew by experience that his message was not received by everyone and, on the contrary, that it caused frictions, debates and even war and hate !  It’s also true that he his the Prince of Peace but that would only be fulfilled on the other side.  Here, on earth, we the humans, we’re not transfigured and resurrected yet, so our ego represent often a big barrier against a real peaceful relation with others…  And Jesus knew that.\n\n","date":"July 25, 2012 at 10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/24/barrie-schwortz-responds-to-colin-berrys-rude-criticisms/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14215","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz responds to Colin Berry’s Rude Criticisms","post":"Reeal/serious incivility shall not be confused with mild provocation and pedagogic anger….\n\n","date":"July 25, 2012 at 5:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/24/barrie-schwortz-responds-to-colin-berrys-rude-criticisms/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14206","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz responds to Colin Berry’s Rude Criticisms","post":"You would be hard pressed to find anyone that is more kind, honest, and fair than Barrie Schwortz-his integrity, dedication,and professionalism are second to none. Barrie is one of the most generous human beings on the planet-through his efforts a wealth of information about the Shroud is easily accessible for those wishing to learn more about it.  As I’m certain anyone who has personally interacted with him will attest, Barrie is more than helpful and willing to provide information about any aspect of the Shroud and suggest other sources that may also be useful.

However with hope in my heart, I wrote to him concerning the Aragonite limestone studies, and was delighted to receive a personal detailed response.  He was courteous enough to include the following postscript: \n“I was in New Zealand in 2005 but never got to Wellington. I spent all my time in Auckland as we put on a Shroud exhibit there.

His unwavering commitment to the authenticity of the Shroud, and the research that has been done thus far will continue to have a far reaching impact on the scientific as well as the religious world. The integrity he puts forth in the work is evident when you speak with him. Simply put, he has given his life- his career to the Shroud of Turin. In the end, he and all of us must anwser to our God, and having said that, it seems to me his obligation to the sacred preservation of it (in all its forms) is not taken lightly.
