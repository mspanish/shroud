Even if it could be proven that the Shroud dates back to the 1st Century, however reasonable it may look like, it could not be stated with a 100% confidence that it is the burial cloth of Christ and not someone else’s.\nIt reminds me of another relic whose origin (*) has been undoubtedly determined to be in a  1st Century workshop somewhere in Middle East: the Chalisse of Valencia. Even so, despite the well documented, traceable and centuries old tradition, the Church is very cautious about establishing any scientific connection beyond any doubt to the Last Supper.\nHowever, remarkably enough, Pope Benedcit XVi in his visit to Valencia, celebrated mass with this Chalisse.\n(*) The Chalisse consists of two parts: a medieval jewelry artwork and a carved stone which is the element thought to have been manufactured at some point of the 1st Century, somewhere in Middle East.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2013 at 7:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/02/cbs-this-morning-coverage-with-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-29116","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"}]
