[{"title":"Barry Schwortz on Grok Radio","post":"Interesting interview, I have learnt a few things as for example, that technically the Shroud does not belong to the Church itself but to the Pope.\nBarrie also dismisses the conspiration theory regarding the radiocarbon dating and considers that the labs did a good technical job. He thinks that the problem was that the chosen sample was a medieval reweaving.\nRegarding the prsence of flowers, coins and so on he does not believe that there are any but he does not go into details as in the paper he recently coauthored with Dilazzaro et al and published in ENEA\n\n","date":"January 12, 2013 at 7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/10/barry-schwortz-on-grok-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21919","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barry Schwortz on Grok Radio","post":"I listened to the entire 2hrs and enjoyed it. Barrie covered most of the conceivable arguments and explained his answers well.
