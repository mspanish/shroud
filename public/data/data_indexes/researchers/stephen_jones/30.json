I believe since 631 AD. This is fact.Agreed about \"the 7th century\" but not necessarily \"631 AD\". The Sudarium probably entered Spain on or shortly after AD616 but did not arrive in Oviedo until 718 (see below).The AD631 date is when St. Braulio, bishop of Saragossa, Spain, wrote in a letter that \"the linteaminibus [linen] and the sudarium in which the Lord's body was wrapped\" had been in Jerusalem but he did not know of their present whereabouts (Guscin, M., \"The Oviedo Cloth,\" 1998, pp.11-12). He was either genuinely ignorant of the location of the Sudarium being in Spain, or did not want to reveal it.Guscin says that, according to the chronicle of Pelayo, bishop of Oviedo (1101-43), the Sudarium was taken from Jerusalem before it was sacked by the Persians in 614 and arrived in Spain after the fall of Alexandria in 616 and before the death in 633 of St. Fulgentius, bishop of Ecija, Spain, who received  Sudarium in a chest (Guscin, p.14).The chest containing the Sudarium passed to St. Isidore, bishop of Seville (c.560-636), who in turn passed it on to his student San Ildefonso (St Ildephonsus), who became bishop of Toledo in 657 and died in 667.Then following the Muslim invasion of Spain in 711, the Sudarium was taken in 718 in its chest to a cave near Oviedo (which was not founded until 761). The sudarium remained in the cave until King Alfonso II (791-842) built the Camara Santa for it in the Oviedo cathedral in 840 (Guscin, p.15). The chest was eventually opened in 1075, by King Alfonso IV and the Sudarium was in it (Guscin, p.17). So the historical evidence is that the Sudarium has been in Spain since at least 633 (and probably 616-620), and before that it was in Jerusalem, presumably from the time of Jesus' crucifixion (because why would anyone keep a small, plain, blood-stained cloth in Jerusalem if it was not Jesus'?).>When the Sudarium and The Shroud of Turin face are aligned, the blood spots exactly line up. Agreed. This is the strongest evidence (which in a criminal trial would be accepted as proof beyond reasonable doubt) that the Sudarium of Oviedo and the Shroud of Turin covered the same face.And since the Sudarium has been in Spain since 616-633 and in Jerusalem before that, the simplest hypothesis is the Shroud of Turin must also have been in Jerusalem and also covered the body of Jesus.>The Sudarium and the Shroud of Turin both have the rare blood type AB.Apparently old blood tends to degrade to type AB, so this is not conclusive evidence that the blood of the Sudarium's and Shroud were from the same victim. But if the blood type had been different, then that would have been strong evidence against the Sudarium and the Shroud having covered the same body. So the fact that the Sudarium has the same type AB blood as the Shroud is an important test of authenticity that the Sudarium could have failed but successfully passed.>This alone should be cause for alarm, with respect to the C14 dating of the shroud. The C14 should have, at least, dated the shroud to the 7th century.Agreed. Before the Sudarium of Oviedo evidence, the evidence that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Christ was already very strong (e.g. the Shroud's unique marks found on art going back to the 6th century), and the only positive evidence against it was the 14th century C14 dating.Because of the many problems with C14 dating, due to contamination with external carbon, etc, archaeologists normally disregard a C14 date as anomalous if it disagrees with other known facts about an artifact. So the only reason the C14 dating has not been set aside in the case of the Shroud is because of the enormous loss of face science would have to endure, especially in respect of Christianity. This is exacerbated by the fact that most scientists are agnostics/atheists and if the Shroud of Turin really is the burial sheet of Christ, then that is personally very hard for them to accept.Stephen E.
