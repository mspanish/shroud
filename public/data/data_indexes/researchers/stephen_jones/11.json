If you mean my December 2016 Editorial, which is as at 31 December 2016, that will be the next post after this current \"Negative #19\" post. I had already written it on 1 January 2017, but I can't post it until I finish the latter.I had originally estimated I would finish my \"Negative #19\" post on 5 January, but I found it requires much more research time than I first thought.But it is an important topic so I should not skimp it.Stephen E. Jones----------------------------------\"By way of guidance as to what I mean by `offensive' and `sub-standard,' I regard comments to my blog as analogous to letters to the Editor of a newspaper. If the Editor of a newspaper would not publish a comment because it is `offensive' and/or `sub-standard' then neither will I. It does not mean that if I disagree with a comment I won't publish it. I have published anti-authenticist comments and other comments that I disagreed with, and I have deleted `offensive' and/or `sub-standard' comments that are pro-authenticist. `Sub-standard' includes attempting to use my blog as a platform to publish a block of text of the commenter's own views, and also bare links to other sites with little or no actual comments. By `off-topic' I mean if a comment has little or nothing to do with the topic(s) in the post it is under (except for the latest post-see above).\" [05Jan16]\n\n","author":"Stephen E.
