Jones’ Report on the Lecture by Joel Bernstein","post":"Thank-you Mr Jones for the prompt report…I too like Kris cannot fathom people still mentioning McCrone in their lectures or arguments against the Shroud.I guess people like Berstein assume their listheners have done even less research then themselfs and therefore can get away with all the bull**** they spew.\nI guess it doesn’t matter how many ‘peer-reviewed’ papers chemists, physicists whomever put out on the subject of the Shroud, these people will always refute them.Biggest thing that bugs me, is that they never ever mention or list any ‘peer-reviewed’ papers to back their statements…kind of hypocritical isn’t it? \nAnother person to put on my list of frauds and do not bother reading list.\nRon.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2011 at 5:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/28/stephen-e-jones-report-on-the-lecture-by-joel-bernstein/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3465","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
