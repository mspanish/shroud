From admittedly what little I have read about the  Tilma of Juan Diego, aka. the Image of Guadelupe, there is no comparison between it and the Shroud of Turin.Scientific testing of the Shroud of Turin has shown it not to be a painting, with no paint or pigment, but scientific testing has shown the Image of Guadelupe to be a painting, with layers of paint:\"In 2002, art restoration expert José Sol Rosales said he examined the icon with a stereomicroscope and that he identified calcium sulfate, pine soot, white, blue, and green \"tierras\" (soil), reds made from carmine and other pigments, as well as gold. Rosales said he found the work consistent with 16th century materials and methods ... Norberto Rivera Carrera, Archbishop of Mexico, commissioned a 1999 study to test the tilma's age. Leoncio Garza-Valdés, a pediatrician and microbiologist who had previously worked with the Shroud of Turin, claimed, upon inspection of photographs of the image, to have found three distinct layers in the painting, at least one of which had initials painted on it.\" (\"Our Lady of Guadalupe,\" Wikipedia).Garza-Valdés, whom I know of from my Shroud of Turin studies, is a devout Roman Catholic, who regards the Shroud of Turin as authentic, so if he says the Image of Guadalupe is a painting, that is decisive for me.>Considering that the tilma still exist to this day and did not rot, it could be said that it is alive.I gather the Image of Guadelupe is on hemp, which is very durable. >When alive, plants absorbed radio carbon and stop only when it died whence radio carbon decay. This is the basic principle of carbon dating. Agreed.>Now if the shroud is alive up to the date when it was first exposed to public then it was only at that date where the linen (derived from plant) has its radio carbon start to decay. The Shroud itself is linen, which is woven flax and ceases to be alive when the flax dies, i.e. is harvested.>Consequently, the carbon dating will point to the said date, which was the one observed in the radio carbon dating experiment. This can support the belief that the shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of JesusIt wouldn't. That the flax the linen of the Shroud is made of was alive just before the Shroud's first undisputed appearance in France c. 1350, is in fact what the 1988 radiocarbon date of 1260-1390 assumed is the case.Proponents of the authenticity of the Shroud claim the flax was alive only up to or before the early 1st century AD, and that the radiocarbon date is wrong, i.e. it does not yield a true chronological age, due to one or more factors, such as contamination with younger carbon, and/or enrichment of neutrons (i.e. from Jesus' resurrecting body changing its state of matter), that are known to give an apparently younger radiocarbon age than the actual chronological age.Stephen E.
