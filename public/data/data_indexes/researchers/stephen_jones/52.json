[{"title":"\nShroud name index `H'\n","post":"\n\nI have read Dr. Heller's \"report on the Shroud of Turin\" in 2011 and found several points of interest in support of the statements that the shroud is an authentic piece of evidence, and is not contrived/produced by a prankster.My own speculation on how the hyperfocal image of the man (I believe it represents the image of Jesus Christ) occurs on the shroudinvolves quantum physics and His Capacity to transform to light. I think transformed to light as the wave aspect of His Particles as He passed through the shroud. The shroud was not removed from Him. Therefore, the front and back images came together as the fabric fell.
