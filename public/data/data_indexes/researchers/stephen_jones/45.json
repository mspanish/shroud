Here is the simple explanation for the annoying repetition of similar messages.\nMaybe there were line problems or other causes.\nI hope that this never happens again.\n— — —\nHere what I have found surfing the Web today:\n>1. – Where were the Jerusalem samples taken?\nDr. Nitowsky (Sr. Damian of the Cross) sampled in Israel, nine sites which included:\n1. Emmaus; 2. Jericho, at Herod’s palace; 3. Qumran ; 4. Beth Shan ; 5 Sepphoris; 6 and 7 Beth She’arim; 8 Jerusalem; 9. Mt Carmel”. The Jerusalem samples are further identified as in the École Biblique tomb complex and more particularly from the bench of the tomb.”\n>2. … … omitted … …\n>3. – How was the Aragonite identified from Jerusalem?\n>Kohlbeck analysed with the microscope thin sections of the Jerusalem tomb and he concluded was Aragonite. The strongest way to distinguish Aragonite from Calcite is the X-ray diffraction to determine the crystalline structure. However, this test was never mentioned. But Kohlbeck should be able to recognize through the microscope the aragonite versus the common calcite. Nevertheless, this is not the key question because actually, Aragonite is very spread and very common. It should be easy to find Aragonite in the Jerusalem rock and in the Shroud too and its presence in the Shroud cannot be taken as a clue of its stay in Jerusalem. Only specific traces (iron and strontium) could give an indicative fingerprint. Kohlbeck applied the X-Ray fluorescence method to detect traces of iron and strontium and being not able to find lead.\nIt is the further analysis conducted by Dr. Riccardo Levi-Setti through his high-resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy that provided the true “little DNA” or “finger print” to be compared with the samples of the Shroud (fibers).\nlink:\nhttp://www.holyshroudguild.org/cesar2.html\n— — —\nSIMS\n link:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_ion_mass_spectrometry\n— — —\n>Ion microprobes, also known as secondary ion mass spectrometers (SIMS), use a finely focused ion beam to probe a selected sample domain.  A small percentage of the material sputtered from the polished surface of the sample is ionized, and these ions are accelerated into a mass spectrometer where they are separated according to their mass-over-charge ratio.  An important characteristic of SIMS is its high sensitivity compared to other microbeam sampling techniques: the ability to count individual ions results in detection limits in the parts-per-billion range for many elements.  Also the fact that ions derived from the sample are separated by their mass-over-charge ratio allows isotopic analyses to be performed on test portion masses that can be as small as 200 picograms. \nLink:\nhttp://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/research/organizational-units/departments/department-4/inorganic-and-isotope-geochemistry/infrastructure/secondary-ion-mass-spectrometry-sims/\nDo you know the dimensions and volumes of the craters produced\nduring secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis ?\n— — —\nSuper-SIMS (SIMS = Secondary ion mass spectrometry) – also called Accelerator-SIMS or Trace Element AMS (TREAMS)  – is an ultrasensitive analytical method for the determination of stable elements and isotopes.\nDue to the acceleration of the extracted sample ions to MeV-energies and their charge reversal from negative to positive ions, Super-SIMS can reach about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower detection limits  (up to 10-12 or ppt, highly depending on analyte and matrix) as conventional SIMS. …\nLink:\nhttp://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=2809\n\n","date":"September 30, 2014 at 8:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/28/searching-stephen-jones-quotation-archives/","cat":"quotations","id":"comment-157978","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"}]
