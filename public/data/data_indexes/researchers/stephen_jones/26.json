[{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"Arguing with a fanatic can bear no fruit worth the eating, and as for winning an argument with such it is impossible. It is an easy matter to take scripture out of context, Screwtape does it all the time. Stephen has taken Matt 7:22-23 out of context. What is the context? It is Matt 7:21; “It is not those who say to me, “Lord, Lord”, who will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the person who does the will of my Father in heaven.” So it is not a matter of mere piety. At the end of his earthly mission in his last public discourse, we have the picture of the Last Judgment, and we learn what must be done. Does it focus on belief? Does it focus on faith? Does it focus on prayer.  Does it focus on confessing Jesus as Lord? They’re all important, but no! The key to the kingdom is only held by those who have carried out the corporal works of mercy, repeated three times! see Matt 25: 21-46.  So much for the Faith versus Works debate!\n\n","date":"April 25, 2014 at 7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-103536","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"If we would enter the Kingdom through our good works, then there would be a big bunch of God’s children (those for whom he died on the cross) who will be left outside…  This idea that you need to do good deeds to merit the Kingdom is a Jewish idea (repeated some times in the New Testament by the Jewish writers) that comes from the Old Testament and they put this in Jesus mouth.  Of course, the ideal in life is to do good deeds and to be merciful, but that’s not what matters the most for God (as Jesus show us on the cross when he forgives even his executioners and when he said, just prior to his Passion that once lifted up, he would attract EVERY person to him).  No!  What matters the most (at least for God) is simply the fact that we’re all his beloved childrens…  Look : When your child do bad deeds, do you reject and condemn him for eternity or do you keep on loving him (even more than before maybe)?  For God at least, be sure that he will ALWAYS choose the second option…  And it’s a blessing that it is like that because I would certainly be one of those who would be left outside his Kingdom if he would be the God of Daveb!  I repeat it :  Doing good deeds and being merciful is what God would love to see us do all the time, but at the same time, he know perfectly well that we’re all sinners and poor people and that’s why the Kingdom is a FREE gift.  A FREE GIFT.  He we still keep on believing the Kingdom will only be for those who do good deeds, then we don’t believe in that it’s free and we’re simply not worthy of being called Christian and in fact, we’re just another pharisee (since this idea of a Kingdom for the good persons only was already the central belief of these Jews of Jesus time).   Look again :  Did St Paul received all his blessings from the Resurrected Jesus for having done good deeds?  Not at all!  It was a FREE GIFT of God for him and we must see this as a very great sign of the FREE GIFT God wants to give to us all…\n\n","date":"April 25, 2014 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-103567","author":"Roger","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"Correction: You should read “IF we still keep on believing the Kingdom will only be for those who do good deeds, then we don’t believe in that it’s free and we’re simply not worthy of being called Christian and in fact, we’re just another pharisee…”\n\n","date":"April 25, 2014 at 9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-103572","author":"Roger","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"I think you misread Daveb’s point.

The only thing that save us in the end is our being of God’s children.  Life is not a passing exam.  It is simply a growing process that is needed to prepare us for eternal life.  To believe in Jesus can help some (like me) going through life, but that’s not an obligation in order to be saved.  In fact, everyone is already saved.  The only difference is that there are some who believe it while they’re still on Earth and the rest who will be face to face with this great truth when they’ll die.  Some understand quicker than others…  That’s the only difference and that’s not very important in the end.\n\n","date":"April 25, 2014 at 10:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-103592","author":"Roger","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"Wild Turkey is made in Kentucky, not Virginia.\n\n","date":"April 25, 2014 at 7:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-103550","author":"Tom Devins","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"You got me.

It’s a quantum thing.\nChrist gave us two commandments taken from scripture but combined in a unique way. They were to love God with our whole being and to love our neighbor as ourselves. \nThat’s it. But what does it mean to love both God and neighbor? How does one “love” a disembodied spirit existing before space and time and beyond our comprehension. Christ nswered that question in the parable of the Last Judgment. [So described by Pope Benedict and Pope Francis].\nWhen one reads the litany of deeds that enable salvation, there are some things lacking. No where is tithing raised as a necessary deed, nor even honoring the Sabbath. Rather only through the works of love to the neediest CAN we express our  love of the deity.\nPope Francis realizes this. That’s why he saw Jesus in the person of a young Moslem delinquent girl whose feet he washed during his first Holy Week as pope.\nMother Theresa found Christ in the desperate neediest in the slums of Calcutta. \nIt a real test to love the neediest, particularly if he or she is a homeless person on the subway who hasn’t bathed in a while and who, frankly, smells awful.\nBut that’s what Christianity is about. At least that’s what Christ said Christianity is about.

Read again the parable of the two sons if you don’t believe me…  The youngest was the first to enter into God’s Kingdom, even though all that he did was bad deeds.

Until January this year all Dan’s references to Stephen’s site were complementary. Even his response to Stephen’s first suggestion that the radiocarbon data might have been hacked was interested and encouraging. “This ‘mini-series’ sounds promising. Stephen isn’t joking and the title of this posting, being as it is a play on the title of Feynman’s most famous book, is meant as a full-throated compliment to Stephen, assuming he pulls it off.”\nI was less complimentary, as even in this first post there was a serious misunderstanding of Gove’s statistical analysis of the shroud (which it is not clear Stephen really understands even now), and a misrepresentation of Robert Hedges’ viewpoint. Although he was quick to qualify what he meant by fraud, he firmly announced his intention to “set out the evidence for … the bias and dishonesty of those involved in the dating,” which seemed, in the absence of any such evidence, libellous.\nStephen second post (Labelled Part 1) was in February. Now the ‘fraud’ had become some kind of computer hacking, but no evidence at all was put forward. Dan was disappointed. So was I. Stephen thanked Dan for the publicity he was being given. Part 2, the following day, added nothing more, and to be fair to the dubious, Dan suggested we look at Wikipedia’s Timeline of Computer Security Hacker History.\nPart 3 appeared a few days later and “the hacker” was more or less established. However still no evidence had been put forward and I was prepared to dismiss this whole idea as preposterous. Dan didn’t comment at all.\nBy March 7 it was either “a KGB agent hacked into the AMS system control console computer at each of the three C-14 labs and inserted a program” or “anyone with the requisite computer skills, even a university student hacker testing his ability.” When both Professors Jull and Ramsey had replied to my emails saying this was impossible, they were described as “ambiguous,” “misleading” and “defensive,” with “fallacious reasoning and false facts.” However Stephen now turned his attention to the possibility of individual hackers at each of the three labs, and, picking on Arizona University first, fingered two of the radiocarbon team with deep suspicion, while announcing boldly that he couldn’t prove they were guilty.\nUntil this moment, Dan still hadn’t murmured a derogatory word, but at last, under some pressure from his readers, felt that direct personal accusations of fraud without any evidence whatsoever were unacceptable on his blog.\nNothing constructive has occurred since, but I cannot find that Dan has been derogatory about Stephen anywhere. Stephen’s “evidence” concerning hacking has been robustly challenged without much defence and his hypothesis cannot be considered to be in any sense established.\nAnd finally: “However, unlike Porter, it is part of my long-standing, stated policies that I do not to allow offensive or sub-standard comments. This includes offensive comments against Porter.” !!!

The presence of works are the Litmus paper that Validates our conversion.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2014 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-104196","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"Agreed 100%, daveb.

A man had two sons. He came to the first and said, ‘Son, go out and work in the vineyard today.’ 29He said in reply, ‘I will not,’ but afterwards he changed his mind and went. 30The man came to the other son and gave the same order. He said in reply, ‘Yes, sir,’ but did not go. 31* Which of the two did his father’s will?” They answered, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Amen, I say to you, tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you.” \nMotives are clearly secondary.  I think I would place the direct words of Jesus as recorded in Matthew ahead even of St Paul’s more obscure theology.  I agree James’ epistle has the correct approach and is consistent with Matt 25:31-46. Luther was reluctant to include James epistle in his translation and only did so out of respect for tradition.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2014 at 9:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-104257","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones","post":"Dave, I dont think the parable you mentioned was about motive. He was basically saying “Actions speak lowder than words” irrespective of the motive.\nHowever, I believe according to Jesus, the motive is very important, “Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues”…(Matthew 6:1-4) clearly Jesus is condemning people giving to the poor to be recognized by others and not out of love to the poor, which is in agreement with what Paul was saying.\nAlso, according to the dialogue with Nicodemus being born again was imperative for entering the Kingdom of God, no mention of acts of mercy or good deeds. He also clearly said, ” No one comes to the Father except through me” so if someone is doing good deeds but rejects Jesus salvation, he won’t make it to the kingdom of God.\nI Agree with you that James has the correct approach. Salvation demonstrated by works.\n\n","date":"April 27, 2014 at 12:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-104291","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"}]
