[{"title":"\nShroud of Turin News - September 2008\n","post":"\n\nAnonymousI have deleted your comment about \"Archeologist Shimon Gibson\" because it is off-topic under this post, which has nothing about Gibson. I have also deleted your identical copy of that comment under \"Re: John Calvin on the Shroud #2\" because it is off-topic there too. And also because I regard it as \"substandard\" to make identical copies of the same comment under different posts. If you wish, you can re-do your comment under \"Burial shroud proves Turin Shroud not from 1st century C.E. Jerusalem?\" which is about archaeologist Shimon Gibson.Stephen E.
