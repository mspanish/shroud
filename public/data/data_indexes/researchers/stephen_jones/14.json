I am not now and have never been an English professor at Montclair State University, as a check of Montclair State University would reveal. (I might work there at some point in the future ... but, up to now, December, 2007, I am not and have never been an English Professor at Montclair State University).The website that identifies me as an English professor at Montclair State University, to which you link, is bogus. I've written to them and asked them to correct their site, and they ignored my request.I hope that you will correct your page.
