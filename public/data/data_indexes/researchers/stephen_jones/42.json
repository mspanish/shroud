If their aim was to ensure my many megabytes of Creation/Evolution/Design material (11.7 Mb in quotes alone) would not be read for fear of harming the readers' computers, then they have succeeded.Even though as far as I am aware, there never was (or is) anything on my web pages that could harm anyone's computer. After all, they are MY pages and NONE of my computers over the years have ever been harmed by anything on my web pages! I recently did a full Microsoft Security Essentials scan of my entire system (which includes copies of all my web pages, past and present). It took 5 hours and found ZERO threats.But as I said, it doesn't bother  me. The focus of my activities these days is this my Shroud of Turin blog.And Google can hardly claim that THAT would harm readers' computers, given that it is hosted by Blogger which is owned by Google!Stephen E. Jones---------------------------------Reader, if you like this my The Shroud of Turin  blog, and you have a website, could you please consider adding  a hyperlink to my blog on it? This would help increase its Google PageRank number and so enable those who are Google searching on \"the Shroud of Turin\" to more readily discover my blog. Thanks.\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"July 10, 2014 at 9:56 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/07/stephen-e-jones-home-page-wont-harm.html","site":"moore"}]
