I have always said that the Vatican, by its actions, shows that it believes the Shroud to be authentic.It is a question of simply telling the truth. Which the Vatican is not doing regarding the Shroud's authenticity.The result is that non-Christians like Philip Ball take the Vatican's failure to confirm or deny that the Shroud is authentic as evidence that it is not.Stephen E.

A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question which contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt). Aside from being an informal fallacy depending on usage, such questions may be used as a rhetorical tool: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda. The traditional example is the question `Have you stopped beating your wife?' Whether the respondent answers yes or no, they will admit to having a wife and having beaten her at some time in the past. Thus, these facts are presupposed by the question, and in this case an entrapment, because it narrows the respondent to a single answer, and the fallacy of many questions has been committed.\" (\"Loaded question,\" Wikipedia, 15 June 2015).I DID answer your question by pointing out that: \"It is not a question of knowing. I have always said that the Vatican, by its actions, shows that it believes the Shroud to be authentic.\"But you wanted to entrap me by requiring of me a simple `yes' or `no' answer to your fallacious question. If I had answered \"yes, I do know more than the Vatican,\" you would rightly accuse me of arrogance. But if I had answered, \"no, I don't know more than the Vatican,\" you would rightly accuse me of ignorance. So I could not win if I had accepted the `have you stopped beating your wife?' terms of your question. So I did not accept the fallacious terms of your question but answered truthfully what the real issue is: the Vatican knows the Shroud is authentic, but refuses to confirm or deny it. Presumably because (as I have written before) if the Vatican had to start confirming or denying which of its many claimed relics were authentic, it would have to admit that almost all of them were fakes.You have had more than your normal \"only one comment per individual under each one of my posts\" (see my policies above) so this was your last comment under this post.Stephen E.
