I was starting to wonder if anyone else was reading this off-topic post. Are you a Shroudie (or anti-Shroudie) and a (competitive) chessplayer?>Anand had white twice in a row because they switched order of colours halfway through the match. OK. I did not realise they were going to do that. But it seems fair though, come to think of it.>This means Anand will have black in the last game, but for now, it seems like the match will be over before that happens. The match is effectively over now with Carlsen two games up with four games to play. Anand seems to think so too, by not playing Sicilians as Black, nor gambits as White. It looks like he has already conceded the match and his goal now is not to be beaten by too much?Unless Anand's desperate plan is to lull Carlsen into a false sense of security, and get to the last two games being still two down, and then throw the kitchen sink at Carlsen, hoping he will lose the second last game. Then Carlsen might be so rattled at the prospect of not winning the World Championship that he thought was already won that he might then lose the last game also?Stephen E.
