I hadn't realised that the latest Google Analytics map shows China as the second highest source of viewers of my blog!My thoughts on that are the same as my August \"Editorial and Comments\" that \"most of my readers are [in August] in the Russian Federation, which is particularly gratifying to me that I can provide information about the Shroud to people who might otherwise have difficulty finding that information.\"Stephen E. Jones----------------------------------MY POLICIES. Comments are moderated. Those I consider off-topic, offensive or sub-standard will not appear. Except that comments under my latest post can be on any Shroud-related topic. I normally allow only one comment per individual under each one of my posts.\n\n","author":"Stephen E.
