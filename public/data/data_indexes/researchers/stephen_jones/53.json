That is interesting.I did not know about the other head cloth artifact. Nor about the coins on the eyes.It's funny. When I was initially reading about the 3D-like body image revealed by scan? in the cloth, it popped into my head the phrase, \"Whose image and superscription is this?\".Then I read some more and came across your article on the coins!Fascinating.Thankyou,GraemeP.S.

He never will fake something which he invented, because this is absolutely nonsense. Both conditions are not satisfied in the case of the Shroud of Turin, because neither the New Testament nor the apocryphal writings mention a single line about the existence of a cloth with the dorsal and frontal images of Jesus’ body. Christian tradition, on the contrary, mentions a cloth with only Jesus’ face (the Veronica veil). One would expect that this veil would be faked instead. Before the Middle Age, nothing is mentioned about it, as well. Why will a supposed forger be at the same time so skilled in order to make such an astonishing masterpiece (which even today is very difficult-if not impossible- to copy) and so silly in order to ‘fake’ something unknown at his time? This would be the greatest paradox of all time!\n\n","author":"Tersio","date":"April 15, 2010 at 9:13 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2009/12/shroud-of-turin-is-burial-sheet-of.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nThe Shroud of Turin is the Burial Sheet of Jesus!\n","post":"\n\nTersio>What all skeptics do not notice ... or simulate ignorance ... is the fact that a forger only fakes something either preexisting or something which is known throughout the history. ...Thanks for your comment.

But that is the case for the Shroud, which has features (e.g. negative photography, correct venous and arterial blood circulation, blood serum halos that can only be seen in ultraviolet light, etc) that were unknown to medieval or earlier science.However, since my stated policy is to not allow extended debate on an issue, you have had your last word on this topic.

I have split my reply into two parts because of its length.>I wasn't totally convinced by it but couldn't answer all its points. You seem to be very knowledgeable on the topic so I figured you might be interested.I am now back working as a high school teacher, so I don't have the time to drop everything and answer this website's points one-by-one. However, when I do get the time, e.g. in a term break, I may do so.However all of this website's \"Strong evidence against the authenticity of the shroud\" and \"Circumstantial evidence against the authenticity of the shroud\" has been plausibly answered. And at least one of the claims is simply false, e.g.:\"There is no blood on the shroud: all the forensic tests specific for blood, and only blood, have failed.\"The late Dr. Alan D. Adler, whose specialty was blood chemistry, after an exhaustive series of tests confirmed that, \"the red stuff on the Shroud is emphatically, and without any reservation, nothing else but B-L-O-O-D!\" (his emphasis):\"Adler was asked how he could answer McCrone's claim that there was no blood, but merely a mixture of red ocher and vermilion. Adler flashed on the screen the following table from our paper. Table 5 Tests confirming the presence of whole blood on the Shroud 1. High iron in blood areas by X-ray fluorescence 2. Indicative reflection spectra 3. Indicative microspectrophotometric transmission spectra 4. Chemical generation of characteristic porphyrin fluorescence 5. Positive hemochromogen tests 6. Positive cyanomethemoglobin tests 7. Positive detection of bile pigments 8. Positive demonstration of protein 9. Positive indication of albumin 10. Protease tests, leaving no residue 11. Positive immunological test for human albumin 12. Microscopic appearance as compared with appropriate controls 13. Forensic judgment of the appearance of the various wound and blood marks Then, after explaining each item briefly, Al said, `That means that the red stuff on the Shroud is emphatically, and without any reservation, nothing else but B-L-O-O-D!'\" (Heller, J.H., 1983, \"Report on the Shroud of Turin,\" Houghton Mifflin Co: Boston MA, pp.215-216.

To be honest I don't know. But if I had to pick the most promising method, I would say it could have been constructed using a rubbing technique on a bas-relief model.\"But the \"bas-relief model,\" far from being \"promising\" is just another one of the many failed naturalistic alternatives of how the Shroud's image was formed. Indeed, that the \"bas-relief model\" is just one of many so-called \"promising\" naturalistic methods of forming the Shroud's image, is itself evidence that other Shroud anti-authenticity advocates regard it as inadequate. Also the \"bas-relief model\" conflicts with the website's own citing of \"a Catholic bishop's [d'Arcis] report to Pope Clement VII, dated 1389, stating that ... a predecessor had `discovered the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it'\". The website cannot have it both ways. If the Shroud was \"painted\" then it should be advocating the \"painting model\" not the  \"bas-relief model.\" But if the Shroud was not \"painted\" (which it wasn't) then this bishop's report was wrong (which it is)!Stephen E.
