[{"title":"Update to Stephen Jones’ Blog","post":"Dan\nThanks for your feedback. I tried uploading my full size 1190 x 2885 pixel scanned image but Blogger for some reason displayed the bottom end of the image green.\nI then uploaded a 70% size 809 x 1962 pixel version of it which was larger than the previous image and Blogger left it as the original colour. But clicking on Blogger’s 400 pixel wide depiction of that image did not enlarge it to its underlying 809 pixel width. It may be the 1962 pixel length of it that is the problem?\nAs it seems the image cannot be enlarged by clicking on it within Blogger’s limitations I have removed the “(click to enlarge)” instruction.\nStephen E. Jones\n\n","date":"January 14, 2013 at 8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/14/update-to-stephen-jones-blog/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21982","author":"Stephen E.
