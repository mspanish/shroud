[{"title":"\nShroud name index `W'\n","post":"\n\nAppreciate that this is a bit late, but I have only just read The Turin Shroud by Ian Wilson, having come  across it in a  second hand book shop.Would just like to make one point.  Wilson relates the story of the woman who wipes Jesus' face with her veil;  the cloth then reveals 'the true image' (\"Veronica\")of Jesus' face.  Jesus is reported to have said:  All honour to you, courageous woman.This may sound somewhat flowery in English, but the phrase 'all honour to you' is a regular expression in Hebrew (don't know about Aramaic) and is often used in the sense of 'good for you',  or 'well done'.  Similarly, the words courageous woman, recall another well known expression in Hebrew - eshet chayil.  These are the first words in the famous lines in Proverbs, where the phrase is usually translated as 'a woman of worth'but could perhaps more readily be translated as woman of courage.  Although, as Wilson notes, the story doesn't come from the New Testament, and is thought of as a myth, I found it very interesting that the reported speech would translate back to Hebrew so readily.\n\n","author":"Rona Hart","date":"February 13, 2017 at 1:27 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2008/02/shroud-of-turin-name-index-w.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nShroud name index `W'\n","post":"\n\nRonaThanks for your interesting comment,I will reply to it under my latest post, \"Three-dimensional #20: The man on the Shroud: The evidence is overwhelming that the Turin Shroud is authentic!\"That way more people will see it.Stephen E.
