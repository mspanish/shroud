The English is excellent, making for easy reading, and if he sought assistance for this, it showed good judgement.  I agree with him up to the point that it cannot be definitively asserted that the image had a miraculous origin, as up to the present time there is insufficient evidence.  It is an error of judgement for a scientist, or even an engineer, to assert at this stage that it does have a miraculous origin, although one might have a private view about this.  However, where I think I may depart from Yannick’s expressed viewpoint, is that it MAY have a miraculous origin.  I suggest that one piece of evidence that could support this view, is the apparent lack of body deformation on the dorsal view – it appears to be suspended weightless in space – or to put it another way, it is as if the image was formed in the upright position.  It is of course possible that the body may have been placed on its side, which could also explain the lack of dorsal body deformation. \nIt is an obligatory requirement of Catholic belief that miracles can and do happen (Check out the Catholic catechism).  However there is no obligatory requirement for any belief that any specific event generally deemed miraculous, was in fact miraculous.  It is well-known that the Church requires aduequate proof of miracle(s) for the causes of canonisation of saints.  Most of these are otherwise inexplicable healings, but other miracles are also admitted (check catechism). \nYannick, and also others, in their various comments, often emphasise the importance of understanding the chemical processes involved in forming the TS image.  However I also think it important to be accepting of various possible explanations involving the discipline of Physics.  The science of Physics may be just as important as Chemistry, and possibly even more so.  I have often mentioned in other postings the work of Giovanna de Liso, who obtained intriguing high-definition 3D images under moderate earthquake activity.  \nEarthquakes may be viewed as some kind of supernatural activity in Quebec.  I can assure Yannick that we take them in our stride in NZ, and also doubtless they do in California and Japan, and also apparently in Italy.  Nor are they rare events in the Middle East.  This week in NZ, we have just had one of our dormant central North island volcanos wake up spewing ash, after being asleep for over 100 years,  But I suspect it had little to do with the publication of Scientific Research and Essays in Academic Journals!\n\n","date":"August 7, 2012 at 5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/07/and-yannick-responds-to-giulios-comments/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14599","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Reacts to Special Issue","post":"¡Hidroxiprolina!\n¡Un MAGNÍFICO argumento a favor de la AUTENTICIDAD!\n-En el individuo normal, SANO, la hidroxiprolina se encuentra como TRAZAS en el suero sanguíneo, y en mayor cantidad en la orina como hidroxiprolina libre y hidroxiprolina conjugada con péptidos.\n-En el individuo ENFERMO con diversas patologías que aquí no interesan, la hidroxiprolina aumenta en el suero sanguíneo y sobre todo en la orina.\n-¿Adivinan en qué situaciones AUMENTA de forma considerable la hidroxiprolina tanto en el suero sanguíneo como en la orina?\n-La hidroxiprolina aumenta de manera muy considerable en suero sanguíneo y en orina en los INTENSOS ESTIRAMIENTOS MUSCULARES MANTENIDOS, lo que es bien conocido por la medicina del deporte.\n– No se me ocurre un ESTIRAMIENTO MUSCULAR MANTENIDO MÁS INTENSO que el proporcionado por 3 horas de CRUCIFIXIÓN.\n[el pico de hidroxiprolina en la muestra procedente del talón me sugiere “contaminación” por la orina.

After that, the sample was given to Ray Rogers by Gonella in 1980 for analysis.  Rogers state in his book that the sample came to him in a very bad state.  Here’s what he say about that : “There was very little sample in the envelope (note : in fact, there was only some red flecks that were still there).  The Zina sample had been cut to pieces.”\nNevermind that fact, Rogers choose go ahead and analyzed some red flecks found in the envelope with the method known as pyrolisys mass-spectrometry, which is a very precise method to found any organic material that would be present in a sample.  Even if the state of the sample was no good, he still did the analysis because he did some previous chemical testings on the biggest red fleck he could find in the envelope and the results give him a good confidence that this red material was really blood.  For the pyrolisys mass-spectrometry, he got a high peak that indicate the presence of hydroxyproline.  Carlos interpretation of this result is, of course, interesting in the context of a tortured and crucified body, but I think we should be careful not too extrapolate too much from this one single finding.  I really don’t know if Heller and Adler have found traces of hydroxyproline in their own blood sample analysis.  I’m really not sure about that.  If hydroxyproline could be confirm in other blood samples coming from elsewhere on the Shroud, then the interpretation of Carlos would be much more possible in my mind.\nAnyway, it’s important to note that it’s not the most important thing that came out of this particular analysis of the red fleck made by Rogers.  Let’s hear Rogers himself about that : “The appearance of a low-temperature emission of hydroxyproline sets a definite upper limit on the highest temperature that could have been seen by the blood after it appear on the cloth.  The blood WAS NEVER HEATED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE  by boiling the Shroud in oil (as sometimes had been suggested) or BY THE IMAGE-FORMATION PROCESS.”\nTo me, that’s the main finding that came from the pyrolisys mass-spectrometry analysis of the Zina samples that was made by Rogers.  This finding is very important because it tend to corroborate the idea that the image formation process was probably active at room temperature without creating a high increase of temperature.  This goes well with any natural image formation process involving a chemical reaction between the surface of the cloth and some biological substances coming from the dead body.  Of course, this is just one clue in favor of these kind of chemical hypotheses, and never constitute a proof.  But anyway, in my mind, this is an important data that point directly in that direction and not at all in the direction of some kind of energetic radiation that would have come from the corpse.  \nIt would be interesting if one day, some independent researchers could confirm this finding of Rogers, by using another blood sample that would come from another part of the Shroud and that would be in a better state of conservation.  Independent confirmation my friends !  Everything is there.  And in the case of any findings concerning the Shroud, I think it’s even more prudent to wait for 2 different independent confirmation coming from 2 different samples before considering a particular finding as an authentic fact !!!\n\n","date":"August 12, 2012 at 6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/07/and-yannick-responds-to-giulios-comments/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14850","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Reacts to Special Issue","post":"Muy interesante Carlito!

In fact, it’s precisely the opposite !  It ensure us that he had no religious bias when it comes to Shroud research, which is something we can’t say of many modern Shroud “scientists”.  Religious thinking MUST stay out of any credible scientific research, and this is also true (even more maybe) concerning the study of the Shroud of Turin (because it’s so easy to fall into that religious or supernatural trap for any scientist who happen to be at the same time a Christian devotee).  And if sometimes Rogers could have sounded like a “preacher” in his writings (I agree), it is most probably due to the fact that he felt that many persons in the Shroud world (researchers) were not doing science as it should be and he wanted to teach them the RIGHT WAY to do science (whether it concern the Shroud or any other material object in the Universe).  \nIn the end, I prefer 1000 times to see a Raymond Rogers (no matter what was his personal beliefs versus God and the Resurrection of Christ) doing Shroud researches with integrity, rigor and professionalism than seeing all those religious biased people who pretend doing Shroud science these days.  How can you trust these researchers, their hypotheses and their findings when you have a profound sense that these people have a preconceived notion (religious of course) versus the Shroud ?  \nWith a scientist like Rogers, even if he could have made mistakes like anyone else, at least, there was no such religious bias and we can easily assume without too much risks that his research was not driven by his personal feeling (or preconceived ideas) because, as a rationalist, he had no will to “use” the Shroud for any purpose whatsoever…   \nSome people in the anti-Rogers clique seems to try hard these days to discredit his honesty versus his researches on the Shroud by saying that he desperately wanted to show that the image was formed naturally.  But…  WHAT ELSE CAN YOU EXPECT OF A REAL SCIENTIST ???  Of course he will try hard to find a natural explanation for the image !!!  Of course, since he’s a scientist (and not a Jesus freak) !  \nAnd for sure, that don’t make him someone with some obscure agenda to “disprove” the supernatural reality of the Shroud !

It utterly fails to acknowledge the role of religion in the development of science, commencing with the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas; pioneers in Renaissance science, including astronomers Copernicus and Galileo, Founders of the calculus Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz; and so many others who came after them, Kepler, Blaise Pascal and so on.  The break-through with Aquinas demonstrated that order was to be sought in the workings of the universe, and that phenomena were not the work of a capricious God or random Fate.  Even the battling Bernoulli family with all their internal strife were originally intended for the Church.  \nAt the heart of the Arab development commencing in the fifth century, was the motivation of Islamic objectives.  The atheism and agnosticism of some modern scientists with their so-called “rational” approach is a relatively modern phenomenon.  Commencing in the 12th c, the universities were founded on religious principles, and required religious affirmation.  \nThe assertion makes the assumption that professional scientists are unable to set aside their religious beliefs in a way that compromises their scientific endeavours.  It fails to understand the professionalism and integrity with which professional scientists approach their work.  \nShroud researches have advanced most significantly by those with a religious belief, or as a result of their research, came to such a belief.  What is being said is that only atheists can make a useful contribution to Shroud research.  This is even more ludicrous than asserting that only scientists with a religious belief should carry out such research!  To deify the work of Rogers, is to misdirect the object of true worship.  It also fails to allow that in fact, for all we may know, there may only be a supernatural explanation for the image. that only scientists can provide an explanation.  In over 100 years of shroud research, they have still failed to come up with an answer!\n“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and not rely on your knowledge.\nIn all ways Acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight”.

You’ll see that I’ve developed 4 possible scenarios to explain the relic and that one of them (the last one) include the possibility that the image on the Shroud could come, directly or not, from the Resurrection of Christ.  And if you pay attention to the footnote related to the description I’ve make of the 4th scenario, you’ll read this : “This 4th scenario might shock some because it is based on a dogma of faith (the Resurrection of Christ) and, by definition, it goes beyond the pure scientific rationality. But, since the Shroud of Turin is considered by Christian tradition as being the authentic burial cloth of Jesus-Christ, it seems justified to keep open that possibility, even if, in face of all the known and confirmed data, such a scenario is not necessarily the most probable. For a very detailed analysis of that possibility, see: Raymond N. Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, Barrie Schwortz Editor and Publisher, July 2008. \nSo, I hope now you can admit the fact that it’s not true that I have completely shut the door to the possibility of a miraculous event in the case of the Shroud, even if I don’t considered this avenue as the most probable !  Stating that the image on the Shroud could not have been, in any way, a direct product or a by-product of the Resurrection of Christ was not the point I tried to make with my editorial letter.  In fact, I agree with you that, on a PERSONAL AND PRIVATE BASIS, it is truly possible for someone to BELIEVE that the image on the Shroud is related to the Resurrection of Christ.  I know very well that this is not an idea that the Catholic Church officially promote, but I don’t think we should (or can) FORCE someone to deny that faith if it’s what he believe.  Besides, we can teach them properly about the Shroud and his image, but that’s another story…\nAnyway, the MOST IMPORTANT POINT I wanted to express in my editorial is this :  If someone (and it is pretty evident that, sadly, there are many modern sindonologists in that category) start or base his study of the Shroud of Turin on the preconceived notion that the Resurrection SHOULD have something to do with the body image on the cloth and, consequently, avoid, neglect or, even worse, refuse completely to considered properly all the possibilities that exist for a natural occurring image formation, especially in the light of the observations, conclusions and hypotheses reported by Ray Rogers and others (especially concerning the probable chromophore of the image), then this person is guilty of doing a bad science, because it is religiously biased.  Period.  As I often said here on the blog, religious dogmas or ideas should not have anything to do with any good scientific research.  And if such a person go ever further and try to “prove” the Resurrection using the image on the Shroud, then this is called “doing science with a religious agenda in the back of your mind” and it is a complete shame in comparison to any scientific research that is performed in the state of the art, following completely and honestly the scientific method (i.e. following ALL the data and facts no matter where it leads you and what the conclusion can be, even if it goes against some preconceived notions you could have at the beginning).  A “scientist” that would be found guilty of such a “crime” should not be considered “reliable” no more on this particular subject and I’m sure there’s some modern sindonologists (I don’t want to mention any name here) that are part of that group !\nIt’s interesting you mention the fact that the Catholic Church will NEVER proclaim a miracle before science has done a complete in-dept analysis of the reported phenomenon and find out that this phenomenon CANNOT be scientifically explained by the known Laws of nature.\nI really think that if we apply this notion with honesty (and without any religious feelings) to the image on the image on the Shroud, we have to conclude that it is not possible, in this particular case, to call this a “miracle” (and the Church never claim the image to be miraculous by the way) for the simple and good reason that it is really premature to state that science CANNOT explained this thing with the known Laws of nature.  That’s the reality because the Shroud and his image, up until this day, has not been DIRECTLY analyzed enough by science for someone to claim that science has come full circle concerning this image and 1- is still not able to define and understand his nature (the chromophore) and 2- is still not able to describe a natural theory that can account for all the known physical and chemical characteristics of the image.\nEven if a lot of researches have been made on the relic, we have to understand that direct testing has only been made once (by STURP and some Italians in 1978 and the years following), along with some more researches done after that by other scientists claiming they have worked with authentic samples from the Shroud.  In this context, I really don’t think anyone has the right to proclaim that science has made a full and complete examination of the relic so far.  The best proof of that can be found in the fact that the STURP team, right after having published his final peer-reviewed article concerning the research on the Shroud, was already asking permission to the Cardinal of Turin and the Vatican for a second round of direct testing on the cloth !!!!  \nBecause of the fact that science still need further testing on this relic before it can be said that the analysis is complete, no one can proclaim that the image SHOULD have been caused by a miraculous event.\nPersonally, I think science is pretty close to answer the first question concerning the image chromophore and concerning the second question (the one related to the image formation process), it’s evident that this will be the more complex “mystery” to resolve, but if we can understand perfectly the real nature of the chromophore (question #1), then I truly believe science would be in a pretty good position to find the proper answer for the second question, especially if more testing under laboratory conditions can be performed to analyze more deeply some interesting natural image formation processes like the Maillard reaction proposed by Rogers (and there are others natural suggestions also interesting that exist) in the context of a body who suffered a long torture prior to his death by crucifixion and who was enveloped (probably loosely) in a shroud that was probably manufactured with the ancient method of making linen cloths.  \nIn fact, this is precisely the SECOND MOST IMPORTANT POINT I wanted to make with this editorial letter !  To me, if science can finally find what is the real nature of the image chromphore (without any serious doubt), then it will be much easier to evaluate correctly all the proposal that have been made over the years concerning the most probable process (or processes) that can explain the image formation on the cloth in the very particular context I just describe.  And this should hallowed science to finally have a much clearer idea of the direction where to search in order to find the solution to this enigma.  I really think that this should be sufficient to eventually permit the resolution (once and for all) of this “mystery”, thanks to the scientific method.\nIf what I just said could be confirmed in the future, then I don’t think the possibility for the body image to have come from the Resurrection of Christ (and consequently, to be called “miraculous”) will still be there.  Remember what Sagan said :  Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.  It’s not because the image is not fully understood today that it will always be that way in the future and that we have the right to call for a supernatural event in order to explain it…  This TRUTH is very important if we want to stay scientifically sound in our analysis of the Shroud of Turin and his image (or any other material objects in the Universe by the way).  Remember that science, in face of something it can’t explain, will ALWAYS add that this is only true for today because, as Barbet said very well in his book :  WE CAN’T PRESUME OF THE FUTURE !  So, that why you will always see conclusions like this :  In the PRESENT STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, science cannot explain this phenomenon.  \nIT IS EXACTLY THE SAME WITH THE SHROUD and, if we want to stay scientifically credible, we should recognized that there is no good reason (not even the tradition that state it is the burial Shroud of Christ) to believe otherwise !  And let’s never forget what Francisco Alconchel-Pecino said in his recent paper about the C14 issue : “Probably the controversy arose because, once more, HUMAN INNOCENCE WAS SURPRISED BY THE SUBTELTIES OF MOTHER NATURE.”  This great TRUTH should always be kept in mind when it comes to analyzed the Shroud and his image… Unfortunately, this is not always the case (to say the least) !\nAnd concerning the idea that an earthquake could be responsible for the image, front and back, of a human corpse on a linen shroud, I’m sure I’m not the only to find this possibility quite absurd.  Anyway, as I said, let’s wait for science to finally find out what is the true nature of the image chromophore and then, we’ll have a much better scientific basis to analyze properly if this hypothesis of the earthquakes can have any chances to explain the image on the Shroud…  Is it a deal ??? ;-)\nBut be sure of one thing (I don’t want to presume of anything here.  I just emit an hypothesis), if Rogers was correct about the image chromphore (i.e. that it resides ONLY in a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers), then this earthquakes hypothesis (or any other hypothesis involving an energetic radiation) would really be in jeopardy.  That’s why the exact nature of the image chromophore is so important to confirm and, in my mind, that should be the MAIN QUESTION that an eventual new series of direct researches on the cloth SHOULD TRY TO ANSWER IN PRIORITY.  Because you can be sure of one thing : if the question of the chromophore is not properly answered and stay covered in doubt (as it is today), it will never be possible to prove any hypothesis of image formation !  \nI hope that my call concerning the resolution of this most important issue will be heard by some competent ears !!!  One thing’s for sure : It doesn’t seem to have been heard by M. Fanti !  I say that because in his most recent paper “Open issues regarding the Turin Shroud”, here’s the 3 major issues in his mind : The formation of the image (as expected, it comes in #1 place even if, as I said, it should always come in #2, after the image chromophore), the conservation and his dating.  You see ? NOT EVEN A WORD about the most crucial question of it all concerning the Shroud, which is the image chromophore !!!!  This is truly incredible and pretty shameful…  Let’s hope that other scientists will heard my call much better than M. Fanti, who seem to think (wrongly) that this question of the chromophore was settled with his 2010 paper in which he proclaimed, without any chemical testing to back it up, that the image chromophore was most probably the primary cell wall and not a thin layer of impurity on top of the fibers !!!!  As I said in my editorial, it’s not surprising at all that he claimed this, since it is truly possible to colored only the primary cell wall of a linen fiber without affecting his core with a corona discharge (as demonstrated by an experiment done by Rogers himself !!!).  \nMeditate on that for a while and you’ll see that all this doesn’t smell very good, to say the least.  And what is also important (and shameful) to note is the fact that this question of the chromophore seem to be (wrongly) settled in the mind of many other sindonologists.  I say that because, in Valencia earlier this year, a bunch of them had no difficulty to sign a list of “facts” proposed by M. Rolfe, in which we originally found the hypothesis of the primary cell wall, while the hypothesis of Rogers was completely cast out !!!  To me, this is a VERY GOOD CLUE that clearly shows the very bad state of sindonology these days…  I’ll say it again : This is really shameful !!!  When he see that, Rogers (and others) must turn over in his grave !!!  THE FACT IS THIS : THE QUESTION OF THE IMAGE CHROMOPHORE HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY CONFIRMED YET AND SHROUD SCIENCE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT INSTEAD OF ON IMAGE FORMATION !!!  It’s only when this question will be properly settled that we could focus our attention on the image formation process…\nFinal note :  At least, there’s one good thing that can be found in this paper from Fanti :  For the first time (to my knowledge), in page 3 of his paper, he recognize the fallacy of his conclusion of the probabilistic model he once made and that gave a probability of 100% (!) that the Shroud is really the authentic Shroud of Jesus Christ (note : he doesn’t say “Jesus of Nazareth” as it should for a scientist, but “Jesus Christ”, which speak very loud to me).  At least, here, M. Fanti was able to recognize that his result had no value whatsoever because they were based on “subjective evaluations”.  At least, this recognition is one good point for him !!!\nP.S. : I am currently writing a follow up paper to my article concerning the authenticity of the Shroud and, in it, I will do an in-deep analysis of the second part of the question of the Shroud authenticity, which is the real identity of the man of the Shroud.  I hope to be able to finish it this autumn…  One thing’s for sure : you will never see me stating that the probability that this is really the Shroud of Jesus (of Nazareth !!!) is 100%, simply because it wouldn’t be an acceptable conclusion, scientifically speaking.  On that particular question, we’re dealing with probabilities, not certainties!\n\n","date":"August 9, 2012 at 8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/07/and-yannick-responds-to-giulios-comments/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14654","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
