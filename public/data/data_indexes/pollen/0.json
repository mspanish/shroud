[{"title":"The Pollen Scam?","post":"As I have said before, I am not a scientist.  But I think that common sense should tell us that the Shroud would have pollen on it from where ever it had been kept, open up, laid down, folded  up etc. for it’s about 2,000 year history,  Some of it may even have dirty smudges from hands, or what ever it was laid down on and/or stored on or in.  The Shroud is the Lords present to us, we must honor it and take care of it.\n\n","date":"November 10, 2015 at 5:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/10/the-pollen-scam/","cat":"science","id":"comment-214463","author":"ekmcmahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Pollen Scam?","post":"I was indebted to Gaetano Ciccone’s paper for some of my research in ‘Problems with Pollen’, in the BSTS Newsletter June 2014.

NO\nOpponents of Shroud authenticity use the «difficulties» in interpreting the data of pollen studies as an argument to dismiss all the honest work done on this issue.\nIf it’s  true that Professor Danim changed his mind relative to his previous assertions on pollen classification and no longer used it as an evidence of including Palestine in the geographical track of the Shroud I must ask?\n1-Was Palynologist Professor Baruch wrong interpreting Dr. Max Frei  tapes?\n2-Could the difficulties in classifying pollen on Dr. Max Frei tapes be caused by age deterioration of the samples?\nIWe must remember that Dr. Frei’s classification was challenged namely by Professor Litt more than 20 years after he got the pollen samples.\nSeveral botanists did agree with Dr. Frei classification and botanist Dr. Mariotti-Lippi wrote«I concluded that the Shroud in some unspecified period of time stayed in the Middle East.»in\nhttp://www.sindone.info/VALENC-6.PDF\n It seems to me that Professor Fanti’s et al studies on Shroud plant DNA is a serious study and a careful reading allows us to conclude that the Shroud had been in Middle East during a period of its existence.\nProfessor Lucotte’s paper allows to conclude likewise.\n Perhaps authenticists cannot use the Pollen evidence as a very «strong» one for establishing an exact geographical trail of the Shroud but skeptics cannot use these problems with pollens to dismiss the Shroud’s authenticity or claim an european mediaeval origin either.\nSo it turns out that the importancet of Professors Fanti and Lucotte’s studies (remember that the last one also mentioned the finding of mineral particles from a desertic soil) was to grant the possibility that the Shroud had been in Plalestine during a period of it’s existence.\nWere not these important papers, with all the controversy(possibly unjustified) on the Pollens, even the fact that the Shroud had been in the Middle East would be challenged by the skeptics.\n                                                                                                   regards\n                                                                                      Antero de Frias Moreira\n                                                                               Centro Português de Sindonologia\n\n","date":"November 10, 2015 at 2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/10/the-pollen-scam/","cat":"science","id":"comment-214472","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"}]
