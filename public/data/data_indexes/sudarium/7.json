In the case of the Sudarium, we do have details about the radiocarbon dating, so it is not to be taken very seriously and, as you know, the 1988 dating of the Shroud is controversial, there are just too many doubts for one to be sure about the results.\nThe Shroud is not an article of faith in the Catholic Church, but many Catholics and Orthodox Christians venerate relics, not Protestants. Yet, the Shroud is an ecumenical topic and can help bring Christians together.\n \n\n","date":"April 8, 2015 at 5:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/06/new-paper-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"sudarium","id":"comment-195767","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper on the Sudarium of Oviedo","post":"Sorry, I meant “we do not have details” about the radiocarbon dating of the Sudarium.
