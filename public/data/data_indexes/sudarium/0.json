[{"title":"And now the Sudarium of Oviedo: The Novel","post":"Back in the 1950s, I vaguely recollect my parents’ generations called this sort of trash, ‘Penny dreadfuls’;  I think you could buy them from the pulp bookshops for a penny at one time, but only hack writers ever wrote the stuff.  Maybe they only paid the writers a penny a page.  Sort of Mills & Boone genre.  Will Noelle’s devout atheism be intellectually challenged by her breathtaking scientific breakthroughs?  Will the guy get the gal?  And Farran de Clare? Will he surrender his Templar celibacy?  And she’ll need a villain in the mix as well.  You can actually write this stuff with the brain in neutral!\n\n","date":"August 21, 2012 at 6:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/21/and-now-the-sudarium-of-oviedo-the-novel/","cat":"books","id":"comment-15303","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
