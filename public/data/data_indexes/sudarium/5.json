Nor does it appear in any of the identifications of any of the subsequent pollen investigators (Danin, Baruch, Litt, Whanger). Its identification on the Shroud by Marzia Boi has been based entirely on photographs of type specimens and not on any actual Shroud pollen, either on tape or photographed.\n2) Be that as it may, Avinoam Danin, in his Flora of Israel site (http://flora.org.il/), lists two species of Helichrysum, pallasii and sanguineum. The former is rare and does not flower till late June and can be rejected. The latter is common, grows around Jerusalem, and flowers in April.\n3) Helichrysum sanguineum is an entomophilous flower whose pollen could not have blown onto the Sudarium. Its pollen could only have arrived on the blood of the cloth by being placed there. Despite Boi’s etymology (heli-chrysum : sun-gold), H. sanguineum flowers are deep red, are sometimes called the Blood of the Maccabees, and have a similar significance as a memorial to fallen warriors as the poppy does in Western Europe. I do not know when this symbolism emerged, but at face value, the plant does not seem inappropriate for Jesus.\n4) It is not clear to me what the precise relationship is supposed to have been between the Sudarium and the Shroud.\na) Did the Sudarium cover the face, and the Shroud cover the Sudarium? The appearance of the image of the face on the Shroud through two layers of blood soaked Sudarium seems to me incredible.\nb) Did the Sudarium cover the face for the transport of the body to the tomb, whereupon it was removed and replaced by the Shroud? In which case why should it have been covered with flowers?\n5) What is the provenance of the sample examined by the electron microscope? To date, at least on this site, there has been absolutely no evidence for any supposed pollen identification of the Sudarium other than vague suggestions. If Max Frei, or anyone else, took tape samples from the Sudarium, when did he do it, where is his report and where are the slides?\n6) As has been mentioned Helichrysum species are found all over Europe, the pollen in individual species are difficult to identify, so there is nothing in this report that prevents the Sudarium from being an early medieval creation, as suggested by its (also unconfirmed) radiocarbon date.\n\n","date":"February 15, 2015 at 9:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/15/important-new-pollen-discovery-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-191116","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important New Pollen Discovery on the Sudarium of Oviedo?","post":"Hugh:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/bennettpantxteng.pdf\nand http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/bennettpanppteng.pdf\n\n","date":"February 15, 2015 at 10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/15/important-new-pollen-discovery-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-191120","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important New Pollen Discovery on the Sudarium of Oviedo?","post":"Thanks, OK, but this is very much a secondary source. “At least nine of the sixteen species of pollen found on the Sudarium grow in Palestine”, says Bennet of page 4, and “There are about thirty types of pollen grains, three of which indicate that the Sudarium was in Palestine, and the rest clearly indicate a flora belonging to the Mediterranean region” she says on page 5. How does Janice Bennet know this? I guess she is quoting from two reports. Where are they? She mentions three Palestinian pollens, Quercus, Pistacia and Tamarix. Not Helichrysum, and not even Gundelia, which is a cornerstone of the Whanger/Danin hypothesis. How strange. Slide 18 on the pdf announces: “The electronic scan microscope makes it possible to identify a large number of pollen grains.” What does this mean? There are two pictures of pollen grains taken by a scanning electron microscope, but the microscope illustrated is not a scanning electron microscope, nor it is how Max Frei took his specimens.

Regarding the observation that the pollen is adhered to the blood, thus subsequent contamination can be ruled out.  This logically raises the question, what do electron micrographs of pollen not adhered to the blood look like?  Are the points of all of the spikes completely on the surface? Has it been considered that folding, rolling of the cloth at some point in time, may have affected how this is perceived, i.e. that a grain may have been pressed more into the fiber (dried bloodstain) than when it originally landed? \n2. Another (main) point is: The pollen is adhered to the blood, so they arrived on the cloth at the same time.  Okay, when was this? That is, scientifically speaking, what data is there that speaks to when the blood arrived on this particular cloth? \nIt would be important that these (and other) studies reach the point that the results could be formally summarized and submitted to a major scientific journal.  For most scientific investigations, the order is typically the reverse: publication first, then any type of press announcement is secondary.  \nIt is expected that a reviewer would pose similar questions as those above (and others). Scientists naturally question things, even (and most importantly) in their own research. When others ask questions about a particular scientist’s ideas, it may sometimes be perceived as challenging (threatening), but it need not be.  It’s about trying to sort out what is real and what is not.  There is circumstantial evidence to possibly link the two cloths in association with each other.  What would it really take?  That’s something each person has to decide for himself or herself: what level of scientific rigor is necessary in the context of what could be done given the age, condition, and accessibility of both cloths.\n\n","date":"February 15, 2015 at 12:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/15/important-new-pollen-discovery-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-191124","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Important New Pollen Discovery on the Sudarium of Oviedo?","post":"The story goes that the  sudarium was one of many relics from the last week of Christ’s life that were kept in a chest apparently made by the apostles themselves.
