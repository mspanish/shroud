[{"title":"The Carbon Dating of the Sudarium of Oviedo Plus the Caves of the Sudarium","post":"I’ve been  at 2012 Valencia Shroud Conference and as far as I recall a spanish member of Centro Español de Sindonologia whose name I no longer remember stated something interesting on this issue.\nHe stated that the results of 2007 radiocarbon dating the Sudarium of Oviedo around 700 A.D. had to be explained by some factor(s) that skewed the tests, namely contamination.\nSo a study had been done by scientists from Centro Español de Sindonologia and microscopic examination of the fabric-whose images were shown on the screen to the attendance- determined the presence of many tiny carbonaceous particles over the threads,resulting from a previous fire in the Oviedo Cathedral, he called the particles the black particles \nAccordingly to this scientist the presence of those carbonaceous particles which were impossible to completely extract from the sample by the cleaning procedures were responsible by the younger dating than expected.\nIf anyone has something to add I’d appreciate.\n                                                                          regards\n                                                       Antero de Frias Moreira.\n                                                 (Centro Português de Sindonologia)\n\n","date":"April 24, 2014 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/24/the-carbon-dating-of-the-sudarium-of-oviedo-plus-the-caves-of-the-sudarium/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-103135","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Carbon Dating of the Sudarium of Oviedo Plus the Caves of the Sudarium","post":"Thanks Antero,this is similar to what Hesemann describes, but I need more details. Where was the sample taken, what was the actual results, what was the laboratory report etc. The main problem is that to skew the C14 result from circa 30 Ad to circa 750 AD, one needs about 36-40 % of modern carbon. And that is quite much, I think. Only hydrocarbon substances, like oil (of course organic, not mineral) or wax may give enough carbon, and the problem is how large percent of contaminated sample they may be.\n\n","date":"April 24, 2014 at 7:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/24/the-carbon-dating-of-the-sudarium-of-oviedo-plus-the-caves-of-the-sudarium/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-103155","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Carbon Dating of the Sudarium of Oviedo Plus the Caves of the Sudarium","post":"Unfortunately I can´t remember further details.\nI lloked for the Valencia paper dealing with this subject but it was not available.\nMaybe if you contact Centro Español de Sindonologia they will give you the anwer to your legitimate questions\nNevertheless I got the idea that radiocarbon dating of Sudarium of Oviedo would never provide accurate results because of the impossibility to remove those carbonaceous debris.\n                                                                        regards\n                                                         Antero de Frias Moreira\n\n","date":"April 24, 2014 at 9:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/24/the-carbon-dating-of-the-sudarium-of-oviedo-plus-the-caves-of-the-sudarium/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-103202","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Carbon Dating of the Sudarium of Oviedo Plus the Caves of the Sudarium","post":"“Five samples from five different cloths..”\nSorry if I missed it, but was the Sudarium sample from (just) a single site?\n\n","date":"April 24, 2014 at 2:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/24/the-carbon-dating-of-the-sudarium-of-oviedo-plus-the-caves-of-the-sudarium/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-103299","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Carbon Dating of the Sudarium of Oviedo Plus the Caves of the Sudarium","post":"We don’t know.
