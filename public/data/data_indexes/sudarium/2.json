I started to study the Shroud after somone found an old article circa 1800's about the Shroud.   For the last few weeks I have reviewed many ideas and hope to visit our nations largest store house of info in a few weeks.   Having spoke with a research assitant I was told a 20-page document is held at the National Lib.  IT's said to be written by an assitant to the pope who did in fact watch while Germans reviewed the shroud during the time of Hitler.   I hope to review the document when I visit.  However, it's written in German so I have hired somone who speaks german to read the document to me.  I'll keep your url link and if I find my info will be helpful I will be happy to send details.  God Bless your efforts\n\n","author":"Anonymous","date":"August 25, 2008 at 10:50 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2007/08/bogus-shroud-of-turin-10-shrouds-blood.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nBogus: Shroud of Turin? #10: The Shroud's blood and pollen closely matches the Sudarium of Oviedo's\n","post":"\n\nAnonymous>Thanks so much for your post. I just read your article. Thanks for your comment. You might also read my three-part post, beginning: Re: In my humble opinion, the Shroud of Turin is a hoax #1>I started to study the Shroud after somone found an old article circa 1800's about the Shroud. You did not say what was the author and title of this 19th century article.>For the last few weeks I have reviewed many ideas and hope to visit our nations largest store house of info in a few weeks. OK. However, be aware that there is a lot of confusing information about the Shroud. Even many (if not most) Christians, are prejudiced against it (as I was, see my Introduction to my The Shroud of Turin (TSoT) blog!).  >Having spoke with a research assitant I was told a 20-page document is held at the National Lib. ... You don't say if this is the same 1800's article. Nor what country you are in. >I hope to review the document when I visit. ... I'll keep your url link and if I find my info will be helpful I will be happy to send details. Thanks. I would be interested in what it says. It may already have been translated. If you comment again what its author and title is (in German and/or translated English) then I may be able to tell you if it has.  >God Bless your effortsThanks. The same to you!Stephen E.
