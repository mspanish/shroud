[{"title":"Embarrassed Left: Medieval Shroud of Turin Presented to Gullible Masses","post":"I think it is important to distinguish between the atheists “Left” who are locked into a nineteenth century Marxist’s mindset and the Christian left who are locked into a St. Matthew’s first century mindset. I graduated from high school in 1954. It was year of Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that decreed the integration of Public Schools in the US, and the year that Willie Mays made one of the greatest plays in American baseball history that is described in a Wikipedia entry labeled “The Catch (Baseball).” It was also the year of the televised Army-McCarthy hearings in the United States Senate which ultimately ended career of anti-Communist zealot Joseph McCarthy\nTo me, the first, most significant, step taken by Pope Francis was reviving the sainthood process for Archbishop Romero whose was murdered in his El Salvadorian Cathedral by a right wing deaths squad of the US backed government.  Similar death squads in one incident murdered six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and the housekeeper’s child; and in another three nuns and a lay health worker (all US citizens) who they first raped and tortured before killing them. The US ambassador was relieved by the Reagan Administration for protesting too much.\nIt has been reported that some Wall Street analysts study Marx because he was quite good at analyzing actions of capitalists. That’s a little different than the atheistic Marxists represented by the author of the article in question. I suppose my politics are a little to the right of St. Matthew.\n\n","date":"May 5, 2015 at 5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/05/embarrassed-left-medieval-shroud-of-turin-presented-to-gullible-masses/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-198341","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Embarrassed Left: Medieval Shroud of Turin Presented to Gullible Masses","post":"Marxists have killed more people, (especially Catholics) then any other form of government.\nIn fact Mary warned “spreading errors” at Fatima…happened exactly as she said it would\n\n","date":"May 5, 2015 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/05/embarrassed-left-medieval-shroud-of-turin-presented-to-gullible-masses/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-198380","author":"rick","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Embarrassed Left: Medieval Shroud of Turin Presented to Gullible Masses","post":"Dan, that is tricky writing by you.
