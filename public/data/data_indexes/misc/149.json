Every credible historian who is expert in Byzantine history that is independent of mind on the subject of the Shroud will tell you :  these two hypotheses don’t rest on any solid ground at all and can be seen as interesting fairy tales.\n\n","date":"June 3, 2013 at 2:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/every-year-millions-travel-to-rome-to-view-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-35919","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Every year, millions travel to Rome to view the shroud . . . ???","post":"YC commits the same error as Artifactory. Dogmatic assertions based on error, spin and personal belief! Artifactory claims TS is in Rome – it’s in Turin of course -, Edessa was not a village, it was the principal Christian city in the East before 500 AD, more so after the destruction of Antioch, and a major centre of Christian scholarship and a refuge for persecuted Christians; there is sufficient evidence that the Shroud MAY POSSIBLY have been in Edessa, including the likeness of icons to the TS facial image, and which were claimed to be based on an image not made by human hands and known as the “Image of Edessa”, whatever that might have been.  Genuine attempts have been attempted to reconstruct a plausible history with the utmost integrity, and with such supporting evidence as can be found. They cannot be dismissed as “fairy tales” quite so easily. Such assertions originate with anti-authenticist academics, who prefer to relegate the TS to being a medieval artifact, rather than their so-called “independence of mind”. It MAY have been in Edessa. No alternative hypothesis has ever been seriously postulated, and there is not a scrap of evidence that it was anywhere else except Edessa! Of the very many relics recovered by Helena from Palestine and taken to Constantinople, there is no object recorded that could possibly be identified as the Shroud! Provocative and negative dogmatic assertions cast no illumination! Likening the “Edessa hypothesis” to Dan Brown’s fantasy of Jesus being married to Mary Magdalen bears no comparison at all.\n\n","date":"June 3, 2013 at 5:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/every-year-millions-travel-to-rome-to-view-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-35950","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Every year, millions travel to Rome to view the shroud . . . ???","post":"Quote: “the Shroud MAY POSSIBLY have been in Edessa”\nMy reply:  This is pure speculation…  Period.
