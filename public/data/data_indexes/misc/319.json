She seems to be continuing its tradition of publishing half-truths.  It’s perhaps not too surprising that there has been global sourced DNA present on the Shroud cloth;  Pilgrims from all over the world had been flocking to view its several earlier ‘al fresco’ expositions.  \nIf the Shroud emerged from a hidden unknown source today, it’s doubtful it would get past Customs bio-security clearance.  Paper this morning published an article of  a NZ art-work locked up in Australian Customs for the past five years for this reason.  They’re now considering destroying it.  We always suspected they were philistines over there.  \nhttp://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/73238285/shots-fired-at-aussie-philistines-after-kiwi-artwork-quarantined\n\n","date":"October 21, 2015 at 2:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/20/news-about-the-shroud-pass-it-on-well-most-of-it/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-213275","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
