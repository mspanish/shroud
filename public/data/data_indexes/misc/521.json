[{"title":"The Shroud of Turin Exhibit & Museum in Alamogordo","post":"Please note our phone number has changed to 575-415-5206. Thank you for your blog and for stopping by the exhibit. While the phone cameras do demonstrate the photonegative properties discovered by Secundo Pia in 1898, they are not 3D. The 3D is shown on the green-screen connected to the VP-8 Analyzer and in the works by Dr. Soons as well as the cardboard model images, re, Jackson and Jumper’s work. Thank you again for letting others know about the Shroud exhibit and museum. – – – Events@ShroudNM.com\n\n","date":"May 27, 2013 at 12:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/26/the-shroud-of-turin-exhibit-museum-in-alamogordo/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-35022","author":"Pete Schumacher","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin Exhibit & Museum in Alamogordo","post":"The 3D characteristic of the Shroud includes the entire front and back of the body image.  This first allows us to recreate the exact manner of how the body was laying at the time the image was formed.  The Vatican exhibit contains such a “statue” in repose and the knees and head are tilted up.  Forensics tell us that any such body is in rigor mortis.  We also know that rigor mortis relaxes after a max of 48 hours.  Thus, the 3D characteristic of the Shroud image establishes that the image was formed in the first 48 hours after death.  In other words, we are given a timeline for image formation by the 3D characteristic.  Also interesting to note that if the person forming the image died at about 3 PM on Friday it was about 40 hours until dawn on Sunday – well within the 48 hour limit.  Could this be the purpose of the 3D??  Very interesting!!\n\n","date":"May 27, 2013 at 1:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/26/the-shroud-of-turin-exhibit-museum-in-alamogordo/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-35033","author":"Larry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin Exhibit & Museum in Alamogordo","post":"Thanks Larry.
