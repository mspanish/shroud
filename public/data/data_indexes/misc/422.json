[{"title":"Scientific Conference on the Shroud of Turin","post":"I’m doing my best to get the IEEE to withdraw its support for this conference. I filed an ethics complaint against Bruno Barberis and others with the Ethics and Members Conduct Committee of the IEEE. This complaint is basically the same as the complaint I filed against Cardinal Dolan for suppressing my slideshow/lecture with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. If the IEEE sanctions Barberis, it will in effect be criticizing the Catholic Church for promoting the authenticity of the Holy Shroud.\n\n","date":"August 6, 2014 at 7:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/06/scientific-conference-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-142583","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Scientific Conference on the Shroud of Turin","post":"“So far, some elements seem to be clear: the scientific results have let say with certainty that the image was produced through a natural process that involved the body of a human being.”\nThe imaged was produced through a natural process with CERTAINTY?

Also, your reference to “natural process” makes no sense to me. All processes are natural. There is no such thing as a “supernatural process.” If you think the Shroud is authentic, you should keep it to yourself. Saying the Shroud is authentic is like saying God caused the Big Bang. There is no evidence God caused the Big Bang.\n\n","date":"August 6, 2014 at 10:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/06/scientific-conference-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-142597","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Scientific Conference on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Who caused the big bang?\n\n","date":"August 6, 2014 at 4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/06/scientific-conference-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-142643","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Scientific Conference on the Shroud of Turin","post":"There is no evidence God caused the Big Bang.
