[{"title":"Bad Archaeology at Bad Archaeology","post":"Slight error above Dan; Line stated; “Did you mention that the cloth contains measurable vanillin but that the carbon dating samples do not?” …it should read the other way around. The carbon samples tested for vanillin, not the main cloth.\nI also question the 3d statement, as the way I understand it there is no ‘computer’ program exactly as the VP-8, a computer program ‘may’ give ‘similar’ results but not exactly. Oh and paintings, photos, BAS-RELIEFS and DRAWINGS have all been tested under the vp-8 analyzer and from what I understand NONE showed the same results as the Shroud!….People seem to forget that the ‘inventor’ of the VP-8 himself, has been quoted that only the Shroud emits the 3d image, nothing else.\nR\n\n","date":"January 28, 2012 at 11:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/28/bad-archaeology-at-bad-archaeology/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7630","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bad Archaeology at Bad Archaeology","post":"Thanks, Ron.
