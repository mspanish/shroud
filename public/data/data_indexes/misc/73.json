But it is just not like that, there are doctors in the Church who have been women. Pope John Paul II refused to allow the ordination of women, calling attention to Jesus’ twelve male disciples. Did that make Jesus a “male chauvinist”? Of course not, women had other roles to play\nIt is quite some time that Christ’s birth, death and resurrection are being questioned. It began in Germany in the nineteenth century and continues till today. However, even a liberal Protestant scholar and pastor like Helmut Koester has stated that the “quest for the historical Jesus” has got nowhere and should be laid to rest for the time being.\n\n","date":"April 25, 2014 at 11:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/bill-donohue-on-the-ten-commandments-the-shroud-of-turin-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-103644","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bill Donohue on the Ten Commandments, the Shroud of Turin and More","post":"Did the “male-dominated” Jesus movement make Jesus learn how to cook?

The natural conclusion of John’s gospel is at 20:30-31, and ch 21 seems to be an Appendix.  My JB version has the note “Possibly the words of a group of John’s disciples”.  Perhaps it was added to provide a significant third post-resurrection appearance (reinforcement).  Did Jesus cook? Maybe!\n\n","date":"April 29, 2014 at 9:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/bill-donohue-on-the-ten-commandments-the-shroud-of-turin-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-106179","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bill Donohue on the Ten Commandments, the Shroud of Turin and More","post":"Your alternative could be correct.

Its notes are excellent. I use to argue regularly with our scholarly assistant priest, now teaching theology at an Auckland seminary about its relative merits. He preferred the recent more literal translations as being more true to content. I considered that while the language might make good Greek, their English came out rather stilted, likewise I have difficulty with the new standard English translations of the Mass.  Seldom do they benefit from any poetic expertise on their translation boards, whereas the Gospel is meant to be proclaimed and the language should reflect that and be sympathetic to it. \nThe USCCB translation is quite good, with good notes, and is on line which makes it convenient for ‘copy and paste’;\nhttp://www.usccb.org/bible/books-of-the-bible/\n\n","date":"April 30, 2014 at 12:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/bill-donohue-on-the-ten-commandments-the-shroud-of-turin-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-106305","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
