[{"title":"Gripping Comment Promoted thus expanding Teaser of the Day #2","post":"For a scientific paper claiming to be :A Critical Summary …”, I’d have to agree with Hugh that Sieker and Spicer have been fairly careless and uncritical in their write-up, but maybe Hugh is just being a little too scientifically pedantic, even precious, in his criticism.  It would seem that the two scientists have endeavoured to generalize conclusions resulting from the work of John Jackson and Eric Jumper which began around 1968.  Ian Wilson first mentions this work in his 1978 book at Chapter XXII.  Doubtless there are now more detailed and better write-ups available on this work, probably on the Shroud.com site. \nJackson and Jumper recruited another Air-Force colleague who seemed to match the TSM’s physique and draped a cloth over the subject.  They measured the body-cloth distance and correlated their results with readings from a densitometer on a Shroud negative, obtaining a perfect match.  Their further investigations with the VP-8 image analyzer followed, leading to the various 3-D images so familiar to us now. \nHow objective generalized scientific conclusions resulting from.that work may be written up is a matter of skill in accurate report writing.  I’ll confine my conclusions merely to saying that the Shroud clearly contains 3-D encoding of the subject, a property first noticed by Paul Vignon following the development of Secondo Pia’s photographic negatives.  The work of Jackson & Jumper quantified this property.  This 3-D property cannot be denied!\n\n","date":"February 1, 2013 at 3:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/01/gripping-comment-promoted-thus-expanding-teaser-of-the-day-2/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23178","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gripping Comment Promoted thus expanding Teaser of the Day #2","post":"Precious… good word… however, I wonder if you could be a little more specific here. I have seen photos of the cloth, carefully marked out with various coordinates, draped over the body, and seen how well the bloodstains fit and so on. But remind me, having draped a cloth over a body, how was the cloth-body distance measured? And in how many places? In the photos, the cloth is draped quite neatly around the back of the head, the sides of the shoulders and the legs, and yet, although the cloth-body distance is these places is clearly zero, no equivalent dark image image appears on the shroud.\n\n","date":"February 1, 2013 at 8:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/01/gripping-comment-promoted-thus-expanding-teaser-of-the-day-2/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23195","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gripping Comment Promoted thus expanding Teaser of the Day #2","post":"Hugh can easily do what I just did, Go to the Shroud.com site and search on “Jackson and Jumper” – there’s 10 articles listed on each of 7 pages which he can access.

I have the 26 page “Correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3-D structure of a human body shape” before me, specifically the graph labelled Figure 2. For those not familiar with Jumper and Jackson’s remarkably inventive technique, this is what they did. They photographed the head of a man lying on the ground from the side, with and without a cloth draped over it. By superimposing the two photographs, the vertical distance between the two outlines could be measured. As it is difficult to identify most of the body parts with sufficient specificity, data from 13 places on the real head was compared with intensity data from 13 equivalent places on the shroud. Figure 2 shows the relationship. Being good scientists, they find that although the null hypothesis (that there is no correlation between image intensity and cloth-body distance) can be rejected, very little can be confidently asserted about what the relationship is. (The perfect match” quoted by daveb has, like so many derivations from original papers, become part of shroud dogma, but is in fact wholly fictitious.) They might have refined their calculations by omitting three, closely-spaced results which appear to me to be outliers, but, being good scientists, they didn’t.\nThese 13 cloth-body measurements, of 13 points on the head, provide the whole rationale for every subsequent attempt to read three-dimensional information from the shroud. And it works astonishingly well. Jumper and Jackson’s further investigations take the correlation as read, and devote the rest of their time to deforming the whole body image derived from it (which they find very unconvincing as is) until it matches the observed profile of a prone volunteer, thus establishing a theoretical cloth shape which looks entirely convincing. Other investigations using the same idea demonstrate that the cloth is more flexible along the warp than the weft, rather like, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, unrolling a carpet or a Venetian blind over a body.\nThe most important point about all this is that the cloth-body measurements that work so well were all made vertically (indeed, how could they not be, from a face?), not perpendicularly to either body or cloth, which fact has interesting ramifications for ideas about gas diffusion and minimum distance, among others.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 9:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/01/gripping-comment-promoted-thus-expanding-teaser-of-the-day-2/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23239","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Gripping Comment Promoted thus expanding Teaser of the Day #2","post":"Thanks for the detailed explanation Hugh.  However, Wilson does write that they draped the cloth over the whole body, (not just the head) and provides diagrams of the arrangement, with a graph showing full body length medial section relative opacity.  I should think it has some factual basis in what J & J actually carried out.  \nComments in your last para above are intriguing.  In Dan’s subsequent posting on this topic, Gabriel hints that there must be implications about the image-forming process.  One might hypothesize for instance that if it has a chemical basis, then perhaps the gas(?) molecules emitted by the body are inherently unstable, and in the finite time that they take to arrive at the cloth are partly converted to a stable form, resulting in different concentrations at the cloth, giving the correlation between luminance (conversely opacity) and cloth-body distance.  However I suppose other hypotheses could of course also be suggested.  But from the correlation,it seems remarkable that random variations don’t seem to be as significant as one might reasonably expect in such a process.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/01/gripping-comment-promoted-thus-expanding-teaser-of-the-day-2/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","id":"comment-23257","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
