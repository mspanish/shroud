I wonder why, or how, this particular image was used.\nSecondly, one has to be very precise about exactly what any particular FFT does. The weave of the Shroud means that the image appears largely on the warp threads, and not on the weft. Thus the warp threads are darker than the weft threads. However, in any photo, the weft threads appear the darker, because they are in shadow, forming ‘valleys’ between the warp thread ‘ridges.’ If we wish to remove the diagonal striping, we can average out the colour between say, a weft thread and one or both of its adjacent warp threads, or we could lighten the weft threads until they match the colour or intensity of the warp threads on either side. The latter would be preferable.\nWhat’s more, such ‘blood’ as remains on the Shroud is largely confined to the ‘valleys’ between the ‘ridges’ having been abraded from the more superficial threads, so that weft ‘bloodstain’ threads really are darker than ‘warp’ bloodstain’ threads, as well as appearing darker anyway because of the shadow effect. To achieve a uniform ‘blood’ colour, it would be better to lighten the weft a little to remove the shadow, and then to darken the warp to replace the blood where it has been worn off.\nI would like to know what exactly any particular FFT achieves in real terms. Using a negative (and a black and white one at that) means that one is in danger of manipulating artefacts of the photo rather than understanding what, and where, the image actually is.\n\n","date":"October 11, 2015 at 6:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/11/removing-weave-pattern-from-images-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-212282","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Removing Weave Pattern from Images of the Shroud of Turin","post":"I would like to know what exactly any particular FFT achieves in real terms.

My observations are largely based on Shroud 2.0, and for example, I will take the ‘spear wound stain’ which covers several directions of the ‘ribs’ of the herringbone weave. However careful Haltadefinizione were with their lighting, it is apparent that it comes from the top left of the photo, such that the warp thread ‘ribs’ going from top-right to bottom-left cast deeper shadows into the ‘valleys’ of weft threads than the ‘ribs’ from top left to bottom-right. It seems to me that although the warp threads of the ‘blood’ areas are slightly discoloured, the weft threads are more so, suggesting that the blood has largely abraded from the more superficial warp threads, but less so from the weft ones, being more protected.
