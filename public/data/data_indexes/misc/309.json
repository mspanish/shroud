With the sole exception of the Shroud, a tangible object, the selection listed above lie mainly in the realm of speculation and fancy. Some 20 years ago, Readers’ Digest published a handsome work “Great Mysteries of the Past” with several categories, and well-presented. It seems to have been adapted from a work published in Germany in 1990, “Wie geschah es wirklich?”.  My parents then still alive, made me a present of a copy, and I still have it.\n\n","date":"September 28, 2013 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/28/national-geographics-100-greatest-mysteries-revealed/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-45753","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"National Geographic’s 100 Greatest Mysteries Revealed","post":"I find it compelling evidence for the Shroud’s authenticity that, with all the analytical capabilities afforded to us by modern science, it has not been demonstrated to be a fake or a forgery, and that we also still lack a reasonable explanation for how the image is there in the first place.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 3:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/28/national-geographics-100-greatest-mysteries-revealed/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47390","author":"Ken E.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"National Geographic’s 100 Greatest Mysteries Revealed","post":"This magazine is the worst piece of overpriced crap you can waste your money and time on. Display cost $12.99 US, there are no ads so you are paying for the lack of those ads.  The print is large and dbl spaced the take up as much page space as possible with no real content. Whom ever wrote the stories was obviously biased and ill informed. There are no mysteries revealed and little to no factual information on any of the content. Shame on National Geo for ripping me off and dumbing me down.  Your magizine 100 greatest mysteries revealed should be re named to we suck and we dont care.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 2:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/28/national-geographics-100-greatest-mysteries-revealed/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50330","author":"Over priced crap","site":"shroudstory"}]
