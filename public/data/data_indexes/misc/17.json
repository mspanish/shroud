Lansa’s translation of the Holy Bible from the original Aramaic and was surprised to find the Gospel of John, concerning the linen burial clothes, did not mention “strips.”  See the following:\nARAMAIC\nJohn 20:5-7  And he looked in and saw the linen clothes lying: but he did not enter in.  Then Simon came after him and entered into the tomb; and he saw the linen clothes lying there.\nAnd the burial napkin which was bound around his head was not with the linen clothes, but was wrapped up and put in a place by itself.\nAt this point in time, I own the King James Version of the Bible, The Jewish New Testament translated from the Hebrew by David H. Stern and the Aramaic translation of both the Old and New Testaments by George M. Lansa.\nThe Hebrew translation of the NT by Stern, referring to John (same section as above), indicates the following:\nHEBREW\nJohn 20:5-7  Stooping down he saw the linen burial-sheets lying there, but did not go in.  Then, following him, Shim’on Kefa arrived, entered the tomb and saw the burial-sheets lying there, also the cloth that had been around his head, lying not with the sheets, but in a separate place and still folded up.\nNeither of the two versions, Aramaic nor Hebrew, refers to “linen strips,” but instead, linen clothes or burial-sheets.\nBest,\n\n","date":"October 9, 2013 at 9:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-46726","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"Angel, Excellent point!

But most people don’t pay too much to Biblical scholarship before voicing an opinion on whether the Shroud is authentic or not.  Another thought comes to mind concerning arguments based on John’s gospel–more related to common sense than scholarship.  I’m always amazed at how many people use the argument that John mentions linen clothes and since the Shroud is just one piece, it can’t be authentic.  That’s like saying if I lost a pair of shoes and find just one, it can’t be part of the pair because I originally lost 2.  And these folks somehow never think to mention that the Synoptics used the word “sindon,” which fits very well with the Shroud.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2013 at 11:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-46734","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"You can check five Greek versions, Jerome’s Latin Vulgate, and nine English versions, all in parallel at http://www.greeknewtestament.com/ \nThe five Greek all use the word ‘othonia’\nLatin Vulgate uses ‘linteamina’, from root ‘linum’ = flax or linen, hence signifies cloths(pl) made of linen; Of the nine English versions, eight either use ‘cloths’ or ‘clothes’.

In fact, during one occult ceremony when the blood of children was being offered as a sacrifice, he “wished to see the Devil” but in fact chickened out.  Crazy people will do what crazy people do: beat their children to death, starve them, kill their enemies or those who disagree with them, and whether they say “God made me do it” or the “Devil made me do it” or “People from outer space controlling  my brain with Z rays made me do it” they are still crazy. People have done horrible things in the name of God. But they did these things with ulterior motives, cloaking their evil designs behind holy trappings and the fears and gullibility of the ignorant. To impute this evil to Christianity itself is beneath contempt. No institution has been free of those who would abuse it for their own gain. The next time someone wants to point and say “SEE? He is a Christian and look what he did!” you might want to also say “he did not do this in the name of Christianity.  He did it because he was a bad man, no matter what he called himself.”  I would be ashamed of that kind of intellectual dishonesty sir.   Straw men burn easily.\n\n","date":"October 10, 2013 at 7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-46930","author":"Josie L.

I was, when I could work, an in-home care giver for many mental patients, not only those suffering from forms of dementia associated with brain deterioration but also Alzheimer’s disease and those experiencing psychosis related to frontal lobe deterioration.  That said, Gilles de Raes was one of Joan of Arc’s best commanders, a man fully in charge of his faculties and not-Inconsiderable intelligence and battle field strategy, when he chose to be.  There is Evil, sir, I do believe it, Evil with a big “E.”  Monsieur de Raes wanted Power, with a big P. How better to take a short-cut to Power than thru the Prince of the Powers of the Air, to whom it is given?  If Evil can be dissipated by few hours on a couch with a nice old fellow who says, in a German accent,” Tell me about your Muzzer..” or with a pill, I’m all for it.  But that is evil with a little “e,” and even the most horrifying human “monsters,” the Jeff Dahmers, the Ted Bundies, are, at their core, pathetic victims of ill treatment or, as you say, mental defectives.  No amount of pills or therapy(or lack thereof)  can account for the killing fields of Pol Pot, or Auschwitz.  THAT kind of evil nailed the Man to the Cross, and even he was not the Christ, THAT is still true.  Mankind is imbued with a sickness, the destructive, seductive desire for power that “seemeth right” but can only bring misery, just like the ring in the famous trilogy by Tolkein, that cannot be wielded for good, no matter how pure or high-minded one’s intentions.  Some of us still call it ‘sin,’ and the denial and suppression of it’s existence is Evil’s greatest triumph.

The lexicons are presumably based on a lot more than what a few writers of a minor Jewish sect set down in 1st century Palestine!\n\nIt is not the problem with the dictionaries. The problem is that some words can have multiple meanings -like in the case of  ‘sudarion’ and ‘othonia’. Just like the words ‘cloth’ and ‘linen’ can have multiple meanings in English. ‘Sudarion’ can mean either small or large cloth. The problem is what to choose. And translators usually chose to translate it as ‘napkin’, based on other places in the Bible where it is used in that meaning -so they think in this case it is also, but this is not certain. However, the Shroud o f Turin is also refered as ‘Sudario’ on some of the older paintings of it.\n\n","date":"October 12, 2013 at 6:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47185","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"O.K., \nHistorically speaking: \n1/ How long will you ignore the Kornelimönster “sudarium quod fuerat super caput Christus JXX vii” was presented as a gift for Charlemagne to his imperial manor by the Patriarch of Jerusalem?\n2/How long will you ignore since 812 it was kept in Aix/Aachen?\n3/ How long will you ignore since the mid 9th c.

Much more important is what the Charlemagne’s collection of burial cloths actually were, and where they came from. \n““Just I am not convinced about Sindon Munda and Shroud of Compiegne were two halves of the same cloth.” On which historical and factual ground? ”\nGorny&Rosikon (pg. 298) write that Sindon Munda (stored in Kornilmünster) allegedly was to be used to transfer the body from the cross to the tomb. Beside its size is 180×105 cm, while the Compiegne shroud was, according to Hesemann 237×125 cm (other sources claim it to be 245 cm long), so the widths don’t fit, (unless data for Compiegne are wrong).\n“4/How long will you ignore the veil mesasuring 3,50x6m, proceeding from Antiocha in Syria is made of byssum fabric, is 16 TIMES FOLDED UP ONTO ITSELF and preserved in a gauze-like protective fabric and tghus reduced to the size of a napkin? ” \nMax, do you have any sources for that? Gorny&Rosikon mention only that it measures 39×22 cm. Pierluigi Baima Bollone in his “Sindone, 101 domande e risposte” claims its original size was 615×352 cm, but today it measures only 39×22 cm, so I assumed it was either cut from the larger cloth, or its measures are wrong. \nAnd I think using 6×3.5 m cloth during burial is quite impracical.\nMax do you have primary documents for Charlemagne’s relics? Becuase I am not sure how much reliable the original tradition about them is. Due to complicated political relations around 800 AD  Charlemagne could obtain his collection of relics from Jerusalem, as well as from Constantinople, and some perhaps via Rome. \nCharlemagne possesed several relics, or rather “representative relics” or “brandea” (that means copies):\n1). Shroud of Compiegne, currently destroyed\n2). Sindon Munda, currently stored in Kornelimünster\n3). Sudarium Domini, currently stored in Kornelimünster\n4). Linteum Domini, the towel used to dry the Apostles’ feet, currently stored in Kornelimünster. What’s interesting, another towel was among the Constantinople’s relics sent by Latin Emperor Baldwin II to king Louis IX, see https://shroudstory.com/page/5/ So the other cloths were probably copies of those stored in Constantinople (or in Jerusalem, and later transferred to Constantinople).\nBesides those, Charlemagne possesed also:\n5.) The Holy Tunic of Argenteuil\n6.) The nail\n7.) Eight thorns from the Crown of Thorns.\n8.) Jesus’ loincloth, currently stored in Aachen and terribly bloodied.\nAnd several others.\n\n","date":"October 12, 2013 at 9:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47209","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"Correction:for the towel used to dry the Apostles’ feet https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/29/blood-from-a-picture-of-christ-links-to-the-shroud/\nHowever:\n22cm x16 =352 cm, it works.

The study on this is Matthew Gabriel and Jane Stuckey (eds,), The Legend of Charlemagne in the Middle Ages, Power, Faith and Crusades, Basingstoke, UK and New York, 2008. It is part of the consistent medieval practice of developing ‘backstories’ for relics for which there is no other  historical evidence. The Shroud of Turin is interesting in that no one in the Middle Ages developed such a backstory, although the dukes of Savoy did later claim that it came from Cyprus (via Margaret de Charny) as part of the possession of the de Luisignan family who were kings of Jerusalem and they claimed that it had been given to them in the eleventh century by the patriarch of Jerusalem.  (See  John Beldon Scott’s, Architecture for the Shroud,University of Chicago Press, 2003 -pages refs in the index under Lusignan.) To clamber back onto my hobby horse, yet another instance where the devotion to Ian Wilson has closed off research on alternative legends for the origins of the Shroud ( or at least, I have not come across any Shroud researcher other than the excellent Beldon Scott, whose book should be on every Shroud researcher’s shelves, who seems to be aware of this legend).\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 6:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47352","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"Because today it is anachronistic, but in fact it is worth studying -because in every legend is a grain of truth!\nSee:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheiropoietos_Monastery\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47356","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"Here are a few addenda and corrections to my previous posts and O.K.’s:\n1/  in 798-802, as a token of his esteem, Baghdad Caliph Harun al-Rashid (763-809), offered Charlemagne a brandeum or substitute relic of the Sindon Munda as gift.\n2/ The most likely original size for the Kornelimünster substitute relic called “Sindon Munda” is 480×120/5cm.

Moreover the two words are used in a very specific context: that of the Empty Tomb scene, and, last but not least, the koine Greek the writer used in his gospel is NOT natural Greek at all but translation Greek from Hebrew/Aramaic.\nNow the Greek word OTHONIA can read as cryptic hermeneutical crux via wordplay on the Hebrew phrase OTH YONA, “SIGN OF JONAH”, in conjunction with the Empty Tomb scene. It echoes BOTH Jonas’s Prayer (Jon 2:1-3)– “Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his G.od from the belly of the she-fish, and he said, “I called out from my limit for the LORD and he answered me; out of the Sheol (Abraham’s bosom) I called, my voice thou heardest” AND Matthew (Mat 12:40) – “For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” This is not just coincidental here.\nBesides the “Greek” word SOUDARION as the hellenisation of the Aramaic word SUDARA’ and his triliteral or triconsonantal root (Samekh-Rosh-Daleth) plays on the Hebrew/Aramaic word SEDER, “order, arrangement, and composition” in reference to the Passover Seder. It is also in Aramaic-Syriac sidar, “he arranged” and Akkadian sadaru, “to put in order, to weave”. Therefore cryptically speaking, it evokes at one and the same time the large wrap rolled up onto itself and the Passover Seder in conjunction with the Hebrew Letter Samekh (literally “fish bone”, first letter of the Aramaic word sudara’). Reminder the Turin Shroud itself is a piece of HERRINGBONE patterned linen in a 3:1 twill weave. \nFinally, based on the Hebrew verbal root (Y-Sh-‛Ah), the deceased’s Aramaic given name Yeshu‛a tells us about “[providential] salvation, deliverance, safety and… RESCUE” and back we are to Jonas’s story and Yeshua’s prophecy in Matthew 12:40…\n\n","date":"October 15, 2013 at 10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47563","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"Sovev, sovev, “round and round…\n\n","date":"October 15, 2013 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47564","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later","post":"Max, the problem is we still need two more cloths… In Constantinople, there were at least 3 cloth, the current TS, and two others.
