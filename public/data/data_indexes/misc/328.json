[{"title":"Of Biblical Blankets and Such in LiveScience","post":"I read further. The web-site is a curious mix of pop-science and pop-religion claiming some 385k likes. After the page 1 put-down as bait, you go to page 2 to read more for the hook, and we get the lesson according to Wesselow. That’s where the quasi-serious stuff starts. But it’s all really superficial, and it doesn’t seem to resolve the initial objections it poses. We get nothing more about the D’Arcis memo, and just a nod towards claims that the C-14 sample is alleged to be a patch. Nothing in depth at all really. It’s pop-stuff. I blame post-modernism! I guess that’s how kids get “educated”(?) these days. It’s probably run by high-school students.\n\n","date":"July 9, 2013 at 6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/09/of-biblical-blankets-and-such-in-livescience/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-38786","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Biblical Blankets and Such in LiveScience","post":"One wonders if the staff writer knew about what she was writing, given that the report is stale.
