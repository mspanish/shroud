Differs from protoporphyrin hemoglobin for the presence of two hydroxyethyl groups instead of two vinyl groups.

Its biological role seems minor and his presence in the wild is not currently certain.\nRemember also that hemoglobin consists of globulin and hematin.\nHere other informations:\n>Hematoidin, similar to bilirubin, is a reddish-brown pigment,\nfound in the form of rhombic crystals; does not contain iron,\nis insoluble in water, alcohol, or ether, but is soluble in chloroform.\n>It is found at the seat of old hemorrhages, and is generally considered\na later form of hemosiderin. …\nLink:\nhttp://chestofbooks.com/health/disease/Pathology/Hematoidin.html\n-*-*-*-*-*-\nHemin and Hans Fischer.\nHe was a German biochemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1930 for research into the constitution of hemin, the red blood pigment, and chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants…\nLink:\nhttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/260817/hemin\n\n","date":"April 8, 2015 at 8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/07/seeking-help-to-identify-an-image-called-superficiality/","cat":"reader_inquiry","id":"comment-195725","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Seeking Help To Identify an Image Called Superficiality","post":"Hemosiderin:\n>Hemosiderin often forms after bleeding (hemorrhage).

Fe concentrations were found in particular structures named siderosomes. The combined application of Extended energy loss fine structure (EXELFS) analysis, a “short-range” probe, and Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), a “long-range” probe, allowed us to investigate the atomic arrangement of proteins constituting the siderosomes. Results are compared with structural data obtained on purified proteins.
