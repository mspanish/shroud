[{"title":"Best Comment on the so-called Death Certificate on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Sorry. I don’t change my opinion.\nAbout Capasso, the most important point, I find your argument odd. Capasso didn’t examine the shroud itself. OK. He didn’t examine photographs of the shroud. What for ? What can you see naked eye ?\nHe examined and dated the handwritings peer-reviewed by Marion. What is the probability that he found them coherent and dated them from -50 to 50 ? It seems to me that it is a remote probability, especially in a single-blind experiment. But I agree it needs to be confirmed and peer-reviewed.\nFurthermore, it’s incorrect to say nobody sees the inscriptions again. Thierry Castex( cf. http://thierrycastex.blogspot.com/ ), in a article in Revue internationale du Linceul de Turin wrote he discovered the same inscriptions examinating the Barrie Schwortz photographs (1978).\nP.S. Forgive my english also !\n\n","date":"January 26, 2010 at 6:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/01/26/best-comment-on-the-so-called-death-certificate-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-960","author":"cazab","site":"shroudstory"}]
