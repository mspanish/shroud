[{"title":"Quote for Today byÂ Galileo","post":"Dear Galileo,\nYou are absolutely right. But,you did not mention where you want to use the God given faculties. These are to be used at the right place. to further explain my point, eyes are used to see the things and not to smell. Similarly, Nose is to smell the things and not to see the things.\nSimilarly, SENSE, REASON and INTELLECT is to be used at the right environments, for which these have been created by the creator. You have not to forgo the use these faculties. These will only provide you some benefit, when used at the right place and at right time. Those who use them correctly, they develop high status in all faculties, while those who use incorrectly, they lead to world wars.\nAyaz.\n\n","date":"February 26, 2011 at 6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/26/quote-for-today-by-galileo/","cat":"quotations","id":"comment-2626","author":"ayaz","site":"shroudstory"}]
