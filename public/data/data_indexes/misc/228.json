[{"title":"Is my mind closed? Or is it the other guy?","post":"“… only assertion acceptable to science.”  ???? If “science” has already DETERMINED the outcome or results of the research … then that is some really bad science. \nThese skeptics say the word “science” as if it actually means something. They indicate that “Science” has the only true answers. “Science” is the only objective source of knowledge. Well, if “Science” is deliberately BIASED in its perspective, then I would say that such “Science” is completely worthless. And yet, this guy is willing to place the worth of his eternal soul on such wobbly foundations as Science with an Agenda?  \nScience is bad enough even when it DOESN’T have an agenda!! Fifty years ago “Science” told us all to eat oleomargarine because butter was bad for us. Recently they determined that oleo might be worse than butter because it has “bad” cholesterols and butter has “good” cholesterols. Thank goodness I never gave up butter, it would have been 50 years wasted. \nThey also told us that chocolate and coffee were bad for us but have recently decided otherwise. Thank goodness I’m committed to my evil vices… which it turns out were not so evil after all. In fact, it might even be healthy to eat chocolate, drink coffee and smear real butter on my bread… in moderation. Obviously Science does not know everything, and to depend entirely on the wisdom of Science is, well, it’s a little astonishing. \nThe skeptics hold up Science as if it’s the ultimate virtue, but it doesn’t even take close inspection or analysis to know that the wisdom such Skeptics rely on is all an enormous crutch or diversion. They use it to skitter away from facing the real Truth.  \nThe poor, sorry Skeptics have no idea how foolish they sound to people who know their God and walk with Him every day.  I am alarmed for their future, I can actually see them cowering before God’s wrath someday and I wish I could turn them from it — but there seems to be very little we can say or do that will make a difference. \nFor one thing, they lack honesty. I’ve heard of a few who HONESTLY dug into research and learned some things. One guy was intent on discrediting the Resurrection of Christ and set out to prove it never happened. Instead, he became impressed by the fact that every one of the 11 disciples who knew Christ during His ministry suffered hideous tortures: and all but one died as martyrs. He concluded that the original Disciples really DID believe the things they were saying, to the point that they were willing to die for the Truth they preached. So he ended up turning to Christ as his Savior, too. \nAnd recently I read about a guy (here on this blog somewhere) who was convinced of the reality of Christ because of his study of the Shroud, which he initially believed was a fake. This is good news, it is very encouraging. I wish more of the pseudo-Skeptics would stop their mocking and get serious about doing some research of their own.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2011 at 3:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/29/is-my-mind-closed-or-is-it-the-other-guy/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3477","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is my mind closed?
