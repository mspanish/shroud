[{"title":"Francis Turretin had long hair","post":"A few comments:  Only the gospel of John mentions “strips” of linen, the other gospels only refer to a linen cloth.  The strips were likely strips of linen used to bind the wrists, ankles and head and perhaps strips around the outside of the cloth.  The use of a single linen cloth is mandated in the event of violent death with significant loss of blood.  The other cloth referred to as a “napkin” in John’s gospel is not the usual talit (prayer cloth) but was a cloth used to cover his face from the cross to the tomb.  It was folded up and placed next to the body and was not on the face in final burial.  The spices and oil were brought to the tomb but probably not applied due to the impending Passover sabbath.  The women were on their way to the tomb Sunday morning to finish anointing the body when they encountered the empty tomb.\n\n","date":"April 15, 2012 at 7:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/15/francis-turretin-had-long-hair/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10395","author":"Shroud Encounter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Francis Turretin had long hair","post":"“Strips’ is only one interpretation of a specific ancient koine greek word and most likely incorrectly interpretted. The more plausable interpratation if one studies more indepth, would be simply “cloths” nothing more.\nTurretinfan is also another one of the illogical band of morons that believe radiocarbon dating is somehow ‘flawless’ and it’s results not questionable. Which is “out and out false”. He should ask people in the field who do or use RCD for a living, and find out for himself how error prone it truly is and that the basic RCD method used, even today, relies on several unprovable assumptions to get to it’s results.\nR\n\n","date":"April 15, 2012 at 8:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/15/francis-turretin-had-long-hair/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10396","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Francis Turretin had long hair","post":"Dan,\n– The following is something I posted at\nhttp://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=226761&page=26 on the James Randi forum for skeptics of everything.\n1. In regard to doubting Rogers’ honesty (as was suggested in this thread), we have little or no reason to do that. Perhaps he was wrong in his conclusions, but we have no significant reason to doubt his honesty regarding them. It’s clearly possible that he was being dishonest, but the available evidence supports his honesty much more than it undermines his honesty.\n2. The scientific processes surrounding the carbon dating were not especially rigorous.\n3. Rogers found 3 major differences between the carbon dating (and Raes) samples and the rest of the cloth.\n4. In 2005, John L. Brown of the Georgia Institute of Technology confirmed Rogers’ findings.\n5. In 2008, a group from the Los Alamos National Naboratories also confirmed Rogers’ findings.\n6. Other scientific evidence supports a much earlier date than that concluded by the carbon dating.\n7. Historical evidence does also.\n8. Carbon dating is not foolproof, and is only part of the evidence. \n– I’m sure that there are more reasons for doubting the carbon dating results (some of which I probably, vaguely know about). Perhaps, you and the followers of this blog could point me to them.\n– Thanks.\n\n","date":"April 15, 2012 at 1:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/15/francis-turretin-had-long-hair/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10407","author":"Richard Savage","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Francis Turretin had long hair","post":"Richard. You still trying to convince those degenerates on that forum to see your side? …It’s useless, they have not the ability to see beyond their ignorance.

I do lose patience with yada yada yada. Until one of the medieval fake claimants comes up with a truly convincing argument for a medieval fake, maybe we only encourage them by engaging in endless debate with them. The one thing de Wesselow did do is demonstrate the absurdity of the medieval claims from an art historian’s point of view. It’s just too bad that for  whatever reason he went off the deep end with the Shroud as Resurrection argument. His claim wasn’t new as the Corvagio painting demonstrates.\nI was never very taken with suggestions about divine providence. I was brought up to believe the “lord helps those who helps themselves.” I have also felt, however, that a conversion of science and the Shroud which began at the turn of the last century might indicate that something was at work that might be more than coincidence and that, perhaps, the Shroud has been waiting for science to release its revelation about the reality of Christ.\nBut what strikes me now, is that the Pia’s historical photo shoot came at the same time that the science of quantum mechanics was taking form and that the Newtonian, determinsitic universe was beginning to collapse. Something really important is brewing. We may be privileged to participate in it.\nBut the yada yada yada of the doubters who do not have a scientific leg to stand on any more may be just a distraction. We may have important work to do.\n\n","date":"April 15, 2012 at 7:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/15/francis-turretin-had-long-hair/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10417","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Francis Turretin had long hair","post":"John,\n– I just now read your April 14 post, and tried to reply — but didn’t seem able to.
