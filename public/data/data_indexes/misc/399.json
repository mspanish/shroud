[{"title":"Religion on the Internet","post":"Most parishes, dioceses and churches have their own web-sites these days, but they’re of varying quality.  Often manned by volunteers, young enthusiasts on the move, they can sometimes get terribly dated when there’s no-one else to take over when the webmaster moves on.  One cathedral parish I checked out had little else on it except its celebrated choir.  But they’re slowly getting more professional. \nThe Catholic Encyclopedia is a wealth of authoritative iniformation with extensive discussion on most topics.  Vatican sites, various saints;  Wiki is often a good first start for further checking out.  Also type a few keywords of a Bible text that you vaguely remember, into your search engine , and you’ll usually drop onto specific references with extensive discussion on it.  One interesting site I found gave several versions of the original Greek New Testament, together with their various translations, verse by verse.  But there’s a lot of chaff out there amongst the grains of wheat.  I wouldn’t be without a good search engine.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2012 at 4:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/29/religion-on-the-internet/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-19644","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
