[{"title":"Paris","post":"Paris, never been there.  I said  a prayer for those killed and injured and feel bad that the citizens that live have to be afraid because of the sick minded people that feel they have to go around killing non-believers.  These people doing the killing seems to be following the directions of Satan or Lucifer whatever its name is.  The beast thinks it is better than God and is still capable of directing his nasty followers.  Problem is that his followers probably are not aware of it’s true identity.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2015 at 5:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214601","author":"Emmett McMahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"The attacks of (9+2)/(11+2)/2001+(2×7) started at 0:00 sidereal time;Mars upon nodal axis; Paris upon Boswash axis.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2015 at 8:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214602","author":"Jos Verhulst","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"I have read what happened in Paris.\nIn the past I’ve been in the city\nof Paris few times …\n…and now “it’s up to Rome,\nLondon and Washington”, this the\nhorrible proclamation accompanying\nthe celebrations of the supporters\nof the Isis, on Twitter, the attacks\nin Paris, with the hashtag ‘Paris in flames’.\nThe perspective (= after Paris,\nit’s up to “Rome, London and Washington”\nthis is what threatens the Islamic State\non social media) that was presented\nto our future is terrifying and\ntherefore the States should defend\nthemselves adequately.\n…No shortage of threats to Spain and\nPortugal, the territory of the ancient\nCaliphate in Europe…\n\n","date":"November 14, 2015 at 9:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214605","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"Thanks, Dan.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2015 at 11:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214609","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"Our sympathy to French people and prays for those who were murdered in this abominable killing\n                                                                  Centro Português de Sindonologia\n\n","date":"November 15, 2015 at 12:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214634","author":"Antero de Frias Moreira","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"About 6 months ago I was at Eifel Tower.\nWhy religions are teaching to kill others?\n\n","date":"November 14, 2015 at 4:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214614","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"You mean, why do people believe in Koran and Mohammed which teach the killing of Jews and Christians.\nAnswer: allah = satan\n\n","date":"November 16, 2015 at 9:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214658","author":"chuck hampton","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"Sampath, obsession with monotheism can be dangerous.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2015 at 7:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214618","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"Fluctuat nec mergitur.\n\n","date":"November 15, 2015 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214638","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"Very sad.

Simply, I would like to help people push their reflection a bit further…\nEven if it’s natural and very okay to pray for the victims, is there one single Christian who will remember those words of Christ and put them in practice?: “But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Matthew 5:44-45)\nAnd what if it would not be by praying for these sick people (so that they could see the light and get out of their darkness) that something could finally change in this sick world?\nThese words of Christ tell us who God really is and, obviously, he’s very different than us, because he loves and saves everyone of his children, even those who seems, for us, to be definately lost.\nWhen you read “scandalous” words like the ones I gave you, it’s not surprising that Jesus got killed by his Jewish brothers…  God is very different than us.  God is love and we all are sinners…\n\n","date":"November 16, 2015 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/14/paris/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214668","author":"Joe","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paris","post":"A prayer that goes beyond Paris.
