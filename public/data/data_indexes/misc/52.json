Only watched it because it was on TV. I was also disappointed Hanks would take the role, but I guess money talks! I find it funny the report states that “it was an acknowledgement of that story’s debt to their research” LOL. What! to false research? You’ve got to wonder what would Jesus think about these people who would show false witness to the truth, for the sake of the almighty dollar? and if these authors ever think about the ramifications?\nRon.\n\n","date":"November 18, 2011 at 5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/18/from-the-i-didnt-know-that-dept-lynn-picknett-and-clive-prince-appeared-in-the-da-vinci-code/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-4872","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
