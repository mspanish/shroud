Also re-read the Acts of the Apostles (Ac 10:10-16; 11:5-10) re Peter’s ‘co-lateral’ vision of the creatures he saw in a sheet as a remarkable cryptic resurrection scenario.\n“I (Peter) was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. 6 I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air. 7 Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’ 8 “I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ 9 “The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’ 10 This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.”\nA vision of wild beasts such as a lion head with a leopard body?\n\n","date":"June 6, 2013 at 7:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/06/most-unlikely-yet-overwhelming-success-story-of-all-unrecorded-time/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-36270","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Most unlikely yet overwhelming success story of all unrecorded time","post":"This is funny.

The doubt in regard to what is here really meant is as old as Chrysostom. The latter says, (Horn. x. on this epistle) “that the word (phailonen) denotes a garment (to himation = a very large rectangle of fabric that can be draped as a shawl, a cloak, or a head covering)”.\n  The philological fact is the word can read as a reference to a very large wrap, wrapping fabric or wrapper. Now the Greek Word φαιλόνην (phailonen) is derived from the ancient Greek word phaos, “to shine”, “give light” (e.g. a heavenly light such as surrounds angels when they appear on earth) or “make manifest”. \n  Thus philologically speaking, the word phailonen most accurately denotes “a very large wrap that shines and/or makes manifest (through a porthole in the middle?)” and can refer to the TS shroud as a 4.44m long and 1.13m wide sindon/himation in which shines (in full daylight or natural transmitted light) the crucifixion victim’s bloody body (or just face?) image as visual epitome of the Gospels. Reminder: the phailonen Paul asked is mentioned along with books (2 Th 4 13: The large wrap that I (Paul) left at Troas, with Carpus, when you come, bring with you: and the books, especially the parchments).\n\n","date":"June 11, 2013 at 11:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/06/most-unlikely-yet-overwhelming-success-story-of-all-unrecorded-time/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-36701","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Most unlikely yet overwhelming success story of all unrecorded time","post":"Tpo: phao, “to shine”….\n\n","date":"June 11, 2013 at 1:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/06/most-unlikely-yet-overwhelming-success-story-of-all-unrecorded-time/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-36715","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Most unlikely yet overwhelming success story of all unrecorded time","post":"+typo: phlainoes\n\n","date":"June 11, 2013 at 1:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/06/most-unlikely-yet-overwhelming-success-story-of-all-unrecorded-time/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-36716","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Most unlikely yet overwhelming success story of all unrecorded time","post":"Ooops; I meant phenoles/phainoles (too hasty typing)\n\n","date":"June 11, 2013 at 1:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/06/most-unlikely-yet-overwhelming-success-story-of-all-unrecorded-time/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-36717","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Most unlikely yet overwhelming success story of all unrecorded time","post":"Reminder: The Greek word phelonen/phailonen, “large shining wrap” (2Th 4: 13) is to read in the light of the TS body image as the latter when seen under a certain angle and light, looks like translucid straw yellow impression.
