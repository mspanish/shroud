[{"title":"We Can Fantasize, Anyway","post":"The site says Paul’s texts have an “enormous impact in Christian communities and in politics today.” This is an understatement. Not only the best Christian scholars but Jewish ones as well are doing their best to “decipher” Paul and his explanation about the meaning of Christ. It is recognised that Paul is someone who has to be reckoned with, he can help elucidate the interpretation of history for those who subscribe to the Bible.\n\n","date":"January 23, 2014 at 7:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/23/we-can-fantasize-anyway/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-74219","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"We Can Fantasize, Anyway","post":"The site says “such an important impact in Christian communities and in politics today.” This is an understatement. Paul’s texts are proving to be something very difficult to “decipher” not only by Christian but also by Jewish scholars. This is not surprising for an apostle who went very deep into the meaning of Christ and important for those who subscribe to the Bible.\nThere will be problems when it comes to what Paul wrote and what is being demanded in Christian circles today, not to speak about the interpretation of history.\n\n","date":"January 23, 2014 at 8:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/23/we-can-fantasize-anyway/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-74224","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
