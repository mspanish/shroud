[{"title":"Hathos Warning","post":"The video in question is an edited and shortened version of a program produced in 2010 by nuns from the Chemin Neuf community in Lyon, France. The original title is “He Is the Image of the Invisible God – Shroud of Turin,” which was released in June 2010 on a 16 language DVD. Here is a link to the original program on our website store page: http://www.shroud.com/obtain.htm#Video. Also appearing in the original program were Thibault Heimburger, Christian Cataldo, Ed Prior and others. I have no idea who re-edited the program or whether they obtained permission to do so. You can view the entire original 35 minute version of the program on the Net For God website at this link: http://www.netforgod.tv/VOD/index.html (Scroll down the list of programs and select: “Il est l’image du Dieu invisible Le Linceul de Turin,” then select the language you wish to view in).\n\n","date":"June 19, 2014 at 1:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/hathos-warning/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-131342","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hathos Warning","post":"Erratum:  It is Sébastien Cataldo and not Christian Cataldo.

The quest has affected Jews, particularly after the Nazi Holocaust, and Christians and Jews with discoveries in science. It does not affect — so much — people whose belief in God is vague in the sense that they do not believe in Revelation, as Jews and Christians understand it, their belief is more a philosophy of life than a religion. It also does not affect — so much — people who have a religion/philosophy of life where there is no deity. They are more prepared to take things as they come because they expect nothing like believers in monotheistic religions and are therefore sort of indifferent to developments.\nThat is the reason why churches in the Western world are becoming empty as each day passes by, why less Jews attend synagogues in the US, why the new generations are not tied to beliefs held by their forefathers, being more interested in “electronic friendships” and in building careers.\nIn a way, RD made a strong effect when he went around London in that bus proclaiming that God does not exist, wrote a number of books against belief in a Supreme Being and so forth.\nBut RD has had second thoughts, recently refusing to sign a letter criticising UK Prime Minister David Cameron for calling England a Christian nation. He is intelligent, understanding, perhaps, that there is more room for science-theology dialogue, that he leaped without looking to a certain extent.\nWhatever new discoveries science can show us, it is bound to affect all believers, whether they believe in monotheism or not, whether they believe in some deity (however vaguely he is defined) or not, whether they believe in no deity, only in some philosophy.\nThe quest for Jesus in Shroud research is interesting to believers and atheists alike, to see who is right and who is wrong. But as I have stressed more than once, even if it is “proved” that the Man of the Shroud is Jesus, that the relic demonstrates the Resurrection in some way or the other, it will still leave questions answered. The Church could not be more correct in not including the relic as an article of faith, in not thinking of adding …”wrapped in the Turin Shroud” to what is said in the Creed.\nNo one has to believe, like Gould, that life on earth began like a big joke, just like an accident. There is more to it, scientists cannot indulge in scientism, there will have to be more science-theology dialogue, to reduce the feeling of emptiness that many may feel if they are not indulging in electronic illusions:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7343768/Viktor_Frankl_and_the_Human_Search_for_Meaning\n\n","date":"June 21, 2014 at 9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/hathos-warning/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-132070","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hathos Warning","post":"Sorry, “questions answered” above should read “questions unanswered”.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2014 at 9:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/hathos-warning/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-132072","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
