Many St. Louis papers","post":"Since my interview with Professor Giulio Fanti is listed in the December 1, 2014 update I have the following to say:\nI have not written anything that does not correspond to the truth and, in fact, added a note of caution in the fourth paragraph of the introduction:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/8841978/Professor_Giulio_Fanti_discusses_the_controversies_in_the_realm_of_Shroud_studies\nIt refers to the dating method developed by Professor Fanti and he himself has said that he leaves it to readers to judge for themselves. From what I could gauge, the research is in the initial stage and more data will be needed to reach really clear-cut results. So, from the scientific point of view also no untruths have been voiced.\n\n","date":"December 1, 2014 at 5:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/01/new-december-2014-update-to-shroud-com-many-st-louis-papers/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-174214","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
