But at least, we can have some hope that things could change one day if more people like me, Charles Freeman and some others have no fear to go on pro-Shroud blogs like this one to tell the truth about this erroneous hypothesis proposed by Wilson…\n\n","date":"October 18, 2012 at 3:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/18/top-10-relics-of-christ/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-17821","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top 10 Relics of Christ?","post":"1: “The theory that the object venerated as the Mandylion from the sixth to the thirteenth centuries was in fact the Shroud of Turin has been the subject of debate, but is now mostly rejected as a hypothesis.”\nLack of evidence, proves nothing one way or the other.  Edessa was the closest Christian city to Jerusalem, after both Jerusalem and Antioch had been destroyed.  If the Shroud is authentic, it had to exist in some place, and Edessa is at least a credible candidate city, if not probable.  Yannick has posted elsewhere that he is persuaded by the likeness of the Shroud face to Christ iconography, that the Shroud face was very likely the model for the template for this iconography.  Much of the iconography seems to have radiated out from Edessa.  The Mandylion may well have been a separate object from the Shroud,  The omission of blood stains on the iconography is irrelevant.  \n2.  Judging from the tenor of most of the comments on the “Top 10 Relics” website, clearly the devil of the sceptics is alive and well, and has done his work.  What puzzles me, is why so many sceptics should seek out a site with this title?  What are they looking for?  Is the spiritual gap so wide in their lives, that they are prepared to seek out a site such as this, only for the purpose of abusing religion, and giving vent to their splenetic comments, and indulging in trivia?\n\n","date":"October 18, 2012 at 4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/18/top-10-relics-of-christ/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-17831","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Top 10 Relics of Christ?","post":"What I ment by emphasing this statement from a popular site is the very interesting and refreshing fact that Wilson and others in the Pro-Shroud world have not succeed too much in their propaganda operation versus the Mandylion, at the sad exception of the pro-Shroud world itself, which is a clue that there are many people with a complete biased opinion in this circle…  It’s sad to note this but that’s the truth.  I’ve said it before and I will continue :  A lot of persons in the pro-Shroud world only seek what they believe to be the truth instead of really seeking truth with honesty, and so, no matter what really is this truth.  And by acting like this, they prove to be against true scientific knowledge.  The Mandylion thing remembers me of the C14 result of 1988 in the contrary sense.  In both cases, we have well enough pieces of evidences to reject the conclusion but people with a biased judgement are not willing to change their mind even in face of this sum of data that point strongly in disfavor of the particular conclusion…  That’s the sad reality.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2012 at 8:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/18/top-10-relics-of-christ/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-17863","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
