[{"title":"Searching for Papers","post":"I imported my long list of “Favourites” from Internet Explorer into Google Chrome a year or two ago, so I can access any of these old Favourites quite easily.  I added the ones most often used into the ‘Bookmark’ strip at the top of the screen.  This gives me immediate access into any of these sites.  Barrie’s shroud.com site has a ‘Search’ panel.  By entering a simple key word such as a topic, author, or conference, you can find all references to them available on the site, including those in BSTS newsletters archived, conference papers or whatever.  Other web-sites often have a similar ‘search’ facility.  I use Google Search engine only when I’m looking for a new web-site that might have the info I’m looking for, as why would anyone want to scroll through a million or so web-page entries.\n\n","date":"December 2, 2015 at 2:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/02/searching-for-papers/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-215504","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Searching for Papers","post":"We started using the pdf format in 1999, before it became widely accepted, and the first 23 papers we published in that format were placed in the root directory of the website. It quickly became apparent that this was the ideal format for papers on the site, so we created a new folder specifically for files of that format and all new pdfs were placed in that directory. It currently contains 1600 pdf files. The root directory only includes those first 23 pdf files and we have left them in that directory to avoid changing any links on the website, since those are often used as references in published papers, books and presentations.\n\n","date":"December 2, 2015 at 4:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/02/searching-for-papers/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-215507","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"}]
