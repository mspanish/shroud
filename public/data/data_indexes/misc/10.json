So let me REALLY clear it up now I feel more rested.\nReminder: as I am a non-English speaking person, I had to go back practicing the English written language    and actually have been practicing it thanks to Dan’s blog since late october 2011 (from the summer of 1994 summer to the autumn of 2011, I just wrote once in English in order to prepare a poster session to be presented in Frascati, Rome, Italy).\nBack to the issue.\nRe your opinion “it’s PERFECTLY CLEAR (my upper case) in all of them (the alternative translations) that the shroud was not to be exhibited as the true shroud” and again “But the fact that it was to be announced “alta et in intelligibile voce, omni fraude cessante, quod figuram … non ostendunt ut verum sudarium … sed tanquam figuram” CLEARLY SAYS (my upper cases) that it was not to be claimed to be the Shroud, whatever anyone’s beliefs.”\nMethinks actually you’re totally off the mark.\nFirstly, the Latin sentence is NOT clear at all per se as it can trigger two translations. It is most circumvolved nay deliberately ambiguous.\nThe true fact (my correction) is it doesn’t say clearly whether this is not the true shroud nor this is a fake/forgery/hoax. Translation is neither revision nor correction. You shall stick to the way it is phrased no matter how circumvolved and ambiguous and, if need be, provide an alternative translation for the sake of intellectual honesty. Still with me that far?\nBesides if the Shroud had been CLEARLY VIEWED  in June 1390  to be a painting/fake/hoax/forgery, could you then tell me/us why would Clement VII have allowed and even encouraged the Lirey Shroud to be displayed with an indulgence attached? This is not serious.\nTaking into account the intrinsic and extrinsic context namely Medieval Ecclesiastical prose per se + Pierre d’Arcis’s report + conflict of interest + the very fact the Lirey Shroud could be the Constantinople Shroud that was stolen by Crusaders during the 4th Crusade) now I ask you another question:\nInvestigation made, had Clement VII really known the Lirey Shroud was the true Shroud of Christ, could the pope officially recognize the Lirey Shroud as the Shroud of Christ that was stolen during the 4th crusade of which the whole episode is one of the most shameful blots on church history? Could he have deliberately associated the Holy Relic with this shameful episode? He just couldn’t have, which DOES account for his/his official scribe most circumvolved and ambiguous prose. \nFinally I refer you to your own conclusion (proving my point). On October 23, 2014 at 12:46 pm, you wrote:\n“Oh, I quite agree. Neither the d’Arcis memorandum nor the (second and definite version, my comment added) Papal bull prove that the Shroud is not authentic, not even that their respective authors really thought it was not authentic.”\nAll the ambiguity is encapsulated in the sentence written in Medieval Ecclesiastical Latin  and in the formule omni faud cessante, “all misrepresentation ceasing” or “all misstatement ceasing” in other words “in all honesty”.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2014 at 5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165110","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty","post":"In other words, Clement VII neither could tell it was not the true Shroud of Christ nor it was a fake.

I agree that the the finel version of the papal bull was much less antagonistic towards the shroud, and by implication its owner than the previous ones. I’m afraid I cannot go along with your suggestion that the phrase ‘omne fraude cessante’ can be reduced to a formulaic expression of general good faith, but do agree that the second part of the sentence (ut tanquam…) is indeed couched in somewhat legalistic jargon (especially with all those predictam, dicti and diciturs!).\nSo did Antipope Clement think the Shroud was authentic or not? I think he had no idea. While any bit of bone or cloth might be considered a genuine relic in its local environment, partly out of loyalty to its area and partly for lack of anything else to compare it to, the hierarchy in the Vatican (or Avignon in this case) must have realised that there were dozens of conflicting, and sometimes impossible, relics scattered around Europe, many or most of which could not be authentic, and were at best pious representations and at worst deliberate frauds. I do not think consideration for the irregularities of the Fourth Crusade were much of a consideration; at the time these things were considered ‘rescued’ rather than ‘robbed’ I think, but the seniority of the place where the relic was displayed may have played a part in making a decision. A humble parish priest suddenly announcing he had a nail from the cross could have been denounced out of hand, while a bishop might have been accorded considerably more respect. A conflict of interests between two important men over the Shroud had to be handled very delicately. Various middle paths were possible: the shroud was authentic, but couldn’t be displayed; the shroud was not authentic, but could be displayed; or the pope didn’t know whether it was authentic or not. The last, ignorance, would have shown a hierarchical weakness an antipope would have wanted to avoid, and the first would have rendered the relic useless (practical things, relics). The second, I think, was the best compromise the pope could come up with.\nTwo questions arise; why would one grant an indulgence to someone who visited a painting? and why was the bishop enjoined to perpetual silence on the matter?\nThe first is easy. An act of veneration is made to God, not to an artifact, miraculous or not, and indulgence is granted to a person, not a thing. The visiting of a holy place, whether or not it contained a relic, could be considered sufficient devotion for an indulgence to be awarded.\nThe second is less easy. My guess is that, being personally hostile to the de Charney family, d’Arcis had another go at the Pope, who now felt that his authority was being attacked and who felt that he had already made as good a compromise as necessary.\nAs to whether the Shroud is really authentic or not, I don’t think any of this correspondence sheds any light on the matter at all!\n\n","date":"October 24, 2014 at 6:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165127","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty","post":"“As to whether the Shroud is really authentic or not, I don’t think any of this correspondence sheds any light on the matter at all!”\nIt doesn’t.

The true fact is their anti-authenticity prosecution case has neither iconographic, nor literary or archaeological legs to stand on while the authenticity prosecution case does have.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2014 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165188","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty","post":"WHAT IF THE ANTI-AUTHENTICISTS WERE JUST ‘FAKE PEOPLE’?\n\n","date":"October 24, 2014 at 11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165195","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty","post":"Ah.

We don’t know the true motives of\n the main characters of the story. They could be political, theological or sincere. We only know the facts:\nD’Arcis: A complaint for fraud: the monks show a sheet as the true Shroud. It is a fraud.\nFirst papal bull: To avoid the fraud (the painted shroud), he imposes to the monks some conditions: to utter aloud that the Shroud is not the true Shroud but a representation, etc.\nSome corrections are done by Jean de Naples. He erased some expressions (specially the “painted”) but he maintains the main corpus and the structure of the writing: avoid the fraud and pronounce the warning; all this with the same words that the first redaction.\nThe first rule of interpretation: without any evidence adverse, you ought to accept the main sense of a word or text. The main sense of fraus, fraudis is guile, fraud or deceit.\nSo, the fraud or guile which is mentioned in D’Arcis’ memorandum and the different versions of papal bulls (all in the same terms) is to present the Shroud as the true Shroud of Our Lord. The Pope explicitly disavows this.\nThe Liege’s episode (1449) confirms the straightforward interpretation: the inauthenticity of the Shroud was presupposed in the papal bull. This is what the commission created by the bishop concludes on the basis of a direct exam and the checking of the papal bull in power of Marguerite de Charny. \nOf course, this is not an evidence of the Shroud is false. But the determination of some sindonists to speculate about unfounded interpretations of the last version of papal bull, and the aggressive terms usually uttered are hints of something. The papal bull disturbs them.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2014 at 6:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165410","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty","post":"Exactly so, David Mo; I agree completely.\n(Except for making up novels!

No less so was Geoffroi II de Charnay.  The bailli Venderesse had a letter signed by Charles VI to retrieve the Shroud.  Who drafted this letter?  Had Charles actually bothered to read the letter or was it in a stack of “unimportant correspondence” for his routine signature?  At the very time that Venderesse was seeking to retrieve the Shroud from Lirey, Geoffroi II was in Paris with a celebratory party to mark the arrival of Isabel of Bavaria as preliminary for her coronation as Queen of France.  Geoffroi II took part in the joustings as did Charles VI himself, all a very cosy party for the lads and mates of the king.  And Venderesse was all too easily discouraged from his assigned mission, directed against a fellow bailli. \nD’Arcis himself may well have been confused about the matter.  He may have been aware that the genuine Shroud had perhaps once been in Besancon, and that there was said to be a shroud still there.  Unknown to him, this was the replacement shroud that had been painted and the poor fellow had probably confused one with the other, as the replacement had been done in secret. \nHe had his own interests and problems to think of as well.  Here the lucrative pilgrim tourist traffic was heading off to some little insignificant village church in Lirey, while his own seat was in a state of disrepair.  During the Christmas period in 1389, the entire nave of Troyes’ cathedral collapsed, and shortly afterwards the rose window of the north transept fell out.  D’Arcis had to hire 30 labourers just to clean up the mess.  A bishop needs to think of his priorities and where the money should be going. \nNow coming to the matter of the relationship between Antipope Clement VII and Geoffroi II:  Was it merely a question of disturbing a lucrative tourist trade of a relative, as David Mo would suggest, or were there in fact higher motives?  Is it not possible that Clement, as a family relative, in fact had inside knowledge of the true origins of the cloth that Geoffroi II was displaying? Did he know that in truth the Shroud had been captured from Constantinople, and that therefore there were rather bigger issues at stake.  On 5 January 1390, Clement sent his stern letter to Bishop D’Arcis.  On the same date, he sent a letter to Geoffroi II, stating that he could continue to hold the Shroud expositions, though he should limit the lavishness of the accompanying ceremonial.  There was not even any mention that Geoffroi II was required to describe the Shroud as a ‘figure or representation’ of Jesus’ shroud. \nDid Bishop D’Arcis send his memorandum to Clement VII with all its accusations against the de Charnay family?  I think not.  That is an invention of Ulysse Chevalier, echoed by his co-conspirator Herbert Thurston, who wrote lies for the Catholic Encyclopedia.  \nAs David Mo says, “To speculate is free”, but I think my own are closer to the mark!\n\n","date":"October 26, 2014 at 6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165624","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty","post":"Pierre d’Arcis’s memorandum did MISPRESENT the case to the pope.

To unashamedly and wronly assert that the sentence “We don’t show the figure or representation because it is the true Shroud of Christ but because the figure or representation which it carries is said to be that of Christ” means the Shroud is clearly a fraud is a linguistic and intellectual fraud (une imposture)!\n[Last two sentences removed by moderator]\n\n","date":"October 26, 2014 at 7:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165738","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"}]
