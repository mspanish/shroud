When it comes to my starting “a stamp on any moves towards retesting campaign” that is precisely what I am not doing. What I am doing is trying to show a path towards testing. However, it has to be non-intrusive. \nYou may balk at examining the reason STURP succeeded and look at the naked power play of the carbon labs that destroyed STURP participation as a model, but that is not going to be an appropriate model: Fool me once etc.\nWhen it comes to corruption, the corruption of science represented by the carbon testing was gigantic fiasco. By the way, it was not Thomas de Wesselow who first called it that but at 4:441 EST, I am not going to check for the original use of the fiasco label. \nSecular science flunked the carbon dating. In fact, it’s a template for how it can’t be done. When I publish my manuscript if I ever get it finished you will see why I can write that. Luigi Gonella every body’s fall guy for what went wrong, has stated that the labs blackmailed the Vatican by threatening a campaign saying the Vatican was protecting the Shroud form science.

Repetition of dubious measurements (or even non-dubious ones) is the essential modus operandi of science. One of the chief reasons for peer-review is not to check that findings are correct, and will stand the test of time (few if any papers submitted for publication can be judged instantly on that criterion)  but simply to ensure that measurements are properly replicated with an indication of their statistical precision. The standard deviation often tells all (at a glance) yet no valid SD was possible (and should have been reported, unless heavily qualified) for the 88 testing, given it was essentially a single sample, non-randomly chosen.\nRegard the 88 testing as a ranging shot exercise. It showed that AMS methodology is reasonably consistent between labs, using slightly different de-contamination procedures. Amend those procedures if necessary to take on board concerns re thymol, DDT etc etc. Just repeat it, and repeat it quickly, say in the next 12 months. But make sure that everything is totally transparent  (with real-time web cam links etc), and no souvenir collectors/squirrel hoarders, least of all those who are Turin or Vatican insiders. Oh, and keep the British Museum out of the picture.

It is just that some of us are already into the day whether there is sand in our Vaseline or not (didn’t know that one!).\nBut seriously, the option of shutting up all scientific testing on the Shroud is a possible one to take and then everyone can go on arguing for another twenty-five years about the radio-carbon ‘fiasco’. De Wesselow said something about it being one of the greatest scientific frauds of all time. That showed he knew very little about the lively history of scientific fraud and sadly he never explained who was being fraudulent (you have the book, i binned mine, so perhaps you know) but he rather lost me there. \nMeanwhile there are just so many areas of research that people could be getting on with in the archives in the cities of northern France. (Troyes has a lot still to explore.) I keep throwing them in. So Margaret de Charny said that her grandfather Geoffrey got the Shroud as ‘a spoil of war’. Some researchers have followed him to Smyrna but the war that he was actually fighting in the early 1350s when the Shroud is first documented was against the English in northern France. So was the Shroud originally among the loot taken from one of the collections of relics that are documented in northern France  as coming direct from Jerusalem, even ‘the Lord’s Tomb’, in the second half of the first millennium? It is unlikely but these are the leads to be followed up.\nFollowing an earlier discussion, if the thread in the Shroud is Z spun then it is unlikely (stress unlikely) to have been made in Palestine. So who, among those who think it is first century, is going to do the work on early first century trade within the Roman empire that might pinpoint its origins. There’s tons of new shipwreck evidence for trade. Certainly we have Greek imports to Judaea and the mainland Greeks seem to have used Z spin.\nSo go for it and let’s break this endless wrangling about test results that are long since passed their validity date. The Shroud is supposed to have had more tests done on it than any other artefact in history and yet there are major areas of research into its origins that seem untouched. Will your book actually say anything new so that we can move on a bit?\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 6:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50410","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"Fortunately, I think God will have the final say as to what may or may not happen.

No matter how de Charny got it, it was on one level stolen property at some point. I believe I saw at one point but failed to note it, that Clement carefully cadged his approval of he  Shroud so as not to approve of authenticty claims because the Church was still seeking reunion with Orthodox and a claim that it was an authentic artifact of Christ would engender Orthodox demands for its return. (Which would have by the way made in vulnerable to the Islamists armies who were on the move.) Do you have any thoughts on that.\nI have a riff on Dawkins in my first chapter because he has a dim view of eye witness testimony and actually prefers solid circumstantial evidence. That’s because in archaeology-anthropology  there are no eye witnesses. \nBias is usually a slur. However, I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag, but it is my opinion that the weight of the circumstantial evidence is authenticity. Can’t defend that in a few hurried, and often typo filled,  comments on a blog. But I do not believe that the inability to draw a conclusion from evidence already offered is a disqualification if the mind is open. \nBy the way, by reason of the personal experiences of someone very close to me, I have observed the National Institute of Health (NIH) for two decades. There is fierce competition for grants. Is there fraud  by some, you betcha. (Palinease for “You bet there is”) Fraud is NOT endemic. Pride is.  the NIH has funded programs of ultimate value far beyond its budget.\nOverall the NIH is grant program a most valuable and necessary component of US science and one of the bedrock for the US’s scientific and economic progress. You double betcha. \nLet me say this once in sum. The carbon labs waged a determined effort to keep STURP out of the carbon dating process and to stop any further scientific tests if the carbon date was not within range of 30 CE. STURP had one function in the tests: to select the best sites for taking samples. Because STURP was excluded from the process, the worst possible site was chosen.\nSurely you must realize that for  carbon dating the sample must be  typical of the entire object. It wasn’t. But those chapters are already written and I have to move on and not debate it further. \nMy work will speak for itself (if anybody gets to read it). Frankly, I am impressed by the support I’ve gotten. I even have permission  from Elaine Pagels author of the Gnostic Gospels to use a long quote from her book (God bless the Internet). I’ll use it now since it is not original with me: It’s from Chapter Two, working title: The Story as Told.”\n“Then she puts martyrdom in the context of Christ’s passion in words that echo Pasternak:\n‘In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.'”\nFinally, show a little respect for those whose opinions differ from you.

Do you have any thoughts on that.’\nEven if the Shroud came from Constantinople, which is disputed largely because there is no record of it having done so (the missing years), it was one of many thousands and certainly by no means the most prestigious. One has to remember that in the hierarchy the Cross and the Crown of Thorns ( that ended up in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris) were higher up than the various shrouds that were around.\nEven if the Schism between east and west had been settled (as was attempted in Florence in 1439) no local church would ever have surrendered up its relics, certainly not the French kings and other potentates who had the best ones! This is what gave a church or ruler status.\nI think the real problem that Shroud researchers often have is to think that the Shroud was considered as important before the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when it got a powerful backer in the Savoys. Clement was probably overwhelmed with requests to have relics of all sorts proclaimed  authentic and popes typically hedged their bets according to which  kings or nobles they needed to please. Clement never saw the Shroud, he would have known that it was one of many shrouds, no one could tell where it had come from,and there was the problem of the unrecorded images- so I suspect that he just  wanted to keep things calm!\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50422","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"\nCharles Freeman :\nKelly.

First of all, regarding current complaints from pro-authenticity people regarding the events surrounding the 1988 dating:  it’s safe to say that if the 1988 testing had come out 1st century, skeptics would still be complaining today about some of the things that went on such as the discrepancies in the sizes and weights of the samples.  One of the most important scientific tests in all of history and they can’t even get the basic facts about the samples right?  And that was just the beginning of the problems.  The Shroud should have been tested in 1988 with the multi-disciplinary plan that STURP has proposed.  No matter how useful C-14 is as a scientific tool, it is often inaccurate.  With all of the mysteries of the origins of the Shroud and its known and unknown history, more should have been thrown at the Shroud, not less.  If the Church was open enough to have allowed the 1978 testing, it should be open enough to allow further testing on the most important relic in Christianity, especially with all the controversy with the 1988 dating.  While I suppose the Church would run the risk of alienating some Christians if further testing proved the Shroud not authentic, they could have such a positive effect on Christians if further testing did not disauthenticate it.  And given all the scandals in the Church, you’d think they’d allow testing just to put the attention somewhere else.  Regarding skeptics and agnostics about the Shroud, their comments, I think, help to force pro-Shroud people to think outside the pro-authenticity box, which can be rather small and compressed.  Regarding Kelly’s:  “Rap music-mutually exclusive terms IMO, but to each his own” and compliments about the Beatles:  AMEN!  And a question for another blog:  why can’t McCartney ever come up anymore with some of the great songs he wrote as a Beatle?  Regarding the book Elvis was reading when he died, I have a handwritten letter from the late Frank O. Adams, author of the book “A Scientific Search for the Face of Jesus,” who told me that Elvis had been reading his book, which was not totally on the Shroud, but contained a lot of material on it.  “Now it’s time to say Goodnight…” (Lennon & McCartney from the fantastic “White Album”).\n\n","date":"November 9, 2013 at 1:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50513","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"Now that I mentioned “Goodnight,” I can’t get the song out of my head (or “out of me head” as the lads might have said), I actually can’t get to sleep.

As I’ve said before, the main anxiety of the labs was probably less to do with accurately dating the Shroud on first encounter, and more to do with the consequences of three labs reporting widely different results which would have diminished confidence in the AMS method generally, and have provoked all kinds of speculations as to which lab had done the best job, which the worst.\nPresumably this is not the best site on which to launch a new petition to Pope Francis, one calling for an immediate re-dating of the Shroud of Turin, but I would nevertheless like to give Dan Porter first refusal, so to speak, before going it alone.

This is a pity as if they have been kept in pristine condition and together, new tests would certainly add new information about the Shroud. \nI once worked on a US led archaeological dig in Turkey. We were allowed to take materials out of the country for testing on condition that they were returned.I wish the same had happened here but clearly the deal was done otherwise and so we have a fragmented Shroud. No one here seems to mind much.

Orville Dahl, surveying the Frei tapes, pointed out that no less than 32 of the 57 pollens could only be deposited by insects – rather than blowing in on the wind as Frei suggested.

But as my dear wife sagely points out, a headline that read “Shroud really is 2000 years old” would surely have garnered more publicity, more funds than the anti-climax of  an apparent medieval provenance, at least for the corner tested, making a refreshing change from all those “in cahoots with the Richard Dawkins tendency” bla bla.\nBut it’s no longer just water under the bridge.

I mixed some crushed roots up with water and boiled it, reducing the volume of water considerably, but not letting it boil dry. I then pipetted some of the liquid in drops on some linen. So far, terrific! The brown stain spread out a little and looked just the colour of dried blood, and, what a surprise, a yellow ‘serum’ spread out beyond the brown stain, exactly like a wound exudate on an injury-dressing. Very exciting. After it had dried – and would you believe it did the clot retraction thing to perfection, leaving a thicker rim and and a thinner middle – I looked at it with a UV light. Tragedy. The brown stain did not fluoresce, but the ‘serum’ ring did – bright pink! (Most unlike the alleged serum rings around some blood areas on the shroud.) Back to the drawing board. Still, I then washed my paint drips thoroughly, and the dark brown “blood” was washed away, leaving a much redder, but lighter, therefore pinkish stain. The yellow ‘serum’ ring is a little lighter, but still yellow. The whole thing now fluoresces pinkly as well.\nI do not know if the pink fluorescence is long lasting, but if the C-14 sample corner fluoresces pink, then Rogers’s madder ideas may be better supported. Sadly, Miller and Pellicori omitted the corners altogether, and I don’t think there are any other UV pictures of it.\n\n","date":"November 9, 2013 at 3:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50579","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"Interesting, Hugh. So would one be correct in thinking that, despite the reference to Rogers, your interest in madder has extended from its alleged use to produce yellow colour for an instant aged look in a mended area, to serving as a blood substitute (more touching up?). Certainly I’ve always thought of madder root extracts (alizarin and purpurin) as being more red than yellow or brown, so it’s interesting that you see pink after giving a rinse. Wasn’t it once maintained, at or shortly after the inquiry following the 1532 fire, that the Shroud had previously endured other insults, like being washed repeatedly AND boiled in oil – a bizarre test for image permanence!  Hooray.

(Heller and Gove are the more readable and informative.)\nClearly whatever happened to the tapes on the disbandment of STURP they do not seem to have been made over to a public institution that could care for them and make them available for scholars to examine. This is a pity as if they have been kept in pristine condition and together, new tests would certainly add new information about the Shroud.\nI once worked on a US led archaeological dig in Turkey. We were allowed to take materials out of the country for testing on condition that they were returned.I wish the same had happened here but clearly the deal was done otherwise and so we have a fragmented Shroud. No one here seems to mind much. (One of my first jobs when working as a ‘slave’ – I suppose ‘intern’ nowadays, in Rome, in 1966 was packing away gold fibulae from Etruscan tombs and I was taught how vital conservation and labelling was because one would never know who might one day want to examine the finds.) Even if I was granted access to the tapes I don’t have the expertise to do any new tests so I just made the enquiry as a matter of interest.\nI do hope the wrangling about the radiocarbon dating can stop – we have passed the 25th anniversary. Even if the tests are declared invalid there is not a scrap of evidence from the tests done by the labs to date the Shroud to the first century so why go on about them, Even a patch, that no one who has examined the Shroud close-up ( e.g Flury-Lemberg) can see. might simply have been a sixteenth century repair of a cloth made two hundred years before.\nThe atmospheric palynologist, Dr. A. Orville Dahl, surveying the Frei tapes, pointed out that no less than 32 of the 57 pollens could only be deposited by insects – rather than blowing in on the wind as Frei suggested. Dr. Dahl put it cautiously when came to the conclusion that the pollen was not ‘due to wind-borne deposition but to human activity of some sort.’  I am not one for conspiracy theories but I admire his restraint!\n\nHeller’s book remains as one of my favorites, together with William Meachum’s, title notwithstanding, but I understand.  I would also list anything by Fr. Rinaldi.  The Heller book has some good narratives regarding the blood tests; today’s blood tests still evaluate the same thing-the presence of hemoglobin-bound iron.  Blood really hasn’t changed during the past 30, or even 300, years.   \nDNA evaluation is now included in the current forensic techniques, but blood testing still involves the same one-two approach described in the book, chemical tests for Hb/Fe, followed by immunological tests-no disrespect intended to anyone, but it really doesn’t require a huge degree of technical skill to chemically analyze for the presence of blood, even that in dried bloodstains-field technicians do it all of the time, so do undergraduate forensic students.  The arguments about Heller & Adler being too technically naive to test for the presence blood are ludicrous-hemoglobin is a porphyrin; Adler was a porphyrin specialist, for crying out loud.  But anyway, just thought I’d slip that in there, it’s in the book.  I know, I know, an open issue, no problem…\nI would reiterate about considering contacting those directly involved in what specific areas of Shroud research you might be interested in, historical or otherwise.  I believe we all learn from each other, even if our viewpoints are dissimilar.\n\n","date":"November 10, 2013 at 5:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50670","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"“…blood testing still involves the same one-two approach described in the book, chemical tests for Hb/Fe, followed by immunological tests-no disrespect intended to anyone, but it really doesn’t require a huge degree of technical skill to chemically analyze for the presence of blood, even that in dried bloodstains-field technicians do it all of the time, so do undergraduate forensic students.

I could understand others less scientifically or technically qualified making it, but YOU????\nWhere does one start?

OK, that’s speculative, maybe, but you surely don’t need me to tell you that Adler and Heller were hard pushed to characterize Shroud blood with standard test procedures. Those field kits only test for the first two stages of degradation as I recall, i.e.as far as hemochromes. But degradation was surely far more extensive, given the difficulty  of getting blood stains, real or look-alike,  into solution, requiring hydrazine and other harsh reagents as I recall, Then there was the atypical porphyrin spectrum, which then occasioned what was largely speculation on their part, i.e. biblical narrative-driven speculation  (spectral shifts attributed with trauma-induced bilirubin  (photo-labile) that some might consider would have been photo-oxidized away within in no time at all),.

Best stop here, methinks, and wait for immediate reaction/feedback to my astonishment at the line you have taken.\n\nThe basic chemical identification of blood based on the presence of a heme group is the same in both cases-that’s what I was referring to, nothing more, than the bottom line.  Field kits, hydrazine solubilized (aged), the initial chemical identification of blood in both contexts is heme/Fe.  Immunological tests measure the primary blood components albumin, Ig, although more current tests include glycophorin, which can distinguish species readily.  It think it gets advertised way too much that Heller & Adler were in way over their heads, not even able to troubleshoot at a first year graduate student level.  The book version may be in narrative style, but such results were accepted & published in the scientific literature.  Surely, the reviewers were much more scientifically & technically qualified than me.   Regarding degradation, etc., of course aged blood is expected to be more degraded than fresh blood, but certain components can and do survive-blood has been identified on prehistoric tools, immunoglobulin has been detected in T. Rex digs, similarly ABO antigens in mummy remains.  Hope this alleviates some of the astonishment… Shocker!\n\n","date":"November 10, 2013 at 10:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50690","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"So it’s still hunky dory as regards the immunology.

I was actually hoping for a journal reference or two with an evaluation of blood, pre-ingestion vs. post-ingestion, particularly showing that the atypical spectrum of maybe blood is recreated by vacationing in the gut of a leech.  Is there data of an anomalous spectrum or just an assumption that the profile would be similar?  I’m just asking.  “Wacky” hypothesis?  I thought it was pretty creative, particularly with the anti-coagulation angle-beats keeping a cage full of vampire bats on hand.  \nBut, the blood is only part of the story-if it’s blood or maybe blood, there is an alternative.  It could be something elseIf the blood tests were so botched, what about the tests to include/exclude the possibility that paints,pigments can account for the “bloodstains”?\nI believe that 2nd question was posed by an eavesdropper in the coffee room (Heller? McCrone?) listening in to your conversation with Adler.  In his book, Heller states that six tests were performed to evaluate the presence of blood, any one of which would be accepted in a court of law.  He adds that together they were irrefutable.  Sounds like a pretty strong statement.  Apart from the book, their work was scrutinized and peer reviewed by other scientists, some of whom may have even made the club on Google scholar.  Many would consider publishing in such peer reviewed journals as a pretty strong statement.  The question came up because if one considers the tests for the presence of blood as inconclusive, what about the other tests that were done for an alternative?  Should these also be categorized as incompetent, incomplete, etc.?  There are two ways to approach the question.  If it’s not blood, or even maybe blood, then can one definitely say that it is anything else or does it fall under the category of RBD, remains to be determined?  Are there enough results from the tests that were performed & published to make a conclusive statement regarding this inclusion/exclusion of paints, pigments as a possibility?  Or we will have to hold out for that STURP box set?\n\n","date":"November 12, 2013 at 1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50968","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"I shall have to respond to you in instalments, Kelly.

It depends on how the blood was harvested from leech. If it was done in a way that extruded leech tissue and their  immunological markers, then  the latter would have been initially intact,and any subsequent degradation would be no more or less severe than that of the blood cell markers. So if claims can be made that ABO blood group markers can survive centuries, allowing positive tests for AB etc, then surely the same could be said for leech markers.\nThe problem might be in choosing which leech tissue component to serve as marker, purifying it from a modern leech (hoping there are no species-specific problems) and then raising one’s antibody to it. But this is your area of expertise, not mine, being more inclined to think in terms of physical isolation of molecules, as distinct from tactile recognition by your immune sera with their miniaturized tunnel-vision search-and-destroy robots, they of the limited vocabulary (like “found” v “not found”, exterminate, exterminate  etc ;-).\nSo, back to my more comfortable and better-fitting biochemist’s hat, here’s another suggestion. Given the leech secretes an anticoagulant that prevents ingested blood from clotting, then the fibrinogen of the blood should be intact, and may, just conceivably may, hang around at least for a while (assuming it’s not all strained off to the outside like the watery plasma in which case this idea is a non-starter). So one tests for the presence of fibrinogen in Shroud bloodstains. If the pro-authenticity ideas of Adler and those before him are true, i.e. that what we see is not whole blood, but serum exudates from bloodclots, then there should be no fibrinogen worth speaking of, although there might be FDPs, ie. fibrin degradation products for which there are separate tests.\nCome to think of it, did Adler et al ever test for FDPs as another authenticity-promoting marker for real blood? I don’t recall any mention of those. Would a synthetic organic chemist/porphyrin specialist have known there are standard test kits available (I used them myself to monitor the health status of rats on a lifespan trial of dietary fibre). But that brings us back to the question of horses for courses…  Adler is so often referred to in Shroudology as a “blood expert”. Not true, at least not in terms of published  work.\n\n","date":"November 13, 2013 at 6:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-51057","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"\ncolinsberry :\nLeech antigens?  It depends on how the blood was harvested from leech. If it was done in a way that extruded leech tissue and their  immunological markers, then  the latter would\nhave been initially intact,and any subsequent degradation would be no more or less severe than that of the blood cell markers. So if claims can be made that ABO blood group markers can survive centuries, allowing positive tests for AB etc, then surely the same could be said for leech markers.\nThe problem might be in choosing which leech tissue component to serve as marker, purifying it from a modern leech (hoping there are no species-specific problems) and then raising one’s antibody to it. But this is your area of expertise, not mine, being more inclined to think in terms of physical isolation of molecules, as distinct from tactile recognition by your immune sera with their miniaturized tunnel-vision search-and-destroy robots, they of the limited vocabulary (like “found” v “not found”, exterminate, exterminate  etc ;-).\nSo, back to my more comfortable and better-fitting biochemist’s hat, here’s another suggestion.

Not true, at least not in terms of published  work.\n\n“Unique” leech antigens was the phrase, this is in reference to potential protests that the make up is similar to our own, and since these are blood meals, you couldn’t just use any-expression would have to include the gut.  It’s not really a claim that AB antigens can survive, they do, though I’m not really sure that’s a direct comparison to the putative leech antigens, one would suspect these (leech) would be protein-based, not carbohydrate based such as the ABO system.  I am always careful to discuss the typing results on the Shroud as type AB as determined by forward typing-In my opinion, a conformation using molecular biology techniques would be an important extension/conformation.\nRegarding Adler being a “blood expert”, it’s been discussed ad nauseum-hemoglobin is a porphyrin, he was a porphryin expert. One can decide on their own.  These were professional scientists at professional institutions, it’s unfair to paint them out as clueless at the controls of a plane in a steep dive.  Heller & Adler weren’t immunology experts, but they were able to set up & carry out a series of controlled antisera experiments, either through their own proficiency (easily believable to me) or with some consultation (happens all of the time in science as you know).  You chime in on a variety of scientific areas (numerous) in various postings, which according to the Google Scholar club, there may not be a sufficient paper trail.  What is one to make of that?  Look objectively at the data, results, or comments, if it’s sound, it’s sound.  One’s knowledge & experience can extend GS, no?\nBut enough of this bantering about blood or maybe blood-as I previously wrote, assume these blood tests, even though reviewed & accepted in journals by other Google Scholars, were so terribly botched that it’s only a maybe at best.  What about that eavesdropper, who is asking about the alternative?  Were those tests similarly in error?\n\n","date":"November 13, 2013 at 7:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-51075","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cementing Over Central Park","post":"Two quick responses.
