A minor inhibition would consist in a timidity about expressing the criticism; a strong inhibition would prevent him from organizing his thoughts, with the result that they would occur to him only after the discussion was over, or the next morning. But the inhibition may go so far as not to permit the critical thoughts to come up at all, and in this case, assuming that he really feels critical, he will be inclined to accept blindly what has been said or even to admire it; and he will be quite unaware of having any inhibitions. In other words, if an inhibition goes so far as to check wished or impulses there can be no awareness of its existence.” (The Neurotic Personality of Our Time, Karen Horney, M.D., New York: Norton, 1937, p. 55 )\n\n","date":"February 11, 2014 at 9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78304","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"David, how do you distinguish a person that have no inhibitions from one that  inhibition goes so far as to check wished or impulses there can be no awareness of its existence?\n\n","date":"February 11, 2014 at 10:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78321","author":"Blas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"Aren’t relics intended to bolster faith?

The question of the shroud being authentic or not is a scientific question not a faith question. As long as we get this right, everyone will be happy. They are 2 different issues. I don’t believe in the shroud because I am a christian. And I don’t believe in Jesus because I believe in the shroud. This is why I can understand the position of the Catholic Church (and my Coptic Orthodox Church, as per my priest) in this matter. The question of the authenticity has no bearing in our faith in Jesus. I understand that the shroud can get people who don’t believe in Jesus to think about believing in Jesus. but ultimately they have to lay down their life to Jesus, praying for the Shroud will not save them. this is why there are Christians who don’t believe the shroud to be authentic, and there are Jews/agnostic/atheists who believe the shroud belongs to the historic Jesus. The importance of the shroud to me though is that it gives me the chance in the 21st century to “behold the man”, to see how much Jesus suffered for me. It is also very dear to my heart that Jesus would leave such an imprint, His true likeness, His Photograph if you will, etched on a piece of linen for us to connect with Him. I think it’s priceless.\n\n","date":"February 11, 2014 at 3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78386","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"The Doctrine of Addai demonstrates that the principle of a visual aid in evangelisation was established very early indeed. Did Bishop Avercius of Hieropolis use the Shroud in this way when he baptised the court of King Abgar VIII the Great in Edessa around 195AD, with “his fish of great size”? Nevertheless Avicius says that “Faith led him onward!” Is the Shroud Jesus’ love letter to humanity? Or is it his receipt for the cloth?

Does it mean we must believe in God because of all those “mysteries”?  Surely not because even just 10 or 20 years from now, there were even more things that science was still seeking to explain!  \nHow can anyone be certain if the “mystery” of the Shroud image will not be fully explain with the known laws of nature when the Vatican will eventually allow a new series of direct researches on the cloth?  And if this day ever come, what will happen with your faith if a good portion of it is based on the kind of link you just did?\nTrue faith should never be an intellectual belief but a true spiritual relationship with God.  Read again what Jesus said to the women at the well: “God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”  God don’t want people to believe in him because of some unsolved mystery regarding the image on his shroud, but because we simply have enough faith to trust him and have confidence in him to help us on a daily base and because we want to live a true Relationship with him.

Speaking both as a scientist and a Christian, if you compromise your objectivity and feel it necessary to selectively favor those data that support your own personal beliefs, while ignoring those that don’t, then what good is that-you’re not really interested in the truth, just a biased version of it.  That is false integrity for either a scientist or a Christian. \nTrue faith withstands the flame.  So does true data.  Put it to the test as many different ways as you can.  if you truly believe something scientifically, you should try to disprove it, not support it at all costs.  If the Shroud is real, it’s real, if it’s not, it’s not.  I think science can help increase our understanding either way.  The Shroud enhances my faith, certainly, but my faith is not dependent on it-there are too many other things that enhance and nurture it.  Well, there you go, Andy, that’s about as honest as I can be!\n\n","date":"February 11, 2014 at 11:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78518","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"“Casting you pearls before swine” means being judicious in the presentation of your beliefs.

Even if the Catholic Church says it’s an official relic. YOU say it’s fake, how can YOU reconcile that. According to you, if it’s fake, it should be wrong calling it Holy, but you still do it?\n2- this is argument from ignorance. I can’t understand it so it must be Jesus. Nothing can be further from true faith.\n3-The Gnostic thing again, you have absolutely no evidence for that claim except from some ancient text that shows the Gnostics have seen the shroud. This doesn’t mean they made it.\n4-the blood is not smeared and the image detail is not evidence of fabrication, Especially when you still have no explanation for how the Gnostics did it. These are evidence for authenticity because if the shroud was a byproduct of the resurrection (result of some type of radiation that left a photographic like imprint) when the body came back to life, both would be true.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78642","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"1, 2, 3 and 4.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78598","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"Paulette, Ditto.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78639","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"\nDavid Roemer :\nThe atheists (Locken and de Wesselow) were attempting to give an historical explanation for the Resurrection of Jesus.

The difference between arguing and summoning is the difference between faith and reason. It is a matter of reason that God exists. It is a matter of faith that He has communicated Himself to us.\n3) Who else but a Gnostic would crucify someone to get a relic?\n4) We see the image and ask, “How was it created?” We invent the theory, “It was done by an artist.” We marshal the evidence: 1) All known images are created by humans. 2) The blood stains are not smeared. The Resurrection of Jesus is an historical event. It does not have any “by product.” The historical event was the renewed fellowship of His disciples after He was crucified, the belief that He was the Messiah, the emphasis on the Jewish belief in life after death, the beginning of worship on Sunday, the appearances of Jesus to Paul and others.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 9:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/are-we-being-honest-with-ourselves/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-78658","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Are We  Being Honest With Ourselves?","post":"I give up..

Consequently, they believed he did not truly suffered on the cross.  All this heretical system of belief is CONTRADICTED by what we see on the Shroud!!!
