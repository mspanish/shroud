One or two commentators made a few really intelligent comments.  Oddly enough one of them was called Tinsmith, and for some reason I immediately thought of Colin, but it certainly wasn’t him.  I thought about dropping a comment to enlighten the masses, but then thought – No – as the Good Book says, I need to take good care of where I leave my pearls.\n\n","date":"August 2, 2012 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/what-science-has-or-has-not-been-able-to-confirm-about-the-shroud-is-instructive/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14405","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What science has or has not been able to confirm about the Shroud is instructive","post":"Error: I meant that the last 10-11 days, her posting has accumulated a great number of comments!

You’d think with what this Shroud may mean too all of mankind, they would put more effort into educating themselves on it’s details and evidence…another GO FIGURE ;-)\nR\n\n","date":"August 6, 2012 at 3:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/what-science-has-or-has-not-been-able-to-confirm-about-the-shroud-is-instructive/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-14545","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
