It’s quite frankly one of the the finest quotes I have ever encountered. \nWhy? Because it guarantees transparency. And if there’s one thing notably absent in the Shroudology literature, it is scientific transparency. \nMaybe that’s what attracted this retired science bod to Shroudology it in the first place – the lack of transparency…the disingenuous manipulation of words and syntax, the rotten whiff of bent science..\n\n","date":"November 5, 2013 at 7:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/on-arrogance-and-second-hand-literary-wisdom/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50104","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On arrogance and second hand literary wisdom","post":"Who was it that said, “i will not go quietly into the night…”  :)\n\n","date":"November 5, 2013 at 9:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/on-arrogance-and-second-hand-literary-wisdom/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50111","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On arrogance and second hand literary wisdom","post":"“I will not go quietly into the night…”:\nA misquote from the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas 1914-1953, best known for his brilliant classic radio play “Under Milk Wood’, a day in the life of a small Welsh village.  I first encountered UMW on an LP, as a young student around 1960, have since read the script often, participated in several theatre group readings, and at the slightest provocation will replay my copies of the full text with Richard Burton as Reader 1. Thomas himself led a somewhat dissolute life-style, eventually dying of alcohol poisoning in New York, having just turned 39. His inability to deal with his Inland Revenue problems plagued him for most of his life, and compounded his chronic alcoholism.     \nDylan Thomas wrote the poem “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”, with its echoing refrain, “Rage, rage against the dying of the light” when his father was being afflicted with the onset of blindness. The dying of the light is a reference to darkness and being blind. A degree of blindness may occasionally affect more than just a few of us. \nDo not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieve it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n        Dylan Thomas ~1951\n\n","date":"November 6, 2013 at 5:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/on-arrogance-and-second-hand-literary-wisdom/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-50153","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On arrogance and second hand literary wisdom","post":"It’s surely about death, impending death, even if his father’s death was preceded by blindness (which I have no reason to doubt).
