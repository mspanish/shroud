[{"title":"Speaking of “our own” commenters in the big papers","post":"Nice comment, John. There have been other people like Pope Francis in history, one was Cardinal John Henry Newman, and the laity and scholars tend to think about his brilliant mind and the important books he wrote, knowing next to nothing about his care for the poor. It seems that in England at least each prelate did some part of the job, Cardinal Henry Edward Manning fought against vivisection and in favour of labourers, and so on. Cardinal Vincent Nichols is well-known for his work in favour of welfare:\n   http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2014/02/21/cardinal-nichols-will-not-allow-us-to-forget-the-poor-for-this-i-am-profoundly-grateful/\nThe Harley Davidson given to Pope Francis by the motorcycle company was auctioned to raise money to build a shelter for the homeless and another place for them to eat in Rome.\nThe sad part about this issue is that it has taken the example of Pope Francis to bring community feeling into the minds of many of the faithful. This feeling was strong in the primitive Church and began to fade as doctrinal and other issues began to take a lot of their time.\n\n","date":"February 23, 2014 at 10:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/speaking-of-our-own-commenters-in-the-big-papers/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-81675","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of “our own” commenters in the big papers","post":"If we’re looking for competitors for true sanctity, then my vote goes to Blessed Frederic Ozanam, founder of the St Vincent de Paul Society. A brilliant scholar and jurist, his heart went out to the poor of Victor Hugo’s post-revolutionary Paris, even when as a student there, he founded groups of young men to administer charity to them. A reasonably comprehensive biography can be found at: http://vincentians.com/blog/blessed-frederic-ozanam-biography-i/  . \nLike many other dedicated French Catholics of this era, he was brought up in Lyons, well away from the secular philosophy that dominated Paris. His parents were also dedicated to the cause of the poor. The St Vincent de Paul Society remains a significant arm of Catholic charitable works in NZ.\n\n","date":"February 23, 2014 at 3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/speaking-of-our-own-commenters-in-the-big-papers/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-81735","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Speaking of “our own” commenters in the big papers","post":"True enough, and we have had more recent examples:\nhttps://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view;_ylt=AwrB8pkaXwpTYDkAvt.JzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTI0MTNuajl0BHNlYwNzcgRzbGsDaW1nBG9pZAM1ZTk1ZGRmMjI4N2VkOTM0YWMwZjk5YmY4OWQ0ZTQ0YwRncG9zAzY3OARpdANiaW5n?back=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dmother%2Bteresa%26ei%3Dutf-8%26y%3DSearch%26fr%3Dsfp-img%26spos%3D132%26nost%3D1%26tab%3Dorganic%26ri%3D678&w=582&h=479&imgurl=dcbarroco.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F04%2F120513-mother-teresa.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdcbarroco.wordpress.com%2Ftag%2Fmother-teresa%2F&size=52.2KB&name=%3Cb%3EMother+Teresa+%3C%2Fb%3E%7C+District+of+Calamity&p=mother+teresa&oid=5e95ddf2287ed934ac0f99bf89d4e44c&fr2=&fr=sfp-img&tt=%3Cb%3EMother+Teresa+%3C%2Fb%3E%7C+District+of+Calamity&b=661&ni=384&no=678&ts=&tab=organic&sigr=11hgi7mra&sigb=13t7alo8j&sigi=11uj0trtq&.crumb=luR.RPe853I&fr=sfp-img\n\n","date":"February 23, 2014 at 4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/speaking-of-our-own-commenters-in-the-big-papers/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-81746","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
