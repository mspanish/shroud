In other words, there is no discrepancy in body height from head to toe if one factors in all the available information.  So if there is missing length/body height immediately below the buttocks, it cannot be due to folding/invagination of the linen leaving a blank non-imaged region when the linen is subsequently later stretched out. \nI would go further and state (though Hugh is free to differ) that is the result of linen – at the instant of imaging – failing to conform (i.e. to drape around) every contour, due to a tenting effect, i.e. a  short-cutting of taut linen from one extremity/prominence  to another, leaving a hollow or air gap across which no imaging is possible by contact and conduction (but with the possibility of weak imaging by convection currents of heated air, steam and other gases).\nThe radiationista would say there can be imaging across air gaps, conforming in their narrow vision to an inverse square law (but with a strange cut-off at 4cm!). The facts speak otherwise – when one looks closely at a number of areas of the Shroud image (e.g. the region around crossed hands especially). Any weak imaging that may occur across air gaps where there are tented regions between extremities, is confined to very small distances, and is almost certainly due to convected current of hot air and pyrolysis gases. \nLook if you will in vain for any references by the radiationista to the phenomenon of heat transfer/temperature increase arising from convection . All they see is their supernatural radiation, and they then try to dismiss what they see as the exclusive alternative – namely  direct physical contact between subject and linen with atom-to-atom conduction- with simplistic, nay crass arguments, with no recognition whatsoever of close heat encounters of the third kind – i.e. convection  – moving currents of heated gas and vapour that can scorch at a distance -like the reverse side of the linen, where gas meets a  solid underlay,  admittedly conjectural, creating a second interface for pyrolysis via contact/conduction.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2013 at 5:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-30533","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App","post":"I should have stated more clearly that length measurements does not support the hypothesis of Thierry Castex.

However, shorter wavelengths may get scattered, so that there are fewer to detect, which is why the sun looks redder in the evening. Reflectance spectra would not be affected. A whiter backing cloth would reflect more of all wavelengths, but the overall shape of the spectrum would not be affected, I think.\nAs to the red spike, it puzzles me enormously. From the spectra I have found on the internet, it seems that ‘red’ minerals reflect little visible light from roughly 400-500nm, and lots from 600-700nm. The shape of their spectra is basically a step. ‘Brown’ things have a spectrum which slopes gradually from little at low wavelengths to lots at high wavelengths. Green and blue minerals have reflectance spectra that look like hills at around about their appropriate frequencies, but nothing is typified by a spike. \nSpikes do appear in the spectra of biological material, such as various algae, but I imagine that that sort of material would degrade quite quickly, and cannot think of anything (a lichen perhaps?) with a stable red colour.\nIt beats me, then.

When we look at a patch of cloth and say it’s green, and then look at its spectrum and see a big reflectance hill around 543nm, that’s easy to understand. That’s why I like reflectance spectra better than absorbance. However, we could see its spectrum and see nothing in the ‘green’ range, but twin spikes in the blue and yellow. A patch of cloth made of alternating blue and yellow threads looks green, but if we examined individual threads, we wouldn’t see green at all, but blue or yellow. (I actually know this because our school uniform skirts are made of a blue and yellow tartan, which looks green at a distance).\nNow if, for example, the shroud linen threads consisted of, say, 90% yellow fibres and 10% bright red ones, then we might see that anomalous spike in the spectrum, and be able to resolve it by looking more closely at the individual fibres. However, when we found these bright red fibres (or paint flakes, or whatever they might be) they would still have to be made of a material with a distinctly ‘spiky’ spectrum, which so far I can’t identify.\nAs for identifying individual spectra of layers of different colours, that would be a bit of a poser. However, by overlaying a transmission spectrum (light shining from behind) and a reflectance spectrum (from above), you might be able to identify wavelengths of light absorbed by the material underneath, and thus deduce something about its colour. So a twin layer of red and green would look red by reflected light, but black if you tried to shine a light through it, showing that there was an absorption of the red by the layer beneath it. If the spectra of the two layers were individually quite irregular patterns (such as those of blood and cloth), then subtracting the one from the other might enable you to derive the colour of the hidden material. Maybe an expert in authenticating paintings would have some ideas along those lines?\n\n","date":"April 13, 2013 at 12:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-30617","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App","post":"Further to my previous comment, there’s a region of the Shroud image that is of prime interest.

So-called gap could not be flaking off at all – flaking off at one spot is not flaking off, but purposeful scraping off ( which is possible), but rather than being scraped off it looks much more like a stain of some liquid over the blood, which just dilutes it.\nThe other part – if the body image is not a whole blood stain – why do you expect it to flake off? nobody knows how the image appeared on the cloth, but there is absolutely no reason to expect it to flake off, or wash off, or watever, so it being there does not prove ANYTHING in the domain what is been on the Shroud first – and you clearly want the image to be first .\nSame is pertinent to your description of the “wishbone” – those spots, or gaps which you want to be flaking off look more like diluted by other liquid spots, not even scraping of the dry blood, but clearly wet dilution.Change of color clearly proves that – flaking or just dry scraping off won’t make such a change in the coloring, wet dilution or washing out – will.\nOverall, from your block it is clear that you WISH to prove that image was painted ( though you do not have any idea how) first, and then blood stains were forged over it.\nBut your arguments have no validity in proving that, because you can not prove it experimentally – not knowing HOW the image appeared. There is also no proof that the image can not be superimposed over the stains, without interfering with them – all these speculations about flaking, scraping off ( which do not look like ones at all) are not proof to what was there first.\nThe image might have appeared together with the blood – did you ever thought about that?\n\n","date":"April 14, 2013 at 3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-30796","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App","post":"I’ll gladly allow you the last word on this one – since there is no arguing with people who write “clearly wet dilution”.
