[{"title":"Breaking News on the Bari Conference","post":"“Only few papers accepted for presentation at the workshop exhibit a content within the IEEE field of interest.”\nNo kidding!\nHas Vernon Cooray cancelled his presentation?\nLouis:\n“Piero can clear his doubts about the lightning here and the topic gains importance in view of the paper to be presented by the Sri Lankan scientist Professor Vernon Cooray (Uppsala University, Sweden), author of around 200 scientific papers and a recognised authority, in Bari, Italy.”\nhttps://shroudstory.com/2014/07/15/a-telling-interview-with-giulio-fanti/\nI was hoping that “as professor at Uppsala he should not say to much baloney”… for sure he won’t.\n\n","date":"August 28, 2014 at 10:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/28/breaking-news-on-the-bari-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-146799","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News on the Bari Conference","post":"Well, Professor Vernon Cooray is a known authority, has published around 200 scientific papers and will present his paper on lightning, which is where his expertise lies, at Bari. It will undoubtedly be a scientific paper. What he says will of course be theoretical and we will have to weigh the evidence with what we know for certainty about the Shroud till today. I don’t really expect baloney, for surely he knows the controversies in the realm of Shroud studies. Would he go from Sweden to Bari to present baloney and add to the controversy?\n\n","date":"August 28, 2014 at 2:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/28/breaking-news-on-the-bari-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-146843","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News on the Bari Conference","post":"I couldn’t find him, so i’ve just wondered.\nhttp://dee.poliba.it/ATSI2014/Programma_ATSI%20final.pdf\n\n","date":"August 28, 2014 at 2:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/28/breaking-news-on-the-bari-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-146850","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News on the Bari Conference","post":"Louis, what is your source for stating that Cooray will present a paper at Bari?\n\n","date":"August 28, 2014 at 4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/28/breaking-news-on-the-bari-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-146871","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News on the Bari Conference","post":"Hi Gian Marco, both you and Anoxie has raised a good question.
