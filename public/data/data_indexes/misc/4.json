[{"title":"A guy who claimed to be God","post":"That’s certainly refreshing to read about!  Someone who came to their senses and realized, “Oh my goodness, what if God is REAL?”  \nWe were listening to the “Touching Point” program yesterday (Dr. David Jeremiah’s church program.)  The music in that church is so fabulous. I don’t understand how anyone can resist the music of Christianity, or why they would choose any other religion if they knew what a great time Christians have with their celebrations. Christmas music is so awesome. And Easter music is just as good.\nPerhaps Peace did not come to earth (yet) when Christ was born in Bethlehem, but I do think there is a peace that settles over any person or group or crowd when “Silent Night” is played. That song has even been known to bring peace on the battlefield. \nSo I don’t understand how people can be so resistant about turning to God. Seems as if God has left bread crumb trails all over the place to show people that He is worth knowing. I think they’re kinda dense when they can’t figure out any of it.\n\n","date":"December 5, 2011 at 7:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/05/a-guy-who-claimed-to-be-god/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-5251","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"}]
