Mr. Wilcox explores every hypothesis known and searches out experts in every field of research and science.  The narrative moves along quickly through all of the evidence and the conclusion is undeniable.\nI’m going to order (at least) 3 more copies.\n\n","date":"April 20, 2010 at 9:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/08/the-truth-about-the-shroud-of-turin-solving-the-mystery-exciting-new-book/","cat":"2010","id":"comment-1263","author":"creationbydesign","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Truth About the Shroud of Turin: Solving the Mystery – Exciting New Book","post":"I am a dedicated catholic, I feel impelled to give my testimony because one needs to witness to the truth where and when necessary. In 1981 I was very privileged to have had a vision of our lord Jesus Christ in a historic church that was dedicated to St.Peter and St.Paul, I saw our Lords face, so sad.And the crown of thorns on his head so clear was this vision i could see the string of thorns encircled many times and the thorns so clear as if one would be pricked by them, I was totally awestruck and as you can imagine this vision took me from being a christian with many question marks to a fervent believer, after the vision i went to my mothers home when i went in to her living room i told my mother of my wonderful vision and was overwhelmed to discover that my mother had a copy of the shroud of Turin on her wall.I immediately said to my mother, this is Jesus Christ, this is who i saw actually as he is. It is him. The holy shroud image is that of Jesus Christ, I can’t prove it but i would lay my life on this because it is true. I have since 1981 had many other experiences which have also confirmed to me the authenticity of the holy shroud and that it is of our Lord Jesus Christ. One day it will be recognised as true and venerated as the wonderful relic that it is, and i look forward to that day. Yours in Christ … Fred\n\n","date":"June 6, 2010 at 9:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/08/the-truth-about-the-shroud-of-turin-solving-the-mystery-exciting-new-book/","cat":"2010","id":"comment-1355","author":"Fred","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Truth About the Shroud of Turin: Solving the Mystery – Exciting New Book","post":"I completely believe the image is that of Christ our saviour as well. There is a lot of compelling evidence to say that it is but in the end, you decide by your faith. I was looking at a photograph of it and noticed that the eyes are slightly open. Can you see this too? I wonder sometimes whether the image was formed when he was dead or during the Resurrection. Thank you for sharing your vision :)\n\n","date":"April 25, 2011 at 9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/08/the-truth-about-the-shroud-of-turin-solving-the-mystery-exciting-new-book/","cat":"2010","id":"comment-3015","author":"Louise Cowley","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Truth About the Shroud of Turin: Solving the Mystery – Exciting New Book","post":"One other thing… I’m not so sure it would be agood thing for the Shroud to be proven as being what is it. I think when you know, you just know and you don’t need accurate carbon dating tests. However, if the whole population weer suddenly given evidence that it was real, it might not encourage faith and could cause many problems. We need to believe first.\n\n","date":"April 25, 2011 at 9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/08/the-truth-about-the-shroud-of-turin-solving-the-mystery-exciting-new-book/","cat":"2010","id":"comment-3016","author":"Louise Cowley","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Truth About the Shroud of Turin: Solving the Mystery – Exciting New Book","post":"Fred Ablitt, in my oppinion ,there is no doubt that the shroud of turin is the same shroud that Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of Jesus as in the gospel of Mark chapter 15 verses 42…46. Pope Benedict xv1 recently in Turin stated himself that the holy shroud of turin is like a photograph,positive and negative, he also said it is a burial cloth which enshrouded the corpse of a crusified man, and corresponds to what the gospels tell us about Jesus. I personaly believe that there is a whole stack of evidence to back up the holy shroud of turins true authentisity , but the real problem is that one still needs to look at the whole situation with the eyes of faith ,through an open mind,which is where most non believers stumble because they then have to accept that the God they dont believe in might actualy exist, which totaly contradicts there views, and puts there non beliefe to the test. In my view the real problem is that when true authentisity is being debated with those who dont believe in the existance of God, they inevitably wont take into consideration anything that might oppose there views, so in reality there is a stalemate, they then base there whole analysis on desisions they have made according to there own human ability to judge which is prone to error, using no more than tests to detemine age, carbon dating which has been proven unreliable, in the tests that have been carried out on the holy shroud of turin, so i ask those scientists lets look at this with an open mind, with a full compleate and unbiased analysis of all the evidence without exeption, then a true and fare conclusion can start to take place, if only for the sake of common sence…YOURS IN CHRIST…FRED…\n\n","date":"June 6, 2010 at 9:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/08/the-truth-about-the-shroud-of-turin-solving-the-mystery-exciting-new-book/","cat":"2010","id":"comment-1356","author":"Fred","site":"shroudstory"}]
