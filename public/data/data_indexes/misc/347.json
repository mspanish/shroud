Did King Tut leave his image on the wrapping? I have seen an ocassional stain on mummy wrappings, nothing more.

It also goes to show that things that may not chemically react on their own can when part of a cocktail. But it really is the PBS link with Mattingly’s work that is the most intriguing aspect of the post.\n\n","date":"November 16, 2013 at 12:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/16/pbs-the-real-story-of-king-tut-has-become-shrouded-in-myth-with-many-mysteries-around-his-tomb-unsolved-to-this-day/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-51633","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"PBS: The real story of King Tut has become shrouded in myth, with many mysteries around his tomb unsolved to this day","post":"Hi Dan, I knew that was your intention and it is indeed an interesting post and will serve to illustrate the fact that no pharaoh, Tutankhamon and Ramses II included, left images on any wrappings.

There would be some effect on flesh too, some kind of baking would take place, enough for those in favour of the Maillard reaction.
