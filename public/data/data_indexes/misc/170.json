[{"title":"Tourists or Pilgrims?","post":"Can I say that having led a tour to Turin last year it is one of the most civilized of Italian cities. The centre is almost traffic free after 9 am and stunning Baroque streets radiate out from the former Royal Palace.  There is wealth of cafes and you can even buy a Chocopass allowing you to get free samples from the many small chocolate shops. The Slow Food Movement was born here and excellent food can be got at good prices.\n Don’t miss out on the superbly restored royal hunting lodges, a short distance from the centre and there is the Agnelli art collection in the old FIAT factory as well as excellent museums of cars and cinema.\nSo once you have venerated the Shroud hang about a bit to enjoy the city! My group had a great time.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 7:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/06/tourists-or-pilgrims/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-135630","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tourists or Pilgrims?","post":"Only God can judge what goes on deep inside the heart, so we cannot generalise. One thing is clear: there are those rare pilgrims in Catholicism who walk for kilometres carrying a wooden cross — and not to Santiago de Compostela, taking photographs along the way to show family and friends or to write books — and climb up the stairs of the church kneeling. They don’t know where they will lodge, what they will be able to eat, have no money to buy souvenirs….\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/06/tourists-or-pilgrims/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-135750","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
