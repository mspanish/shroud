I never said that there wasn’t something miraculous going on. Words, indeed, do have meaning. The words dematerialization (of the sort that might produce byproducts to form an image) and commensurate rematerialization imply a process. Going through a door or a wall, or for that matter a floor or a ceiling, implies a process, as well. But it does not necessarily mean de-re-materialization. And then if we consider the way St. Thomas tells us angels come and go, we have another “miraculous going on” option that does not involve de-re-materialization. All of this is, of course, pure speculation. In other words there is no reason to infer dematerialization from scripture at the expense of any other possibility. There is a reason to infer something miraculous but undefined.  But…but…but, all this inferring, which may or may not be de-re-materialization, is valid only if we are assuming a literal reading of scripture.  So to use any of it as evidence you must first prove that a literal interpretation is correct and justified. That is tricky and probably impossible.\n\n","date":"November 17, 2015 at 11:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214736","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"not dematerialize, a different kind of material.\n\n","date":"November 17, 2015 at 9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214733","author":"Chuck Hampton","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"John 21:12 indicates Jesus’ Body could change His appearance.

His body must have been placed and covered by the Shroud in some other place (a place with much more space to do this job).  Such a place could well have been the central room of the tomb or, this is possible, in the open air outside the tomb.\nIf this probable scenario is truly correct (taking into account the normal configuration of Jewish tombs, it is the most logical), then we must conclude that the enveloped body of the Shroud man must have been transferred from this initial place where he was placed inside the Shroud to his final resting place inside the tomb (most likely on a small stone bench carved in a wall).\nIn that case, it’s logical to assume that many bloodstains were already formed before the enveloped body was placed in his final resting place.  It is also logical to assume that, because of this body transfer (manual transfer) from one place to another, some changes (minor or major, it’s difficult to conclude) in the Shroud configuration must have occurred before the start of the image formation, which can easily and logically explain some discrepancies between the body image and some bloodstains (like, for example, the presence of some scourge marks behind the knees in the dorsal image, in a place where there’s absolutely no body image or the presence of a bloodstain outside the frontal body image, in the area of the right elbow).\nIn that context, Latendresse assumption that there have been absolutely no change in the Shroud configuration is most likely false (especially when you keep in mind that the body was most probably placed inside the Shroud in a different place than his final resting place inside the tomb).

From the evidence of the witnesses, it is clear that they perceived it both as something physical, and yet mysterious, with properties that went beyond the merely physical as we know it.  To refer to it as a “spiritual body” seems to me a contradiction in terms.  A pure spirit does not have a body, nor is a body pure spirit.  It is christian doctrine that Christ’s body was resurrected, and we are to understand this as having some physical meaning, not merely a resurrection in the spirit. \nIf we are to look for an analogy, then I prefer one that sees our own familiar universe as a sub-set of a higher universe.  Thus an ant on a table-top may see his own universe as merely two-dimensional with no up nor down.  However from our own three-dimensional universe we may observe the ant and perceive that it does actually exist in a three-dimensional universe.  I think perhaps that the resurrection was something like that.  Christ was able to alight onto the table-top of our own three-dimensional universe from his multi-dimensional higher universe.  The question of passing through walls and closed doors does not enter into the equation.  And I don’t see that this concept involves the creation of any kind of new physics, but is merely a broadening of our perspective.  But it is only an analogy, hopefully more helpful than passing through walls.

One of the semantic problems is that the term “spirit” in most languages seem to have several different meanings.  Essentially there seem to be two approaches, a) metaphysical, b) theological.  Significant metaphysical contributors include Leibnitz, Hegel and Berkeley, and it is necessary to read what they have to say about the subject to arrive at any conclusions, if that is at all possible.  On the theological aspects of the problem, my preference is for a Thomistic approach.  However several of the early fathers of the church have also written about the subject and some of them have asserted that the angels are not immaterial beings. \nI think you might be interested in reading an article on the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia web-site, which has an interesting discussion and provides some overview of the notion of spirit:\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14220b.htm  \nHowever my main assertion is that following the resurrection, Christ’s human body was no longer found in the tomb, and yet he appeared to several witnesses in some kind of corporeal form.

I agree that the concept of spirit, and much else, is something different from matter.  However, in the history of both philosophy and theology, the concept has been highly contentious.  The Catholic Encyclopedia link I gave above is an interesting brief discussion, but I believe it is a transcript of the older early 1900s version and it may possibly be now somewhat dated.  Nevertheless it is still informative.  \nMy Encyc Brit package has much to say in an article on such metaphysics, but of course with no real conclusion.  It is evident that Leibnitz, Berkeley and Hegel had much to say on the concept of spirit, but there are several others, both ancient and modern.as a Google search on “notions of spirit” easily demonstrates. \nRecently my local U3A group ran a series of discussions on Evolution covering a lot of similar ground.  The later works of Darwin seem to see the development of morality and religion as part of the evolutionary process, and seems to have an essentially materialist bias.  It culminates in the work of Richard Dawkins.  As with any group of people discussing the topic, it proved to be contentious and of course resulting in no real consensus.  People will believe what they choose to believe. \nI think there is much of informative value in what the evolutionists can tell us.  My personal belief is that it demonstrates God’s plan of revelation to us.  But to ignore the contribution that religion has made to the development of civillisation in the course of its history is a gross error of judgement.  To me it corroborates this plan of God to bring mankind to Himself.

They derived from certain oral traditions, to some extent independent.  These traditions occurred within a society for which oral tradition was far more important than it is for instance in modern western society.  They rapidly assume a fixed form to the extent that any deviations from the accepted format can be deemed to be an incompetence.  I am familiar with this fixed attitude towards oral transmission of cultural traditions, particularly genealogies and rituals, among NZ Maori and Pacifica peoples.  It also occurs in African primal societies. \n2)  These oral traditions were used in different ways by the individual evangelists.  Thus both Matthew and Luke, as well as using Mark, have access to another source common to them.  Also Matthew and Luke each have access to a third and fourth source but which are not used by the other.  John’s gospel is to a large extent independent, but like Matthew and Luke also uses much of Mark’s Passion narrative.   They were also written at a time when there would have been witnesses still living.  The essential point is that in spite of whatever individual differences in use of source material occur, or their approach and style, all four gospels are fundamentally corroborative, \n3.  The conversion of Paul occurs well after the events of Jesus’ earthly life at a time when the followers were being persecuted.  In fact we are told that he supervised the stoning of Stephen.  He is not concerned with narrating the events of Christ’s death nor of his resurrection, but seeks to interpret them in his own particular way.  He is not a witness to the actual resurrection event as reported in the gospels, but a witness to the resurrected Christ as manifest to himself in his own particular conversion at a much later date. \n4.  Paul’s conversion is in fact narrated in Acts by the same author as the third gospel, Luke.  In fact Luke reports Paul’s conversion at three separate places:  Acts 9:1-9;  Acts 22:3-16;  and Acts 22:2-16, with some differences in detail owing to the use of different sources.  \n5. Paul’s own letters, although set down in writing at an earlier time than the gospels, report his own experience of Christ resurrected as the personal manifestation to himself.  There seems to be no specific evidence that he was familiar with Christ’s earthly mission or had even encountered him.  In his own words, it was as if he were born out of due time.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2015 at 5:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214806","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Daveb:  Paul’s letters set down at an earlier time than the gospels?  Very much not a consensus view:\nLuke was a traveling companion of Paul, and is mentioned in three of Paul’s letters as “Luke the beloved physician.”  Luke joined Paul on his second missionary journey in Troas. During Paul’s third journey, Luke joined him in Philippi (Acts 20:6) and went with him to Jerusalem (Acts 20:16).\nPaul quotes Luke as Scripture:\nWhen Paul wrote to Timothy (1 Timothy 5:18) he quoted a passage from Luke as Scripture:  “FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, ‘You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads the grain,’ and, ‘the laborer is worthy of his wages’.”\nThe first verse quoted is from Deuteronomy 25:4.

It is now generally considered pseudonymous, and almost certainly non-Pauline.  It is absent in some of the early canons, but was eventually included for its pastoral content.  It is hardly surprising that it might cite a passage or so from a gospel account.  \nWith the early expectation of the Parousia there would seem little point in committing the events of Jesus’ life to writing.  Because this expectation went unfulfilled, the decision would then have been made to commit the oral traditions received into the written form of the gospels.  That they originated from  a set of various oral traditions is evident from their pericope format, a set of structured brief episodes likely recited during communal worship, now gathered together into a coherent narrative.  \n2)  My point was that there was little if any evidence to demonstrate that Paul had any personal acquaintance with the earthly mission of Jesus, whereas the gospels are primarily concerned with setting down this narrative.  His encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus occurs well after the events of the gospels.  That there seems to be have been physical aspects to this encounter, would only seem to support an argument that Christ’s resurrection was of a physical nature, rather than arguing against it.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2015 at 2:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214817","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Response to Sampath: \nThe book, “Acts of the Apostles” is presented at its outset as a continuation of Luke’s gospel.  Both are addressed to one Theophilus, who may be some official, a real person, or it may just be a literary device, similar to that used by some other Greek authors.  “Theo-philus” could be translated as “Lover of God”, that is it may be intended for a general reader who wishes to know more about God.  \nPerhaps 50% of Mark’s gospel is used by Luke (In Matthew it is about 90%).  Like Matthew, Luke also uses Q.  However there is also material unique to Luke (L).  This includes the “old age” birth-story of John the Baptist, Luke’s Infancy narrative, and several parables (e.g. Good Samaritan, Prodigal Son).  All the material about John the Baptist is deliberately placed before that of Jesus.  Luke tends to humanise the portrait of Jesus compared to the starker picture presented by Mark and Matthew, there is a concern for piety and prayer, it comes from the Septuagint tradition, and there is compassion for the poor and despised.  However there also seems to be some ignorance concerning certain Jewish customs and Jewish geography.  (Luke does not appreciate that it is impossible to have a solar eclipse during Passover.) \nFrom about Ch 13 of Acts dealing with Paul’s mission to the Gentiles, the author adopts the pronoun “We” as if he is a companion on Paul’s journeys.  This may be the case, or it may be a literary device to establish the authority of his text with Paul as his guarantor.  Several differences from Paul’s own accounts and his pattern of thought have seemed difficult to reconcile the author of Acts as a close companion of Paul.  So he may be working from sources other than his own experience. \nThe three accounts in Acts of Paul’s conversion pose no difficulty in reconciliation.  In Acts 9:1-9 the conversion is part of the narrative;  In Acts 22:3-16, the conversion is presented as Paul recounting his experience to appease the rioting Jews seeking to kill him; In Acts 26:2-18 it is presented as his own account before King Agrippa and the governor Festus before Paul’s departure for Rome.  The differences are in only minor matters of detail. \nIf you are look for a good annotated on-line Bible text, then I recommend the USCCB version which I often use myself when on-line.

Only c. 31 verses of Mark are found nowhere in Matthew or Luke. In the material common to all three Synoptics, there is very seldom verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke against Mark, though such agreement is common between Matthew and Mark or Luke and Mark or where all three concur. \n2) The postulated common saying source of Matthew and Luke, Q, would account for much verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke when they include sayings absent from Mark. The fact that the sayings are used in different ways or different contexts in Matthew and Luke is an indication of a somewhat free way in which the editors could take material and mold it to their given situations and needs.  \n3) The placement of Q material in Luke and Matthew disagrees at certain points according to the needs and theologies of the addressees of the gospels, but in Matthew the Marcan chronology is the basic scheme into which Q is put. Mark’s order is kept, on the whole, by Matthew and Luke, but, where it differs, at least one agrees with Mark. After chapter 4 in Matthew and Luke, not a single passage from Q is in the same place. Q was a source written in Greek as was Mark, which can be demonstrated by word agreement (not possible, for example, with a translation from Aramaic, although perhaps the Greek has vestiges of Semitic structure form). \nIt is therefore a reasonable conclusion that both Matthew and Luke had access to Mark’s gospel, but there has to be an explanation as to why there is common material in Matthew and Luke not present in Mark.  Augustine’s speculation that Mark was an abbreviation of Matthew does not stand up to scrutiny in terms of modern scholarship.  Nevertheless the theory does re-emerge from time to time and has done so recently, but it remains a minority view.  Note that there is more agreement between Mark-Matthew and Mark-Luke than there is between all three.  This points to Mark as being a source used by both Matthew and Luke.  We then need an explanation as to a separate common Matthew-Luke source for material not found in Mark.  The Q source theory satisfies this requirement.  There is much that continues to be debated, such as whether there was a type of original Aramaic version of a Proto-Matthew now lost, which Mark may have used, but these debates are of more interest to specialists in exegesis, and being speculative I think are of lesser general interest.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2015 at 3:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214855","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Perhaps, Dave, but this in no way supports the wild Q theory.\n\n","date":"November 25, 2015 at 10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215117","author":"Dcn Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Response to Don Andy at Nov 25, 20:18 pm:\nAndy, I note you have now been promoted to Deacon.

What if Napoleon had succeeded in invaded Britain, or Japan had never attacked Pearl Harbour? What if light travelled at the same speed as sound? Scientists and historians have enjoyed developing interesting and sometimes useful scenarios based on these ideas, knowing full well that the premises were wholly unsubstantiated.\nOne of Jackson’s axioms is that a body can become instantaneously mechanically transparent. From that, and the rest of his postulates, Jackson has built a reasonable scenario which, according to his ‘new physics’, could produce an image exactly as seen on the Shroud. The scenario is controversial. To suggest that the axioms upon which it is based are controversial – is silly. Even Jackson knows very well that there is no known physics on which such a predicate could be based, although he desperately hopes that, simply because science has occasionally been wrong before, something may turn up to justify it eventually.\n“As a physicist, I admit to having my own difficulties with this concept … [but] … I would like to ask the reader to put aside, for the moment, any reservations he or she might have concerning the “unconventional” nature of this concept and consider it merely as a hypothesis to be evaluated critically using the well established principles of the Scientific Method.”\nWell, fair enough.\n\n","date":"November 18, 2015 at 9:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214774","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Well and fairly stated Hugh.

I described this concern mathematically in a paper for the Proceedings of the 1977 United States Conference of Research on the Shroud of Turin entitled, ‘A problem of resolution posed by the existence of a three-dimensional image on the Shroud.”  This problem, in fact, persists to this day as can be seen from the Image Characteristics versus Image Formation Hypothesis Table of the Critical Summary; compare rows B2.0 (High Resolution) and B3.0 (3-Dimensional) for which no hypothesis, except the Radiation Fall-Through hypothesis, is indicated as simultaneously satisfying both image criteria.  Moreover, a careful reading of the 1990 paper will show that the logic of the Radiation Fall-Through hypothesis does not, in any way, depend upon or require an assumption arising from Christian theology; rather, the logic arises strictly from what is observed on the Shroud of Turin image.”  \nJackson’s hypothesis proves nothing.

So the blame for the misunderstanding has to be laid on my shoulders. The Italian physicist, guided by Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti it seems, was able to see that there was no double superficiality on the Shroud. That is clear in the interview. Years before this interview a prominent “Shroudie” did give me the same information, however I kept quiet, thinking about a line Ian Wilson wrote in his book “The 2000-year-old mystery solved” saying that when Professor Giovanni Riggi separated the relic from the backing cloth he saw some stains that looked like an image in the face area.\nNow the question that arises is: what exactly do we see there? Are they bloodstains or a bit of the face image? Turin says they are bloodstains.\nYou may remember that I wrote an article entitled “Science and religion meet in Shroud research”, which was an interview with Professor Giulio Fanti on the double superficiality and other points in his research. It is no longer online but I am willing to post it again if that is what you wish.\nI think TSC, which has done some very good work, should be more active in the debate and update its site whenever needed. They are also free to contact me if there is anything they would like me to write on new research.\nI have always made it a point to be as correct as possible in writing articles and reviews, although unfortunately it seems that some things I have written have deliberately been ignored. To give you an example, I wrote against the “Kashmir tomb” years ago and received an email from an important scientist appointed by the Vatican saying that it had laid this “Jesus in Kashmir” hypothesisdcx tomb to rest:\n https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The_Quest_for_Jesus_in_Shroud_research\nThe right hand does not know what the left hand is doing in some places where there is Shroud research.

No sides are being taken here, as I respect both Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro and Professor Giulio Fanti.\nI think Turin could make the microphotographs in its possession available to us as it would put an end to the controversy.\nBest.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2015 at 9:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214810","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"did not Jesus ask for a piece of fish when he appeared to the disciples by the sea….body…not spirit…sometimes I laugh when the great minds on this thread try to explain what God is capable of…..\n\n","date":"November 18, 2015 at 7:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214791","author":"rick","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Rick, this is precisely the problem I see with the concept of a “spiritual body”.  The ref you mention is found in Luke 24:36-43: \n“… 39* Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see I have.” 40 And as he said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 While they were still incredulous for joy and were amazed, he asked them, “Have you anything here to eat?” 42 They gave him a piece of baked fish; 43 he took it and ate it in front of them.”\nWhatever a resurrected body might be, I don’t know that it can be called a spiritual body.  \nYour comment: “… try to explain what God is capable of…..”\nThe equation I sometimes use is “Nothing is impossible to God”  If anything is a contradiction, then it is a “Nothing” and this is impossible for God.  Q: Is a spiritual body a contradiction?\n\n","date":"November 19, 2015 at 1:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214799","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Also see John 21:9-13:\n“9 When they climbed out on shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.” 11 So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore full of one hundred fifty-three* large fish. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” And none of the disciples dared to ask him,* “Who are you?” because they realized it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them, and in like manner the fish.”  \nWhether this fish breakfast incident was an actual occurrence or not , for there may be some kind of eucharistic intent in the story, clearly the evangelist is stressing that the resurrection of Jesus was not merely ghostly, mythic, a phantasm, nor angelic, it was a truly bodily resurrection.  This is all part of the resurrection tradition that is being developed, as with the other evangelists, and the early apostolic church. \nLikewise, the earlier appearances, first to a group of the apostles I mentioned above, second with Thomas present.  Thus John is stressing the bodily aspects of the resurrection in three separate ways, and three means emphatic!\n\n","date":"November 19, 2015 at 2:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214800","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"Out of the many hypothesises, I can see, there are only two possibilities to form an image on the burial cloth.

To be fair, he admits that this is little more than an abstract fancy, and asks his reader’s indulgence to accept it as a premise and move on. But if one were to give the rest of his hypothesis any credence at all, one must inevitably inquire how a body can become mechanically transparent, and what happened next. Did the mechanically transparent Jesus become solid again, get up, push the stone away and walk out? Or did he mechanically transparently walk through the stone and resolidify outside? And where did he get his new clothes from? Those who accept the Resurrection as a straight miracle, and those who think the Resurrection, whatever it was, did not violate the known laws of nature, do not get bogged down by this sort of thing, but attempting to describe a miracle as if it were scientifically comprehensible is a passport to more and more convoluted, and less and less credible, imaginary physics.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2015 at 12:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214876","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dematerialization 101","post":"The Resurrection will never be scientifically comprehensible. It “points beyond history but also left footprints in history,” as Benedict XVI wrote in his book. That explains the rise of Christianity.\nSome years ago I reviewed a book that was sent to me by the publisher, entitled “The departed among the living”, by Professor Erlendur Haraldsson. Having done two courses in Parapsychology and conducted some on-site research in the field, the topic continued to interest me. The book reported surveys where materialisation and dematerilisation are supposed to have taken place, but no investigation was conducted. Later, in other books, when I noticed that the Indian magician Sathya Sai Baba was being considered as a divine figure I began to think about Carl Sagan’s “baloney detection”.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2015 at 1:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-214877","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
