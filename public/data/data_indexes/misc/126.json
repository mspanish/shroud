[{"title":"Revisiting the Cosmic Log Poll One More Time","post":"My own personal view is that online polls are completely invalid and any attempt to extract meaning from them is an exercise in frustration. Polls done by reputable firms have a hard time getting it right and they take great pains to do that over and above what online polls do. At best online polls reflect only who decided to respond to them out of the particular audience that visited at the time they were posted. Blogs etc draw types of people and that alone can skew the results because certain types may be far from representative of the target audience. \nIf the author wants an opinion poll from a certain audience he would do best to commission such a poll from a reputable firm.\n\n","date":"February 3, 2012 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/03/revisiting-the-cosmic-log-poll-one-more-time/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7889","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Revisiting the Cosmic Log Poll One More Time","post":"Excellent comment…  I agree completely.\n\n","date":"February 3, 2012 at 11:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/03/revisiting-the-cosmic-log-poll-one-more-time/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7890","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
