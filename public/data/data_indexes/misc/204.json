In the four corners are what appear to be pins, as if this image is a photograph of a big enlargement pinned to a wall. If anyone has a copy of Baima Bollone’s book, can they say if it has any acknowledgement, or even a caption? As a single image, it looks nothing like any other micrograph I have seen, so if it is part of a set, it is curious that none of the others have been reproduced on the web. ‘Sindone O No’ has been superceded by three newer books by Baima Bollone; is the photo reproduced in them?\n\n","date":"November 27, 2015 at 7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/27/i-hope-this-helps/","cat":"reader_inquiry","id":"comment-215175","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I Hope This Helps","post":"In the 1990 book, Sindone o no, this is fig. 34 with no acknowledgements and with the following caption: “Fibrille di filo di lino prelevato in corrispondenza della pianta del piede destro con granuli di materiale pigmentato che le indagini di immunofluorescenza hanno dimostrato essere sangue umano.” Translation: “fibrils from a linen thread taken from the sole of the right foot  with granules of pigmented material that immunofluorescence investigations have shown to be human blood.”\nThe same photo is in the 2010 and 2015 books by Baima Bollone with similar caption (lacking the last words). In all cases the photo is rotated with respect to the one shown above. I have not found the photo in books of 1998, 2000 and 2006.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2015 at 9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/27/i-hope-this-helps/","cat":"reader_inquiry","id":"comment-215178","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I Hope This Helps","post":"Thanks, Gian Marco.

It is interesting that the image is captioned ‘superficiality’ on Soons’ website, which is a feature of the image and not of the blood, which has seeped right through to the other side of the cloth.
