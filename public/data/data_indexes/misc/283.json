[{"title":"Miracle Stain","post":"One thing this commercial indicates is that there is a broader awareness of the Shroud than some might expect. I had breakfast with a client the other day who is relatively young <35 and when I mentioned my project to him, he went-off on the screwed-up C-14 and how they carbon dated the wrong part etc. I was surprised.\n(Incidentally, the issue arose when he complained that he had fallen walking his dog and had some painful bruises. Maybe I should rename my dog Bogie, \"Prophet?\" Nah.)\n\n","date":"February 6, 2013 at 7:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/06/miracle-stain/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-23577","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Miracle Stain","post":"Funny ad except for the last line.
