I have certainly disagreed with these at various times but have generally given the reaaons for that, seldom by just curt dismissal. I consider him to be remarkably well-informed concerning several obscure matters, but it is principally some of his interpretations of these and the inferences he makes which I find contentious. I considered that the contributions he made under the June 7 discussion under the heading of the Tilma of Guadalupe and the Veil of Manopello particularly worthwhile and made a point of saying so. But this did not satisfy him and he continued to harbour his resentments against me. Despite his extensive knowledge and particular specialist field, Mr Hamon needs to learn that the real world is not governed by specialists, irrespective of their particular expertise. It is governed by generalists, who if they are wise, will take due consideration of what experts may have to say, but without necessarily accepting it as gospel. Court histories are littered with any number of cases where alleged experts have been in violent disagreement on opposing sides and it is over to juries of ordinary persons with no specialist knowledge of their own to weigh the value of their evidence.

Nevertheless, Urban exercised his prerogative of clemency to Galileo in setting aside the Inquisition’s sentence. Dr Hamon (if that is how he prefers to be so titled) might discover a valuable lesson in Galileo’s failure in human relations. \nGalileo’s own views on the relationship between scientific research and biblical interpretation have been endorsed by the Vatican since 1893. In 1979 Pope John Paul II reiterated this view and stated that Galileo had suffered injustice at the hands of the church. A statement by the pope before the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1992 is interpreted by some as a rehabilitation of Galileo. \nNevertheless, Johannes Kepler was never able to pursuade Galileo that planets moved in elliptical orbits rather than circles, as it seems that Galileo himself still retained some vestige of a Platonic idealism, rather than committing himself to the more accurate mathematical model devised by Kepler.   \nAs with Galileo, posterity may find that Dr Hamon is correct in his assertions (though lacking the same quality of evidence as Galileo’s), and then again it might just not.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 10:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/13/argumentum-ad-populum-of-the-day/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-36902","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Argumentum ad populum of the day","post":"BTW Pr Hamon (just for you, Mr Belz).
