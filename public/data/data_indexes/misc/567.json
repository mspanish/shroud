Barrie’s argument is very weak and his opinion not qualified.” (October 24, 2011 at 11:21 am | #16) ONLY IN REFERENCE TO Barrie Schwortz writing Yannick Clément: \n“if they did use coins, they certainly would not have put a pagan Caesar coin on the face of the prophesized Messiah!”. \nAllI wanted to say is How can Barrie be so sure? As a technical photographer and no matter how Jewish he is, Barrie is definitedly just not qualified to judge in archaeological and numismatics matter. He is neither a numismatic scholar nor a profesional numismatist that I know of. Are your criticisms only one way?\n\n","date":"October 26, 2011 at 5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/two-jews-three-opinions-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-4375","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Jews, Three Opinions and the Shroud of Turin","post":"….just because Barrie just cannot be wrong?\n\n","date":"October 26, 2011 at 6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/two-jews-three-opinions-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-4376","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Two Jews, Three Opinions and the Shroud of Turin","post":"“These are strong opinions from Hamon – ad hominem charges.

Through 2nd Temple  Judeans, they may were indeed  look ambivalent  as they were specifically designed not only to abide by the 2nd commandment but to be used by Judeans on a daily basis)\nBUT HE IS ALSO WRONG IN HIS FACTS\n(He did mistake Body image and Blood Visual Resolution Limits when it comes to the coin-on-eye issue AND his final assertion that Frei did not lifted up any sticky tape sample on the Shroud face is in rather sharp contrast with the very FACT Frei DID LIFT UP at least one sticky tape sample from the right cheek of the Man of the Shroud) \nAre my opinions not qualified and Barrie’s qualified.
