[{"title":"August 16, 2015 Ecumenical Possibilities","post":"IN the paper you site by Kim Dreisbach he takes it one step further. The Pope holds the Shroud in trust for all of humanity. He quotes a Catholic priest:\n“As Fr. Anthony Delessi of the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Conyers, Georgia has so\nwisely observed: ‘We Roman Catholics have been its custodians for the last eight\nhundred years after stealing it from the Greeks (i.e. Orthodox) who performed that\nfunction for the first twelve centuries. But in truth, it belongs to no one denomination –\nmaybe not even to Christianity. Rather, it is in actuality ’God’s love letter in linen to all\nmankind.'”\nAnd now I turn to the “The Second Coming”  by William Butler Yeats:\n“The darkness drops again; but now I know\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?” \nMake that Turin.\n\n","date":"December 6, 2013 at 9:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/06/august-16-2015-ecumenical-possibilities/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-56937","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
