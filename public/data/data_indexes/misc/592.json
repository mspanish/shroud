That is fascinating.\nI know of no particular Anglican theological opinion on Our Lady of Guadalupe. Here is an interesting Wikipedia article about José S. Landaverde, an Anglican Catholic priest who opened a mission, the Our Lady of Guadalupe Anglican Catholic Church on Chicago’s South Side. As for theological opinion on the relic there would likely be none. Generally, on such matters, Anglicanism leaves this to the individual. Of course, there is still a lot of unwarranted prejudice against relics among Anglicans that goes all the way back to the reformation, that is unless they are English in which case it is okay for some reason.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2013 at 4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/what-if-there-is-a-breeze/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-59941","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What if there is a breeze?","post":"I knew you would like that and you may have noticed that the photograph of the procession makes it difficult to distinguish between Anglican and Catholic. So we have two Walsinghams, one Catholic and the other Anglican, and that is a pity. Westminster Abbey now has some “Our Ladys with Child Jesus” and icons. The tomb of Saint Edward the Confessor, King of England, is the ” holy of holies” there, and reminds one of Catholic devotion to saints. The Church of England will have to come to terms with these “Our Ladys” and relics because they are also accepted in the Orthodox Church.\nCatholicism also does not impose belief in relics and pilgrimages to shrines and we have had Pope John Paul II devoted to Fatima and, before him, Pope Paul VI believing that there was no revelation after the NT.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2013 at 4:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/what-if-there-is-a-breeze/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-59947","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What if there is a breeze?","post":"Like the Manappello cloth if it looks like a painting IT IS A PAINTING.

I have in depth photographic knowledge of all the relics in existance and have processed all of them. Pheiffer resoning that Manappello image miraculously appears on both sides is also  ridiculous as if any artist paints on a silk it will be seen on both sides as silk and bysup is transparent. Unfortunately for Pheiffer he made his conclusions in the late 90s. My work and discovery on Vatican Veronica has debunked his theory. Once I set up my project team or some scientists decide to verify my findings, the Manoppello will be relegated to what it is a famous painting of unknown origen. The Guadalupe Mary if you study the history was created by an Aztec artist. It has survived 500 years because every few years it is painted over and over. There are only 2 miraculous cloths in existance, the Shroud and the Veronica Veil, The cloth of Olivedo in Spain is also authentic but does not have any encoded imagery\n\n","date":"December 16, 2013 at 12:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/what-if-there-is-a-breeze/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-60059","author":"Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What if there is a breeze?","post":"Vincenzo, this sort of arrogant comment along with claims of special knowledge from undocumented methods will get your comments bounced off of this blog in the future.
