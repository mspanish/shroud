[{"title":"Good to know where Hank Hanegraaff stands on the nails","post":"Genuine visions are peculiar phenomena.  Not only may they be a divine revelation, but their purpose is a private communication, so that there have to be elements reflecting the psychology and understanding of the recipient, for the revelation to be effective.  Thus if Hagin believed that Jesus was nailed through his palms, even with three-sided nails, then that is what he might very well see, and that would not necessarily nullify the vision. The test of the vision would be how effective Hagin was in his ministry to the sick. “By their fruits shall you know them!” A similar situation applies in the case of stigmatists. It seems that it is usual for genuine stigmatists to receive the imprints of Christ’s wounds, on their bodies corresponding to where they believe they occurred. \nWe can blame St Jerome for the tranlation of “cheir..” as “manus” rather than “carpus”.  Precisely the same noun “cheir..” is used in Peter’s release from prison, Acts 12:7.  Jerome also tranlates this as “manus”, so that most English tranlations have “And the chains fell from his hands”.  Whereas a moment’s reflection would conclude that in fact the chains would have been around his wrists.  This is acknowledged in a number of modern translations, including the US Conference of Catholic Bishops translation. Thus USCCB Acts 12:7 has:\n‘Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, “Get up quickly.” The chains fell from his wrists.’\nhttp://www.usccb.org/bible/acts/12\n\n","date":"October 7, 2013 at 6:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/07/good-to-know-where-hank-hanegraaff-stands-on-the-nails/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-46363","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
