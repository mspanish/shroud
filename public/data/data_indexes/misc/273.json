[{"title":"Maybe God Doesn’t Know the Future","post":"Much as I appreciate Polkinghorne and Barbour for their attempts to relate Christianity and Science, if the Bible is a special revelation from God (as it claims to be – 2Tim 3:16; 2Pet 1:20, etc – and why BOTHER relating Christianity with Science if it isn’t), then they are WRONG. \nIn the beginning of time, God already WAS (Gn 1:1; Jn 1:1). God is the I AM (Ex 3:14), which if it means anything, means He is not subject to time. \nJesus referring to this, confirmed that God IS the God of the long-dead patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, because “to him all are alive.” (Lk 20:37-39).\nAs for the Kenosis Theory, that in His Incarnation “Christ emptied himself of his divine (eternal) nature and became human (temporal)”, the Bible passage it is based on, Philippians 2:5-6, does NOT say that. \nReading from my Interlinear New Testament, it says: “… Christ Jesus, who in the form [Gk. morphe = nature] of God SUBSISTING [huparchon] … himself emptied [ekenosen = come to nothing – hence “made himself of no reputation” KJV] the form of a slave taking …” \nSo Paul is NOT saying that Christ emptied Himself of His God-nature, but that, while REMAINING GOD, He took on a human nature.\nThat Jesus still had His God nature while on Earth, but normally voluntarily suppressed it, is evident in that with a word of command He stilled a storm (Mt 8:18,23-27; Mk 4:35-41; Lk 8:22-25), and the disciples, some of whom were professional fisherman, “were terrified and asked each other, `Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!'” (Mk 4:41).\nStephen E.
