[{"title":"Quote of the Day on Skeptical Websites About the Shroud ofÂ Turin","post":"It is a problem, but there is a greater problem that I have never heard addressed. If you take a curved surface and wrap a plane (i.e. a piece of cloth) around it to take an impression of it, when you flatten it out it warps the image. (Think of a cylinder projection map of the Earth.) If anyone knows of an examination of this issue, please let me know.\n\n","date":"June 5, 2011 at 6:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/17/quote-of-the-day-on-skeptical-websites-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"quotations","id":"comment-3225","author":"David","site":"shroudstory"}]
