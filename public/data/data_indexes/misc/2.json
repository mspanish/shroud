I totally agree and have already started working on the redesign of the Main Menu page.  I particularly appreciate the technical suggestions and will include them when I update the site for our 16th anniversary update on January 21, 2012. And no, this is not going to get anyone into trouble with me! The site has needed a face lift for years but other priorities always got in the way. Thanks for giving me a much needed nudge!\n\n","date":"September 20, 2011 at 1:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/20/a-call-to-freshen-up-shroud-com/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3962","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Call to Freshen Up shroud.com","post":"One thing’s for sure about my friend Barrie Schwortz :  He’s wise enough to take good friendly advice and keep them !

Or even WordPress but I’m a Joomla fan myself. \nThe site is all HTML. In some ways that’s good but it’s really old fashioned now.\n\n","date":"September 22, 2011 at 9:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/20/a-call-to-freshen-up-shroud-com/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-4005","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"}]
