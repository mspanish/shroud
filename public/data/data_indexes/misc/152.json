[{"title":"Excellent Interview with the creator of Shroud Encounter","post":"I had the pleasure of meeting Russ and attending his incredibly moving presentation on the Shroud last evening at Providence Academy in Plymouth, MN.  The session was well attended and the audience was very engaged.   Even though I know a fair amount about the Shroud, I really liked how Russ integrated his discussion with Sacred Scripture (both Old and New Testaments), which made it very appropriate in these early days of Lent.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2012 at 10:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/excellent-interview-with-the-creator-of-shroud-encounter/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-8857","author":"Randy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Excellent Interview with the creator of Shroud Encounter","post":"Thanks Randy,  it was great to meet you. I was at the University of St. Thomas today with a packed house. I have an interview with the local Fox affiliate on Saturday morning and then back home.  If you can watch, I should be on between 7:30 and 9:00.  Not exactly sure when.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2012 at 5:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/excellent-interview-with-the-creator-of-shroud-encounter/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-8869","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"}]
