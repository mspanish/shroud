There is little to nothing of the symbolic in these words:\nPope Pius XI (1922-1939):  “… certainly not the work of any human hand.”\nPope Pius XII (1939-1958):  “The linen in which Joseph of Arimathea enveloped the sacred remains of our Lord Jesus Christ.”\nPope John XXIII (1958-63):  “This can only be the Lord’s own doing.”\nPope Paul VI (1963-78):  “…The image from the Holy Shroud reveals to us the human and divine personality of Christ.”\nPope John Paul II (1978-2005): “The Holy Shroud is the most splendid relic of the Passion and Resurrection.”\nPope Benedict XVI (2005-2013):  “… a photographic document of the darkest mystery of faith — that of Christ’s Crucifixion and Resurrection.”\nPope Francis I (2013- ):  “By means of the Holy Shroud, the unique and supreme Word of God comes to us”\n\n","date":"April 22, 2015 at 7:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/22/short-shrift-article-at-huffpo-uk/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197171","author":"Nabber","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Short Shrift Article at HuffPo-UK","post":"Nabber; thanks for those quotes.

Desperate refugees risk drowning in the Mediterranean in rickety unseaworthy craft, flooding Europe with their own version of Islam and fomenting strife there, and political leaders dilly-dally impotently allowing it all to happen.  The best that Australia’s Prime MInister Tony Abbott can do is recommend that they follow his example and turn back all the refugees and not allow them to land, a policy of inhuman indifference.  Meantime we hear that the dominant news in overseas media is New Zealand’s Prime Minister John Key playfully tugging some waitress’s pony tail in a cafe, and this trivial item has apparently gone globally ballistic.  I have seen nought, nothing, zilch in any of the New Zealand media, religious or secular, about the Shroud’s current exposition programme in Turin.  April 25 will be the centenary of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli, an inglorious defeat for the allies, but a major national memorial commemoration for our two nations.   \nSo much for the priorities of post-modern news media and its gaggle of reporters!!\n\n","date":"April 22, 2015 at 3:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/22/short-shrift-article-at-huffpo-uk/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197229","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Short Shrift Article at HuffPo-UK","post":"It is a glaring example of how interests trumpet values in our world today.

That is the reason why,perhaps, NZ Cardinal John Atcherley Dew has kept quiet. The Australian Cardinal George Pell is doing some excellent work in Rome, and beyond this his interest lies in John Henry Newman.\n\n","date":"April 22, 2015 at 4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/22/short-shrift-article-at-huffpo-uk/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197233","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Short Shrift Article at HuffPo-UK","post":"***Angel says:  People will believe a lie, if you tell it often enough.  \nNon-believers, due to the erroneous C-14 dating, are (in reality) making use of that phrase to not only discredit the Shroud, but  to cast doubt on any future test that would validate its authenticity.\nLike “Alice in Wonderland,”  what is up is down, what is right is wrong and what is truth is a lie.\nWelcome to the  new world order.  :)\nBest,\n\n","date":"April 22, 2015 at 6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/22/short-shrift-article-at-huffpo-uk/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197243","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Short Shrift Article at HuffPo-UK","post":"Is there anything this author is not ignorant about?\nHe displays an intense ignorance of the actual facts and events of the continuing study which has completely discredited the carbon dating since it does not represent the date of the Shroud, but only a repaired corner.\nThanks goes to Nabber for also showing the author’s ignorance of Papal statements about the Shroud itself.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2015 at 11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/22/short-shrift-article-at-huffpo-uk/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197649","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"}]
