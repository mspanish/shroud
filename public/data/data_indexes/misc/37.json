Malheureusement, chez bon nombre de croyants modernes très religieux, on dénote une toute autre manière de voir ce linge et son image.  En fait, ils ne cherchent que des preuves scientifiques de la résurrection et c’est une honte car Jésus lui-même a vraiment fait l’éloge de la foi sans preuve !!!  Donc, bravo encore pour ta manière de voir les choses et je te souhaite vraiment de rester ouvert aux nombreux signes de la résurrection et de la vie éternelle que nous envoi l’Esprit Saint, pour peu que nous ayons les yeux de la foi pour les voir !!!\n\n","date":"April 1, 2013 at 4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/01/an-easter-meditation-on-the-shroud-as-a-sign/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-29019","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Easter Meditation on the Shroud as a Sign","post":"In this same part of the Shroud Spectrum International issue that I refer to in my comment of Father Garneau’s meditation (link: http://shroud.com/pdfs/ssi02part9.pdf), there is a summary of an Italian congress about the Shroud that was held in Bologna, Italy in 1982. In it, there’s a very interesting note concerning a presentation done by Professor Giovanni Imbalzano in which he called attention to the 3-D effect of CHEMICAL-THERMOGRAPHIC IMPRINTS, which could offer precious information about the Shroud image. If Dan could find the text of this presentation (it is possible that a review of it can be found in Sindon #30), I think it would be interesting to publish it on the blog. We constantly hear this false statement in the pro-Shroud world: “The 3-D nature of the Shroud image is totally unique.” A long time ago, I point out that such a statement is completely wrong and, as a proof, I pointed out the experiment done with the VP-8 image analyzer done by John De Salvo in the 1980s with imprints of plants on paper that truly gave the same kind of 3-D results than the Shroud image with the VP-8 and, from this note concerning Prof. Imbalzano’s presentation in Bologna, it seems that other examples of natural imprints that contained 3-D information exists… \nAll this is truly a bad thing for all those who defend the idea that the Shroud image can only be linked with the Resurrection of Christ and can, therefore, represent a physical proof of that supernatural event, because these people often used the wrong idea that there is no image in the world that was naturally formed and which contain 3-D information, in order to back-up their religiously biased ideology. Because we now know for sure that this is a wrong argument, here’s what I have to say to those people: if other natural imprints can present the same kind of 3-D information than what we found in the Shroud image, then why this body imprint could not have been caused by a natural interaction between a crucified body and the surface of the cloth, as defended over the years by, among others, Vignon, Barbet, Legrand, Father Rinaldi, Baima Bollone, Pellicori, De Salvo, Mills, Rogers and recently by two Italian scientists named Fazio and Mandaglio (who conclude that the Shroud image is most probably the product of a low-temperature chemical process like Maillard reactions and/or thermal radiation released after death by a corpse)? Using Occam’s razor, wouldn’t it be the most simple and rational explanation for the image on the Shroud?  After all, this image is really showing a dead body in rigor mortis and not a glorious body… \nSo Dan (or anyone else who will read this), if you can find a numeric copy of the presentation done in 1982 by Prof. Imbalzano (in English of course!), that would be great to share it with us on this blog! In fact, that would change from all the supernatural craziness that has completely polluted the pro-Shroud world in recent years and, therefore, gives a bit of fresh air to this parallel world that desperately need it. And here’s another interesting note to conclude: In one of their recent paper about the Shroud, Fazio and Mandaglio have destroyed the wrong argument often used by those who think the Shroud image have been caused by the Resurrection of Christ, i.e. that the non-homogeneous distribution of colored fibers in the image area (where we can often see a non-colored fiber being immediately adjacent to a colored fiber) cannot, in any way, be due to a natural phenomenon. Effectively, not only we now know that the Shroud image is not the only imprint in the world that possess 3-D information, we also know (thanks to Fazio and Mandaglio, among others) that a very mild phenomenon like a low-temperature chemical process and/or thermal radiation released after death by a corpse can cause an uneven (also called non-homogeneous or stochastic) distribution of colored fibers in one single thread of a linen cloth. When we take seriously into account all these FACTS, we are forced to conclude that a possible complex and mild natural process (still undetermined yet) must rank very high among the most probable explanations regarding the presence of a body image on the Shroud. And if this hypothesis is correct, such a natural process could not have come from anything else than the very close proximity of a dead and tortured corpse with an ancient linen shroud for less than 72 hours (i.e. before the release of the first liquids of putrefaction by the corpse).\n\n","date":"April 1, 2013 at 4:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/01/an-easter-meditation-on-the-shroud-as-a-sign/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-29020","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Easter Meditation on the Shroud as a Sign","post":"Archeologist Shimon Gibson with his colleagues found the tomb discovery in Jerusalem 2009.
