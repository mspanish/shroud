[{"title":"Emanuela Marinelli to receive the International Prize for Catholic Culture","post":"In 2012 Ugo Amaldi, a well known\nphysicist, received this Prize …\nNow 25 years have already elapsed since\nprof. Diana (Istituto Centrale del Restauro, Roma)\nand prof. Marinelli enunciated the idea to date\nthe Shroud of Turin using the parameter “cellulosic DP” …\nBut their system planned to use the viscosimetric\nway that consumes a fair amount of material of\nthe ancient cloth (= a way of destructive analysis!).\nAnd even during the Symposium of Nice in 1997,\nwhile also indicating other interesting parameters,\nthey still, reaffirmed this “old idea” (which is\nimpossible to apply in the case of the Shroud).\nInstead, in Turin (in 1998)\nI have shown the way of analyses SPMs\n(AFM and SNOM CFM) …\nIn 1998 at University of Pisa, it was made\nan AFM measurement  as force modulation mode,\nwhich allows to derive the dynamic mechanical\nproperties of the sample, but…\nI never published the rough result\nobtained in 1998…\n= little maps [= 4.75\nmicrons of wide] about:\nTopography, Elasticity, Viscosity\n(achieved through a calibration/comparison\nwith Silicon)… because…\nI hoped to improve the level of AFM\ninvestigations (until to reach a new kind of\nsurvey for molecular chains of cellulose.\nSee also what was previously obtained by Andy Baker\nin 1997 [working on cellulose crystals]).\nThen, see also:\nall my remarks about AFM nanoindentation,\n“AFM three-point bending test”, etc., etc.\nand then the last hope to contact a Lab to obtain\nAFM-Raman and SERS controls, etc.\n— — —\nHere an old bibliographic reference:\n“Imaging viscoelasticity by force modulation\nwith the atomic force microscope”\nM. Radmacher, R. W. Tillmann, and H. E. Gaub\nBiophys J. 1993 Mar; 64(3): 735–742. \nSee for example, the beginning of the\ninherent abstract:\n>Force modulation and phase sensitive detection\nwas used to image soft surfaces with the atomic\nforce microscope.\n>This force modulation microscopy allows\nthe simultaneous recording of images of the\nsurface profile, the storage modulus, and\nthe loss modulus of the sample. …\n— —\nIn any case (taking aside the unsolved\nscientific problems… sketched above in a\nrough manner) …\nI think Prof. Marinelli is a valid personage\nin the world of the Shroud. For example:\nthanks to the website “Collegamento pro Sindone”\nwe had the opportunity to read many interesting\nstudies and in the past the book she wrote\nwith another italian person (Orazio Petrosillo,\na journalist now deceased) was a\nfundamental step for an useful information\nagainst the false propaganda after the\n“C14 1988 results”…\n\n","date":"October 19, 2015 at 10:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/19/emanuela-marinelli-to-receive-the-international-prize-for-catholic-culture/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-212991","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Emanuela Marinelli to receive the International Prize for Catholic Culture","post":"I think there is also an interesting fact\nto take into account:\nthe Construction of the Teachers’ House\nthis building grows thanks to the\ncontributions collected by the initiative\nof Emanuela Marinelli and Observo Onlus…\nLinks:\nhttp://www.observo-onlus.org/v2/en/kwauso-school/\nhttp://www.kwausoschool.org/p/knowing.html\nhttp://www.kwausoschool.org/p/support-us.html\n\n","date":"October 19, 2015 at 10:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/19/emanuela-marinelli-to-receive-the-international-prize-for-catholic-culture/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-212992","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"}]
