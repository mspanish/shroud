Pope Saint Celestine V, a Benedictine hermit, a compromise pontiff from outside the conclave whom at the age of 80 years, the cardinals persuaded to accept election in 1294, after they were dead-locked for over two years with the seat still vacant.  Totally unsuited to the ordeals of the office, he abdicated after only 5 months, the first pope to do so, and to avoid any schism arising under his name he was confined to a monk’s cell.  Pontificate July 5 to Dec 13, 1294; d. May 19, 1296, canonized May 5, 1313.  \nCelestine had nothing at all to do with the suppression of the Templar order,  Phillip the Fair implemented his campaign against the order beginning on 13 October 1307, when seneschals throughout France first opened their orders to arrest every templar they could find.   \nThere is no more fact in any of the other statements given  in these postings than there is in that concerning Pope Celestine.\n\n","date":"May 12, 2015 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/12/a-touch-of-the-ludicrous-for-a-tuesday-morning/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-198918","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Touch of the Ludicrous for a Tuesday Morning","post":"Immediately, one can see a different mustache, duh….\n\n","date":"May 13, 2015 at 4:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/12/a-touch-of-the-ludicrous-for-a-tuesday-morning/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-199001","author":"Nabber","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Touch of the Ludicrous for a Tuesday Morning","post":"\n\nHmmm…\n\n","date":"May 13, 2015 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/12/a-touch-of-the-ludicrous-for-a-tuesday-morning/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-199007","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Touch of the Ludicrous for a Tuesday Morning","post":"Mustache definitely not full, unlike Shroud image.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2015 at 5:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/12/a-touch-of-the-ludicrous-for-a-tuesday-morning/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-199086","author":"Nabber","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Touch of the Ludicrous for a Tuesday Morning","post":"Based on Pray Codex.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2015 at 6:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/12/a-touch-of-the-ludicrous-for-a-tuesday-morning/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-199090","author":"PHPL","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Touch of the Ludicrous for a Tuesday Morning","post":"You are truly confused…\n\n","date":"May 15, 2015 at 2:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/12/a-touch-of-the-ludicrous-for-a-tuesday-morning/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-199148","author":"Nabber","site":"shroudstory"}]
