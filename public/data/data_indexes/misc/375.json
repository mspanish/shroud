[{"title":"Publishing Shroud of Turin Papers on Academia.edu","post":"ResearchGate (researchgate.net) is another prominent social network for scientists (5 million researchers). It is used by more professional researchers than academia.edu (see http://goo.gl/sGoJCq) because anybody can sign up at academia.edu which is not the case for ReasearchGate. Many papers about the Shroud can be found at ResearchGate and you can see more information about their authors than academia.edu. It is quite different compared to academia.edu as ResearchGate can keep track of many parameters among them which papers are citing your papers, even the ones you are not allowed to upload due to copyright. If you are looking for papers at ResearchGate, it is probably faster to use Google and add the word “researchgate” as a keyword in your search.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2014 at 1:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/26/publishing-shroud-of-turin-papers-on-academia-edu/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-165684","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"}]
