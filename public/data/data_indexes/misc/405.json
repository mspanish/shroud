[{"title":"Replica of Our Lady of Guadalupe Enthroned in Turin","post":"Too often, mankind thinks far too much of him or herself, believing that “science” is the way to all knowledge. How foolish are we, for some considered to be “so knowledgeable”, yet fail to recognize the existence of the true “Author of creation, our universe, very existence, and salvation”? Kudos to you Dr. Porter, for coming to realize and publicly admit, that you don’t know what you don’t know and can’t explain using science. In doing so, you are opening yourself up to Faith and the explanation, for things that cannot be explained, by mere mankind. God is surely stirring in heart heart, as well as your mind, and soul. Here’s to hoping that others eyes are opened to the TRUTH, even if they don’t yet see it with their very eyes, or feel with their spirit, to the core of their very beings. God Bless.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2011 at 3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/12/14/replica-of-our-lady-of-guadalupe-enthroned-in-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-5514","author":"John","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Replica of Our Lady of Guadalupe Enthroned in Turin","post":"Too often, mankind thinks far too much of him or herself, believing that “science” is the way to all knowledge.

Here’s to hoping that others eyes are opened to the TRUTH, even if they don’t yet see it with their very eyes, or feel with their spirit, to the core of their very beings. Even the hardest of hearts can soften and be changed, if they only open themselves up to the possibilities that they for too long have been denying. Often giving in to what really is, often fills the void that we often times struggle with, no matter how “advanced” our scientific methods or manners/devices of inquiry may be. God Bless.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2011 at 3:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/12/14/replica-of-our-lady-of-guadalupe-enthroned-in-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-5515","author":"John","site":"shroudstory"}]
