[{"title":"A Meditation for All Saints Day","post":"Oh wow, and THIS man is a PASTOR?? He is definitely hanging out with the wrong crowd! Sounds as if his associates aren’t any better than the Atheists. \n“And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.”  Hebrews 11:6\nIf you believe in God, you must also believe in the Afterlife and the Rewards that come with it.  If we believe in a SPIRITUAL EXISTANCE, which is where God lives, then we also believe that we ARE and WILL BE there with God some day.  We’re much more a part of that existance even now than we fully realize. We’re right in the middle of it. It surrounds us.\nThe problem with the Math brain types is they can only see the what their eyeballs see. But there are plenty, PLENTY of other personality types who are not so concrete and are able to perceive more without even trying.  I feel really sorry for the Math brains. And I do think they could do a MUCH better job of being intuitive if they wanted to. \nI really wonder why this guy went into the ministry. This is appalling. Absolutely appalling.  I’ve heard that the seminaries are full of people who don’t believe in God, and I think that’s true but why in the world are they teaching in SEMINARIES then??  Seems as if they are the very tool of the devil himself. \nAnd if you look at it THAT way: there is more “proof” for you. Of course the devil wants to put evil seed in the very seat of theological education: what a brilliant move on the part of the vile serpent who is the Enemy of God. \nCOURAGE??  It takes COURAGE to believe in the afterlife??? This Reverend really needs to apologize to God, IMO.   And he should start looking for men of Faith to be his friends. There are plenty of them: good, solid men of God really do exist. Dr David Jeremiah of In Touch Ministries is one of the best teacher/scholars of this generation. He is on tv every week and his website has daily audio broadcasts. Dr. Jeremiah is as solid as they come.\n\n","date":"November 2, 2011 at 3:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/01/a-meditation-for-all-saints-day/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-4511","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"}]
