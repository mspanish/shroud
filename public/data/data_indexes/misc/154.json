[{"title":"Face from the Shroud of Turin and the Manoppello","post":"In my mind, the face from the Manoppello vail and the face from the shroud are quite different.  For exemple, we can see major differences in the beard.  This Manoppello vail look more like an artwork to me.  Artwork based on the shroud ?  It’s really possible !\nOn the contrary, the face from the shroud have a very realistic touch.  Doesn’t look like any artwork we know.  \nAfter saying that, I still hope that more serious researches (done by honest scientists please !) will be done on the Manoppello vail because who knows ?  Maybe, some surprises could came out of it !!!  In the relic world, we never know.\n\n","date":"May 9, 2011 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/09/face-from-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-manoppello/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3096","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
