That necessity reigns supreme, without exception, in nature.”  Mr. Linker, a female shark not too long ago underwent parthenogenesis, and had never been in the same tank as a male shark — marking the highest-order form of life to ever have this happen.  There’s one exception for you.

The birth of modern science occurred in Christian Europe, after centuries of conditioning people to believe that the world was created and sustained by a rational, all-powerful God, who may occasionally intervene in His creation, but never capriciously.  And we were conditioned to believe that we were created in the image of this God, enabling us to understand and explore His creation.  It was this match between a rational God and our sharing in His rationality that provided the groundwork for science.  As Kepler put it, he was merely “thinking God’s thoughts after Him.”\n\n","date":"December 23, 2014 at 10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/22/a-miracle-debate/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-178691","author":"Julian Stroh","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Miracle Debate","post":"That’s right.\n\n","date":"December 23, 2014 at 6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/22/a-miracle-debate/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-178756","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
