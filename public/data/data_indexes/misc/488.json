Antoninus in the 6th century reports seeing a titulus in Jerusalem (see below). Wiki states that sometime before 1145 the present relic was placed in a box which has the seal of a cardinal who became Pope in 1144 (which would seem to be Pope Lucius II). So it seems that the present artifact dates at least from this time. I would think that Helena was well enough endowed with crucifixion relics, to have insufficent motive to arrange a forgery of any other. I should also think that both Helena and Lucius would be suffiently versed in Greek and Latin, not to reverse the lettering. Thiede argues that the lettering may have been done by a Jewish scribe (hence the reversed lettering) and the order of Hebrew, Greek and Latin, matches what is historically plausible, whereas a forger would have adhered to what is in the NT canon [John = Hebrew, Latin, Greek]. Joe Nickell is known to dismiss this argument as second-guessing, as forgers commonly do the unexpected. I’m not sure why you argue that the 1st century scripts were unknown in 1000 AD. If the original had badly deteriorated during the first millenium, then Lucius or someone else may have thought to create a replica from what then remained. \nThe report of Antoninus differs from the present text. ‘The 6th century pilgrim Antoninus from Piacenza describes a Titulus in Jerusalem and its inscription: it said “Hic est rex Iudeaorum” (Here is the king of the Jews), while the one kept in Rome shows “Iesus Nazarenvs Rex Iudeaorum” (Jesus the Nazarene king of the Jews)’. Either Antoninus is relying on a faulty memory when he writes this, or it is some other titulus.  \nThe carobon dating was apparently reported in the peer-reviewed journal “Radiocarbon” – Francesco Bella; Carlo Azzi (2002). “14C Dating of the Titulus Crucis”.

One said that only one letter could be identified with some certainty, another, an expert in Greek, rejected any identification with the Markan gospel. At present the majority of scholars hold these kind of views.\nThere are also other questions that are raised in this issue: the Essenes in Qumran were extreme separatists, far away from “mainstream” Judaism, and the Christian conception of God was different. Why would they hide Christian documents? Did Jesus refer to the Essenes as “Herodians”, as Yadin believed? Well, they were not obliged to make an oath of loyalty to Herod, and the “War Scroll”, written in Herodian script, shows dependence on a Roman military manual. On the other hand did Jesus refer to the Essenes when he spoke about eunuchs? It is possible, but no one can say with certainty.       \nFrom my point of view, the primitive Christian community was intent on action, and texts were secondary. They were not distributing material like what the Jehovah’s Witnesses or members of “Jews for Jesus” do today. They were preaching, living in closely-knit communities bound by love, sharing possessions. These actions spoke louder than texts, which only appear to have become necessary when the Jesus movement began to spread beyond Palestine.\n\n","date":"September 20, 2013 at 1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44870","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)","post":"It is not even certain that Qumran documents should even be linked to the Essens, or at least maybe not all. It is possible that several groups were hiding their documents in caves, and those could be plundered well before 1947. Another possibility is that the Essens studied Christian literature, from curiosity or for polemical purposes for example. And also relations between Christians and Essens are completely unknown, some scholars claim the hostility, others sympathy, some (but this is fringe theory) think that the Essens created Christianity, while others (even Christian apologists) think that some of the Jesus’ disciples actualy came from Essen society, or joined Christians later. Theories, no proof for any of them.\nAbout what the majority of the sholars hold: these are only opinions and guesses. No solid facts. Most of them believe that Gospels cannot date back before 70 AD. There is still a widespread (and completely unjustified) myth that all of the Apostles were illiterate, or that first Christians were too primitive/didn’t have need to write their memories. And of course ‘oral tradition’. Yes it was important, but it absolutely doesn’t mean that the Gospels couldn’t be written quite early, within the first 20-30 years.\nAnother myth is that early Christians could be nothing more than local Palestine sect with maybe a few hundred believers.

They end in 62 AD in Rome, and don’t mention death of Paul, which occurred in 64 or 67 AD. So they can be very easily dated to 62-63 AD (had they not been part of the Bible no scholar would ever doubt this dating). Because Acts were preceded by Gospel of Luke, written rather short period before, the Luke can be dated to around 60 AD. The final (Greek) version of Matthew can be dated to about the same time, because most of the critics consider Luke and Matthew being written parallely. Now Mark. As it seems that both Luke and Matthew depend on Mark, it must be earlier, perhaps around 50 AD. Now finally John. He knows earlier Gospels, and mentions Peter death, but doesn’t mention destruction of the Jerusalem. So he wrote his Gospel perhaps around 70 AD, but the date could as well be later.\nNow how those dates had been screwed by the modern critics. First response to what you wrote about Papias: “reading from Papias that Mark was Peter’s amanuensis and wrote as he remembered, then if Papias can be relied on, it might be inferred that Mark wrote after 65AD”. Papias NEVER claimed that Mark wrote after Peter’s death.\nNext: destruction of the Temple. You wrote: “However some exegetes read into Mark 13 that the temple is still standing, whereas in Matthew and Luke this is no longer the case.”\nThis is the main argument of those who claim that the Gospels cannot be dated  before 70 AD. However it is based on COMPLETELY FALSE presumption, and has a hidden statement of non-believe in Jesus’ meesianic claims.\nThe very ambiguous prophecy of destruction of the Temple is in Mark 13, Matthew 21, and Luke 21. According to the critics, it was put in the Jesus’ mouth to make him a prophet. Thus they suggest, that Jesus COULDN’T be a prohpet, and couldn’t predict it. But if you are a  Christian and believe that Jesus WAS a Prophet and Messiah, this is obviously PURE ABSURD. Nonsense. And even if Jesus hadn’t been a prophet such prophecy claimed by him would have been nothing impossible. There are plenty of “prophets” today who herald the end of our civilization, the same was in Palestine of the 1st century, when apocalyptic and messianic expectations were very common (just to mention Essens). Many Jews considerd Temple as corrupt. The Temple was once destroyed, by Babyloninas in 586 BC, so why couldn’t this happen again. In political situation in Palestine, when uprising against the Romans could start every moment, the eventual destruction of the Temple was very easy to predict. And one final note: THERE IS NO PLACE IN THE GOSPELS WHICH CLAIM THAT THE PROpHECY HAD FULFILLED.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2013 at 5:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44941","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)","post":"Sorry, O.K., I don’t buy it, arguments too flimsy, too much wishful thinking.\n1) I can agree that there would have been oral traditions circulating at a very early time after the crucifixion.  I would agree that these would most likely arrive at a standard fixed form.  Peoples of this era and even indigenous people today had and have specialists with remarkable recall of oral transmission. I see it here in NZ with both Samoan and Maori who can recite very long genealogies entirely from memory handed down from their forbears. It’s also evident in their knowledge of astronomy for navigation. [Recall Alex Haley’s “Roots” and his encounters with African peoples] These oral traditions (particularly Matthew’s) would have been recited as part of liturgies.  The Parousia was soon expected and there would be little point in setting them down in writing until it became apparent that eye-witnesses were dying out, and the Parousia was not as immediate as they had imagined. I could agree that there may well have been a few written sources which were available for the evangelists to draw on. \n2) The argument from Luke’s Acts, I believe will not stand up. There is too much discrepancy between Paul’s own teachings in his epistles and Luke’s interpretation, for Acts to be contemporaneous with Paul. There is no need for Acts to record the death of Paul, and this is a flimsy argument to assert that Acts predates it. \n3) If Papias has Mark as Peter’s amenuensis, why does he then say that Mark wrote as he remembered, but not in the right order, as if Peter was not then available to correct any errors that Papias believed Mark had got incorrect? And clearly Matthw and Luke both draw on Mark’s final gospel (95% of mark in Matthew). \n4) Concerning the prophecy of the temple’s destruction, one could brutally say that these are words that Matthew and Luke put into Jesus’ mouth, after the event. It is not included in Mark 13, in the discourse on the end-time. However, with the political situation in Jerusalem from about 65AD, any astute observer would likely have had little diificulty in foreseeing the destruction of the temple together with the associated Roman suppression. \n5) I see the final redactors of the gospels, particlarly Matthew and Luke, not so much as original authors, but more as editors each with a specific purpose, who assembled a mix of oral traditions and written material, set their own particular viewpoint upon this material, before the gospels attained their final form.

Several additional informations can be possibly found in the early Church Fathers Writings, as well as some Apocrypha. The unwritten Tradition is still important part of Catholic and  Orthodox Christians. But this absolutely doesn’t exclude the possibility that Gospels were written before 70 AD.\n“The Parousia was soon expected and there would be little point in setting them down in writing until it became apparent that eye-witnesses were dying out, and the Parousia was not as immediate as they had imagined.”\nThis is another myth. Based on what -on some remarks in the Paul’s letters (who wrote himself that the date of Parousia is uncertain) and on THE GOSPELS! Which, according to this version, shouldn’t be written because early Christians didn’t need them. Besides it is not certain that all early Christians would expect Parousia within their lifetime. Remember, the prophecies of Jesus were quite ambiguous, as all the prophecies have to be. Most commentators see the words of Jesus “Verily I say unto you, there are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” (Matthew 16:28) to the Transfiguration of Jesus. Read Benedict XVI “The Jesus of Nazareth” for example.\n2).”The argument from Luke’s Acts, I believe will not stand up. There is too much discrepancy between Paul’s own teachings in his epistles and Luke’s interpretation, for Acts to be contemporaneous with Paul.” \nThis is another nonsense. Remember, what we write about ourselves usually differs from that what others write about us.\n“There is no need for Acts to record the death of Paul, and this is a flimsy argument to assert that Acts predates it.” \nAt the end of Acts, Paul is alive and well. Why? Why does Luke not mention at all his ultimate fate? There is no piece of evidence that he wanted to write the third volume, after Gospel and Acts, as some claim.\n3).”If Papias has Mark as Peter’s amenuensis, why does he then say that Mark wrote as he remembered, but not in the right order, as if Peter was not then available to correct any errors that Papias believed Mark had got incorrect?” \nThe chronological order is not important. Can you find A SINGLE hitorical or biographical book which maintains it through the whole text.\nAnd according to Christian tradition, Mark was later Bishop of Alexandria and died circa 68. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Mark Some commentators place the Peter’s first visit to Rome around 45-50 AD.\n4). As I said the argument from destruction of the Temple is simply absurd.\n5).”I see the final redactors of the gospels, particlarly Matthew and Luke, not so much as original authors, but more as editors each with a specific purpose, who assembled a mix of oral traditions and written material, set their own particular viewpoint upon this material”\nAnd that’s right, because they certainly used some earlier material. Most probably, Matthew took some notes during the Jesus lifetime (Papias mentiones that), which formed the basis of later Gospels. Some traits of it perhaps can be found in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas (with several gnosticisms added later). Remember, Jeremiah had a secretary, Baruch. So why Matthew couldn’t be Jesus’ secretary? The Thiede writes about that in his “Jesus Papyrus”. Of course the modern criticism created another absurd viewpoint that Matthew was illiterate. \nThen later Mark wrote his Gospel, basing on Peter and Matthew’s notes. This served as a basis for Matthew to write a final form of his Gospel, and for the Luke. Remember, there was no copyright in the 1st century.\n“before the gospels attained their final form.” \nThe textual variations in Gospels are very minor. This, and internal logic of the text suggest that they were written in a form very close to today’s relatively quickly. Their slow evolution is another myth of critics. Who -it should be underlined -are not interested in searching for “the truth”, but rather in practicing negationism.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2013 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44958","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)","post":"Sorry O.K: Too much conspiracy theory sbout biblical critics – their theories not all that modern, been known for most of 20th century and accepted by Catholic scholars, too much subjectivism; argument from destruction of temple not absurd but accepted by Catholic scholars.

Once, I was thinking the same way you do. But good texts of several apologists like Carsten Peter Thiede, Peter Seewald (who recently wrote very interesting biography of Jesus, recommended by Benedict XVI), and some Italian apologists like Antonio Socci (a little bit sensationalist but nevertheless very interesting), Andrea Tornielli, McDowell and others (like Jan Lewandowski, my friend from Apologetyka.info forum) opened my eyes.\n“argument from destruction of temple not absurd but accepted by Catholic scholars” -yes but it doesn’t mean anything. It was accepted after Vaticanum II, when there was too much tendency to be “modern” and “progressive”. The Catholic scholarship before 1960s usually accepted dating before 70 AD based on the end of the Acts,just as I presented. Check Daniel Rops for example.\nThe more I delve in the  topic, the more convinced I am that the biblical critics live in completely different world than normal people. I know it is hard to accept this now, just like it is initially hard for most people to accept that the Shroud is genuine, for example. It is not a mystery that biblical critics invent their theories not to seek the truth, but to destroy the credibility of Christianity. And later present those theories as “scientific” and “absolute” truth. And several other scholars, even the Catholic ones, fall into this trap, because they are afraid of being “non-scientific”. This is herd instinct. \nThe attitude of Biblical critics is typical, because being anti-Christian is popular since the time of Enlightment circa 1700. Even Barrie Schwortz, a Jew, noticed that. You now how absurd theories of Nickell, Garlaschelli, Schafersmann and others about the Shroud are presented in popular media. The same is true about Biblical Scholars. The same was true about several myths about “bloody” Inquisition, alleged medieval belief in flat-earth, and so on.\nHave you ever engaged in polemics with militant atheists? I did and I know the dirty tricks they use.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2013 at 9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44964","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)","post":"OK, 100% agreed!\n\n","date":"September 21, 2013 at 12:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44986","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)","post":"O.K.
