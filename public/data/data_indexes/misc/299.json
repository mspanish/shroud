I appreciate the comment you just made about the dirt found on the Shroud.  Nice comment my friend !  I always said that when you want to study the Shroud seriously, look carefully at the little details !  And this aragonite dirt is an important one !!!  I don’t think people talk enough about this detail when it comes to judge if the Shroud is genuine of not.  I wonder what Joe Nickell and other skeptics would have to say about that !!!  Until this day, I’ve never seen a real scientific argument that could contradict this finding…  I think this aragonite dirt is much more important than all the flower image someone can claim to see on the Shroud to “prove” the cloth is genuine !!! ;-)\n\n","date":"September 18, 2011 at 6:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/18/more-still-on-the-dirt-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3941","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
