[{"title":"Not Like a Mummy? A Frequent Question","post":"I am presently reading the new book written by Benedict 16 entitled “Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection”.  You can find it here : http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Nazareth-Entrance-Jerusalem-Resurrection/dp/1586175009/ref=pd_sim_b_1\nGood book to know what’s the pope’s vision of Jesus.  And I can see that his vision is not so far from mine…  In the part where he talk about the entombment, there’s an interesting statement about the Shroud of Turin.  The pope first state that the problem of compatibility between the Shroud of Turin, the “linen cloths” mention in the gospel of John and the “shroud” mention in the Synoptic gospels cannot be discuss in the context of his book.  But the pope add this interesting remark that says a lot in my mind (for someone who can read between the lines) :  “In any case, the aspect of this relic (the Shroud of Turin) is, in principle, reconcilable with the two reports (the one from the gospel of John and the one from the Synoptic gospels).\nFor the mommy way of burial, it’s not a jewish manner at all.  I think any good historian can corroborate this fact.
