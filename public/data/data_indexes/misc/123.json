[{"title":"December’s Flippancy Award: What Would Jesus Do?","post":"Dan,\nThe article is a hoot but the reference to the Shroud and Jesus underlines an important  fact of contemporary life/existence. He is coming back. If I may change metaphors in mid-stream, the Shroud is Christ’s magic carpet which he is riding back into our consciousness. I can envision a magic carpet more readily than a bike as shroud. It’s carpet magically woven by science.\nI said “coming back.” Now I personally don’t recommend rushing down to to Jones Beach or any other handy open space to await the Rapture. Allegories and metaphors are representations of the truth and not always intrinsically true in themselves. That’s why among fundamentalists there are “pre-millenialists” and “post-millenialists.” But the decades of scientific study of the Shroud are beginning to register. He is returning to or consciousness in ways previously unimagined. Perhaps prophesied?\nIn Heller’s book, he wrote that after he came into possession of a fiber, he wanted to examine it as closely as possible for blood so he put on his white lab coat and went to his lab where the best equipment  was.\nHow about this from Revelations:\n“These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They\nhave washed their robes and made them white in the blood\nof the Lamb.” Revelations 7:14\nAre scientists in their white lab coats bringing Christ to us?\nOn the other hand there is Joe Nickell, a man with no scientific credentials per se seeking to debunk the Shroud who loves to pose in a “white lab coat.”\n“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” Matthew 7:15-20\nCan a lab coat also be “sheep’s clothing.\nThat may apply to the carbon labs also. There are many articles on the errors of the carbon dating process, but if you want to see one article that covers the waterfront, I would recommend: Emanuela Marinelli, “The setting for the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud” Valencia Conference 2012, https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf\nSometimes it’s tough sorting out the sheep from the ravenous wolves. Perhaps, it’s the most important challenge of these times.\n\n","date":"December 22, 2013 at 8:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/decembers-flippancy-award-what-would-jesus-do/","cat":"humor","id":"comment-64962","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
