AND I PERSONALLY KNOW THAT, AMONG THEM, THERE’S A LOT OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN SHROUD RESEARCH AND MANY OF THEM ARE MEMBERS OF THE SHROUD SCIENCE GROUP !!!  So, when I heard people saying that blogs are just a lot of bullsh** written by a bunch of fools, I disagree ! ;-)\n\n","date":"December 31, 2011 at 7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/31/growth-of-this-shroud-of-turin-blog/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6385","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Growth of this Shroud of Turin Blog","post":"Yannick is right. But there are other factors as well. The Real Face of Jesus drove searches that brought people to the blog. Facebook, inexplicably, became a major source of inbound links starting in early 2011. In early 2011 I had a hip replacement and was mostly housebound for several weeks and I decided to blog with the time I had on my hands.\nThe trend is strong and there is no evidence of a downturn of three months of more. Here is hoping . . .\nDan\n\n","date":"January 1, 2012 at 5:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/31/growth-of-this-shroud-of-turin-blog/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6407","author":"episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Growth of this Shroud of Turin Blog","post":"I’ll bet there will be another huge spike approaching Easter lol. Not hard to predict I would dare to say. I wait in anticipation for another ‘BIG’ story to break in the media just about then and possibly from the Shroud opponents end, this time.\nR\n\n","date":"January 1, 2012 at 2:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/31/growth-of-this-shroud-of-turin-blog/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6422","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Growth of this Shroud of Turin Blog","post":"YOU BET MY FRIEND !
