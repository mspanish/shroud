[{"title":"David Barash on the Hardest Problem in Science","post":"As the great Neo-Darwinist geneticist, J.B.S. Haldane (1892–1964), realised, that “if my mind is a mere by-product of matter” then “I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true”:\n“It seems to me immensely unlikely that mind is a mere by-product of matter. For if my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true. They may be sound chemically, but that does not make them sound logically. And hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms. In order to escape from this necessity of sawing away the branch on which I am sitting, so to speak, I am compelled to believe that mind is not wholly conditioned by matter.” (Haldane, J.B.S., “When I Am Dead,” in “Possible Worlds: And Other Essays,” [1927], Chatto and Windus: London, 1932, reprint, p.209).\nAnd one of those beliefs is “that mind arises from nothing more nor less than the actions of the [material] brain.” In other words, as C.S. Lewis pointed out many years ago (e.g. in his 1947 book Miracles), Materialist statements like, “mind arises from nothing more nor less than the actions of the [material] brain” is self-refuting. \nWhile I appreciate Prof. Barash’s candour (and nothing I write here should be construed as a personal attack on him or his ilk), nevertheless, Materialists have for decades (if not centuries) been making promises like, “I am also nearly as confident that some day, we’ll understand how.” It even has a name, “Promissory Materialism“!\nStephen E.
