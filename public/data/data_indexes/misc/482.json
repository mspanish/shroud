There are some very good articles on religious topics — because they are largely left alone by the so-called ‘skeptics.’  But the Shroud matters — for all the obvious reasons.  Don’t get me wrong — I think this is a fight worth having, and there’s no more public venue for it than Wikipedia.  Just be prepared to match them, either with vigilance bordering on obsessive-compulsive disorder or with numbers and discipline; you’ll need a group of people dedicated to watching and influencing the article.\nInitially, they will respond within Wikipedia — by using the system to their advantage.  If you persist, they’ll use social media channels like Twitter and Reddit to rally atheists to the fight.  So, the key is to out-think and above all out-reference them.  I would suggest focused, defensible edits.  Discredit the work of McCrone and Nickell, for example.  Wherever possible, reference only peer-reviewed studies in major journals (the atheist gospels).  Don’t, for example, cite the Górny and Rosikoń book (nothing against it; my pre-ordered copy is on my desk as I type this); instead, cite the actual studies or research on which they relied.\nStep one is to prepare by learning how Wikipedia works.  YouTube is a good source for this.  For example, here’s a two-part video on how to add citations in Wikipedia articles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2HFdEtYDyc and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_a9fBc13b4\nUltimately, this is winnable because the weight of research, facts, etc. are on the side of (at the very least) the Shroud being completely unique and utterly inexplicable.  Just understand what you’d be getting yourselves into.  I think it’s important, though, precisely because Wikipedia represents the zeitgeist of the Internet (sort of a meta-zeitgeist, I guess).  A truly balanced, NPOV article here will make a lot of people think about the Shroud, the evidence, and what it all means.  But then, in the interests of full disclosure: I pick fights with atheists on Twitter for fun. So, my objectivity is clearly suspect when the subject is ‘pointless arguments on the Internet.’\n\n","date":"December 2, 2013 at 11:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/02/the-anti-shroudrelicscatholicchristian-propaganda-on-wikipediaguest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-55049","author":"Jeffrey Liss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The anti-Shroud/Relics/Catholic/Christian propaganda on Wikipedia–Guest Posting by O. K.","post":"As a follow up to my comment, I have been testing the waters on the Wikipedia page by trying to correct a single word in the introduction.  After being reverted a few times, I added the following to the Talk page:\nThe final sentence of the introduction identifies the TS as ‘one of the most studied and controversial artifacts in human history.’ My attempt to correct this sentence has been repeatedly reverted. There are two reasons the correction is needed. First, use of the term ‘artifact’ is not NPOV, as the article goes on to state the image — the thing that makes it controversial — was formed by unknown means and is the subject of debate.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘artifact’ as: An object made or modified by human workmanship, as opposed to one formed by natural processes.\nMerriam-Webster is even more definitive:\n1.a : something created by humans usually for a practical purpose; especially : an object remaining from a particular period\n1.b : something characteristic of or resulting from a particular human institution, period, trend, or individual\n2 : a product of artificial character (as in a scientific test) due usually to extraneous (as human) agency\nThis exludes a) natural processes and b) acheiropoieta. Thus, the use of ‘artifact’ represents editorial opinion. This would seem to be confirmed by the revision comment: artifact is correct (this shroud was made by someone), don’t change words in quotations.\nThe words are not part of a quotation; if they are, they are quoted inaccurately. The reference included for this sentence states: According to LLoyd A. Currie, it is “widely accepted” that “the Shroud of Turin is the single, most studied object in human history” in Lloyd A. Currie, “The Remarkable Metrological History of Radiocarbon Dating Journal of the National Institute of Standards and Technology 109, 2004, p. 200.\nCurrie says ‘object,’ not ‘artifact.’\n\n","date":"December 3, 2013 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/02/the-anti-shroudrelicscatholicchristian-propaganda-on-wikipediaguest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-55857","author":"Jeffrey Liss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The anti-Shroud/Relics/Catholic/Christian propaganda on Wikipedia–Guest Posting by O. K.","post":"There is some anti-Christian bias depending on who writes in Wikipedia.
