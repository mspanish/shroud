[{"title":"I say let all of us help David help us all","post":"I’ll be honest. I’d be more likely to drop something in the hat if it was going to a research fund with the product being new scientific data on the Shroud. I’m not that interested in funding a fictional film about the Shroud with the hope it may spur the Vatican and others to proceed with the scientific project. There have been umpteen works of fiction about the Shroud, like the many cloning angles, and none of these have spurred any new science. I suspect many Shroudies have not contributed for this reason. As was stated, we all fell the going around in circles because there’s no new data to examine. We’re all craving new data — if I can fund that directly I’m all in.\n\n","date":"September 11, 2013 at 9:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/10/i-say-let-all-of-us-help-david-help-us-all/","cat":"crowdfunding","id":"comment-43764","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I say let all of us help David help us all","post":"I go exactly in the same direction as yours David.  Personally, I think the best thing that could happen to Shroud science is what I said the other day in another comment, which is to see the coming of a new association of scientists (like STURP or ASSIST but surely not like the SSG) that would clearly dissociate themselves from any supernatural hypothesis versus the Shroud as well as from any affiliation with any religious groups in order to be seen as completely independent of mind with no religious bias and no other motives than to find the truth about the Shroud, no matter what this truth could be.  The first thing such a real scientific team should do would be to build a solid test plan for a future round of direct research on the cloth.\nI think that this is the very best thing that could eventually influenced the Vatican to go ahead to allow a new series of direct tests on the cloth as well as giving permission to use the material collected during the 2002 restoration for research (that means that the test plan of this hypothetical team of unbiased scientists should include some researches on this material).\nMr. Rolfe wants to find a way to “force” the hand of the Vatican and I understand his feelings, but I truly don’t think a new movie about the Shroud (no matter how good it can be) will change anything to the present situation…  That’s my personal feeling and, of course, I can be wrong about that.\n\n","date":"September 11, 2013 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/10/i-say-let-all-of-us-help-david-help-us-all/","cat":"crowdfunding","id":"comment-43773","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I say let all of us help David help us all","post":"Additional comment:  If one day, the kind of scientific team I mentioned could become a reality, if those who will be at the head of such a team wants to remain credible and stay away from any association with some supernatural or religious things, they won’t have no other choice other than exclude from the team every present researcher who have already proposed or publicly support an image formation hypothesis involving some kind of supernatural release of energy from the dead body.

In fact, it’s not important at all. What count is the credibility of the scientific team I proposed. That’s why I think it’s imperative that such a team, if it could get formed one day, to exclude every possible researcher who have already proposed an image formation hypothesis involving some supernatural process link with the Resurrection of Christ, for the simple and good reason that such an hypothesis needs faith to be accepted. But having said that, I also think such a team, in order to stay independent of mind versus every possible explanation for the image formation, and also in order to be seen by the scientific community as truly unbiased, should also exclude every researcher who already have proposed another form of image formation (whether it be based on a natural formation involving an interaction between the corpse and the cloth or a formation involving some form of artistic technique).  In sum, such a team should be only composed of people who never have proposed or defended any image formation hypothesis that can exist.  That’s only with a team of this nature that there could be some chances that the Vatican allowed a new series of direct research on the relic and the scientific community could be willing to accept their eventual conclusions versus the Shroud.

He suggests an X-ray spectrographic analysis of three small areas. If titanium is found in quantity, he thinks his hypothesis is well founded. if not, not. This experiment is easy to do, and its results unequivocal (well more or less).\nHypothetical Scientist B thinks the shroud is a miracle. What experiment does he suggest?

A lot of times, scientists have a bad tendency to think they are the center of the Universe and that anyone who don’t have the same expertise they got have absolutely no right to criticise them or simply disagree with them, which is just simply false.  In fact, this is totally false because it’s a fact that there are scientists who are dishonest and/or who don’t have a good judgement, so they can well be more off-track than me or you.\nFinal note: I want to make things clear on the fact that I don’t think Mr. Kearse is dishonest at all.

Of course, since Mr. Rolfe is a movie maker, it’s normal that he want to use what he know the best, but I think he would have much more chances to achieve his goal by finding one real biochemist or one real physician interested by the Shroud but who have not proposed or publicly supported any image formation process until now and who is not a supernatural and/or a religious freak and try to convince him to design a first draft of what could be the next test plan for a future scientific team that could be allowed to do a new series of direct tests on the Shroud.  After this, such a draft should be presented at a future Shroud conference and, if it receive a nice welcome, then the next step should be to find other INDEPENDENT experts versus the Shroud who worked in other relevant scientific fields and ask them if they would be interested to join the team in order to refine the first draft of the test plan and eventually to propose it to the Turin authorities…  By doing this, I’m truly convinced that Mr. Rolfe would have more chances to see things starting to move the way he wants, much more than by making a new movie about the Shroud.

However I suspect John Cleese is no longer in the business. \nTurning to the serious business of setting up a new scientific study of the Shroud, one could not do better than researching the background history of the STURP project.  Some of this is outlined in Ian Wilson’s 2010 “The Shroud”, chapter 5 ‘Under the Microscope’.  A more comprehensive and detailed story on the setting up of STURP is set out in the drafts of John Klotz’s forthcoming work “Quantum Christ”, particularly his chapter 7, ‘Game Change: Science Goes Deep, 1960-1978’. His Chapter 8 describes the ‘120 Hours in Turin’.  \nThe STURP team was to a certain extent self-selecting, but it comprised a very broad mix of several disciplines, a mix of pro-authenicists, those who were initially indifferent, and to some extent those who were initially anti-authenticist.  It was able to exploit the opportunity of the 1978 exposition celebrating the 400th anniversary of the Shroud’s arrival in Turin.  It proved to be the most detailed scientific investigation into the properties of the cloth and its image that had then been carried out.  Even so, there were a number of aspects that were overlooked and missed, and not studied due to lack of time and preparation, unexpected, or possibly insufficient forethought. Each of course had his own discipline and specialty, and if a particular specialty was not included in the team, that aspect could not be given proper attention. \nAn important aspect that is sometimes overlooked in discussions, is the question of funding, and the ernergy and efforts taken by a few individuals to raise the necessary, some $US2.5 million as at 1978. \nI’m inclined to the view that the only way a new STURP project might be implemented is if a small team of determined, qualified and competent people can set about formulating a definite game plan to bring it about.  They would need to be of sufficient youth and energy to see the project through during their own likely life-times.  Shroud conferences might be useful forums to air such a project and could generate useful discussion and ideas, and possibly provide useful avenues for specialist recruitment. \nOne advantage STURP was able to exploit, was in being able to draw on contacts with close affiliation to Turin, particularly Father Rinaldi, who was able to ease the way for their work.  Italy is not USA, nor the UK, nor for that matter Poland nor Switzerland.  It has its own culture and way of doing things, and social contacts are important in being able to get things done.  \nWithout such a broad, concerted and determined approach by those comptent to do so, I fear nothing will otherwise happen.  But if it does happen, expect to be prepared for a very long road ahead to see it through before a conclusion can come into sight.\n\n","date":"September 13, 2013 at 5:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/10/i-say-let-all-of-us-help-david-help-us-all/","cat":"crowdfunding","id":"comment-44119","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"I say let all of us help David help us all","post":"Excellent background info, thanks Daveb.
