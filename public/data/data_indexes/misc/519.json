However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object – thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.[191]”\nAnd about Maillard reaction:\n“the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.[197]”\n197:  Fanti et alii, Microscopic and Macroscopic Characteristics of the Shroud of Turin Image Superficiality, Journal of Imaging Science and Technology—July/August 2010—Volume 54, Issue 4, p. 040201-6\nDiscussed here, no comment.\nIt looks like “Bouvard et Pécuchet” are writing this article, mixing apples and oranges without even noticing.\n\n","date":"July 28, 2014 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/28/the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-wikipedia-edit-wars/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-140862","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"}]
