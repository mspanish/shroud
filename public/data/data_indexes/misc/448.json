[{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"I guess they can’t get over the problem that John Calvin could be wrong, you know – if it’s not in scripture it can’t be true!  Never mind why it’s not in scripture. I wonder if he’d heard of disciplina arcani, probably the Catholics used it, but it never took with that lot.  If you’re going to enter the debate, it’s more effective to speak from a position of knowledge rather than ignorance, unless of course you’re just wanting to toady up to a lot of other like-minded bigots!\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 6:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13073","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"As a Catholic who is not in total lock-step with the Vatican (cf. nuns), I kind of agree with the post as to one thing: were it not for the Roman Catholic Church through the ages, the Shroud would have been disposed of centuries ago. If had been in France, not Italy, it certainly would not have survived the French Revolution (or apparently the Reformation).\nI believe that the survival of the Shroud into the scientific era is not a question of provenance but providence, or rather Providence. As to John Calvin, he lost me with predestination.\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13075","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"“[…] critics contend experts have no historical record of a coin containing the rare misspelling in Greek of the name Caesar, using a ‘C’ instead of a ‘K,’ “.\nRIGHT. \nRELIABLE numismatic archives/professional numismatists JUST ignore such a mispelling. Actually Filas, Haralick, Whangher, Moroni etc JUST grossly misread half of a dozen of pretty much worn out Pilate coins (lituus coin type). Actually the alleged partial CAI[CAPOC] lettering they thought they read on the Shroud right eye erea should be read [KAI]CAP[OC] with the “P” letter reduced to a fragmented-shaped like “I”.\n“… [critics contend] that the markings found on the shroud could have been distorted by age and the texture of the cloth”. \nBOTH WRONG & RIGHT. \nWhen the partially blood smeared coin obverse (lituus coin type) was recorded onto the Shroud RIGHT eye area, it was recorded nearly at scale 1:1 (98-99%). However when the partially blood smeared coin obverse (simpulum coin type) was recorded onto the Shroud LEFT lower eyelid and possibly the LEFT  eyebrow midarch area it was at reduced scale (via alkali water solution soaked 3/1 woven linen mechanic return force).\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 6:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13076","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"Mistyping: “alkali water solution soaked 3/1 woven linen FABRIC mechanic return force”\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 7:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13079","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"PS: I don’t belong to any Church, Temple, Mosque or Synagogue…\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 7:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13077","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"I am neither a theist nor a gnostic nor even an agnostic…\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 7:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13080","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"…nor an atheist…\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 7:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13082","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"…I am a FREEthinker…\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 7:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13081","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"As far as the Turin Shroud is concerned my agenda is archeo(crypto)logical truth…\n\n","date":"June 27, 2012 at 7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13083","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"Correction: ” (forensic) archaeo(crypto)logical truth”…\n\n","date":"June 28, 2012 at 3:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/27/shroud-of-turin-why-no-proof-can-ever-suffice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-13127","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud of Turin: Why No Proof Can Ever Suffice","post":"Donald P.
