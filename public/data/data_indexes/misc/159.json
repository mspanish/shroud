The number of people who believe in something has absolutely no impact on my judgement.\nThe question of the shroud’s authenticity to me is a scientific question. I don’t believe in the shroud because I am a christian and I don’t believe in Jesus because I believe in the shroud. To me it’s a scientific question and I believe the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of an authentic burial shroud of the historic Jesus. like the agnostic scientist Yves Delage declared “If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, an Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection”\nI don’t believe that 9/11 was an inside job because:\n1- there is absolutely no evidence it is an inside job, only speculations.\n2- there is a lot of evidence that its not. Confession tapes by the leader and team members of the operation. Training courses for flying but not landing or taking off, testimonies from people who interacted with the perpetrators. Money transfers, video tapes, documents recovered from Afghanistan and Pakistan etc.\n3-it makes sense to be a terrorist operation. Islamic extremists are among the most evil people you will ever run to in this life. Absolutely no regard to life. They still blowup and behead people today in Syria, iraq, Egypt, Lybia, Nigeria, Somalia and Phillipines. (see the link below. I would advise you to open the first video only which is someone recounting his testimony. I didn’t open the following videos because I don’t like watching these things). Beheadings, Explosions and flying body parts are their hallmarks, their fingerprints are all over 9/11. I lived in the Middle East most of my life. I was living in UAE when 9/11 happened, I saw people at work and in the streets celebrating the “death of the Americans”.\n4-it doesn’t make sense to be an inside job. I don’t believe that people would do that to their own country, their own people.

I probably haven’t studied it as much as you, but when the radiocarbon date came out to be the 14th century, I was puzzled, since we still had the mystery of how the image was formed.  But I accepted that it was a forgery, since the hard scientific evidence seemed to prove that it was.  It was only when I discovered this website (a year ago?) that I found out that there is strong reason to contest the radiocarbon dates.  Now I only wish new tests would be conducted to lay to rest any doubts about the date.  If it turns out to be authentic, then I suspect God preserved the Shroud for significant reasons, such as a testament to the existence of Jesus at a time when Mythicists are enjoying so much renewed popularity.  \nAs to 9/11, once I found out that there is a significant number of building experts who reject the official explanation for the collapses of all three WTC buildings, that was enough for me to question the official account.  Until there is a new, independent investigation, I won’t be satisfied. \nIt is irrelevant whether the terrorists flew planes into the WTC1 and 2.  The question remains, what brought them and WTC7 down ?  AE911truth maintains that it was controlled demolitions, and there is at least some physical data that seems to support their contention.  If they are correct, then we can ask other questions, such as who, how, and why?  Given the tremendous increases in defense and security spending that has been justified by 9/11, along with the tremendous increases in power for the intelligence community, I think it’s rather easy to find motives for 9/11, besides just terrorism. \nLike the Shroud, I suspect that God made sure WTC7 happened in plain sight (there is some evidence that it was originally intended to bring it down while the dust clouds from WTC1 or 2 would have made viewing WTC7’s collapse impossible) for those willing to follow the truth wherever it might lead:","date":"March 22, 2014 at 11:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/17/the-shroud-of-turin-is-number-11-in-cnns-list-of-top-11-mysteries/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-91931","author":"Julian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin is Number 11 in CNN’s List of Top 11 Mysteries","post":"Hi Julian, I too hope the shroud gets tested again.
