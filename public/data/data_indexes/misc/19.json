[{"title":"A point now where science and religion are in fact treading on the same ground","post":"Is the Resurrection real?\nMy answer :  I believe it is.  That’s the only honest thing I can say.  I cannot say :  I know for sure (scientifically speaking) that it is.  And I cannot say :  I can demonstrate it in a lab.  And here’s a truth for anyone out there:  Nobody will ever be able to demonstrate it in a lab!  How can you prove something that is immaterial and spiritual?\nI can only say that I believe it with all my heart.  In fact, I got a strong intuition that it is real, not only for Jesus but for all living creatures ever created by God, including every human being of course.  In my mind, all the living things created by the Creator cannot end up in nothingness.  That would be a total non sense.  And I think Paul agree with me when he say:  “ALL creation eagerly waiting for that future day when God will reveal his glory.”\n\n","date":"July 23, 2013 at 10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/23/a-point-now-where-science-and-religion-are-in-fact-treading-on-the-same-ground/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-39587","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A point now where science and religion are in fact treading on the same ground","post":"Yannick,\nMy point is that through Science and the Shroud, God IS revealing his glory. In the Phenomenon of Man, Teilhard predicted a convergence of science and religion. That time is now. It is honest science that revels the truth of the Crucifixion and, I submit, the Resurrection.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2013 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/23/a-point-now-where-science-and-religion-are-in-fact-treading-on-the-same-ground/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-39589","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A point now where science and religion are in fact treading on the same ground","post":"Concerning the Resurrection of Jesus, as I said the other day, I don’t think we will ever be able to go further with our science than this point that has already been reached and that is based on enough converging evidences :   Around the year 30 A.D., Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish prophet died the cross the day before the Jewish Passover feast. Then, on the morning following the Jewish Passover feast, his tomb and his burial shroud was found empty. Then, some disciples of Jesus became totally convinced (so much that some even died for this belief) that he was resurrected and they claimed he appeared to them with a physical body that was not totally the same as the one they knew before his death.\nSeriously, I don’t know how science could reach a point further than this one day…  To go further, there should have been cameras set inside the tomb 24/24 and also cameras that would have follow the disciples everywhere in the days following the death of Jesus.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2013 at 11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/23/a-point-now-where-science-and-religion-are-in-fact-treading-on-the-same-ground/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-39593","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A point now where science and religion are in fact treading on the same ground","post":"Most important thing to understand versus the point I described in my previous post:  This historical fact will never be enough to be considered as a sure proof of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.
