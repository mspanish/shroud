I think it is thoughtful and well-written.  However, let us not forget that Colin’s web-site seems to be agenda driven, with its heading “The Turin Shroud: but for the pseudo-science it might have been dismissed long ago as a medieval fake”  Contrast this with the more circumspect heading on Dan’s site intro –  “Is the Shroud real? Probably.”   Colin would win more friends if he was less provocative as to his intentions, and could demonstrate a modicum of open-mindedness about even the possibility of authenticity.  However I particularly like the point he makes about “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” – for I suspect there are many such.  In the meantime “Peace!” and let us hope that it is more than just a “Cease-fire!”  \nI have been attempting to give some thought about the question of “pareidolia” as to their real presence or not, and what objective ways there might be of ascertaining this, or at least a better indication than mere subjectivity.  There has already been extensive comment following the posting of the recent paper on this topic.  One of the shortcomings of that paper, and indeed a considerable volume of most other material on the web concerning image analysis and identification, is that they all seem to seek to make comparisons with known pre-existing imagery, such as for example the attempt to make comparisons with an alleged back-of-cloth facial image with the known front-of-cloth image.  This approach clearly has limitations, and does not allow for the discovery of anything new not yet known, or at least possibly admissible.  \nA passing thought is the simple human ability to recognise ordinary alphabetic lettering despite a variety of fonts.  By objective measures only, there would seem little to connect say Lucida Black with Times Roman, serif fonts with non-serif, Gothic and Arial, etc.  Yet the human eye and brain readily succeed in achieving this recognition.  I think it doubtful that any objective measure could succeed in confirming this identification in the same degree.  OCR succeeds to some extent, but perhaps it needs to identify the font character set beforehand.  I suspect that similar comments may apply to pareidolia, that there are inherent difficulties with objective measurements.   \nThe frequency distribution of any variate is completely defined by its statistical moments, although it is rare to go higher than the fourth – 1st moment = central tendency (mean); 2nd moment = variability (standard deviation); 3rd moment = skewness; 4th moment = flatness or peakedness (kurtosis).  Higher moments tend to be unstable.  The situation becomes somewhat more complex for multi-variate distributions, and the grey-scale pixels on the Shroud cloth comprise degrees of greyness on a 2-dimensional matrix (surface of the cloth).  There is also the backgound inherent banding from the weave of the cloth. \nIt occurs to me that it should be possible to divide the cloth into a grid of squares wherein the various normalised moments can be ascertained.  There is a further complication with areas which may be blood-stained or not blood-stained, and whether the cell is an image area or non-image area.  Ideally it should be possible to ascertain grid moment outliers as areas of interest for further inquiry into pareidolia phenomena.  Yet a further complication is that pareidolia imply a geometrical shape, which again implies some kind of inter-connectedness between neighbouring pixels.  The computing requirements for such an investigation would be phenomenal, and perhaps it is no wonder that subjectivity has to date been the mainstay of attempts at identifying pareidolia – however such subjectivity has proved to be controversial and lacking agreement.  I think perhaps I have now exhausted my present thoughts on the topic, but possibly it may continue to tease my regrettably now senescent brain.  Perhaps a younger investigator may see something worthwhile in pursuing a few of these ideas.\n\n","date":"January 12, 2013 at 4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/12/stop-taking-cudgels-to-each-other/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21941","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stop taking cudgels to each other?","post":"Well thought post, Dave.\n\n","date":"January 13, 2013 at 9:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/12/stop-taking-cudgels-to-each-other/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21954","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stop taking cudgels to each other?","post":"Re unknown, it does seem CB ignore most of the research work done before him on the TS as far as  scorching  is concerned.\n\n","date":"January 13, 2013 at 9:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/12/stop-taking-cudgels-to-each-other/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21953","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stop taking cudgels to each other?","post":"Reminder (as long as B.
