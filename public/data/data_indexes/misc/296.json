[{"title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures","post":"The official record of Garlaschelli and Borrini’s presentation can be found at: http://www.aafs.org/sites/default/files/AAFS2014Proceedings.pdf. Three references to the “traditional” horizontal position of the arms led me to believe the setting up of a straw man, but I think I was mistaken. Attempts to get blood to flow down an arm were made from three different ‘exit wound’ sites, at angles from “0° (arm parallel to the groud and perpendicular to the body) to 90° (vertical arm).” It was found that blood would only flow down the arm at “greater than 80°” which is, indeed, a good deal more vertical than any “traditional” position.\nThe idea that there were two blood flow angles, as illustrated above, was explored many years ago. The zigzag pattern was created, it was suggested, by blood flowing vertically down the arm and stopping in minor clots along the way, which, when the arm was more horizontal, then changed direction and dripped straight off. This was quite ingenious, and I experimented with it myself twenty years ago, but was wholly unable to produce anything like the pattern we see on the Shroud. The fact that in all this time nobody has reported success suggests that either the experiment has continuously failed, or that the researches of Garlaschelli and Borrini are long overdue.\nMike’s suggestion, that the blood would flow along the sloping arm if the flow was slow, or vertically off it if the flow was faster, also needs experimental corroboration.\nThe authors do state that “further analysis will focus on the position of both arms…” so I don’t think the right arm has been wholly ignored. We must look forward to their further results.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 6:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-96102","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures","post":"One more thing Hugh, a hole in the wrist will produce blood from more than one point (unlike their experiment squirting blood from one narrow tube in one direction, which doesn’t reflect what happens in nature); the skin is covered with blood vessels. Even blood from both the entry and exit wounds may flow around the arm and mix together. Another thing is the viscosity of the blood, since Jesus was severely dehydrated the blood would be thicker than that of the volunteer in the experiment.\nThe fact that blood would flow on the arm is simple physics (surface tension) where the blood would stick to another surface until a greater force (gravity, when there is enough weight of blood ) overcomes the surface tension.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-96120","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures","post":"Sorry Hugh.

Would there always be rivulets?  In exactly the same pattern.  Handling, transport of the body could also be affect the final result, as well as washing, even done hurriedly, which is debatable. . \nIf an artist were skilled enough (or not) to effectively depict blood flow patterns on the cloth is subjective, but if the blood was simply applied by a forger, why is it so red?\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 7:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-96114","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures","post":" “…….but if the blood was simply applied by a forger, why is it so red?”\nThis it is a MAGNIFICENT question!\nCarlos\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 7:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-96119","author":"Carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures","post":"And which artist would even consider blood flow on a body in two different plains (vertical/cross & horizontal/tomb) like in the small of the back blood stain and the blood stain going off the elbow?\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 8:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-96123","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures","post":"Bloodstains evidence on the Shroud totally contradict the idea of a forger applying blood on the cloth.

Even for a single individual, on a singular arm, the relaxed & flexed positions of a forearm, shoulder could alter the blood flow patters due to the absence or presence of furrows at a particular time that blood dripped downward.\nThe pictures are interesting-I believe the color of the cloth(s),material including the Shroud, is a consideration to be taken into account as to how this may affect our perception of the blood color.\nIf the blood was doctored, wouldn’t the chemical signature of the additive be apparent in the spectroscopic analysis-or perhaps it could lie within certain of the unresolved peaks?\nIn Adler’s protease digestion experiments, would the paint, dye be sensitive, removed together with the blood to evaluate fiber color underneath?\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-96154","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures","post":"Good points.
