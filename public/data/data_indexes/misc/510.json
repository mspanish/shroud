[{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"As far as I am concerned, the verdict is still out.  It is not enough to simply claim the cloth is medieval without offering a credible process the alleged artist used to create this masterpiece.  We are clearly looking for an artist who predated Leonardo by several hundred years.  Charles Freeman has offered the most recent hypothesis but it too fails to explain why the blood penetrated the cloth whereas the paint did not, nor is it credible to assume that every speck of paint used to form the image has now disappeared.  Garlaschelli’s attempt was compelling but still does not replicate the fine gradient that correlates with body to cloth distance, nor does it account for no image being under the blood.  Contest this point all you want, this was a clear determination of STURP—you know, the scientists who had hands on access to the cloth for five days and nights.  I also get annoyed when the cloth’s obvious origin in Constantinople is conveniently ignored so as to allege the history only begins in the 1300’s.  This is irresponsible in view of the numerous documents both historical and visual that give strong evidence for the Shroud being stolen in 1204 by the French during the 4th Crusade.  Too many unanswered questions for the Shroud to be dismissed as a Medieval fake.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2015 at 7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197294","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"I’ve been attempting to use this site’s comments to unveil a new hypothesis Russ – the “nitric acid fumigation model”.

Remoistened blood and heavy sweat residue built up on the body transferred from the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the body and onto the linen surface. After a 15-30 minutes’ subjection to fumigation to purify and dry out the bloodied body (in the fumigated tomb antechamber), the linen held the bloodied body image through a providentially ‘built-in’ pre- or light mordanting process, which resulted in ventral and dorsal HD prints born on the inner side of the winding inner burial sheet (here linen with carbohydrate layer on it)\n– at least two cloth-to-body configurations in terms of COMPRESSURE (via tighlty wrapped-up shrouds) and slight loss of COMPRESSURE (as the in-soaked inner shroud aka TS got sort of taut again through shrinking and gradually unstuck) \n– AQUAEOUS ALKALI SOLUTION as pre- or light mordanting agent since the warm/hot water solution used to soak the inner winding burail sheet in order to purify the bloodied corpse without disturbing the blood and wasting time, most likely was either the Red Heifer waters (in order to purify the TS man’s shed innocent blood along with his corpse), waters mixed with Jerusalem limestone/Melche stone dust (just to purify the bloodied corpse) or just remoistened urea residues (presence of ammonia) (A combination of waters mixed with ashes, limestone dust and ammonia cannot either be totally ruled out as far as aqueous alkaline solution is concerned)\n– use of an all wrapping sheet (Sudarum of Kornelimûnster)  as ‘final touch’ prior to the body be carried down to the tomb chamber and laid suspine on a stone bench on granulized myrrh bags.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2015 at 1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197321","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"There is a difference between ‘aping’ and coming to a similar conclusion from a different route.

Everyone’s life experience and world view has value, and is valid to them.  What is not permissible is to assert dogmatically that the Shroud is not the authentic burial cloth of Christ, nor to assert dogmatically that indeed it is.  It is conceivable that the Shroud is what it appears to be, and equally conceivable that it may not be.  My own personal opinion based on the information which I have considered over a long life, that it is the burial cloth is well enough known.  That opinion as is the opinion of others are all worthy of respect if honestly derived.  \nBecause the Shroud may be what it appears to be, it ought to be approached with the proper reverence and respect that admits such a possibility.  It cannot be dismissed as an insignificant rag, or merely a cunning device created for the gullible and superstitious, regardless of whatever our personal opinion may be of it.  Too much about it is unknown. \nIn Andrea’s posted comment above, reasons are given for his rejecting its authenticity.  Andrea has written a book arguing that the Shroud is not the Mandylion, and therefore he would seem to have a vested interest in asserting that it is not authentic.  Quite likely he may be correct in his assertion that it is not the Mandylion, but that is quite insufficient by itself to assert non-authenticism, as there are any number of other possibilities, some of them unknown.  Wilson’s Mandylion theory was only one such brave attempt to derive an explanation for the apparent gap in its history.  Andrea, along with others, considers it has failed to do so. \nHe asserts that for thirteen centuries no-one in history has ever spoken of the Shroud.  That is his own peculiar rigorous view of history, where he seems to require a specific document outlining and specifying all the features of the Shroud that we now know.   A more open approach to history would place some value on the very many less specific and obscure references that we find in Byzantine sources, but to an open mind would seem plain enough, particularly if allowance is made for a typical Byzantine obscurantism when discussing matters of the Holy.  It is therefore incorrect to assert that no mention is made. \nHe then refers to the comments of the Bishop of Troyes and the Pope, presumably Pierre D’Arcis, and Avignon Pope Clement VII.  Much of what is asserted here derives from the work of Chevalier and Thurston, both of whom had a peculiar agenda of asserting non-authenticity in response to the photography of Secondo Pia and the forensic work of Delage and Vignon.  Both Chevalier and Thurston have been charged with a conspiracy to misrepresent their sources.  A rigorous approach to history should be satisfied that the claims that D-Arcis and Clement VII are asserted to have made are indeed factual, and are without the bias of Chevalier and Thurston.   \nHe then ventures beyond his own field of specialised competence into the forensic.  He dogmatically asserts that the image could not have been produced by a dead body without the intervention of a craftsman, and that the blood flows are unrealistic.  Given the particular properties of the Shroud cloth, he cannot know this, and several forensic pathologists, experienced in such matters, have asserted otherwise.  Nor does his assertion that the Shroud cloth is technologically medieval stand unchallenged.  There are good reasons for asserting that the yarn was processed according to ancient methods, particularly the bleaching process.  \nHis brave attempt at asserting that twelve separate radiocarbon tests dated the cloth to medieval times, conveniently passes over the fact that all the tests were carried out on one single unrepresentative sample, so that it would be incomprehensible and incompetent of the laboratories if the results did not match.  In fact the actual tests are known to have failed a chi square test for consistency, so even that remains an unresolved issue.  \nI am uncertain as to his intent in mentioning coins, but it is curious that there are Byzantine solidi from about the sixth century which are a close match to the Shroud facial image.  Perhaps his allusion is to the debatable coins over they eyes issue.  He seems to dismiss such matters as pollens, although there remains sufficient evidence from spring pollens exclusive to Jerusalem environs, including the Dead Sea area.  \nHe omits any reference to the presence of Jerusalem aragonite limestone found on the feet, nose and knees of the image, as if from a fall, and from walking the Via Dolorosa.  \nPerhaps none of the matters I have mentioned are sufficient by themselves to assert authenticity, but taken together I find them a powerful argument.  There still remains the enigmatic image of a man of sorrows.  And yet with all our modern technology, no-one yet knows how that image was created.  The Shroud may indeed yet prove to be the burial cloth of Christ, notwithstanding the naysayers.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2015 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197343","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"‘ peculiar rigorous view of history’ !!!!\nSo are historians to be blamed for being rigorous?\nNothing I have seen among earlier references to shrouds, images on cloth, specific icons, of which there were many references, can be shown to link specifically to the Shroud now in Turin.

He argues that it was the Shroud.  The Image of Camuliana was paraded around Cappadocia and Anatolia in 554.  In 574, Byzantine emperor Justin II brought two important relics to Constantinople, a relic of the True Cross, and an image of Jesus which was said to have originated in Camuliana.

Indeed Charny is elsewhere described as a founder member of the Order, which understandably faded away in the aftermath of the disastrous (for the French) Battle of Poitiers in 1356 at which de Charny was killed, hardly surprising given he was ‘honoured’, read targeted,  as carrier of  the Oriflamme, and John was captured and exiled to England.\nFor a brief period, two of the most powerful men in France were members of the most powerful club in France – one that they themselves had founded. Might the TS have been gifted to them, for ceremonial use? Or might they have commissioned it themselves,  money and top level patronage opening doors aplenty. Were there links between the Order and those with the technical know-how needed to conjure what could be claimed to be the long-lost Linen of Joseph of Arimathea?  Might the TS have been in the Star’s Paris HQ in the early 1350s, being returned de Charny’s widow on his death, maybe in lieu of hard cash to help her cope. That might explain why the TS was not on public display until immediately after her husband’s death.\nI must now go and re-read what Ian Wilson had to say about a star motif on the Machy Mould for Lirey medallion Mk2.

Geoffray de Charnay  had indeed subjected himself to a similar earlier period of voluntary English imprisonment, as you indicate above had John II.  Wilson is at pains to cover De Charnay’s fascination with the ideals of knightly chivalry, and of course mentions his earlier namesake, the Templar Prior of Normandy executed with Jacques de Molay.  The inference seems to be that De Charnay was attempting to found a successor order similar to the Templars.  \nThe Lirey badge of course shows the De Charnay arms on the dexter side of the shield implying that De Charnay was still alive when the badge was struck to commemorate the first showings at Lirey, so that it had to be before 1356.  Part of Wilson’s purpose in mentioning this fascination with knightly ideals seems to be to exempt him from any deliberate fraud in creating the Shroud, as out of character for such a person.  The Shroud image itself is quite unlike any concurrent artistic model of a dead Christ.  Whether De Charnay had the financial or technological resources, let alone the time available to him in what seems to have been a busy warrior’s life seems an unlikely proposition.  \nYou’ve spent some three years experimenting in your attempts to produce something even vaguely like the image.  I doubt that De Charnay had that amount of free time available, and he certainly would not have the same technical know-how.

Nowhere did I suggest that de Charny*  rolled up his sleeves in the outhouse. Quite the opposite in fact. He must have been one of King John II’s closest associates, given his major input into the creation of the Order of the Star and being chosen as the carrier of the Oriflamme in battle Given the combined clout and financial resources of those two, King and knightly noble, it’s time to consider the real possibility that they commissioned the Shroud, and did so by outsourcing the technical side to an alchemist (=protochemist) employing state-of-the-art technology to convert an imprint in some kind of organic material (a proxy for sweat and blood) to what might look like an authentic 1300 year old image left on J of A’s linen by a newly crucified man.\nSo far, I have had only a few days of experience with flour paste as imprinting medium and nitric acid vapour as developing agent. Isn’t it a bit soon to be so disparaging about my present results, which are after all an entirely novel method of  modelling the TS? You read it here first, in this site’s comments. Already I know of a better alternative to wheat flour, and there are a number of different geometries, ‘frottage’  techniques etc that can be adopted at the imprinting stage, different pre-treatments of the linen etc etc.\nOh, and I don’t agree that de Charny’s widow would have left her newly deceased husband’s coat of arms off the Lirey badge. How respectful is that? Indeed, the badge may have been commissioned partly as a memorial to a celebrated and valiant knight, one of the top men in the land.\n*It’s not “Charnay” (sic)  btw, which is one spelling of the alleged Templar uncle aka de Charney, who was roasted at the stake alongside Jacques de Molay in 1314. )\n\n","date":"April 24, 2015 at 4:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197391","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"No real intention of being disparaging, not even mildly mocking.

Could he accidentally stumble on this marvelous secret, still unknown, and not make better, more frequent use of it?

Please correct me if I’m wrong, and attempt to answer some of the questions, which are not contradictions, but requests for clarification.\n1) Having been scourged and tortured, and now covered in blood sweat and dust, Jesus was dressed in the Tunic of Argenteuil.\n2) After being crucified, he was taken down from the cross in a rigid state of rigor mortis, and his face covered with the Sudarion of Oviedo.\n3) Arriving at the tomb, he was laid on the Shroud on a preparation table, which had two stones or bags of myrrh granules placed to elevate the body from the surface, and the Shroud laid over them.\n4) Leaving the body unwashed and unwiped, the Shroud was folded back over the top of his body, and secured tightly with the Veil of Manopello, the Cap of Cahors, and the Sindon Munda.\n5) The shroud itself was wet, having been soaked in an alkaline mixture including Red Heifer water, Jerusalem limestone and powdered starch. Ammonia derived from urea in the sweat may have contributed to the alkalinity.\n6) Within the wrappings, various bits of plant material, and wooden artefacts were also placed.\n7) The body was then fumigated on both sides with vapours arising from the myrrh and aloes, which contained a blood-intensifier.\n8) As a result of the fumigation or a natural drying process, the Shroud shrunk, pulling itself away from the body to leave various areas of non-contact.\n9) The blood marks were formed by contact with the cloth.\n10) The image was formed by bodily contact with the cloth, and also by some form of emission resulting in action at a distance, collimated by the dust covering the surface of the body.\n11) Finally the whole assemblage was wrapped in the Sudarium of Kornelimunster and placed in the burial chamber.\nI hope Max feels that I have represented him correctly, and that others find this description more coherent than previous attempts.\nMy questions are:\n1) Can we have some sources for the idea that any of this was typical Jewish burial practice?\n2) What is ‘Red Heifer water’?\n3) What does ‘fumigated on both sides’ [first on one side and then on he other side] mean?\n4) What was the nature of the emission from the body to produce the action at a distance represented by the intensity differences on the Shroud?\n3) How did the dust on the body collimate the emission?\nOnce I have really understood your hypothesis properly, I will be in a better position to comment on whether it has any credibility.\n\n","date":"April 24, 2015 at 5:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197396","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"Thanks for this, Hugh.

My new model is not ‘naturalistic’. It does not see any role for natural emanations from a dead body leaving an image on cloth. The defects of Rogers’ model, at least as initially set out, have been discussed at length on this site: gas or vapour molecules  do not move in straight lines, unless released through a slit into a perfect vacuum, i.e. ‘collimated’. So how can expect to image across air gaps. Or is it a contact-only model? Naturally-draped cloths do not make good contact with the 3D relief of a human body, without some applied ‘frottage’ as in the Garlaschelli model, and my own. There was no frottage in that 1st century tomb.\nSure, there is a vapour in my new model, but it’s the gaseous phase of a ferocious chemical agent (70% HNO3) that gradually convert over hours a pale or  colorless  organic-based imprint (whether carbohydrate, protein etc) into a yellow or brown image, not dissimilar at first sight to the sepia image on the Shroud.\nThe new images are not dissimilar either from those produced by contact with hot metal (the “thermal imprinting model). But there’s a huge advantage over that previous model: being a two step process – wet imprinting with a harmless foods substance (flour paste etc), followed by an aggressive development in the laboratory (or garage!), one can imprint part or ALL of a living person (or cadaver). One’s not restricted to statues or bas-reliefs. I see no difficulty whatsoever with scaling up, except for needing a good supersize laboratory hood to extract nitric acid vapours (I’ve stopped calling them ‘fumes’ on this site!)..\nWhat’s your opinion of this imaging of my own hand using the nitric acid model?\n\nWhat’s Dan’s opinion?

It is highly unlikely that the imaging process affected the Shroud’s PCW only.

The notion that a superficial 200nm coloration precludes a conventional mechanism is total nonsense, given that 200nm is the approximate thickness of the PCW with its complement of highly exposed and vulnerable hemicelluloses.\nScientists are not trying to disprove the existence of supernatural phenomena. What they object to are pseudo-scientists who rush to invoke the supernatural, claiming that this or that technique provides “hints” of the kind of unscientific ‘theophysics’ that may be operating.  Harnessing laser beams is especially deplorable, given that the  Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation is an entirely man-made effect created by containment and precise geometry, with no evidence that it occurs anywhere else in the universe.

One smears maybe, but with harmless things like flour paste. They are the imprinting agent, as distinct from developing agent. \nNo harsh chemicals come into contact with the skin. Nitric acid vapour is then used to develop the imprint transferred to linen by those harmless agents. Nobody had to dive into vats of developing agent in the early days of photography. The same principle applies. Capture a latent image that may be barely visible. Then develop it chemically until it reaches the desired level of visibility.\nThink of it as  tactile ‘chemography’, an alchemical  forerunner of photography (?)\nAs I said earlier, the method can be scaled up to work with the entire body. No new equipment requirements or modification of basic technique  are introduced, except for larger sheets of linen, more imprinting medium, larger vessels for suspending the linen over nitric acid to get a few hours exposure to the vapour. Based on a single pilot experiment, I suspect that the exposure time can abe considerably reduced using an alternative to flour paste that works faster and as a bonus also sequesters the vapour before it can do appreciable damage to the non-image areas.\nThe final colour – yellow or brown – can probably be manipulated by altering the ratio of carbohydrate to protein in the imprinting medium. More carbohydrate means more oxidation, more browning. More protein means more nitration, more yellowing. The nitric acid model would appear to be a versatile system, but there’s much development work still needing to be done. \nThe colour we see today may not be the same as the initial Mark 1 image. There is arguably something to be said for a model that generates a highly conspicuous image initially, but which degrades and becomes fainter with  time.\n\n","date":"April 24, 2015 at 3:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197445","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"All right, I get it, but you are still in the experimental stage and I would really prefer a paper, complete with details from A to Z, perhaps including material from your 250 postings.

How much experience do you have Y of images that are only visible when you stand well back, or which are not visible with back illumination?\nI suspect that your experience of those features is the same as everyone else’s here, which apart from the Shroud of Turin is zilch, zero, nothing. So what gives you or anyone else for that matter the right to go insisting that an unfamiliar effect is supernatural, simply because you are at a loss to explain something new and unfamiliar.\nIn fact you have no right to do that at all. what’s more, the scientific approach is to treat every such unfamiliar phenomenon as something that can be investigated by applying known principles of physics, chemistry and biology. Invoking a supernatural cause is simply a way of stating that you have no understanding of the scientific temperament or modus operandi. \nWhat is so deplorable is that our friends at ENEA say in the one breath that the approx 200nm deep image is too small to be formed by conventional science, yet in the same breath state that 200nm is also the thickness of the outermost layer of a linen fibre, namely the primary cell wall. Had they followed that up – the botany that is – they would have learned that the PCW is especially  rich in chemically-reactive hemicellulose explaining why image colour is concentrated in so thin a layer, explaining no doubt its no you see it, now you don’t properties.\nThey also acknowledge that image fibres are mechanically weaker than non-image fibres. How come, if all the chemical change is restricted to  the PCW? Answer: it’s almost certainly not. there are hemicelluloses in the core SCW as well, and they were probably compromised too in the image-making process, except that is not so easily visible, due to the preponderance of unaffected cellulose.\nIt is deplorable that those ENEA folk attempt to lecture us all on what is or is not possible with conventional science, displaying as they do an abysmal lack of knowledge – or even interest – in the fundamental botany and chemistry that has to be addressed if one’s to probe and understand the nature of the TS body image.\nWhy do have to repeat myself over and over again on this site re the crucial role that hemicelluloses play, contrary to the prevailing assumption that linen fibres are essentially pure crystalline cellulose. That’s approximately true for cotton, but NOT for linen.\nIs it not just a little discourteous to constantly recycle the same old faux arguments at a researcher – without bothering to read at least some of his postings, which in my case have focused relentlessly on hemicelluloses for well over 3 years? This biomedical researcher worked in the area of cereal dietary fibre for some 12 years. Hemicelluloses are one of the most biologically-active of the cell wall carbohydrates, being easily fermentable in the lower bowel. You have to understand that I discuss hemicelluloses as a seasoned specialist.

As a scientist, he is entitled to say that, but then he will have to reproduce a life size image. That is what Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro asks of anyone who picks up the gauntlet. As a scientist who has been studying the Shroud for thirty years you must also be aware that there are scientists in the realm of Shroud studies who openly claim that the image was produced by a miracle, what Dr. Di Lazzaro avoided saying.\nIt is obvious that National Geographic accepted the Italian scientist’s research, just as I did, and went even further by dwelling on the amount of energy that would be needed to produce an image like the one we see on the Shroud. You can be sure that is because Dr. Di Lazzaro is direct and honest, and can even be blunt-spoken when needed. Unfortunately that has not always been the case whenever I have written about the Shroud, making some Shroudies take me to task for publishing what someone else stated, which they rejected. In this case, the fault has not been mine as I expect to hear the truth, and refuse to be manipulated. If I was deceived then that is something else, what Ian Wilson has referred to as dishonesty in some circles in Shroud studies, while writing as editor of the BSTS newsletter.\nUnfortunately, many Shroud publications only allowed chummies to publish their articles, even if it was just plain rubbish, making me appeal to other publications. In cases like these I have received support from other Shroudies, particularly those who judged that I was correct. I tend to be careful in what I publish, and have some articles and interviews published after painstaking research preserved in university libraries or in other renowned institutions for reference.  \nNow, if there are some scientists who openly mix science with religion, there are (or have been) others who did the exact opposite, sweeping any reference to the supernatural, even though it is implicit, under the rug. That is something I will never accept and if there are journalists who are not accurate that is their problem and I would not like to placed in the category they are in.

Its predecessors included orreries devised by Archimedes (285-211 BCE) which were model planetariums derived from earlier model globes of Thales and Eudoxos which included markings of fixed stars and constellations.  Later Heron of Alexandria constructed similar orreries. \nThe “antikythera” (so named from its location) was discovered in the Aegean in 1900 by Greek sponge divers and lying in 200 ft of water.  In 1958 Derek Price was permitted to examine its remains.  It is essentially an astronomical clock, with an inscription giving instructions, It included mechanical gearing, and a dial with signs of the zodiac.  It included a slip ring which could be used to adjust the mechanism, as predating Julius Caesar’s leap year calendar, the constellations would gradually get out of sync with the lunar calendar then in use.  \nIt included several gear trains, and signs of minor repairs indicated that the device actually worked and was in use.  From the setting of the slip ring it seems that the ship sank about 65 BCE, but then little further was heard of such devices, until about 1000 AD, when al-Biruni an Iranian savant traveled to India and described a very similar machine.  Like the Antikythera, al-Biruni’s machine had 60 degree triangular teeth mounted on square shanks.  \nSuch devices besides illuminating what was then known of astronomy, seem also to have served a useful and practical purpose in navigation.\n\n","date":"April 27, 2015 at 3:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197710","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"Typo,  the anikythera preceded Julius Caesar’s calendar, but I think leap years came later with Pope Gregory.\n\n","date":"April 27, 2015 at 3:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197712","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"The trouble with the supernatural, Angel, is that it is so dull and unimaginative that I can’t believe that God works in such unmysterious ways.

Cannot you correctly read me? I actually referred to a DUST-(urea residue)-blood COVERED body-like membrane shroud acting as a natural primary collimator in terms of accurate alignment AND image enhancer. You totally missed the implication (it makes a world of difference indeed)!\n(Second reminder for you: for the latter propriety of dust covered linen and contactless image transfer mechanism in a humid environment, see Bruno Azzola’s paper presented at the fourth Congresso Nazionale, Siracusa, Sicily, Italy in 1987. BTW that’s the third time I am referring you to the paper and most obviously you haven’t still read it yet before passing your most uninformed, misrepresenting and unsubstantiated negative comments!) \nHow long will you misrepresent my ideas to overrate your allegedly ‘scientific’ opinion and underrate my archaeo(crypto)logical opinion in Dan’s blog? When was it last time you made an attempt to reconstruct the TS man’s dressing in shroudS to experimentally check out if his shroud(s) was/were not a genuine one/genuine ones or a fake/fakes? (I personally made two attempts in 1994 and 1997). What do you REALLY know about the mechanical return force exerted by textile structure in specific circumstances as described below?)\nIn previous posts, in my haste (and admittedly tentative English) to explain (between two professional appointments!), I found it convenient to recur to the optical metaphor “bent & planar mirror”. The phrase (as you should have guessed!) does not refer to any ‘bent and planar mirror’ stricto sensu but the energy receiving-re-emitting textile surface in light of the body-to-cloth initial and final configurations! \n(And absent noteworthy exceptions) Indeed I integrated the likely fact that, first the cloth was tightly moulded around the body front and back and then sort of got taut again (through gradual shrinking and unsticking) from about 0.5mm to only a few millimetres’ distance just above the body.\nAs to my use of the substantive “scan” and the phrase ‘energy beam’, they were for convenience too. The former was no reference at all to an ‘actual scan’ but to a superficial uniform front and back enhanced (3D encoded/volumetric indeed) recording of the bloodied image onto the inner side textile surface on fumigation procedure! The latter (“energy beam”) most exactly referred to a collimated/ body-shaped like vaporographic beam of energy resulting from fumigation of the alkaline water in-soaked inner winding burial sheet (aka TS) moulded around the body front and back.\n(to be continued)\n\n","date":"April 29, 2015 at 10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197940","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"“How long will you misrepresent my ideas?” I do hope I’m not misrepresenting your ideas at all.

You’ll have to be a lot clearer than that. \nYou seem to rely a lot of Bruno Azzola’s paper, which I am completely unable to access. Googling him in an attempt to find out more, all I get is from the BSTS Newsletter on Shroud.com. “J.

Scientists familiar with what the Author is talking about may be able to figure it out.” Now, I hold up my hands here. I don’t know what his ideas are. But don’t now jump up and down in glee shouting “Go and do your homework” as usual.

While the end result matched the eye witness accounts of the tube fire, the simulation’s depiction of the fire burning parallel to the 30° slope of the escalator was THOUGHT BY SOME TO UNLIKELY AND IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE PROGAMMING MIGHT BE FAULTY (upper cases mine). During  experiments with a third scale replica of the escalator constructed at the UK’s Health and Safety Executive site at Buxton, a fire was lit and after seven and a half minutes of normal burning the flames lay down as in the computer simulation.The metal sides of the escalator served to contain the flames and direct the temperature ahead of the fire.When the treads of the escalator flashed over, the size of the fire increased dramatically and a sustained jet of flame was discharged from the escalator tunnel into the model ticket hall. The 30° angle of the escalators was discovered to be crucial to the incident and the large number of casualties in the fire was AN INDIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF A FLUID FLOW PHENOMENON THAT WAS LATER NAMED THE TRENCH EFFECT, A PHENOMENON COMPLETLY UNKNOWN PRIOR TO THE FIRE. The conclusion was that this newly discovered trench effect had caused the fire to flashover on 18 November 1987 at 19:45.” \nToo bad my neologisms do not speak to you at all and you just cannot imagine/’see’ what you’re not familiar at all with or is unlikely to your way of thinking\nMore later (no time at the moment to reply to Hugh and give the sequel to my first part)\n\n","date":"April 29, 2015 at 12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197944","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"Ri-ight.

In general, analytic solutions are usually only available for the simplest cases, such as in laminar flow of incompressible fluids, particularly if they can be modeled in two dimensions only.  \nA lot is known about the turbulent phases and the significance of boundary layers, momentum exchanges and so on, but knowledge and analysis remains imperfect, theoretical only, and to some extent speculative.  In most practical cases of any complexity it is necessary to resort to physical modelling.  Some skill and knowledge is required to ensure that the requirements of dimensional analysis are satisfied, and it is usually not enough to construct merely a geometrical model.  Depending on what phenomena are thought to be most significant the model must be consistent with several various dimensionless numbers, such as the Reynold’s No., Mach No., and so on.  \nThe situation becomes more complex in the case of compressible flow, more so if random temperatures occur such as in a fire. \nThe “Trench Effect” mentioned by Max would seem to be some kind of convection phenomenon caused by the fire, possibly due to some kind of confined air flow from the temperature gradients.  In different practical situations, other as yet unknown effects might also occur, and can usually only be identified by physical modelling.  \nI would think it unlikely that the “Trench Effect” per se would be of direct relevance in creating the Shroud image.  As yet we do not know the processes that might have been involved in creating the image, assuming that it might be naturalistic.  However if fluid flow was involved in its creation, then a physical model would in time be necessary to test any hypothesis, and some as yet unknown fluid phenomenon might yet be involved.  Concerning collimation, it was for this reason that I had wondered whether earthquake stimulated radon emissions might be relevant, in confining and directing whatever particulates might have caused the image.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2015 at 3:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-197960","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"Thanks Daveb for your comment. \nHugh, (as a SHORT reply since I have no much time for a long winded articulate comment), methinks the crucifixion victim’s ‘smooth wet and dust-covered textile skin’ (or ‘second skin’ aka his aqueous alkali solution in-soaked inner winding burial sheet now known as the Turin Shroud), tightly moulded over his dust-sweat-blood covered body, acted as an image enhancing membrane for accurately aligning (collimating) incompressible vapour flow and orthogonally moved in terms of body-to-cloth gradual shrinking and unsticking front and back by means of the said flow as a thermal actuator.\nWhat is now most needed is a physical model in terms of experimental archaeology to test the hypothesis.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2015 at 8:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-198004","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"Typo: in terms of STATE-OF-THE-ART experimental archaeology (no kitchenlab, no pig experiment)\n\n","date":"April 30, 2015 at 9:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-198006","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"This I’d rather call it the ‘Sindon French effect’.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2015 at 9:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-198014","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity","post":"“What is now most needed is a physical model in terms of experimental archaeology to test the hypothesis.” Absolutely correct, Max.
