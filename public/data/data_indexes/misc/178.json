[{"title":"Good Friday 2013","post":"As a Catholic, here’s the most profound meaning of Good Friday to me:  This is “the death of the judgement” and the greatest sign that God, unlike everyone of us, is Love and Mercy and nothing else!!!  And I want to add this:  He’s Love and Mercy for everyone of his children, not just for those who believe in him on Earth.  God doesn’t make categories like we do.  He is God, not human.\n\n","date":"March 29, 2013 at 5:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/good-friday-2013/","cat":"topic_for_today","id":"comment-28750","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Good Friday 2013","post":"Yeshua here is seen as a GIANT (the tallest of the five)  with his long hair worn in a ponytail at the back and a loin-cloth stained with blood rivulets and hanging at the rear of his pelvis.
