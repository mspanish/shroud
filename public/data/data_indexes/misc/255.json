[{"title":"Les Fredette’s Crucifixion Nail: Why I am Skeptical About It","post":"Dan,\nWhat an excellent essay on the process of observation. I reserve my judgment on many claims of things observed on the Shroud because those things that are observed and are beyond reasonable dispute are convincing enough of its authenticity. I think making the most recent photographs of very high definition available would be helpful in resolving some of the “sightings.” \nhttp://johnklotz.blogspot.com\n\n","date":"August 17, 2012 at 10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/17/les-fredettes-crucifixion-nail-why-i-am-skeptical-about-it/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-15118","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Les Fredette’s Crucifixion Nail: Why I am Skeptical About It","post":"Very well written, Dan.  I am of the opinion of Ray Rogers through Barrie Schwortz (I would have loved to have met Ray, I think I would have really liked him, but his death was far before I got involved in SEAM and created the website, which caused me to start my own study in 2009).  There has to be objective criteria by which to verify these observations to something provable by actual measurement.  I don’t pretend to know how that could be done for that is not my area, but it seems to me that experts in that area might come up with something.  Necessity is the mother of invention.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2012 at 8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/17/les-fredettes-crucifixion-nail-why-i-am-skeptical-about-it/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-15163","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Les Fredette’s Crucifixion Nail: Why I am Skeptical About It","post":"Dan,\nHow long will you ignore the alternative aspect to the sight-and-brain issue namely THINKING YOU DON’T SEE what is really there (as it does need a truly initiated eye/a strict & relevant methodology and presentation to be seen/detected)? How long will you just mantra your same old biased stuff after Murra and Di Lazzaro who most unscientifically too totally ignore the same alternative in their paper?\n\n","date":"August 18, 2012 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/17/les-fredettes-crucifixion-nail-why-i-am-skeptical-about-it/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-15170","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Les Fredette’s Crucifixion Nail: Why I am Skeptical About It","post":"Dan, It does seem you only have examples of “I think I sees [what is not really there]” to give and NONE the other way around (examples of “I think I don’t sees [what is really there]”.
