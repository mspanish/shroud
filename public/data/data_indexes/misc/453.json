That would truly be absurd. He has said that the shroud image looks very like a scorch, which indeed it does, and has conducted a number of experiments which demonstrate this. The problem is that scorch marks also fluoresce quite brightly under ultra-violet light, and we are told that the shroud image does not. Experiments I am carrying out, albeit so far unsuccessfully, are attempting to produce visible scorches that do not fluoresce. If these experiments are consistently unsuccessful, the claim that the image might be a scorch is weakened, although time may be a factor which I do not have long enough (700 years or so) really to explore.\n\n","date":"December 5, 2012 at 9:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/22/sinister-clowns-in-the-shroud-of-turin-burn-marks/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-19868","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
