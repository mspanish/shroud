[{"title":"The Wabash Shroudie","post":"Interesting choice of “burned” considering Ray Rogers’ prolific words: The crystal structure of the flax fiber of the Shroud shows the effect of aging, but it has never been heated enough to change the structure. It has never suffered chemically significant radiation with either protons or neutrons. No type of radiation that could produce either color in the linen fibers or change in the C14 content (radiocarbon age) could go unnoticed. All radiation has some kind of an effect on organic materials. This proves that the image color could not have been produced by thermal or radiation-induced dehydration of the cellulose. Image formation proceeds at normal temperatures in the absence of energetic radiation of any kind.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2015 at 7:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/01/the-wabash-shroudie/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-195177","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"}]
