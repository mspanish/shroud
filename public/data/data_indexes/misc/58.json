[{"title":"Arts and Crafts Is Not Science","post":"The image on the shroud seems to be a “bump map” describing 3D space in continuous tones of image density. What’s more, the ratios in density-to-distance from the view plane (the linen itself) of the image seem to be uniform across the entire image. I can’t imagine how this image could have even been conceptualized, much less actually produced, until the invention of photography.\nIs it even possible to produce a recreation of the shroud using modern technology? It would be hard to see how this could be done.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2009 at 6:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/10/08/arts-and-crafts-is-not-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-804","author":"Mozam","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Arts and Crafts Is Not Science","post":"I am a dedicated catholic, I feel impelled to give my testimony because one needs to witness to the truth where and when necessary. In 1981 I was very privileged to have had a vision of our lord Jesus Christ in a historic church that was dedicated to St.Peter and St.Paul, I saw our Lords face, so sad.And the crown of thorns on his head so clear was this vision i could see the string of thorns encircled many times and the thorns so clear as if one would be pricked by them, I was totally awestruck and as you can imagine this vision took me from being a christian with many question marks to a fervent believer, after the vision i went to my mothers home when i went in to her living room i told my mother of my wonderful vision and was overwhelmed to discover that my mother had a copy of the shroud of Turin on her wall.I immediately said to my mother, this is Jesus Christ, this is who i saw actually as he is. It is him. The holy shroud image is that of Jesus Christ, I can’t prove it but i would lay my life on this because it is true. I have since 1981 had many other experiences which have also confirmed to me the authenticity of the holy shroud and that it is of our Lord Jesus Christ. One day it will be recognised as true and venerated as the wonderful relic that it is, and i look forward to that day. Yours in Christ … Fred\n\n","date":"June 5, 2010 at 7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/10/08/arts-and-crafts-is-not-science/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-1331","author":"Fred","site":"shroudstory"}]
