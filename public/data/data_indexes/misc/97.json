I really do not have time to debate the skeptical trolls who post blather on this blog. There are plenty of incisive bloggers who can carry that load, as well as, and indeed better, than I. (Daveb for just one example)\nHowever, the importance of the Shroud is demonstrated by the vehemence and at times delusional rantings of the pseudo-skeptics who believe that the debunked carbon tests and the hearsay D’Arcis memorandum prove the Shroud inauthentic and blithely dismiss the pertinence of the Pray Manuscript and the physical evidence of the Shroud itself. Get used to it: the stains are of real blood and the properties of both the image and the bloodstains have attributes that were unknown in medieval times and beyond the knowledge of anyone until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nScience supports the authenticity of the Shroud. It took the advances of science in the past 115 years to provide the tools by which the Shroud could be properly analyzed down to the quantum level.\nNone dare call it providence!\n\n","date":"May 16, 2015 at 6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/16/christianity-in-sharp-decline-in-the-u-s/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-199269","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Christianity in Sharp Decline in the U.S.","post":"I’ve read this recently too.

How many people were at the foot of that Cross? Two.  How many people hung around on Sunday to try and give the Body of their Master a little dignity in death, as He had given them love in life?\nAs Christians, the Lord gave us the Great Commission ” Go ye unto all peoples, unto all lands..” and so we do.  He didn’t tell us to count them.  In fact, the Christ TOLD us that two-thirds of ALL the seeds planted would not sprout. Some will fall on rocks, some on soil too hard to bear fruit.  How many Christians are there?  The day will come, I believe in my lifetime and I am no Spring chicken, that the ‘people in the know’ will avow that faith is dead. Let them.  So what? What to those of us who truly, completely, believe in Him? Caiaphas, Nero, Domitian, Robespierre, Marx, Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Hitchens… where are they?  And Christ still lives and reigns. He told us, “Lo, I will be with until the end of the world.”\nEven so, come Lord Jesus.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2015 at 7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/16/christianity-in-sharp-decline-in-the-u-s/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-199273","author":"Josie Lu Tyner","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Christianity in Sharp Decline in the U.S.","post":"Correction: Abraham, not Lot, pleaded for Sodom.

However, religion continues to be dominant in a lot of countries. That said, to believe or not to believe is not the problem to me. The problem is when believers support his religion with insults and irrationality (not to mention physical or legal aggression). I don’t know any survey that has studied the question from this outlook. \nSome people think that by expressing their holy anger they work or show that they are working for their cause. In some circumstances they can terrorize, but never convince their opponents. But since we are in a forum, which is a place where terrorizing is impossible, they should consider that their insults have no effect, except to disgust the sensible people.\nPerhaps Hugh is more sensitive to verbal aggressions in this forum because his beliefs are nearer to the aggressors than mine. Such a thing as “troll”, “delusional ranting” , etc., leaves me cold or makes me a bit of  laugh. But they aid me to know when discussing with someone is useful or not. To discuss with an intolerant or an exalted one (“energumen”?) is a loss of time.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2015 at 12:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/16/christianity-in-sharp-decline-in-the-u-s/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-199284","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Christianity in Sharp Decline in the U.S.","post":"David, I read Paulette’s comment and the way it is written, I think she meant for a joke.

I have seen him go off on people and believe me, if he thought he were being attacked he would flip on the high-beams in a hot minute.  I completely and whole-heartedly agree with you, we can be sincere people without forcing our beliefs on anyone.

This seems to be a theme taken up by all recent popes, all of whom personally seemed to accept authenticity, but saw little need to argue its case.  To them, it was the message that was more important.  \nTo Josie:  Perhaps the disregard of the elderly is a by-product of a materialist consumer society, which greedily seeks to take the money from the more gullible young.  In this country, the elderly are clearly valued for their experience by the indigenous Maori, and our many ethnic populations from the Pacific, the Philippines and South-east Asia.  My advice – Join up with a few clubs for the elderly that value your experience, say U3A, voluntary work, or take up Lawn Bowls.  You should find plenty of supportive intelligent company to your liking there.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2015 at 3:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/16/christianity-in-sharp-decline-in-the-u-s/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-199295","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Christianity in Sharp Decline in the U.S.","post":"Christianity in decline?
