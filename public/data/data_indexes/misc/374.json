[{"title":"Press Release: The Institute on Religion and Science of the Regina Apostolorum on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Interesting news.  I just hope M. Di Lazarro will be kind enough (and honest enough) to expose, along with supernatural hypothesis, like flash of light or energetic discharge coming from a corpse, other natural hypothesis like the Maillard reaction or the Volkringer pattern…  Unfortunately, those natural hypothesis (who have not been tested that much) don’t seem to have to favor of many researchers these days.  Maybe it’s because they are not spectacular enough for a supposed shroud of Christ ???  That’s what I think.\n\n","date":"May 13, 2011 at 1:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/13/press-release-the-institute-on-religion-and-science-of-the-regina-apostolorum-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3126","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
