Just another way of getting the message out there, crass though it might be.

I suggested last night to a local priest that he might like to consider using the latest Mayan calendar prediction [Dec 21 is apparently the next Doomsday] in one of his Advent homilies.  But he thought if he weaved Mayan calendar predictions into one of his sermons, that even I would pause and wonder!  We get on just fine.\n\n","date":"December 8, 2012 at 5:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/07/for-your-shroudie-friends-at-christmas/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20060","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
