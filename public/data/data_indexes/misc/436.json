[{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"“Get involved” how, exactly? The Shroud Science Group is no more a coherent authority than the “Shroudstory” group. Recently they have been discussing the possibility of water-borne bacteria being a source of contamination, which is sensible, and why the corners of the shroud are missing, which is also sensible, but before that there was a lot of quantum biophotonic speculation, which, in the absence of any evidence, is as far-fetched, so far, as the earthquake hypothesis.

They can propose the protocol though, and get someone else to execute it.\n\nI don’t know if a truly neutral team, exists anywhere.  IMO, you get the best scientists to do the job, period. \n True, the PAS are appointed by the Church, but there are numerous major, 1st tier names in modern science (including multiple Nobel laureates) that are members of the group.  (I am most familar with those related to the biological sciences), for example, David Baltimore, Paul Berg, Maxine Singer, Francis Collins, Guenter Blobel, Erna Moller…  Stephen Hawkins is also an appointed member.  Francis Collins is the current director of the NIH, considered by most to be the premier research instituion in the world.  These are extraordinarily professional and exemplary scientists, IMO, scientific competence should be the basis for formulation, personal beliefs should not qualify nor exclude anyone from consideration.  The work could or could not necessarily be performed by the individual labs of the PAS members, but they would certainly be competent to assign/suggest particular labs that are considered the best, internationally, at evaluating that particular question.  If one doesn’t trust such exceptionally qualified scientists to suspend any personal beliefs they may have in evaluating these types of questions, what does that really say?  Where do you go from there?  \nIt is possible within such a framework there could be a certain level of exchange/dialogue with pro-Shroud groups, or anti-Shroud groups in the shaping of a formal investigation plan.  You get the best scientists period.  Otherwise, you’re setting yourself up for lessing the credibility of type of any investigation that might be permitted.  STURP laid the groundwork.  The C-14 dating is what it is, was done how it was done.  The next go round, if there is one, will be even more high-stakes; it needs to be thought out very carefully, you are not going to keep getting chances.\nThe Church is the official custodian of the Shroud.  In my opinion, assigning the task to a group such as the PAS to discuss, formulate a well-thought out plan of investigation seems like a natural way to go.  Other options are, of course, possible.  Any discussion like this is predicated on the Church’s desire to allow further investigation & characterization of the Shroud, if they are interested in doing so, or not.\n\n","date":"February 24, 2014 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-82027","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"Kelly, that makes sense.

That was when he co-authored a paper on evolution, not on the Shroud, where he implied that the process was automatic, failing to explain where the rationality came from. It was his way of avoiding the trap, because he must have known that the\nscientist can only answer the How questions, never the Why questions, which is in the domain of theology.\nOne of the good things about you is that your belief in the Incarnation and the Resurrection does not depend on what is seen on the Shroud, and there I am with you.\n\n","date":"February 24, 2014 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-82087","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"Barrie Schwortz once told me personally that Rogers had faith in God.

To me, all those images are a middle eastern ancient way to describe with stricking images a much more subtle and spiritual reality…  Look, even Jesus himself used that technique when he was telling his parables to the people!  Important note to conclude:  even if all those scenes are not 100% historical in the sense that they most probably not happened as it was described, that doesn’t mean the more profound and spiritual reality they try to described with poor human words and images did not happened…  In the case of the transfiguration, I really believe some disciple surprised Jesus one day after or during he was praying in the mountain and were struck by the way he looked like (as he was transfigurated because of the loving connexion he had with his Father at the moment).

I have no doubt it was produced by the body ( not from an external source like an earthquake ) it is photochemical or thermochemical in nature because it is very superficial almost produced in a flash speed (as shown by ENEA’s experiments). It was not produced by fluids coming from the body because it would’ve never produced this resolution of an image. it was not produced by vapours because it is very superficial, and again resolution would be a problem. I don’t exclude a natural phenomena but I think it’s highly unlikely. So when left with a supernatural event I think the only thing that a new team of scientists can do is to continue what STRP did. i.e. new carbon dating of the multiple pieces that were clipped off from several locations in 2002. Re-examine the pollen grains from the dust that was vacuumed in 2002, re-examine the chemical composition of the shroud vs the side strip vs the C14 region. Reexamine the blood stains, is it really high in bilirubin, is it really there before the image. it would be to validate STRP work, the things that STRP scientists would’ve done if they took a second chance to examine the shroud, what did they miss and what could’ve been done better.

Of course not!  Why in the world such an event must have produced any kind of by-product in the form of a burst of material energy?

This is a presumption. It may be that the Shroud image is naturalistic, and one might then expect that if given adequate access to the relic, then Science might some day discover all that is to be known about it.  However in our present state of knowledge it is equally possible that the image has a supernatural origin.  How is the competent scientist of Faith to take account of this very real possibility?  \nDoes he ignore the possibility that it may be miraculous, knowing than that whatever scientific endeavours he persists in may well be fruitless, as his Science may be incapable of providing the answer? Or perhaps he may look for some kind of boundary where Science and the Supernatural might meet? This second path seems to be the one trod by such as Fanti, Carpenteri and Jackson. For various reasons they seem to have discarded the purely naturalistic explanation and seem to be searching for some kind of amalgam of science and the supernatural. Yes, it involves conjecture and speculation and an agnostic scientist is unlikely ever to accept their conclusions. As in all such new ideas they will sometimes go astray, as seems to have been the case with the Carpenteri paper.  But what if they happen to be right in their suspicions that a purely naturalistic explanation will never suffice?  \nIn the absence of adequate experimentation, a purely naturalistic explanation cannot yet be ruled out. I should like to see a concerted programme of experiments with time-expired lab animals to see if it is possible to produce Shroud-like images by naturalistic means. Whether that is indeed possible cannot yet be excluded. \nIn the meantime, other well-meaning attempts to explore the boundaries between science and the supernatural need not be deplored.

Most probably, Turin will never give those data to just one or two researchers, so they can use them for their own benefit and I agree perfectly with this vision.  In order for the authorities to agree for a new series of direct researches and analyses (including the analysis of all the data and material taken during the restoration of 2002), I’m pretty sure this will take the same kind of team effort that was done by STURP back then.  In other words, scientists interested by the Shroud should look at the building of the STURP team and the making of their test plan and try to follow their footsteps.  Such a new test plan should, of course take into account all the findings and conclusions of STURP and try to design some tests to confirm or reject each of them, while trying also to push the analysis further than what STURP did concerning some important subjects like the question of the chromophore of the image (which is the most important thing that still need to be fully determine in order to understand the image, to judge the validity of each image formation hypothesis out there and maybe to build a new (rational) ones that will have more chance to fully explain it).\n\n","date":"February 26, 2014 at 11:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-82727","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"Professor Giulio Fanti’s new Shroud book was launched by Segno today:\nhttp://www.edizionisegno.it/libro.asp?id=1137\n\n","date":"February 25, 2014 at 5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-82474","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"\ndaveb of wellington nz :\nIn the absence of adequate experimentation, a purely naturalistic explanation cannot yet be ruled out.

The naturalistic route would seem\nmuch more amenable to a concerted effort of experimentation than many of the alternative\nexplanations-yet, it seems to lag behind in attempts to collect empirical data.  I have always thought Rogers sold himself short in his paper mache hand experiment-the system was not the best-in my opinion the detail is just not there-even knowing the hand was the substrate, it is difficult to appreciate the shape in the resulting image.

Relative to a real hand, I have wondered if the porosity of the skin might help to provide some of the focus, detail that would be important to demonstrate.    \nIn designing an experiment using lab animals, a considerable number of variables exist, both relative to treatment conditions of the cloth and the body underneath it.

Some verses in the bible can be difficult to interpret (wheather figurative or literal, e.g “a day” in genesis 1) and their exist a lot of debate over those. Other verses are clearly metaphorical or symbolic in nature (e.g. “The lord is my shepherd”) while others are clearly literal (“Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.”) as you can see in the way those verses were written you can tell that it was a literal description of events. The transfiguration event is clearly literal. You see the disciples were “terrified” and they “fell on their faces” even Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah”\nWhen I was a teenager I always got stuck on this verse. I would say its in the bible, it must mean something. I totally missed the rest of the verse “For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified”(Mark 9:6)  this is not how you write a Metaphore, this is how you write an eyewitness account. Peter basically was saying gibberish and its written in the bible because… This is what happened. This is not because they saw Jesus face showing love to the Father.

One good clue to think if a verse is using metaphorical images is to find the same kind of images used in the Ancient Testament.

That’s why I tend to consider the images we found in the accounts of the transfiguration, of the Passion, death and resurrection in the Gospel of Matthew, of the conversion of St Paul and of the Pentecost (just to name a few) as probably metaphorical in good parts, even though, as I said, they still refers to TRUE REALITIES, but realities that are SPIRITUAL and not visible with our human eyes (only visible in fact with the EYES OF THE HEART).

So, in such context of direct links between the account of the transfiguration and the account of Moses at the Horeb (and also when you consider that at the transfiguration, Moses is supposed to have been there with Jesus), I think it’s fair to assume that at least a portion of the transfiguration account (a major part in my mind) is most probably metaphorical (including the idea of light coming out of Christ and the presence of Moses and Elijah with him).\nNote : If the belief that this account is completely historical makes you feel better and help you sleep at night, my suggestion is that you keep on believing this…  As I said (and most scholars agree with me) :  knowing FOR SURE if a particular part of the Bible is historical or metaphorical is a real guessing game, unless we can back-up this particular account with solid historical facts and/or archaeological findings.\n\n","date":"February 27, 2014 at 10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-83083","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"I must add that the description of the disciples being « terrified » and to “fell on their faces” is also directly related to the account of Elijah meeting God on the mountain, which is another good clue to think most of the transfiguration account (i.e. most of the images used in this account) is metaphorical.\n\n","date":"February 27, 2014 at 11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-83084","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"\nLouis :\nKelly: “Lab animals are routinely used in many lines of research-it could probably be coordinated with a lab group that was already using (control) animals as part of another \nstudy.”\nThe world is changing, for instance, there are countries where lab animals for testing cosmetics is prohibited, and this is just a start. Sorry, I would tell anyone who suggests using lab animals for Shroud research: put yourself in the animal’s place to see how it feels.\n\nMy main reasoning was to use animals already gone by the wayside.  No blood sacrifices.  No different from a pig used in the tv experiment with Barrie last year.  Just at least, in triplicate, please.  And controls, okay?  Apart from actually involving the body of an animal, I believe there is much one could learn about the process from really scouring the literature and talking to the labs that routinely study the physiological mechanisms associated with death.  That, on its own, could help advance things.   \nSomewhat off-topic, but related, let me just briefly share this with you as someone who has been there, done that.  Then I’ll stop.  \nHere are two studies I was a part of that characterized antibodies used in the evaluation of human ovarian cancer.  The antibodies recognize tumor specific antigens that are important in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  \nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0215(20001215)88:6%3C866::AID-IJC5%3E3.0.CO;2-6/full\nhttp://iospress.metapress.com/content/dqmj6wakd35yn153/\nThese antibodies were generated in mice.  They simply cannot be made in tissue culture, they require a living system.  There are strict guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals in such research.  I don’t know about the specifics of cosmetic testing.  \nIn my opinion, one has to weigh the relative cost of using animals in scientific and medical research with the overall benefit towards human beings.  Several of the labs I have worked in were attached to or located within a clinical setting.  Many of the patients there were last chance treatments.  I saw their families in the hallways.  I saw the patients themselves sitting outside in the courtyard, and rode together with them on the elevator.  It was very, very easy to put myself in their place and the place of their family members; the thought of the animals, quite frankly, came secondary or even further down the ladder.\n\n","date":"February 25, 2014 at 9:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-82538","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"Kelly, I get your point, yet I see no need for animal sacrifice in Shroud studies.

There are respectable labs where routine testing on animals still persist.  De Liso used a snake and I’m unaware that any objections arose from this.  Problem is snakes are cold-blooded, metabolism unlike human.  Abattoirs still thrive (tried any NZ lamb recently?), I’ve heard that it’s still bad news for turkeys on Thanksgiving in USA, and chicken farms still yield other products besides eggs. Where do KFC and Mcdonalds get their key ingredient, it’s not all soy! Admittedly, both NZ and Australia have serious problems with Japanese whaling in our Southern Ocean. Or maybe you could start off with fishes, but again they’re cold-blooded. \nI think there’s a serious vacuum in our knowledge of Shroud Science as to whether images can or cannot be routinely formed from carcases.  Until the matter can be settled one way or another, I fear there will be little real advances in understanding what processes might be involved. Barbet was not averse to using cadavers or amputated limbs in his research. \n“No blood sacrifices!” is a fairly emotive objection. Possibly Louis is a vegetarian or vegan? I’ve been in abattoirs (my dad was a butcher), and I’ve worked in a fellmongery when a student; The slaughter chain is not a pretty sight and can be fairly upsetting for the young. But most of us are still omnivores. I doubt if a Chinese or Japanese lab would have any serious ethical problems with setting up such an experiment. There would be objections in India.     \nUntil a serious attempt is made to understand what imaging processes may be involved, naturalistic vs supernatural causes will remain in the area of idle speculations going nowhere!\n\n","date":"February 25, 2014 at 10:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-82553","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"Most NZ lamb is now killed by certified halal butchers for markets in the Middle East.

My father was a doctor, his elder brother got an honorary doctorate in medicine from the very European university where he became a doctor years before. A few years before that he was appointed by both Government and Church to examine the incorrupt body of a Catholic saint and submit a report, which was later published by an European Academy of Science. But this has not influenced me in the least because my father did not have much patience with animals and my uncle did not seem to be a big animal lover. My position is based on study and observation and experience, which would drive anyone to understand that all form of suffering should be reduced to the minimum possible because there is a lot more evil in the world than most people imagine. The most dangerous form of evil is that one which acts silently. For those who are unwilling to accept this, one can say, at least to believing Christians, it is mentioned in the most important Christian prayer: The Lord’s Prayer.\nAs for daveb’s second comment, I beg to differ, halal butchers got their theology from (in my view) unnecessary teachings that crept into the Old Testament. How could the God of Israel be different from the pagan gods if he advocated blood sacrifices? The hated Romans also sacrificed animals, the Seleucid ruler Antiochus Epiphanes slaughtered swine in the Jerusalem Temple to show that he was in charge in Palestine and could desecrate the house of worship. The Prophets seem to have understood, for one of them wrote, “I will have mercy and not sacrifice”.   \nI have seen a Jewish politician, an extremely respectable person who has done a lot of good, much more good than his gentile colleagues, demanding an end to “Shehitah” (kosher),and some four months ago I saw a TV news report where two groups of Jews, Orthodox and Reform, were arguing on the streets and the issue was blood sacrifice. The Reform Jew told the journalist present that the chickens the Orthodox were selling for 30 dollars each did not take away anyone’s sins and that the Orthodox were making money out of it.\nOf course, this view comes from the historical-critical reading of the Bible, a form of study which was accepted even by an important Israeli Jewish scholar like Yehezkel Kauffman.\nSo, it seems that appealing to laboratory animals to study the Shroud image formation is more like an act of desperation, nothing more than a demonstration of weak faith. As I commented more than once here, even if it is “proved” that the Man of the Shroud is Jesus it will still not answer many questions.\n\n","date":"February 26, 2014 at 8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-82871","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Should SSG Get Involved?","post":"In # 108, daveb unnecessarily brought the halal butchers in NZ into the discussion about using animals in Shroud research.
