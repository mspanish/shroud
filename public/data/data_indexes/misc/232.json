If it were – or had been –  a fake, produced by some ingenious imprinting process that mimicked at least some of the properties of modern photography, indeed, computer-aided imaging technology –  then why was the “trick” not repeated subsequently again and again, in a range of applications, as finally to elicit a huge groan or yawn on each reappearance?\nOK, so I am repeating the obvious – namely that the Shroud is unique – making it not just an object of devotion for the faithful, but equally well an object of intense interest and speculation, at least to those of us possessed (or afflicted) with an open and enquiring mind…\n\n","date":"January 17, 2012 at 10:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/16/it-is-enough-to-make-you-want-to-become-a-skeptic/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7091","author":"sciencebod","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"It is enough to make you want to become a skeptic.","post":"Sciencebod brings up an interesting point: I have read in many publications about there supposedly being many shrouds in history. Have any of them survived, I wonder? If so what do they look like? Or is it just conjectured that there were many shrouds due to the “relic industry” of the middle ages?\nIf another shroud exists it would be good to have for comparison even if it was a blatantly bad attempt at relic forgery. It might give folks a sense of how bad or how good such efforts turned out in such times.\n\n","date":"January 17, 2012 at 11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/16/it-is-enough-to-make-you-want-to-become-a-skeptic/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7094","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"It is enough to make you want to become a skeptic.","post":"Chris, check out these:\nhttp://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/Details/copy1.htm\nhttp://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/Details/copy2.htm\nhttp://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/Details/copy3.htm\nhttp://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/Details/copy4.htm\nhttp://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/Details/copy5.htm\nhttp://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/Details/copy6.htm\nDan\n\n","date":"January 17, 2012 at 12:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/16/it-is-enough-to-make-you-want-to-become-a-skeptic/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7098","author":"episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"It is enough to make you want to become a skeptic.","post":"Most of those publications you mention, talk about other Shrouds, however there were and are no other Shrouds, only the Shroud we know as the Shroud of Turin. All the others and I believe there were over 40 of them, were all painted ‘copies’ of the ‘real’ Shroud, as pointed out in Dan’s links. Alot of people misunderstand this, leading to the idea there were many ‘forged’ shrouds out there.\nR\n\n","date":"January 25, 2012 at 2:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/16/it-is-enough-to-make-you-want-to-become-a-skeptic/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7528","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"It is enough to make you want to become a skeptic.","post":"Dan, these are fascinating.
