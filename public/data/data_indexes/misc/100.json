I add that in July the American\nmagazine “The Scientist” has published two articles by Kerry Grens about Kuznetsov. In\nthe first article Grens explains that Kuznetsov has been accused of scientific fraud:\nhttp://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/36299/title/Accused–Fraudster–\nHeads-Two-Journals/\nAs an immediate consequence, Kuznetsov was expelled from his position as chief editor of\ntwo scientific journals, as told by Grens in her second article:\nhttp://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/36441/title/Editor-Quits-After-\nFraud-Allegations/\nThen Kuznetsov has sent three long letters to Grens that are published as comments under\nthe latter article. I am preparing a counter-reply I will add to my page that you have already\nlinked. I will also add a post-2002 biography of Kuznetsov where his amazing career is\ndescribed.\n\n","date":"September 30, 2013 at 10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/30/on-dmitry-a-kuznetsov/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-45920","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Dmitry A. Kuznetsov","post":"Kouznetsov is irrelevant to Shroud studies, he was discarded long ago, so why waste time with him?\n\n","date":"September 30, 2013 at 10:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/30/on-dmitry-a-kuznetsov/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-45921","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Dmitry A. Kuznetsov","post":"Louis: “Why waste time with him?”.
