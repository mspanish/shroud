We have not had a formal opening as yet; but it is nearly ready.  The interior restoration is complete and the exterior is just starting. to be worked on.  I expect completion will be a month or so away.  We had a tornado touch down in the neighborhood; and lost about 15 trees, the clean-up is also nearing completion.  As close as we are, we are not there yet.\nI will let you know,\nRichard\n\n","date":"September 12, 2013 at 9:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/12/the-wabash-shroud-of-turin-museum/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44004","author":"Richard Orareo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Wabash Shroud of Turin Museum","post":"Hi Richard.
