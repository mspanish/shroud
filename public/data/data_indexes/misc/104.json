Donna Campbell also points out the irregularity of the thread spacing in the sample she examined, but rightly attributes this to “the collapse of the yarns at the cut edge.” She also notices a black ‘thread’ which is in fact scarcely thicker than one of the fibres of the linen, which could have been used in stitching.

The tail end makes a good wrapping of several turns and thus prevents fraying of the splice. The\nfibers of the twisting yarn embrace the body of the yarn and thus acts as a belt. This in\nturn gives appearance to the splice.\nTwisting:\nThe two yarn ends comprising the splice are twisted around the body of the yarn, each\nyarn strand twists on the body of the yarn on either side of the middle of the splice. The\ncross-section of this region distinctly shows the fibers of the two yarn strands separately\nwithout any intermingling of the fibers.\nTucking /Intermingling\nThe middle portion of the splice is a region (2-5 mm) with no distinct order.

It’s at this point I too am lost. I think the major problem is the nomenclature used to explain blood,myrrh,iron oxide, blood and etc.\nHeres an excerpt from the HSG archive page.\nIn Dr. Nitowski’s “Conservation report” she writes, “If two different fibers are woven together\ninto a material, linen and cotton as in the Shroud, one may actually contribute to the destruction of the other – the cotton contains starch (as observed by Kohlbeck) that could interact with the dye of a cloth like red silk covering the Shroud during storage”.\nIn another report, Dr. Kohlbeck asked Ray Rogers permission  to remount the sticky tape slides in cargille oil. The oil is used for  better resolution to increases the resolving power of the objective when photographing  the sample slides. Dr. Kohlbeck set aside these slides for over three months and re-examine them. To his astonishment he noticed that the once red particles have now turned black and exude a yellow color. “This certainly could not be iron oxide”, he tells Harold Nelson in a letter. He continues and writes, “Dr. Heller is no doubt right,”?  ” I’m no blood expert but I know the particles are not iron oxide”. \nDr. McCrone writes in “Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud” page 82 on Dec 26 1978, starting with 3-CB a heavy image area, blood from the lance wound using low magnification (10% +10% oli) I could see a heavy crustacean (of blood?) – too red”!  Page 84 on Feb 2 1979 he writes, “I have spent a lot of time looking at the tapes especially the red particles. There are a lot of them and they are definitely inorganic. hundreds of fiber are well-coated with these deep red particles. They are the same particles Pellicori and Evans show in their low power photomicrographs they say this is blood- I say it is an inorganic compound.  In our archives I have more notes written by Dr. McCrone which was not published. ” Dr. McCrone writes  on June 13th 1979, “Sample 3AF (finger image) shows the largest percentage of colored fibre examined it closely the fibers are un-uniform colored over lengths exceeding weave units hence the color is not a surface effect-possible mechanism includes heat or liquid treatment. There are in this sample and others a number of yellow amorphous tubular flaked like a material resin. ( I thought in the part they could be aloes or etc).”\nThe yellow amorphous tubular flaked like material resin was possibly also the same thing Dr. Nitowski saw and was convinced it was Myrrh and aloes just as Dr. McCrone first thought. Steven Schafersman is also correct when he states the madder root was first announced by Dr. McCrone.  This is also confirmed by Paul Maloney, President of ASSIST at a Talk given at the “The Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi-Faceted Enigma” conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14-17th 2008, when he states, “Walter McCrone had sent him in 1981 several Kodak transparencies of photos he took of Shroud linen fibers. “On those slides, (Guild also has them) McCrone had written the following note: madder rose, linen fiber, medium (blue) sample 3 CB” 4 and sample 3-AB. McCrone was referring to photomicrographs made on STURP sticky tape samples 3-CB and 3-AB which came from the blood flow across the back nearest the side-strip side of the Shroud and directly adjacent to that flow on linen, itself. It was on that side where someone would have been working their repairs if the re-weave theory is held to be correct. McCrone, of course, due to his belief that the Shroud was painted by an artist, was trying to prove that the Shroud had been in an artist’s studio.” Source: Maloney, Paul C. “What Went Wrong With the Shroud’s Radiocarbon Date?

Although this is some distance from the\n“Raes Corner” such trace amounts can now be conjectured to explain the dye that was used,\nalong with the aluminum mordant and the gum Arabic as a binder to create the wash to finish the\nre-weave. Thus, it may now be seen not as a contaminant from an artist’s studio, but rather a\ncontaminant from the weaver’s workshop.”\n\n","date":"February 28, 2015 at 10:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-192066","author":"Giorgio HSG","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper","post":"if a proper scientific protocol of disciplined sampling, such as that originally promoted by Chagas, had been followed, there would be no need whatsoever even to discuss this matter; irrespective of whether the samples showed a 14th c. or a 1st century date.

Dreisbach in the link posted by Giorgio on 27 Feb at 10:22 p.m.:\nDear Fr. Dreisbach,\n            Conc. The Turin Shroud\nA few days ago Mr. Remi Van Haelst transmitted to me a copy of your letter of October 30 containing a copy of your letter to Mr. Riggi.  Mr Van Haelst asked me to answer directly to you.\nI will try to clarify as good as possible the situation after (?) the Symposium of Paris.  It is true that in my report of the 1973 I mentioned that I found traces of cotton fibres only in the main body of the Shroud.  I must however add that even for the main body I did not find traces of cotton in all microscopical preparations.  On the other hand, I had only a very small part of the strip added to the main body and I could only make a few microscopical preparations of the fibres of the strip.  We must therefore be very careful with our conclusions.\nIn his contribution of Paris, Prof. Vial suggested that the cotton fibres mentioned in my report could be superficial fibres present on the surface of the Shroud and not belonging to the yarns of the Shroud.  After the Paris meeting I was writing to Prof. Vial telling him that I could not agree with him and that in my opinion the cotton fibres were not superficial fibres.  I proposed to Prof Vial a test allowing to be absolutely sure about the location of the cotton fibres.  I wonder however if it should be possible in practice to perform such a test.  Till [sic] now I did not have any reply of Prof. Vial.  The presence of traces of cotton were confirmed by the sample tested by Oxford for the C-14 datation test.  Prof. Hall found some foreign fibres in his sample identified by a laboratory of Darbyshire as being cotton fibres.  As told in my contribution in Paris we may regret that this laboratory was not able to identify the variety of the cotton fibres by testing the number of reversals as told in my research of 1973.\nI have tried to answer as good as possible the different questions put to Mr. Van Haelst and Riggi.  If there are any other points that you should like to clarify don’t hesitate to call upon me.\n                                                                                            Sincerely yours,\n                                                                                            [signed]\n                                                                                            G.

They had no reason to do that.\nOxford provided some pictures showing that they studied at least one TS thread using an electron microscope.\nThe thread was “as received” (no attempt to study individual fibers) and electron microscopy can not show the characteristic features of cotton fibers.\nNevertheless, Oxford found a ‘rogue fiber’ which has been described later as an ‘old’ cotton fiber by another specialized laboratory.\nI bet that many cotton fibers could have been discovered in this thread.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2015 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-192118","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper","post":"“It was only when I decided to “dissect” meticulously the thread and to separate the fibers that I could see many cotton fibers (10-20% of the fibers).\nYou can’t imagine how difficult it was!
