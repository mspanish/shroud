[{"title":"We walk in the footsteps of giants","post":"Father “Kim” was one of those rare Christians in the realm of Shroud studies, and probably in the world in general, he was even spat upon when marching for civil rights. The article on C.G. Jung and the Turin Shroud published by me was in a way largely the result of his encouragement. Heaven must have had its doors ready and open for his arrival.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2013 at 7:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/19/we-walk-in-the-footsteps-of-giants/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-51995","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"We walk in the footsteps of giants","post":"Louis,\nI would really like a copy of your article. It appears to be relevant to the direction I am heading.\nTeilhard (and the Noosephere) Jung  the collective [sub]consciousness) and MacLuhan (the global village) all relate to each other and I believe implicate the theoretical “universal quantum.” information.” I think they also relate to the Shroud because of the unique position of JC as the bridge between creation and the creator.\nmy E-mail is klotzlaw@gmail.com\n\n","date":"November 19, 2013 at 6:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/19/we-walk-in-the-footsteps-of-giants/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-52058","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"We walk in the footsteps of giants","post":"Me too.

While I too believe that JC is the bridge between creator and creation there are gaps to be filled.\nThe article on C. G. Jung and the TS on the Collegamento pro Sindone website may not help you much, it says more about why he was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church and hung a copy of the Shroud face in his study, behind a small curtain.\nYou may find something you are looking for in the link below, particularly in the introduction.
