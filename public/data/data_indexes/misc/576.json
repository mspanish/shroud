[{"title":"Useful and Fun: The Absolutely Fantastic Shroud Scope Tool","post":"What a superb resource. i wish I’d known about Shroud Scope 6 months ago, instead of 16 hours!\nThere is at least one glitch that needs pointing out. The overlay that delineates major bloodstains on the face in close-up does not correspond with the bloodstains, notably that reversed 3 aka epsilon on the forehead (at least on my Firefox browser).\nBut it’s the profound question mark that these HD close-up images places over so much received wisdom that interests this science bod with far too much time on his hands. Like why are the so-called bloodstains virtually indistinguishable from other image areas, inasmuch as the imprint is largely confined to the crowns of the weave, with virtually none in the intervening furrows. OK, so blood is viscous, but one would have expected at least some to penetrate between parallel threads? Or is it only singed or otherwise denatured blood that is imaged, which would contradict Rogers’ claim (which I have always regarded as highly dubious) namely that the bloodstains show no evidence of heat-damage (based on a curious, some might say idiosyncratic measure of hydroxyproline context). (The meat industry uses HP content as a test for heated meat, i.e. muscle tissue, which is rich in HP mainly on account of its connective content, but there is virtually no HP in blood, the little that is present being a degradation product of collagen and other connective tissue proteins).\nI now find myself wondering about the key claim that the blood was transferred to the fabric before the image. How reliable is the evidence on which that view is founded? I see from an oft-cited 2004 Rogers paper that he bases his blood-first view on a simple spot test in which he applied proteolytic enzymes to the blood stains, and found that removing the stain revealed/uncovered/exposed no image under the stain. That does not strike me as conclusive evidence for anything, certainly not for a major claim re the bloodstains. I shall obviously have to dig deeper, but if in the meantime anyone knows of better evidence than a single spot test with protein-digesting enzyme, then I’d be grateful for a link. Thanks.\n\n","date":"June 10, 2012 at 6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/10/useful-and-fun-the-absolutely-fantastic-shroud-scope-tool/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-12133","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Useful and Fun: The Absolutely Fantastic Shroud Scope Tool","post":"Thanks Dan.

Or maybe if you were suffering from Jondice, before you drew blood? Otherwise, your blood on linen experiment is basically worthless…Thats just to start….Two; I don’t know how you can say the blood is only on the crowns of the threads, it seems and looks to me like much of the blood in the image you linked too above is in the furrows, maybe some on the crowns, but mostly in the furrows. I think it would be expected that over the centuries alot of the blood traces on the crowns could have been lost due to the innumerable times it has been folded, or rolled up and unfurled.

Do you still think there is anything different between the image of a “bloodstain” and that of other facial features (notably skin and hair)?  Remember – it is received wisdom that the faint sepia image of the face and other bodily features, including hair, resides primarily on the crowns of fibres, rather than furrows between fibres.
