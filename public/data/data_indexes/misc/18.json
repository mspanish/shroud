[{"title":"Answering Charges of Pseudoscience, Bias and More","post":"I find Barrie Schwortz’s defense against religious bias incredulous.  Mentioning the religious representation on the team he says, “Never mind that our team included three Jewish members (Al Adler, Don Devan and me), one Mormon, one Evangelical, several Catholics, several Protestants and some avowed atheists and agnostics.”  Notably absent on the team is the Buddhist Master.  No matter, I guess, that Buddhists (and Hindu’s) have been vanishing from planet earth in a blast of radiation, all well documented, for thousands of years. It is a foundational article of their beliefs. The last incident occurred in September, 1998 and was thoroughly investigated and found authentic by the Catholic Church. \nThe Buddhists have much to add in the matter of image formation yet the “team” steadfastly avoids soliciting their input.  What is wrong with this picture?\n\n","date":"June 8, 2014 at 8:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/08/answering-charges-of-pseudoscience-bias-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-127749","author":"Tom Devins","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Answering Charges of Pseudoscience, Bias and More","post":"“The last incident occurred in September, 1998 and was thoroughly investigated and found authentic by the Catholic Church.” No, of course it wasn’t.

If any of the scientists selected happened to have had an affiliation to Buddhism, that would merely have been incidental to his/her selection.  There was no steadfastly avoiding soliciting Buddhist input at all, and furthermore there was no steadfastly soliciting a breadth of any kind of other religious affiliation, it just happened that way!\n\n","date":"June 8, 2014 at 4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/08/answering-charges-of-pseudoscience-bias-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-127808","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Answering Charges of Pseudoscience, Bias and More","post":"There was obviously no pseudoscience involved in STURP research, the team members did the best they could.\nSo now the complaint is that no Buddhists were involved?

They took vital evidence in their samples from the Shroud, vital above all because these samples were taken from a number of different areas of the cloth. Ideally they should have been returned to Turin after analysis so that they remained there for future research. If not they should have been kept as an archive in museum conditions with controlled access for scholars  but never dispersed as they appear to have been. I have shown one or two  ‘expert’ friends parts of STURP reports and have been told that some of the problems of the Shroud reported by STURP could be quickly resolved by a 2014  lab.\nIt is not difficult to relate the Shroud to the various ancient and medieval looms of which we have evidence. Some,for instance, would not have been able to weave a cloth of this length but as STURP had no ancient textile expert in their team this was never considered.\nAgain there was no expert on medieval linen painting and the STURP physics and chemistry report specifically says that this area was not considered. Whether there are brush strokes on  a printed linen depends on how liquid the paint mix was when applied, the more liquid the more likely it would settle without marks before it dried. In fact, conservation labs learn about the paint on a linen by seeing whether there are brush marks or not and from this they understand the formulation of the original mix. So absence of brush marks does not mean that the linen was not originally painted ( but, of course, it does not mean that it was!) -again an expert would have known this.\nSo let’s give STURP credit where it is due but note that science does not stand still and reports from 1978 have diminishing value. The team missed a lot of opportunities by not having a full range of experts in weaving and painted  medieval linens. These do exist and could well provide valuable comparative material. Again one cannot give STURP many good marks if they have not preserved their valuable samples intact and together somewhere so that more sophisticated technology can be applied to them. Whatever McCrone’s problems he was able to make a comparative study of samples – is this still possible?\n\n","date":"June 10, 2014 at 4:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/08/answering-charges-of-pseudoscience-bias-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-128281","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"}]
