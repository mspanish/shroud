[{"title":"JREF, Catholics Answers and the like","post":"The fact that JREF has so many participants is an indication of why the Shroud, this blog and Shroud.com are so important. “JR” is James Randy, renowned skeptic who has been cited by Richard Dawkins of God Delusion fame as source for proving all paranormal claims are a hoax.\nThe authenticity of the Shroud is a profoundly important issue in dealing with the accelerating decline of religion in our time. The professional atheists even cast doubt on the issue of whether Christ existed at all.\nSmear me as a believer if you like, but like a lot of people, there came a moment when reviewing the factual information presented by the Shroud, I for the first time, really perceived (but thankfully did not feel) the reality of the Crucifixion and the agony Christ endured.\nThat I believe in the authenticity of the Shroud does not disqualify me from having an opinion about the authenticity, as some skeptics think. My conclusion is based on my legal training and the principles of evidence used everyday in courts around the world.

Even with all the evidence at hand they will not ever capitulate. Richard you will learn nothing by discussing on that forum, your time would be much better spent reading documents found at shroud.com. Scientific and otherwise. Just trying to understand the scientific documents will send you on various tangents of knowledge and allow you to understand the evidence that exists (at present) much better.
