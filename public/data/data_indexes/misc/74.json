It’s another myth that the male dominated Catholic Church promotes.  Penelope Jamieson was the seventh Anglican Bishop of Dunedin, appointed in 1989 until her retirement in 2004.  She was as effective a bishop as any of her male colleagues, and made no fewer useful Christian statements in the Press than her male colleagues in NZ ever did,  Current Anglican Bishop of Christchurch (centre of a traditional dominantly Anglican province) is Victoria Matthews from Edmonton in Canada, who is working effectively in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake, including decisions on the notable Christchurch Cathedral, an important heritage building in NZ, seriously damaged in the earthquake.  My neighbouring Anglican pastor is a lady pastor who works in with my own Parish clergy at Our Lady of Fatima Parish in Tawa, and is prominent in civic Anzac Day services.  We have observed combined services with the Anglicans on Ash Wednesday and are soon to have a combined Advent service.  No problem!  The Tawa Union parish (Presbyterian, Church of Christ etc) has a lady pastor, who is also effective.  \nAs for disenchanted Anglicans joining the Catholic Church, all that will do is make it even more conservative than it is already!  \nDeaconesses were appointed in the early Christian Church, check the Acts of the Apostles, and despite what St Paul has to say about preferring women to be silent in Church, women were still prominent in his ministry.  Mary Magdalen was very likely a prominent missionary in the early church, but the cultural milieu of the time was reluctant to acknowledge it, to the point of suppressing it.  As for whomever Jesus may or may not have ordained, we are not told in the gospels.  Doubtless He may well have had to take into account the dominantly male culture of the time and place. \nThere are clearly certain advantages in living at the ends of the earth,  Did I mention that my own parish has some some excellent altar girls, very reverent and who know and practice their duties well, and also several excellent lady lectors?\n\n","date":"November 15, 2012 at 11:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19096","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"Actually Dave, there are several problems with your post here that need direct response.\n1) there is no myth of the male dominated church.

My view cannot be classified as conservative or liberal which really misses the point, but if it needs a classification, it ought to be called in line with Tradition and practice of the Church over nearly 2000 years.

All the Apostles were probably married…   \nSo, following my argumentation Andy, I ask you the question: Do you agree with me that it’s about time that the Church let the priest free to decide whether they want to get married or not ???\nJesus never ordained women simply because women in his patriarcal society were considered on the same level than a dog (and this is not a joke!).  THIS IS THE HISTORIC TRUTH !  How in the world he could have taken a women in the group of the twelves ?  Never !  As I said, he would have been stone to death in Galilea on the first day and would never have reached Jerusalem !!!  This argument of yours Andy (which is the official argument of the Vatican that I have heard many times) is not fair at all for women because it does not take account of the historical context of Jesus time.  Sad to say but it’s an argument of men FOR men.  You would rarely see a free women agreeing with such an argument !\nBut the main thing to understand is that such a question only concern the discipline inside the Church. In the end, it’s not that important because this is not what’s at the heart of Jesus message, which is : 1- Love God and 2- Love every humans.  Sticking too much on these disciplinary questions while not allowing any possibility of change can make people look like the Pharisees of Jesus time (i.e. close-minded people who preferred to follow the human tradition instead of God’s law, which is the law of LOVE and MERCY best described in the Sermon of the mount) and this closeness of mind is exactly what Christ has denonciate the most during his lifetime !\nAnd the fact is this : all those questions of disciple are free to EVOLVE with the evolution of mentality (I prefer to say “with the evolution of our humanity”) !!!  It’s wrong to think that all these questions are stuck in concrete and could never change !!!!  Remember that contesting the authority and the discipline of his Jewish religion was at the heart ofJesus message… \nAnd here’s the most important thing:  Once you put love into your reflection, things become very clear !  With the eyes of love, I think it becomes evident that there is no good reason why Women should not be ordained…  And here’s my main argument in favor of such a thing: THERE ARE WOMEN WHO RECEIVE THE CALL FOR PRIESTHOOD !!!!  Andy, don’t you understand that this is a sign from the Holy Spirit that it is about time that the Church allow the ordination of women  ???\nAnd this is the same thing with the marriage of priests.  It is about time that the Church allow the freedom of choice !  This is untrue that all the priest are also called for celibacy…  One don’t necessarily goes with the other.\nI’m truly confident that one day (maybe not far from us) a new Pope (certainly not Benedict !!!) will make a great reform in the Church concerning all those disciplinary question that are truly secondary versus what’s at the heart of Jesus message.  I’ll end my comment with this important truth:  Believing that Jesus was the Son of God who revealed the true God of Love and Mercy is what makes us Christians, not our personal opinion on some disciplinary questions…\n\n","date":"November 17, 2012 at 5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19161","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"Although recent popes have been quite firm in their pronouncements concerning the Roman Catholic priesthood being a male prerogative, and have mustered various arguments ins support of this, I am not aware that this has been promulgated as an “ex cathedra” infallible statement requiring the assent of Roman Catholics under pain of mortal sin. \nOne can muster several examples where “official statements” of conservative positions once firmly held, have been modified over the course of time.  One does not have to go back to the case of Galileo to find such examples.  One simple case is in the Church’s attitude to the faithfuls’ study of Holy Scripture.  From the various Tridentine anathemas, there was a singular breakthrough in Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical Providentissumus Deus of 1893.  Breakthrough though it was, Pope Leo’s encyclical today still looks quaintly cautious.  Pius XII’s “Divino Afflante Spiritu” of 1943, addressed to all, gave further impetus to the promotion of Biblical studies.  The Vatican II document “Verbum Dei” on divine revelation bears little relationship to the counter-reformation Tridentine position.  The Pontifical Academy of Biblical Studies comes lately to their subject compared to Teutonic Protestant studies, but very likely have now surpassed them.  \nThere has been a similar evolution in doctrine concerning human reproduction from the more recent time.of Pius XII’s “Humani Generis” as recently as 1950.  \nI maintain that the Church’s present position on a solely male priesthood.is more likely based on certain anthropological considerations, than on any theological position,  Even today, many traditional patriarchally based societies would find a female priesthood difficult to accept.  One partiular difficulty is the tradition of certain pre-Christian religions in associating female roles in worship to that of temple prostitution.  However that tradition has no palce in cosideration of a proper role in the Christian priesthood.  St Paul’s Galations 3:28 makes it clear that there is to be no distinction between male and female, Jew or Gentile, freeman or slave, etc, but all are one in Christ, without distinction. \nI consider that it will only be a matter of time, and further development of doctrine, before we will eventually see an evolution towards acceptance of a female Roman Catholic priesthood, in those societies where it may be found acceptable.\n\n","date":"November 17, 2012 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19159","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"This is from the new story below I referenced with the Church speaking: “The letter also cited his “diffusion of teachings” opposed to the “definitive teaching of John Paul II and the Magisterium of the Catholic Church as well as the “grave scandal” he has caused to the people of God, to the Church, and to many Maryknoll priests and brothers.”\nThere doesn’t have to be an ex-cathedra statement for this to be normative for Catholics.

The formulae of the words the evangelists put into His mouth very likely come from an early liturgical practice of the first Christians.  We do not know who else was or was not present,apart from the apostles.  Obviously someone had to set out the table and clean up afterrwards, and we can easily guess what gender they probably were.  It is not unreasonable that both Mary his mother, Mary Magdalen, and possibly other women were also present.  Being women, the evangelists would see no need to mention them. \nAfter the Resurrection and before His Ascension, He bresthes on them so they receive the Holy Spirit and He imparts the power to forgive sins.  Again we do not know who was present apart from the Apostles.  I suggest that in these cases, the evangelists silence is  insufficient to assert that any others were absent. \nThe Apostles’ laying on of hands to effect ordination is recorded in the Acts.  \nThe cultural attitude towards women can easily be adduced from a commentary by John Gill in relation to Gal 3:28: \n“The apostle’s design is to show the common right of believers, of every nation, condition, and sex, and to encourage the Gentiles, and demolish the pride, vanity, and boasting of the Jews, their men especially, who valued themselves upon these “three” very things which the apostle here makes no account of; as that they were Israelites and not Gentiles, freemen and not servants, men and not women; and in their public prayers they give thanks to God in this form,”\n“blessed be the Lord our God, the King of the world, that he hath made me an Israelite; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a Gentile; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a “servant”; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a “woman”;”\ninstead of which last the woman say: “blessed be the Lord who hath made me as he pleased”  \nGill’s commentary, illustrates well the cultural attitude of male Jews towards women, and in my view goes a long way to explaining the evangelists’ and others’ silence about their roles in the early church, Jewish Christians in particular. Paul demonstrates a slightly more enlightened attitude.   I maintain that these are an inadequate reason for the Church in the 21st century to maintain a similar attitude.

Thanks for that clarity.\nThere’s no doubt doctrine evolves.  I would challenge you though on this issue because never has a woman been ordained in the history of the Church.  I have read some (not all) of the anathemas from Trent.

Don’t you think there is a sign there ?\nAnd don’t forget that it was as much impossible to Jesus to “ordained” some women after his Resurrection as it was before he died because the time was still no good at all for this kind of drastic change that would never have been accepted by the Jewish people of that era !\nAnd I still wait for someone to challenge my main argument :  IT IS A FACT THAT SOME WOMEN HAVE RECEIVED A CALL FOR PRIESTHOOD JUST LIKE MEN !!!  Don’t you think this is another great sign of the Holy Spirit ?  If God really wanted to keep women out of priesthood, don’t you think it would be logical to expect that no women would get a call from him ???  But that’s NOT the reality.  The truth is the opposite.  There really are some Catholic women who are called for priesthood !  And I don’t see one good reason to reject their call…\n\nYannick, Yes, I understand all that but my point is that the argument that He feared stoning is exceedingly weak. The same Jesus that was bold enough to tell the priests of the time that whores will enter the Kingdom of Heaven before them, tell them that they are a brood of vipers, smash their monopoly in the Temple market place by physically over-turning the tables and avoid, at Will, their attempts to arrest Him before the appointed time is not likely to be suddenly timid on the subject of ordaining women. Also, Jesus didn’t hesitate to raise the status of women to that of men when he told the priests and men of the time that they could no longer divorce women at will like a piece of mere chattel. \nI am not arguing either way only pointing out that the arguments being employed are untenable. Better arguments must be pursued. \nI find it also rather contradictory the attitude that it is ambiguous that Jesus actually ordained anyone versus the conviction that female ordination is absolutely what Jesus would desire. Again not arguing either way it’s just untenable to hold both views at the same time. Of course, if one held the view that no one is “ordained” only “called to serve” and that there is nothing conferred with Holy Orders/ordination it might be more consistent in some ways but it also begs the question of why should anyone care about ordination at all? Why even bother to expend any effort on this issue at all? Folks can just go and do what they feel is in their hearts (and many have) and ignore the hierarchy of the Church.\nMy suggestion is that a strong legitimizing argument is only going to be found in the Traditions of the Communities in the early Church. More research may need to be done in order to establish this. Everything else is speculation and projection and more importantly will not win converts.\nMore importantly, this attitude amongst some Christians, with regards to this issue, of ‘I am right, you are wrong’, ‘it’s my way or the highway’, ‘you’re not evolved’ etc etc etc is not productive in fostering relationships among us. No one is willing to entertain “what if my point of view is actually wrong on this issue?” That’s a problem for both sides. \nIs it not more important that we, above all, love one another even in the faults we see in one another? Yes, to me, it’s more important to learn to love like Him because it is in learning to love like that in this life, which is incredibly short in the vastness of eternity, which connects us to the Divine Love of the Risen Christ which in turn rescues us from our temporal condition. Beating each other up over political issues like this cannot get us closer to that and therefore cannot get us closer to Him.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2012 at 11:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19238","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"The main argument of the traditional (orthodox – right wing) branch of the Catholic Church to keep women out of priesthood come from the theological idea that a priest is the official representative of Jesus Christ on Earth and since Jesus was a man, only men should be ordained as priests.\nTo me, this argument doesn’t include “the vision of Love” which should always be at the heart of any decision made by the Church (and we know very well from history that it has not been always the case and that’s an euphemism!!!).  \nOnce you put the eyes of love to take a decision concerning who can be priest and who can not, the truth impose rapidly to you :  ANY BAPTISED PERSON (WHETHER A MALE OR A FEMALE) SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE PRIEST IF HE OR SHE RECEIVED THE CALL TO DO SO FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT !!!!!  To me, it is as simple as that because as I said in my first comment on this topic, I truly believe that God never do any difference between a man and a women and for him, we’re just his children, period.  And before being a guy and more importantly than this, Jesus of Nazareth was a HUMAN BEING !!!!  And because he truly was a human being like anyone of us (the Shroud is the best “proof” of this), then why the Church stop half of his children (the women, who are by the way also human beings!!!!) to go into priesthood when some of them really receive a call from the Holy Spirit to do so ???  I think this is truly a bad decision and a way to put a hold on an important part of God’s plan for humanity.  But as I also said :  I truly believe that one day, a new liberal Pope will do the job that the others didn’t wanted to do concerning the welcome of women into priesthood.\nIf the priest is supposed to be the official representative of Jesus on Earth during the Mass, I don’t see any good reason why that person could not be a women because the bottom line of this is that Jesus was a HUMAN BEING well before being a man…  And as St Paul once wrote:  There are no men and women no more, there are no slaves and free men no more, etc., etc.  In the eyes of God, there are only sick and sinner’s children who need MERCY.  And we’re lucky enough that God’s real name is LOVE AND MERCY !!!  And that was fully revealed on the cross and the Shroud is the imprint of that great moment of APOCALYPSE (REVELATION) !!!  \nMeditate on that folks and please, look at it with the eyes of LOVE !\n\n","date":"November 20, 2012 at 4:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19257","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"That is hardly the main or the only argument in favor of the Church’s teaching on ordination, Yannick.  You are barking up the wrong tree.  This is an error of reason: assign a fallacious argument to the other side and then show how the argument is filled with holes.  That’s not very convincing to anyone except yourself and those who have already made up their minds without listening to the Church who does have the authority to state the teaching.  Ironic.  We could easily trace the barring of women’s ordination to the priesthood back to the fall of Eve and go from there.  \nThere’s no doubt Jesus was a human being – a MALE human being.  God chose to incarnate himself as a man, not a woman.  This is quite telling.  The Holy Spirit cannot contradict Church teaching on ordination or any other subject, Yannick, for the Church is guarded against error on faith and morals.  This subject most certainly fits into these categories.  Your statements show a serious lack of knowledge of Church teaching and how the Church works.  Attempting to ‘do church’ from a secular viewpoint leads one somewhere the Church will not go, your opinion notwithstanding.\nThere are obviously men and women and both are different and complementary – this is a misuse of Paul’s statement which had nothing to do with roles in the Church.  Your arguments are secular in nature and fall far short of really addressing the issue of ordination.  Perhaps it doesn’t matter to you that the Church has never ordained women, but the constant practice of the Church is a major contributor to this teaching.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2012 at 9:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19270","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"The Catholic and Orthodox Churches are Apostolic Churches, which is not the case with the Anglican Church.

All the Apostles were probably married…\nSo, following my argumentation Andy, I ask you the question: Do you agree with me that it’s about time that the Church let the priest free to decide whether they want to get married or not ???\nThat’s a false statement, Yannick.  Read the following which shows clearly how the requirement of celibacy was from the times of Paul or before: The Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy by Christian Cochini, SJ (doctor of tehology and taught in many univeristies) & Celibacy in the Church: The Beginnings of a Discipline of Obligatory Continence for Clerics in East and West by Stefan Heid (German theologian consulted by the German bishops on many occasions).\nJesus never ordained women simply because women in his patriarcal society were considered on the same level than a dog (and this is not a joke!).  THIS IS THE HISTORIC TRUTH !  How in the world he could have taken a women in the group of the twelves ?  Never !  As I said, he would have been stone to death in Galilea on the first day and would never have reached Jerusalem !!!  This argument of yours Andy (which is the official argument of the Vatican that I have heard many times) is not fair at all for women because it does not take account of the historical context of Jesus time.  Sad to say but it’s an argument of men FOR men.  You would rarely see a free women agreeing with such an argument !\nRefusal to accept teaching of the Church means you are choosing to be outside the Church, my brother.  Why would you choose this?\nBut the main thing to understand is that such a question only concern the discipline inside the Church. In the end, it’s not that important because this is not what’s at the heart of Jesus message, which is : 1- Love God and 2- Love every humans.  Sticking too much on these disciplinary questions while not allowing any possibility of change can make people look like the Pharisees of Jesus time (i.e. close-minded people who preferred to follow the human tradition instead of God’s law, which is the law of LOVE and MERCY best described in the Sermon of the mount) and this closeness of mind is exactly what Christ has denonciate the most during his lifetime !\nAnd the fact is this : all those questions of disciple are free to EVOLVE with the evolution of mentality (I prefer to say “with the evolution of our humanity”) !!!  It’s wrong to think that all these questions are stuck in concrete and could never change !!!!  Remember that contesting the authority and the discipline of his Jewish religion was at the heart ofJesus message… \nLet’s evolve and stop thinking entirely and do whatever we want.  That is the thrust of your argument, my friend.\nAnd here’s the most important thing:  Once you put love into your reflection, things become very clear !  With the eyes of love, I think it becomes evident that there is no good reason why Women should not be ordained…  And here’s my main argument in favor of such a thing: THERE ARE WOMEN WHO RECEIVE THE CALL FOR PRIESTHOOD !!!!  Andy, don’t you understand that this is a sign from the Holy Spirit that it is about time that the Church allow the ordination of women  ???\nDo you mean aside from the fact that the Church which does have the authority to teach on faith and morals without error (there does not need to be an ex-cathedra statement) teaches the contrary of what you are stating here?  This is the Traditional and Scriptural truth for the Church is the ground and bulwark of truth.  Women cannot receive the call to priesthood because by definition, the very Church you claim needs to ordain women teaches this is not possible.  These views are nonsense for Catholics.\nAnd this is the same thing with the marriage of priests.  It is about time that the Church allow the freedom of choice !  This is untrue that all the priest are also called for celibacy…  One don’t necessarily goes with the other.\nI’m truly confident that one day (maybe not far from us) a new Pope (certainly not Benedict !!!) will make a great reform in the Church concerning all those disciplinary question that are truly secondary versus what’s at the heart of Jesus message.  I’ll end my comment with this important truth:  Believing that Jesus was the Son of God who revealed the true God of Love and Mercy is what makes us Christians, not our personal opinion on some disciplinary questions…\n\nMarried priests is a discipline of some of the Eastern Churches in union with the Pope and there is no issue with it.  But the fact remains as the two authors to which I refer above, celibacy was established very early in the Church.  May have this mistaken notion which is a pipe dream, not reality.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2012 at 9:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19276","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"Tues, Nov 22, 8:48 am, EST;  “General Synod of the Church of England voted narrowly to reject a compromise proposal that would have allowed women to become bishops. The vote keeps the British church offside many other Anglican churches worldwide, including Canada, where women have been bishops since 1993.” Globe & Mail web-site.  \nMotion won required two-thirds majority in two groups – Bishops and House of Clergy – but failed by six votes among laity.  Proposition cannot be considered again until 2015.  \nNot only have women been bishops in Canada and elsewhere since 1993, but there have also been two women Anglican bishops in NZ, my earlier posting noted above.  \nConcerning apostolic succession debate above (Dan & Andy).  The Anglican Church traces its succession of the Archbisop of Canterbury back to its first bishop, St Augustine of Canterbury.  The Anglican Church in its history, has faced many conflicts between the Archbishop and Monarch in its history, including for example Thomas a Becket, and even Cardinal Wolsely vs Henry VIII.  – there have been others.  The last mentioned when Henry set himself as the Head of the Church in England resulted in a break with Rome. \nFollowing the Oxford movement in the 19th century, an attempt was made at rapprochement, when the validity of Anglican orders was examined in Rome.  The decision given by Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical Apostolicae Curae, was that during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and afterwards, there was a clear decision not to ordain priests for the purposes of consecrating the eucharist as practised in both the Roman and Eastern Orthodox churches.  It was considered that this constituted a break in the apostolic succession.  Very many examples could be given of the hunting down and execution of Roman Catholic priests, who deigned to celebrate Mass in various houses of the aristocracy many of whom still clung to the old religion.  By the time the Anglican Church resumed an acceptable FORM of the eucharist, it was considered that there were then no longer any validly consecrated Anglican bishops who had apostolic powers to ordain.  \nThe situation has since been further complicated by a number of Anglican bishops being consecrated by validly ordained Orthodox bishops as part of the consecrating group.  \nThe situation is therefore very much more complicated than Andy Weiss has asserted.  We can all hope and pray that there may come a time when both the Roman and Anglican churches may once again be in communion.  \nI note from the Globe & Mail posting mentioned above, that there are 3500 women Anglican priests worldwide.  Concerning Andy’s assertion that the arguments for women priests are entirely secular, I consider that the biblical text of Galatians 3:28 is a persuasive scriptural argument otherwise.  The tradition of a male priesthood I continue to maintain is based more on anthropogy that theology.  The argument that Christ was a male, is a specious argument at best.  A similar aversion to women in all sorts of professions has been  tradition in many male bastions, even mathematics.  One should read up on the histories of Hypatia, and Sophie Germaine to see the true source of male objections to women in such occupations.  Emmy Noether in the 1930s was considered by Albert Einstein to be the most significant mathematician since Isaac Newton.  Later generations, light years from now, might even see a female Pope!\n\n","date":"November 20, 2012 at 10:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19280","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"Correction: “The tradition of a male priesthood I continue to maintain is based more on anthropology that theology.”\nFor Christ to become human, he HAD to be either male OR female.

Henry himself preferred to maintain the English Church as Catholic rather than Protestant.  Edward VI succeeded Henry in 1547 but died in 1553. The accession of Mary (C of Aragon’s daughter) resulted in a Catholic reaction against Cromwell, and he was eventually stripped of his ecclesiastical titles and executed for heresy.  Mary’s strenuous attempts to restore the Catholicism of the English Church together with Cardinal Pole, was short-lived with the accession of Elizabeth,  The Church under Elizabeth went down the Protestant road, as originally envisaged by Cranmer.  It was this Protestantising of the English Church which resulted in Pope Leo XIII’s finding that Anglican orders were invalid.

Ordination of women is not to considered a valid option in the present church today.  However it has not been taught as an infallible doctrine of revelation and has not been issued as an “ex cathedra” doctrine.  Therefore, although it requires external observancy, I maintain that the issue may be intelligently debated, without necessarily falling into error.  It is not on the same level as for example questioning the divinity of Christ, which necessarily requires an internal assent to remain within the church. \n(2)  It is the tradition of the church that only men may be ordained, and therefore can never become a valid option!\nResponse:  Not all traditions of the church are immutable.  I maintain that this tradition is based on a human cultural tradition that subordinated women to men, as an anthropological phenomenon, and that the tradition has no sound basis in theology. Therefore this tradition may not be immutable.  \n(3) Christ chose the option to become a male human, and therefore only male priests can be true representatives of Christ in their priestly ministry.\nResponse:  In order to become fully human, the Son of God had to choose to become either male or female.  He might have chosen to become androidal or hermaphrodite, but then it would be argued that he would not be fully human, and that would be in error.  The cultural environment of 1st century Palestine demanded that he become male.  A woman in 1st century Palesine would be incapable of being any kind of religius leader, let alone even a rabbi.\nSt Paul’s teaching in Gal 3:28, shows that all are to be admitted to the life in Christ, that there is no more “male nor female”.  Here he is teaching theology.  Paul’s teaching concerning other female roles, his preference that they be silent in the assembly, that their heads be covered, are in the nature of discipline and are not of a theological nature. \n(4)  Christ never ordained women as part of his commissioning!\nResponse:  The gospels, written by men, record that Jesus called men to become his disciples.  Nevertheless, his attitude towards women was revolutionary in the extreme.  He debates with the Samaritan woman at the well, unheard of!  He defends the woman taken in adultery, discerns the men’s holtile motives, and prevents her being stoned, unheard of!  He allows a highly suspect woman to anoint his feet, over the Pharisees’ objections, unhear of!.\nHe commissions those at the Last Supper to observe his actions over the bread and wine as a memorial.  It is quite likely that women were also present, very likely in a subservient role as befitted their station in that cultural environment.  There were women at the foot of the cross after all the men had fled, with the sole exception of the disciple whom Jesus loved.  After his resurrection he imparts the power to forgive sins.  The gospels are silent on whether women were so commissioned or not, but if they were it is unlikely that the evangelists would make a point of saying so.  Women are present in the upper room when he presents himself as resurrected, and also when the Holy Spirit descends on those present at Pentecost.  He commsissions all to go forth and teach all nations his commandments. (He never said, “But don’t ordain any women!”)   It is Mary of Magdalen whom He first reveals himself as surviving the grave. \n(5)  John Bourgeous was disciplined for simulating the ordination of a woman, and this demonstrates the teaching of the church that women may not be ordained!\nResponse: I have discussed this at some length above.  Bourgeous was quite properly disciplined for this act of defiance against his superiors.  It still does not follow that this teaching is immutable. \nConclusion:  I await with some expectation that some other sound theological reason might be discovered, for prohibiting the ordination of women.  However I suspect that any such will be no less specious than those I have discussed above.\n\n","date":"November 21, 2012 at 8:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19321","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"This is a good summary and shows the weakness of your position.  I sill summarize your positions and provide responses.\n1) The teaching of the magisterium on this issue is not infallible and therefore open to discussion.\nResponse: We are required to hold the ordinary and extraordinary magisterial teachings of the Church.  The Vatican letter in reference to the recent removal of  John Bourgeous makes clear John Paul II gave definitive teaching on the subject in his letter. As such, one cannot validly dissent or hold a position other than this one.\n2) Not all traditions are immutable and therefore this one can change.\nResponse: As definitive teaching, this is not changeable. \n3) Christ chose to be male because it was the only way for him to exercise a ministry in the culture, otherwise he could have chosen either, so this is solely culturally conditioned (Gal 3:28).\nResponse: God knows all things and yet chose to come as a man, not a woman.  Jesus was not culturally bound which you have demonstrated well in showing how he broke with many Jewish restrictions.  This actually weakens your case and supports the fact that the choice to choose male disciples and following to ordain them to ministry (aforementioned breathing and giving the power to forgive sins only recorded to be given to the 11 & Matt 28:18-20 ‘teach all nations. baptizing…’).  Obviously this has nothing to do with cultural conditioning and has to do with the choice of the Son of God.  Your use of Gal 3:28 is arbitrary since the passage is not referring to any ordained ministry in the Church, but rather is general in scope and intent, \n4) Because the gospels were written by men and only record men being disciples, therefore this is biased and ought to be dismissed.  Further, Jesus has many interactions with women that broke with the norm and there are instances in Scripture where it might be implied that women were there.\nResponse: A charge that there was male bias has no grounds to substantiate itself and Gal 3:28 disproves the presumption.\nJesus interactions with women prove that what Jesus did was not culturally conditioned and actually disproves your point.  \nThe insinuation that when women are not mentioned that they are most likely there is an error called argument from silence.  This is not a valid point and will be completely disregarded and not considered again.  This a fantasy, flimsy as ever to support your desired notion that women ought to be ordained.  Any knowledgeable Catholic is aware the constant practice of the Church makes it unthinkable to question or change this practice.  It is well known that no woman has ever been ordained in the Catholic Church for any purpose.  This can also be seen in practice in the case of abortion, artificial means of contraception and many others.\n5)  John Bourgeous was disciplined and this does not support the immutability of this teaching.\nResponse: I agree, but I never made that point (straw man).  I refer you to the letter from the Vatican claiming [his “diffusion of teachings” opposed to the “definitive teaching of John Paul II and the Magisterium of the Catholic Church” as well as the “grave scandal” he has caused].  It is this definitive teaching to which I refer.  Definitive is as it states, nothing more and nothing less.\n\n","date":"November 21, 2012 at 11:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19331","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"David: I can’t devote much time time to this topic, but it seems that the Catholic clergymen who were not hanged, drawn and quartered continued the apostolic succession in England.

What makes us Christian is we were baptized and continue to strive to life a Christian life in imitation of Jesus.  Through Baptism we enter into the Body of Christ and through our perseverance we follow Christ to the end in charity.  \nI have demonstrated in this exchange throughout that Christ both before and after the resurrection did not fail to choose women for ordained ministry because of some societal norms or issues, but rather because it was not his plan as God.  I have stated that men and women have equal but differing roles in the Church and society.  I have argued from historical practice, Scripture and magisterial teaching on the issue to show how your position does not have a leg to stand upon.  I have researched this and read books by experts in the field of which I have referenced a couple in the thread.  Furthermore, when the Anglican Church was considering this novelty in the 1970s, they asked for the opinion of Pope Paul VI who wrote this was not a possibility. Pope John Paul II wrote eloquently and definitively on the issue.  Both were extremely clear on this issue and if you are interested you can download and read both of them from the Vatican or other websites.  \nAfter all my research and reading over the years, all you can come to me with this unsupported, circular reasoning: “it doesn’t go against the wishes of the Risen Christ because his Holy Spirit is really calling some Christian women to be priest.”   Let me get this right and correct me if I am misstating your position.  It doesn’t go against the wishes of the risen Christ because of an unsupported claim – God is calling women to the priesthood!  Does the magisterium agree with your opinion?  No.  Do you have any Scriptural support for your view?  No!  Do you have any previous practice of the Church to support your opinion?  No.  It’s true because you have stated it!  \nThen you make the biggest blunders in all your unsupported statements: “the Holy Spirit know very well that it would have been TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE in the first century A.D.”  You further state this is the ONLY reason women were not chosen by God sooner.  This is a ludicrous statement because of the Scriptural injunction: “with God all things are possible.”  If nothing is impossible for God, in what way is this impossible for God.  In light of this Scriptural rule (God is the Creator and can do as he pleases), in what way would it be impossible for God not to call women to a leading role in the Church?  And this is ONLY reason, you say?  You provide no support for your unsubstantiated statement because there is none.  \nIn light of your failure to support any statement you have made, I ask this of you: either support your opinions or just stop arguing and state you believe it no matter the evidence that contradicts the veracity of your claim.  In light of your lack of support for Church practice and teaching, it would seem your disagreement with the Church is a dangerous opinion for you to take.  It’s not dangerous in and of itself, but if this is how you figure out whom to believe, what other teachings of the Church do you so carelessly disregard?  I do not ask to shame you, but out of concern for your welfare, my friend.  \nI ask you to consider the evidence and consider upon what rests your opinion.  I have considered the basis from which my belief on the issue comes and have attempted to state it clearly.  If you pin your hopes on Gal 3:28 (I realize this is not your argument) which has nothing to do with the liturgical practice, you will have to take into consideration the other of Paul’s statements in which he does limit the participation of women in liturgy.  \nGodspeed,\nAndy\n\n","date":"November 26, 2012 at 10:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19530","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"Just want to complete one of my statement : That’s the only reason why Jesus didn’t “ordained” (I hate this word) SOME WOMEN before or even after his resurrection Andy…  \nNow that’s more clear.\n\n","date":"November 25, 2012 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19499","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion","post":"David : This topic needs a lot more discussion and hopefully an article will be written soon.
