[{"title":"Oh, To Be Reminded of 2002 Again","post":"I have a hypothesis… that the original Holland backing cloth was also too bright for the Shroud, so it was smeared with madder dye where it was visible – at the cut off corners of the Shroud – some of which also got smeared onto the Shroud itself, which is what Rogers found when he discovered his water soluble gum.\nI’m grateful to Barrie for explaining the otherwise rather incongruous blue wooden frame in which the Shroud was exhibited. It may have had some effect in ‘warming up’ the Shroud, but, in view of the blue light which was the only illumination, it also had the effect of glowing somewhat ethereally itself, while the rich red curtains which surrounded the whole arrangement faded into a dull purple.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2015 at 6:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/17/oh-to-be-reminded-of-2002-again/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-208417","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Oh, To Be Reminded of 2002 Again","post":"It would have been easier to use a better color of backing cloth.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2015 at 7:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/17/oh-to-be-reminded-of-2002-again/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-208474","author":"Dcn Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Oh, To Be Reminded of 2002 Again","post":"In the 16th century, probably.
