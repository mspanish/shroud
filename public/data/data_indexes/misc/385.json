Like all conflicts, it occasionally gets bloody.  Consider whether the diversity of Christianity today, even with its irrational extremes, whether ultra-right wing, merely conservative, indifferent, radical, excessively liberal, or just plain loony, is an improvement or a recesssion, on the relatively uniform but superstitious and corrupt form it seems to have had 1200 years ago! Some such conflicts were in fact not about religion at all, but about assertion of national identity. Sometimes the issue is not the issue! The Crusades, anyone?\n\n","date":"April 25, 2013 at 4:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/25/quote-for-today-better-to-be-proven-a-fraud/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-31913","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Quote for Today:  Better to be Proven a Fraud?","post":"\nlooneytombs :\nJester, there is a difference between disagreement and outright hostility.

But this is not the site to discuss one vs the other and I am not going to.\nMy remark on the other thread was driven by constant preaching of one of the members and even in that thread it was present – the man has nothing to do with the Church he is so adamant to reform. It is not his business at all. Somehow that did not cause your peacemaking at all ;)\nGenerally I could not care less who are you in your religion – this site is not about religion and their comparison. But it is not me who constantly dwells on sermons and homilies and instructions to others.\nSo, please, address your reserve to the original and repetitive offender.\n\n","date":"April 25, 2013 at 7:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/25/quote-for-today-better-to-be-proven-a-fraud/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-31923","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Quote for Today:  Better to be Proven a Fraud?","post":"And the best of luck with that!
