It seems more probable the use of the word believe was to some other ‘notion’.

Why did Mary Magdala mistake Jesus for the gardener?  If he was clothed in the Shroud as a himation as Max contends, then the cloths they saw could not have been the Shroud.  They could only have been the bandages and ties.  The head cloth in a separate place had probably been removed by Nicodemus and Joseph A.  To put a supernatural interpretation on it, it may be that Mary saw Jesus draped in some kind of miraculous or heavenly garment, but then he says he has not yet ascended to the Father!  Then it could be that the cloth they saw was in fact the Shroud.  Meacham’s paper refers to the glutinous properties of the myrrh, and then Peter & John have to get their heads around the idea that a grave robbery has occurred, that only the body has been taken away after the difficult matter of removing it from the glutinous coated Shroud.  Alternatively if they saw the image had formed on the Shroud, this might persuade them to believe in the Resurrection.  But only if the image had already been formed, and had been fixed.  Note that John 20:9 has “UNTIL THIS MOMENT, (they had failed to understand etc…) \nWe can speculate and speculate, and come up all with our own interpretations, but I feel that none of us end up any the wiser.

Why do you use the phrase ‘literal sense’ ‘ in a way so clearly contrary to its very meaning, this is beyond me?\n  Lest I get too ‘technical’, I just try to keep my comment to an understandable level here. LITERALLY SPEAKING John and Peter ran to Yeshua’s cave tomb IN ORDER TO check what sounded to them quite unbelievable  (‘a mere women’s tall tale’?): “They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put Him. ” (John 20: 2). \n  On entering the tomb and ‘theorizing’ the linen clothes left there on the sole funerary arched bench in the tomb chamber, Peter was the more perplexed of the two (this in keeping with his Aramaic nickname Kepha, ‘Rock’ figuratively meaning ‘Hardhead’) whereas John could not do otherwise but believe the women. It was not ‘a mere women’s tall tale’. They did have told them the truth. This is the literal sense. Beside NO bona fide Biblical exegete can REALLY hold as a compelling fact, the ‘sindon’ was still lying on the tomb bench as one of the ‘othonia’.\n  Saint Augustine’s, my and Meacham’s reading DO make literal sense. All the more so when we know ‘Yeshua gave his sindon to the servant/auxiliary of the priest’ implying he had NOT left it in his tomb (in all likelihood, the servant/ auxiliary here can be identified either with Joseph of Arimathea as Sanhedrin member/High Priest’s auxiliary of Justice or, as second best candidate, John).\n\n","date":"October 19, 2012 at 6:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-17859","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin","post":"Max I tend to disagree, and agree with Dave in that we can speculate and speculate forever and still come up with our own interpretations. So when you make statements such as; “The TRUE fact is your (and others’) interpretation (as opposed to Saint Augustine’s, mine or Meacham’s) is clearly contrary to John 20: 8 LITERAL meaning” -It just turns my stomach. How can you be so sure your interpretation is right? or infact FACT?\nJohn would have choosen his words very carefully, so for him to use ‘believe’ would have been non-climatic, if talking about the woman. So he believed the woman were right in what they assumed? Still makes no sense, as he would have been ‘absolutely sure’ they were telling the truth and not a ‘tall tale’ at that point. So the usage of the word ‘believe’ is contrary to what he absolutely was sure of at that precise moment. Your comments ‘theorizing’ or ‘sole funerary arched bench’ are simply made up also. When Peter entered the tomb he ‘beheld’ (theOrei) what he saw. When John entered the tomb he ‘perceived’ (eiden) what he saw and believed. Meaning, as I intepret it, that Peter was dumbfounded and could not register in his mind what he was seeing, whereas John saw the condition of the linens and the Sudarium and understood (believed) immediately what must have occured, for up to that moment he did not understand that Jesus would rise from the dead and fulfill scriptures. That ‘to me’ is seems like the most  propable and logical interpretation.\nYes Max, I tend to disagree with your hypothesis when it comes to Jesus’s appearance to Mary at the tomb, as I have an issue with Jesus still wearing a dirty, bloodied 14ft sheet as an himation or article of clothing…I would tend to believe the Shroud was left in the tomb for the apostles to find!

But I will answer the question anyway; How are you so “dead sure” the sindon was not in the tomb? Don’t you think John and Peter would have noticed it was NOT there and made mention of it? That would be a clincher that the body had been taken don’t you think? As I can’t see anyone stealing the body without it….thats all I have to say. Also as I said previously we are NOT talking about the ‘other’ times Jesus appeared to the deciples, just this one appearance, so NO I have not stated that in the other appearances everyone was blinded by the Sun….lets please stick to the one topic at hand and don’t put words in my mouth. My statement on the Mary Magdelena appearance, as I stated quite clearly was just an extremely speculative hypothesis in answer to your extremely speculative statements Max. \nNow to this comment you made to Yannick on his thoughts about the deciples not investigating and just going home; “Had you carefully really read the Gospels, you would have found the answer to your spurrious question: the disciples were instructed by Yeshua (via the women) to meet him in Galilee after the event (‘Go and tel my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me” (28:9-10)…” -My response would be; If you had read the Gospels properly Max, you would realize, they left and went home (without any ‘research’ as Yannick stated) before Jesus appeared to Mary and before she went and told the deciples anything!…please get your chronology in order.\nNow to this comment by you Max; “To the sole exception of Mary of Magdalene who did see Yeshua alive in body and flesh in Joseph’s garden, if you really can read the Greek version of the Gospels and carefully read them you honestly cannot but admit none of the disciples believed Yeshua had resurrected till he appeared to them and opened their minds to what is written in the Scriptures” -This may be your and others mis-interpretation Max. I interpret the Greek as John at that precise moment of perception ‘believed’ Jesus had risen, not ‘KNEW’. He was not absolutely 100% sure, but believed so, from what he just witnessed, and notice also; he states only ‘he’ believed and not that ‘they’ believed, as in Peter believing so also!… Later that evening he would be ‘sure’ when Jesus appeared to them in the room. Hense the reason he used the term ‘believed’, and the reason he would NOT “Implore the reader to believe” as you say at that time. Ever wonder why none of the deciples had any issue in recognizing Jesus in the room that evening, or the next time when Thomas was present? ….funny isn’t it?\nR\n\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 6:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-18022","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin","post":"Your pseudo-traditional interpretation is not only speculative, it is contradicted by narratology, early Christian theology and history,  the Gospel of the Hebrews (see Saint Jerome, common sense and Saint Augstine.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 4:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-18019","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin","post":"Ron, \nSorry to tell you but your opinion is just wishful thinking…Where are your historical, theological, narratological, linguistic, philological facts/pieces of evidence? \nMentioning chronology in the Gospels, could you give me the EXACT chronology of the events on that morning? Did Mary of Magdalene went only once or twice to Yeshua’s tomb? I wait for you… \nThe literary fact is the women (i.e. Mary of Magdalene included) were FIRST told by Yeshua’s angels/messengers to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee and Mary of Magdalene (then alone) was told so A SECOND TIME by Yeshua alive in flesh and blood.\nYou wrote: “I interpret the Greek as John at that precise moment of perception ‘believed’ Jesus had risen, not ‘KNEW’. He was not absolutely 100% sure, but believed so, from what he just witnessed, and notice also; he states only ‘he’ believed and not that ‘they’ believed, as in Peter believing so also!”\n  First, can you tell me (from 20: 8) WHAT EXACTLY did John perceive’ (I’ll very much like you to tell me!) and what makes you so sure Saint Augustine, me and Meacham are “completely  wrong” and cannot read properly?\n  Second, you do tend to totally overlook or ignore this contextual metalinguistic/philological fact: the conjugated Greek verb for ‘he believed’ implies here John uses the Hebrew word ‘aman in the hiphil (verbal stem – causative) form of the verb for his original testimony in order to signify what he saw ‘caused him to be certain, sure’ or ‘to be certain about,’ ‘to be assured.’ Then he was certain about the fact the women had told them the truth. In this sense the word ‘aman  in the hiphil conjugation implied in John 20: 8 shows that it is an assurance, a certainty, in contrast with the English verb ‘to believe’ in reference to something possible, hopefully true, but not certain.\n  Now this ethnolinguistic fact is in rather curious contrast with your contention that “John at that precise moment of perception ‘believed’ Jesus had risen, not ‘KNEW’. He was not absolutely 100% sure, but believed so, from what he just witnessed.”\n  You’d better do your linguistic/philological homework.\n  Mentioning Early Christian history, how do you account for the early church NOT TO APPEAL to the testimony of the beloved disciple to the empty grave AS EVIDENCE of Yeshua’s resurrection in evangelistic preaching? \n  The true fact is Peter and John went to Yeshua’s tomb JUST TO CHECK OUT what the women had just told them (‘they have taken the Master away’). Once inside the empty tomb, Peter was puzzled (not knowing what to really think about the missing body) while John no longer doubted what the women had told them was the plain truth.\n  Had it been otherwise, the kerygma would have literally hinged around the empty tomb scene evidence. The true fact is the scene is… left behind. Yeshua “died… was buried… was raised… appeared…”\n  Please do your early church historical and theological homework before indulging in wishful exegetical thinking…\n  I could go on for hours and hours commenting on your overall wishful thinking here…\n\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-18034","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin","post":"…the whole irony of it is the Amarican Historian and Biblical exegete, Diana Fulbright (who talked on this blog about wishwul thinking),does  read John 20: 8 (almost) like you…\n\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-18035","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin","post":"…and so do so many Christians.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 10:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-18036","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin","post":"There is so much dead wood to be cleared up in the forest of both Christian & Shroud Literature…\n\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-18037","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Shroud of Turin","post":"Since neither Yannick Clément nor Ron answer my questions, can any Christian scholar  tell me exactly which burial clothes were ‘still present’ inside the empty tomb on Easter morning ?
