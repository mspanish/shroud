I was sure the Shroud of Turin was fake.","post":"If Robert Burns is awaiting proof to show that the Shroud is a fake, he cannot assert that it is beforehand.  The most he can do is to say he believes it is a fake, and that evidence will eventually vindicate his belief.  It is obvious from his reasoning that he is letting his predetermined conclusions warp his view of the evidence.\nWe all have our biases, but for religious believers, belief in the Shroud’s authenticity is not necessary for their worldview.  In contrast, unbelievers MUST view the shroud as a fake in order for their belief system to remain unchanged.  Between the former and the latter, it is the latter, generally speaking, that has the chance for more blinding prejudice.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2012 at 6:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/02/that-was-me-once-upon-a-time-i-was-sure-the-shroud-of-turin-was-fake/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-8902","author":"tony","site":"shroudstory"}]
