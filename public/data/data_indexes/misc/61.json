[{"title":"Asking Randi what do so many people have against science?","post":"James Randi is prejudiced. Even the UN has accepted Parapsychology, and parapsychological phenomena can be divided into:\nParanomal\nExtranormal\nSupranormal.\nThe first two are human, the last one involves a power from beyond acting in our world. It should also be pointed that Parapsychology is neutral and should not be confused with Spiritualism.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2012 at 7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/12/asking-randi-what-do-so-many-people-have-against-science/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20315","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Asking Randi what do so many people have against science?","post":"It is far easier to just dismiss things with specious reasoning than to face what you don’t understand in wonder.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2012 at 8:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/12/asking-randi-what-do-so-many-people-have-against-science/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20320","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Asking Randi what do so many people have against science?","post":"Sorry Andy, I read the posting and didn’t see any reasoning at all, let alone the specious kind.  Just clipped pat answers, no evidence of the discipline of the much vaunted “scientific scepticism” at all, Not a single fact offered as any kind of evidence for his bland dogmatic statements.. So who’s the fanatic?  Randl has a faith, But it’s in his own uninformed bigoted position, unsupported by a single piece of evidence.  Typical of most pseudo-skeptics!\n\n","date":"December 12, 2012 at 9:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/12/asking-randi-what-do-so-many-people-have-against-science/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20324","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
