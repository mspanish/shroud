[{"title":"Imagine","post":"What Colin and his fellow travelers overlook is the simple fact that there isn’t a crucifix anywhere that presents the accurate anatomical details of the Shroud of Turin. None, nada zip. A pre-fourteenth century artisan who created such a crucifix would not only have been one of the greatest artists of all time but a medical genius four or so centuries ahead of his or her  time. And imaging a scenario that might have happened ignores the evidence of what did happen. Against hard facts, even circumstantial facts, speculation falls unless supported by hard, not imagined facts (and then it wouldn’t be speculation).\nOne of the things Heller and Adler did is conduct a gedanken (thought) experiment trying to image how the Shroud could have been faked. These very brilliant and accomplished men, one of whom was Jewish couldn’t find any reasonable scenario that could account for the hard facts that are demonstrated by the Shroud.\nWhy do so many people search frantically for explanations which are fanciful and without any historical precedent?\nIs the  the fact of Christ’s crucifixion so frightening that you must flee from its truth?

I know of several who have calmly investigated a variety of hypotheses, presented their findings for discussion, and either refined their line of thought or embarked on new ones. The image on the shroud appears to be unique among images; any explanation for it, regardless of provenance, is fanciful until it is considered established.\nWhat on earth is all that stuff about Christ’s crucifixion got to do with it?

St Paul, I believe, stated that if Christ did not rise from the dead than our faith is in vain.\nI am not a Greek scholar and I do not know what the Greek word was, but I had to look up vain when I started to write that sentence because I suddenly realized I didn’t remember which way to spell vain. There is of course vein and vane all quite proper words in their own right. But having checked to be sure I spelled it correctly, I was interested in the the definitions of vain I found.\n1. having or showing an excessively high opinion of one’s appearance, abilities, or worth.\n“their flattery made him vain”\nsynonyms:conceited, narcissistic, self-loving, in love with oneself, self-admiring, self-regarding, self-obsessed, egocentric, egotistic, egotistical; More\nantonyms:modest\n2. producing no result; useless. “a vain attempt to tidy up the room”\nsynonyms:futile, useless, pointless, to no purpose, hopeless, in vain; \nI don’t know if you took time to read it, but I was particularly struck by Kim Dreisbach’s valedictory read in Perugia posthumously: “The Ecumenical Implications of he Shroud of Turin” see https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/dreisbach4.pdf \nThe reason I was so touched by it is that in sum he stated what has become my conclusion: the Shroud of Turin is a Revelation for our time brought to us by science.  To me as a fan of Teilhard de Chardin, that’s huge. That’s epochal.  \nWhen I started my project and was examining closely the pictures of the Shroud for the first time and reading Barbet and Bucklin, among others, I had what some call a “Shroud Moment.” For the first time in the seven decades my life, I sensed on a personal level what he must have suffered. It’s not that I was in pain, it’s that the reality of that suffering finally sunk in.\nChristian theology has had trouble grappling with some simple facts of history. There was no garden of Eden and no original sin has we now understand it. My favorite definition of original sin is that it is the innate selfishness of all life that was the driving force of evolution. Scripture tells the story of humanity striving to overcome that selfishness. The antithesis of selfishness is love. \nI believe hat the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ teaches us that love, in the end, conquers. As Saint Paul wrote: there exist these three Faith, Hope and Love. The greatest of these is Love for in eternity Faith and Hope will pass away while Love shall endure forever.\nIt has been more than a hundred years since Secondo Pia first discovered the meaning and vitality of the image of the Shroud. No one has explained the process of how that image was created. Many have tried. What Colin Berry and the WAG that Dan posted demonstrate is that it is a childish exercise. \nTo paraphrase St. Paul: it’s time to put the childish things aside. Ecce Homo!\nYou may think am avoiding your arguments but I rely on the arguments of scientists like Heller, Adler and the others of  the STURP team. These were people of scientific accomplishment before they went to Turin. I’ll take their word. Have you ever examined an actual fiber of he Shroud or do you rely on interpreting pictures taken by others?\nDo you consider yourself a superior scientist to Ray Rogers?\n\n","date":"November 26, 2013 at 9:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-52877","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Imagine","post":"“Some people think that the shoulders look dislocated, to account for the fact that the hands can hide the genitals, while others think that the shoulders were slightly raised to account for this.”\nI don’t get this Hugh. My hands can cover my genitals (mind you, only just) even lying dead flat. I certainly don’t have abnormally long arms.\nThere is just no issue there. I struggle to see anatomical abnormalities.\nI’ve proven a number of things to myself by measuring on Shroudscope and corroborating against my own body. A classic example is the myth that the hand wound is on the wrist. It’s not. Its close to the middle of the hand. Another myth, this time from the anti authenticists, is that the fingers are too long. They are not, they measure similar to my own.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 6:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-52914","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Imagine","post":"Hugh:\nIt is often stated that the dorsal image represents a taller man than the ventral image (which should be the other way round if the back of the cloth was flat on a ledge and the front was draped over a figure. \nShort ball:\nIsabel Piczek thinks that the front legs are too short, and attributes this to the fact that they were bent, with the knees well off the group, in which case there should be no image of the back of the legs on the cloth.\nUnless the cloth was raised and tied with a stripe or another cloth.\nRigor mortis, lying on a stone pillow, even floating above the surface of the tomb, all these have been suggested by authenticists to account for what they see as patently inaccurate anatomical details.

I also believe that someday “science” will recognize that fact. \nI think that much of the confusion about the distortions of the image arises from the fact hat the body was not flat at the instant when the image was formed. Forensic pathologists such as Bucklin and Zugibe have found that the body was in a state of rigor mortis. In Chapter 14 of Zugibe’s book “The Crucifixion of Christ: A Forensic Inquiry” he spends a lot of ink discussing “rigor mortis” which he found in the exemplified by the man in the shroud. Between Bucklin and Zugibe  there are some  disagreement about how crucifixion cause death s but the fact that rigor mortis was present is not in dispute.\nZugibe points out that it was necessary for Joseph of Arimithea and whoever else helped him in entombing  Christ to “break the rigor mortis” because since  the man in the  shroud was a crucifixion victim his arms would have stiffened at the moment of death in an extended position. That also meant as frequently pictured that his knees were bent and his head and neck when he was laid flat slightly elevated. Because of that measurement of his actually height has must be adjusted.\nNow whatever  the precise image creation process, it reflects the body still in a position of rigor mortis and that means by the Gospel accounts before 3:00PM on the Sunday following the crucifixion. All four Gospel accounts describe Mary Magdalene discovering the body missing at daybreak on that Sunday.\nThe rigor mortis is one fact established by science that supports a “theory” of Resurrection and adds weight to the conclusion that the Shroud is not a forgery. It’s just one fact but that fact of rigor mortis is a relevant one.\nIt is interesting but maybe not terribly relevant that the digital pictures I take are sometimes distorted. For  example, a picture of my dog Bogart (a/k/a “Bogie”) that I once published on my blog shows his head abnormally large in comparison to his body when he was in a sitting position. Also my wife last night was conversing with her niece in Chicago on Skype using her I-Phone. The appearance of her niece’s face close-up was also distorted. Her nose for example appeared much larger vis-a-vis her face.\nThe very distortions that some see in the shroud man are not the result of an “incompetent” artist but likely caused by the time of the image creation when the man in the shroud was in a state of rigor mortis. Now maybe someone can dispute rigor mortis. Okay, go ahead but only forensic pathologists may apply.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-52922","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Imagine","post":"Some people find he debates on this blog a waste of time.

Yet they will blithely assert that the body would have been limp at image formation and proceed to erroneously interpret the anatomy as if the body were lying perfectly supine on a flat surface.  They resolutely guard and nurture this misbelief because so many of their criticisms of the Shroud are dependent upon it.  \nIn addition to the evident rigor, the absence of distortions consistent with gravity and contact with a planar surface need to be considered.  The hair, back and buttocks do not appear as they should.  I think Gilbert Lavoie’s study and photographs are especially helpful here.  Ideally, they should be reproduced using cadavers exhibiting various degrees of rigor; such observations, though, would be difficult to arrange without the professional access of an authority like Zugibe.  \nGiven the dearth of expected distortion, skeptics are effectively limited to arguing for one of the various flavors of ‘heated statue’ or bas relief theories.  The body must have been a hard, even solid, material.  Of course, these are easily confounded by blood, serum, and other obvuously biological evidence, which forces the argument back to consideration of a corpse.  And round and round we go.\nThe image is, and yet it cannot be.\nWhile I agree with the Augustine forumlation on miracles, I nevertheless think that the Creator’s understanding of nature’s physical laws permits manipulation on a level we cannot hope to understand any time soon.  For this reason, I think it’s fair to say that the image is essentially “impossible.”  It cannot be reconciled with what we understand of physics.\n\n","date":"November 28, 2013 at 11:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-53222","author":"Jeff","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Imagine","post":"Good morning, John.

Two comments: You are a gifted scholar and your work parallels some of the things I wll write about in the Second Part of my manuscript. The working title of the whole manuscript is: “The Coming of the Quantum Christ: The Shroud of Turin and the Future of Science and Humanity.” You referenced quite early in your piece “militant atheism.” \nSo “in the clear” are the first three paragraphs of my introduction:\n“We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Every day we make decisions after weighing the available facts. But almost always we have doubts. Fear the person who has no doubt. Think George Armstrong Custer.  If we only acted in the absence of doubt, we would probably seldom act at all. Even Mother Theresa, who devoted her life to caring for the most desperate of the residents of the Calcutta slums, confessed to moments of black doubt.\n“Unfortunately, one of the hallmarks of the current era are people who profess freedom from doubt under circumstances where doubt would seem to be a reasonable proposition. For example, newly militant atheists are crusading against any form of religion and express no doubt about the absence of any God of any kind. They claim to arrive at their conclusions by the dispassionate application of the scientific method. Foremost among the militant atheists is Oxford Don Richard Dawkins whose literary rant against religion, The God Delusion, has sold more than two million copies since it was published in 2005. The cover jacket for Delusion, modestly describes Dawkins has “the world’s most prominent atheist” (the “atheist pope” so to speak), \n“Opposed to the atheistic militants are, among others, young earth fundamentalists be they Christian, Islamic or Jewish. To those fundamentalists, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary, the world is a scant 6,000 years old and man walked with dinosaurs. Indeed, to some, the Grand Canyon is but an artifact of Noah’s flood. They are but cat’s paw for the atheistic militants who delight in demonstrating their absurdities. Nonetheless, the most potent weapon of the militant atheists, aside from acerbic wit, is their scientific credentials.”\nAgain, if you want to correspond try klotzlaw@gmail.com\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-52933","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Imagine","post":"Thanks for the kind remarks, John.

St Paul, I believe, stated that if Christ did not rise from the dead than our faith is in vain.” Dead right. I am endlessly quoting St Augustine of Hippo, St Thomas Aquinas, Pope John-Paul II’s ‘Fides et Ratio’ and Benedict XVI’s address at Regensburg. However, the genuineness of the shroud has no bearing on my faith in the resurrection, and I don’t believe it has on yours. If it were proved a fake tomorrow, would you convert? What to?\nMatthias: “There is just no issue there. I struggle to see anatomical abnormalities.” Apparently, so does John, but you are in a minority. Shroud/body configuration theories abound in order to correct percieved abnormalities. Just one point though – when you lie flat on the ground with your wrists crossed, what angle do they make? You’ll notice that the shroud man’s arms are very bent at the elbow, and meet at quite a wide angle at the wrists. Can you copy that?\nOK. Your measurements are impeccable. Why so many people disagree with them is beyond me. But they do. Piczek thinks that both the top and bottom of the shroud were horizontal, and the shortness of the legs is due to the foreshortening that comes from projecting the bent legs vertically upwards and downwards. If the cloth were tied under the knees, then there should be a non-image band on both ventral and dorsal images, and there should be considerable lengthening of the upper legs as the cloth passes over the knees. And all that projection business – of course I understand. All the suggested radiation directions and cloth configurations are attempts to show how “anatomical perfection” would look when it appeared on a cloth. The trouble is, as I said before, that each of these possibilites has its adherents, all of whom think that the others’ versions are completely untenable, and would result in a distorted appearance. W says the legs are too short, and therefore must be the result of foreshortening; X says the arms are too long, and therefore must be the result of dislocation; Y says the neck is too short, and therefore must be the result of the head being on a pillow; Z says the buttocks are too rounded, and therefore must be the result of the body hovering in the air. All of them begin with the assumption that the shroud image is not, in itself, anatomical perfection, but a projection thereof. Trouble is, none of them agree how to achieve it.\nJohn: I think you’re correct in thinking that a body set rigidly in the position of a crucified person, whose arms were pulled out of position with some force to their site over the abdomen, is now fairly well accepted by authenticists. What they do not realise is that this is exactly the same scenario as a metal or wooden crucifix, whse arms were snapped off and placed in the same position – except for the actual site of the breakage, which is fortuitously hidden by some convenient burn marks…\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 11:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-52938","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Imagine","post":"To Hugh:\nOK.

All the suggested radiation directions and cloth configurations are attempts to show how “anatomical perfection” would look when it appeared on a cloth. The trouble is, as I said before, that each of these possibilites has its adherents, all of whom think that the others’ versions are completely untenable, and would result in a distorted appearance. […] All of them begin with the assumption that the shroud image is not, in itself, anatomical perfection, but a projection thereof. Trouble is, none of them agree how to achieve it.\nAnd actually, that’s completetly normal situation in science! There are rarely single accepted theories -usually there are many competing models competing models that try to explain more or less a given phenomenon, say the solid state physics, nuclear physics (there is no single good model of the atomic nucleus!), in astrophysics, and in many other branches of “exact”science, not to say about less exact (economy, sociology, history, archeology, psychology and so on). So such disagreements in case of the Shroud are something that should be expected. There is no final, widely accepted model yet, and the space of possible parameters is very large. But there are several good models, which explain various issues -the problem is how to reconcile these models with each other. So some another manipulations with the parameters have to be undertaken, which is\nvery tedious and difficult work (there is no simple indicator that would say we are going in a right direction). Remember, there are more than a dozen parameters!\nHowever, even exising models give slightly different, but still relatively satisfactory results. Actually there are probably no serious abnormalities in the image of TSM, at least no beyond some acceptable limits. Only some sceptics, like Nickell, Schafersman and their followers probably smoke some herb, so they see some terrible distortions.\nIf the cloth were tied under the knees, […] there should be considerable lengthening of the upper legs as the cloth passes over the knees.\nDependent on the model, there could be either lenghtening or shortening.\nThe next post will be about Piczek and her approach.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-52977","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Imagine","post":"Isabel’s Piczek approach and reasons behind it:\nHugh, you wrote:\nPiczek thinks that both the top and bottom of the shroud were horizontal, and the shortness of the legs is due to the foreshortening that comes from projecting the bent legs vertically upwards and downwards.\nSee once again this:\n\nand this:\n\nPiczek assumes that the body (hovering in the air, but that’s unimportant detail here) was popjected vertcally on the Shroud floating flatly in horizontal position above and below (see model 1. and yellow line on the pictures above).\nWhy she assumes so.?The key is her methodology. Piczek is an artist, a painter. See a picture of her, while she climbs up on the ladder to see live model posing:\n\nWhat does she see staying on the ladder, above the model? This:\n\nShe sees her model not from the perspective of the Shroud wrapping the body (because it is hard to imagine such perspective, even for the alleged Shroud forger -that’s another reason why his existence is doubtful), but from the perspective of someone who sees the body staying above it -from the perspective of flat horizontal plate. And while she claims:\n“The professional arts cannot find any such discrepancies and distortions in the anatomy of the Shroud Man, which cannot be explained experimentally and which would prove it to be a painting.” \nshe assumes that the image was projected on the Shroud exactly in this way, vertically on flat surface. Is it fully precise approach -no. This is only the first approximation, but actually this first approximation is good! Some minor corrections may be applied, using more sophisticated tools (models how the Shroud wrapped the body presented by Jackson and others, some computer simulations like performed by Fanti and the one which is being made by Mario Latendresse), but general conclusion seems to be valid, there are no great abnormalities visible in the TS Man.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-52984","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"}]
