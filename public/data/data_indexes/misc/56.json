[{"title":"Have we now exhausted this off-topic?","post":"A scholar of Tom Wright’s standing must be aware that the Marcan story in Mk 16:8-20 of the Resurrection being first revealed to Mary Magdalen, is a later addition, possibly 2nd c. the original ending having apparently been lost.  In Mk 1-8 the women discover the empty tomb, and one angel gives them the message that Jesus has risen.\nThe endings in other Mk MSS vary, but don’t seem to include the story of Mk 16:8-20.  However variations on the story appear in the other three gospels. \nIn Matthew 28, there is an earthquake and one angel gives the three women the message, and then in Mt 28:9-10, Jesus comes to meet them.  In Luke 24, however there are two angels who give the women the message, the women go to tell the 11 apostles, Peter runs to the tomb, confirms their story, and then Jesus appears to two of the apostles on their way to Emmaus, but is unrecognised.  In John 20, only Mary Magdala is mentioned as coming to the tomb while it is still dark, sees the tomb is empty, she tells Peter, and then Peter & John confirm the story of the empty tomb; Meanwhile Mary waits outside the tomb weeping, she sees two angels who ask her why she is weeping, and then sees Jesus, mistaking him for the gardener.  It seems difficult to attribute the women being the first witesses of the resurrected Jesus to Mark, although both Matthew and John give variations of it.  Luke however prefers the Emmaus appearance to two apostles as the first appearance.  All four gospels attribute women as being the first witnesses of the empty tomb.\n\n","date":"December 6, 2012 at 7:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/have-we-now-exhausted-this-off-topic/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19909","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Have we now exhausted this off-topic?","post":"Dave,\nYour biblical exegesis is spot on. I must be careful to distinguish between apparitions and witness to the appearances. However, Wright I think is correct, in putting the fact that women play a central role in the Resurrection story as a whole. \nWright’s first fact in “proving” the Resurrection is the empty tomb.\n\n","date":"December 6, 2012 at 9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/have-we-now-exhausted-this-off-topic/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19910","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Have we now exhausted this off-topic?","post":"correction:\n“I must be careful to distinguish between apparitions and witness to the appearances” should be “I must be careful to distinguish between apparitions and witness to the empty tomb.”\n\n","date":"December 6, 2012 at 9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/have-we-now-exhausted-this-off-topic/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19911","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Have we now exhausted this off-topic?","post":"John, Apart from my comments above, I thought your whole page was a remarkable piece of work, and extremely enlightening.  I had appreciated that Jesus was not averse to breaking the cultural norms when it came to women, but your article is a persuasive argument that at heart he also seems to have been a radical feminist.  I’m not sure if in your paragraph referring to the ordination of women, you intended the word “anarchism(sic)”, or “anachronism”.  Tom Wright’s conditional comment “Even if we suppose that Mark made up most of his material …” also seems a peculiar comment for him to make.  There is a strong tradition that Mark’s witness was the apostle Peter, see closing verses of I Peter (but may well have been written after 65 AD).  My own argument for a gender independent priesthood , argued elsewhere on this site, was merely based on Paul’s Galatians 3:25-28,\n\n","date":"December 6, 2012 at 3:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/have-we-now-exhausted-this-off-topic/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-19932","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Have we now exhausted this off-topic?","post":"Dave,\nCould send me your E-Mail address.
