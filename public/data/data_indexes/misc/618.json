[{"title":"Wonderful:  Pam Moon’s  New Shroud of Turin Exhibition Website","post":"Good morning, Dan. Sorry, I think Pam Moon has leaped to conclusions when it comes to the Jospice Mattress.\nWhy didn’t she present her findings by giving a talk about what she calls her “reflections” at the BSTS meeting in Beaconsfield in 2012?\nDid the artist steal a mattress from the Hospital, finish the painting with body fluids and then smuggle it back? No one noticed it?\nWhat was the purpose? Did the artist think that Les looked like Clark Cable?\nDoes this goes to say that Father Francis O’Leary was either a fool or a liar?\nSee the link:\nhttp://holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/can_the_jospice_mattress_imprint.mht_2.pdf\n\n","date":"January 8, 2014 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/08/wonderful-pam-moons-new-shroud-of-turin-exhibition-website/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-72580","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wonderful:  Pam Moon’s  New Shroud of Turin Exhibition Website","post":"Point well taken. I was focused on the website, which is intended to promote exhibitions. It is well designed for that purpose. Perhaps it is not the place for papers, which are becoming more and more scattered and free of any review. I’ve done the same thing in the past. And Barrie has posted many papers without a formal review process. So have other researchers. And we do it here with guest postings. What I like about the blog setting is the facility for immediate comments that are permanently attached to the paper. I’m sure we will have many things to say about her papers and I hope she will participate in the discussion.\n\n","date":"January 8, 2014 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/08/wonderful-pam-moons-new-shroud-of-turin-exhibition-website/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-72585","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wonderful:  Pam Moon’s  New Shroud of Turin Exhibition Website","post":"Thanks.\n\n","date":"January 8, 2014 at 9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/08/wonderful-pam-moons-new-shroud-of-turin-exhibition-website/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-72587","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wonderful:  Pam Moon’s  New Shroud of Turin Exhibition Website","post":"Nice looking page.

As so often happens, some worthwhile observations are obscured by over-speculative conclusions, which means that even the observations get ignored. In the case of the Jospice mattress, I believe her observations regarding the physiological irregularities are interesting and may have a bearing on the physiological irregularities of the Shroud. I do not agree that they represent incompetence on the part of a forger, but that does not mean they should be ignored altogether.\n\n","date":"January 8, 2014 at 10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/08/wonderful-pam-moons-new-shroud-of-turin-exhibition-website/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-72592","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Wonderful:  Pam Moon’s  New Shroud of Turin Exhibition Website","post":"In 2013 a paper is published by Elsevier: Bevilacqua, M., Fanti, G., D’Arienzo, M., & De Caro, R.
