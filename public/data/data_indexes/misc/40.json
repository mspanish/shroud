[{"title":"An Online Photo Gallery of Italy’s New Churches","post":"IMO, at 73 years of age, none of the churches shown really look like churches on the outside. However what is important is what takes place on the inside.  If I lived nearby and attended one as my Parish Church, my opinion might be different.  As for the photo with Christs facial image, I interpret it as Christs head facing forward.\n\n","date":"December 22, 2014 at 4:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/22/an-online-photo-gallery-of-italys-new-churches/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-178366","author":"Emmett McMahon","site":"shroudstory"}]
