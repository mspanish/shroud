[{"title":"Intellectual Inferiority of Christians?","post":"I find the inconsistency of the statements confusing. The issues addressed can be more subtle.\nThe ubiquity of flood legends doesn’t prove that Noah’s flood saga was true. It is however, powerful evidence that a flood episode occurred in the Middle East – the “Cradle of Civilization”), it was wide spread and caused devastation. There is, I believe archaeology to support that.\nAs to the Shroud.  I believe that Carlos Evaristo’s landmark book on the Shroud’s history with the Savoy’s is the final nail in the coffin of Carbon dating. It was repaired. \nThere were repairs and the bishops at times clutched in their mitts that corner which became the C14-Raes areas.\nThe use of the Shroud in this study, unrelated to the issue of the age of the Shroud, is a scientific tragedy. It’s like asking people if they believe the moon is made of green cheese. (It’s not). It also indicated we still have work to do.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2014 at 6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/02/intellectual-inferiority-of-christians/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-126254","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Intellectual Inferiority of Christians?","post":"“The fact that the Shroud of Turin was scientifically shown to have been made in the Middle Ages indicates it is a fake, not a miraculous impression made by God.”\nThis statement begins with a highly disputed premise, which is followed by a sensible inference, and then a non-sequitur. What is a stupid Christian to make of it?\nIf it is “a miraculous impression made by God” then he could have made it appear scientifically to have been made in the Middle Ages, even if it was authentic. In fact, now I come to think of it, that seems much more plausible that the Soviet plot theory.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2014 at 9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/02/intellectual-inferiority-of-christians/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-126277","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Intellectual Inferiority of Christians?","post":"Bonjour tres cher Hugh,\n                                          You have still not received any reply from the  laboratory regarding Stephen E.

Being so, it was inevitable that elements from surrounding cultures crept into the text. Even the great (Protestant) scholar William F. Albright of Johns Hopkins knew about that. The best (Catholic) scholar to consult today is Joseph Blenkinsopp, his essay can found in the “New Jerome Biblical Commentary”, edited by Joseph A. Fitzmyer, Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy. If it depends on Finkelstein (secular Jew), most of it is myth. What can be said with certainty is that we still have a long way to go. \nhttps://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJ.\n2) The so-called after-death experience is still very controversial. We still do not know enough about the mind-body problem. Not everyone sees an all-loving Being of light, which goes to show that whatever people “see” are products of their unconscious. We cannot live in a world of make believe, where it feels nice to think that in the end what is left of us is not eaten by worms or consumed by flames. The topic goes much more deeper than that, it involves all living matter, inanimate matter, the universe as a whole. Cosmology is the biggest challenge.\n3) There was a tendency to exaggerate in ancient times in the region. It may have been due to an attempt to boost morale after the Babylonian Captivity, but that does not go to say that the authors were lying.\n4) It it not true that the Shroud has been “scientifically shown to have been made in the Middle Ages”. The C14 dating is controversial, the BM authenticated “Piltdown Man” and the Geological Survey of Israel is known to have authenticated forgeries. Scientists are not infallible, that is why one theory is always discarded in favour of a new one, which is in turn forgotten to make way for another one.\nIt is always better to look before leaping.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2014 at 11:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/02/intellectual-inferiority-of-christians/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-126290","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Intellectual Inferiority of Christians?","post":"Be stupid, be stubborn : C14 = raw data.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2014 at 2:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/02/intellectual-inferiority-of-christians/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-126311","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Intellectual Inferiority of Christians?","post":"Or raw material that was incorrectly processed.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2014 at 3:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/02/intellectual-inferiority-of-christians/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-126322","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Intellectual Inferiority of Christians?","post":"… and never released.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2014 at 3:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/02/intellectual-inferiority-of-christians/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-126323","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Intellectual Inferiority of Christians?","post":"Yes, that’s right.

It is clearly agenda driven, “either / or ” questions faultily structured admitting no other alternatives, constrained by an inadequate understanding of religion as if evangelical literalism was the only option of those attached to religion, and with no real cognitive challenge to the irreligious.
