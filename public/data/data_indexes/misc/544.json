[{"title":"Tilt:  Journalism","post":"This comment from Mary is a proof that my fear is founded.  I know that many people in the Shroud world try to use the Shroud to make people believe that it can give us some true scientific proof of the resurrection.  That “bad proselytism christian propaganda” goes on in the Shroud world for decades now and it all seem to start after STURP published is results at the beginning of the 80s when they say that they were not able to fully explain the image formation process that was going on to form the image.  Starting from there, many people from the lunatic fringe have done all they could to make believe that the Shroud offer some kind of sure proof of the resurrection…  But what I found very sad in all this crap, is that some christian believers believe that !!!  Just like if God would force people to believe in him…  If that crap was true and the Shroud really could prove the resurrection, where would have gone our free will folks ???\n\n","date":"May 4, 2012 at 10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/04/tilt-journalism/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-11120","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
