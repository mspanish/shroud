[{"title":"Rest in Peace Dorothy Crispino","post":"One of my regrets is that I came to serious study of the Shroud rather late in the game and never had a chance to meet some of the real giants in the field. Dorothy was one of those but by the time I began work onmy manuscript she had settled in Italy and was suffering from the infirmities of age. However, there is one remarkable piece on Shroud.com that relates the history of the Shroud study on this side of the pond entitled “The Fathers of American Sindology”  http://www.shroud.com/crispino.htm\nShe was the editor and publisher of  Shroud Spectrum  Magazine which remains a remarkable source of information on the Shroud. \nAlthough I never met Dorothy, I am indebted to her for her work on the Shroud as is anyone else who ventures down the path of the Shroud which is ultimately the way of the Cross. Sleep in peace.\n\n","date":"August 26, 2014 at 7:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/25/rest-in-peace-dorothy-crispino/","cat":"obituary","id":"comment-146257","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
