[{"title":"Every Time of its Exposition Since 1978","post":"Hello, Dan:  I too hope to visit Torino during the exposition. It will be the first time for me and I’m really looking forward to it.. I have written a trilogy about the Shroud of Turin (not published yet, but hoping) and because of all the research I’ve done, am so anxious to see the burial cloth of our Savior. I believe it’s the first fictional trilogy where the people actually living at the various times intermingle with my characters.\n\n","date":"December 5, 2013 at 9:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/05/every-time-of-its-exposition-since-1978/","cat":"2015","id":"comment-56871","author":"Rosalie Giansante","site":"shroudstory"}]
