He (Nickell’s) seems to talk out of his rear orifice most of the time. Alot of people also do not realize that Nickell’s is not a scientist, or scholar, or chemist or specialized in any field, whatsoever! He is basically just a critic, and a poor one at that.\nR\n\n","date":"December 27, 2011 at 6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/26/third-update-to-cosmic-log-posting-this-should-settle-it/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-6192","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Third Update to Cosmic Log Posting: This Should Settle It","post":"Quote : “Recently, these results have been confirmed by a direct measurement of another fiber, showing the thickness of the colored coating around the fiber is about 0.2 micrometer.
