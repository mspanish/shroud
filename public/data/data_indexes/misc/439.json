[{"title":"Shroud Encounter coming to the Richmond, Virginia area in March","post":"Thanks for posting Dan.  My daughter is a film major at UGA…I am finally getting a return on my investment.  The purpose of the video is to make use of social media.  Of course all the standard fare is also produced such as a press release and posters but the world communicates now through Facebook and video.
