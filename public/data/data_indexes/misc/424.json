[{"title":"Scientists, after all, are human","post":"Dan,\nWhy the question mark? Are you not aware that the radio carbon labs (at east in UK and US) had government grants to support their flawed carbon dating of the Shroud? \nThere is one point in Gove’s book in which he kind of chortles because one the the STURP scientists who wanted to go to Turin for a conference planing the carbon dating asked Gove if he would use some of his government funds to buy him a ticket to Turin. He didn’t buy it for him.\nAnd then if I am not mistaken, the AMS analyzer, a multi-pound item, was obtained by Oxford by a UK government funded grant.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2014 at 5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/20/scientists-after-all-are-human/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-172192","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Scientists, after all, are human","post":"Of course they are, regardless of what is claimed.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2014 at 7:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/20/scientists-after-all-are-human/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-172206","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Scientists, after all, are human","post":"Scientists can be one-sided and limit themselves to what is convenient to them, depending on their worldview. Einstein limited himself to “Spinoza’s God”, refusing to look further, Freud was obsessed with Moses, who he later dismissed as an Egyptian. Both of them influenced each other and it does seem that Hawking has been reading RD. Have they reached the truth? No they haven’t, they have not heeded Jaspers’ advice.\nIn our increasingly sceptical world, the number of people questioning the Bible has increased considerably, and that is natural. Has science done away with faith? No, it hasn’t:\n https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJ\nAs for 1988, Father Pfeiffer told me during an interview that a lot of pressure had been exerted on the Church. By the time Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero realised the blunder he had made the damage had been done.\nWho was to blame? Was it Professor Luigi Gonella? Daniel Raffard de Brienne refused to attack him during an interview he gave me; he had found the professor to be “extremely friendly”,was charmed by him.\nThe scenario today is different, Rome and Turin have learnt from mistakes, PAS Chancellor Archbishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo is highly qualified, it will need a lot — and the right people — to convince him about more carbon dating.\nWhat can be done meanwhile? Concentrate on the image formation process.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2014 at 9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/20/scientists-after-all-are-human/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-172222","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
