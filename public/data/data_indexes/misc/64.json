[{"title":"In the running for pope?","post":"I don’t know if Marc Ouellet would be good for the Shroud, but I’m certain of one thing: he would not be good as a Pope for the Church.  I know the guy very well and he’s a member of the right-wing conservative side of the Catholic Church (the same gang than Ratzinger and many others) and I truly don’t think it would be a good thing for the Church to keep on the right-wing track it is on since too many years now.  Let’s pray that the Holy Spirit will blow a wind of change on the Church…\n\n","date":"February 17, 2013 at 5:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/17/in-the-running-for-pope/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-24576","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In the running for pope?","post":"Thanks Yannick.

That kind of rigid attitude is very far from the openness and mercy of Christ’s teaching (especially concerning public sinners and women).  My dream Pope would be someone that would represent some kind of mix between the attractive nature and the great strength and courage of John Paul II and the guts to change things like John XXIII.  A kind of spiritual son of John XXIII would be great.  Someone who would truly bring the Church into the 21st century.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2013 at 8:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/17/in-the-running-for-pope/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-24599","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In the running for pope?","post":"Yannick,\nFrom your lips to God’s ear.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2013 at 11:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/17/in-the-running-for-pope/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-24610","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In the running for pope?","post":"All of the papabile were given their red hats by either J P II or Benedict.  Even the Africans and South Americans are all conservatives.  Don’t build up your hopes.  The only way there’ll be any change is to have a Vatican III, another Council of Bishops, the ones with the real pastoral experience, and the ones who brought in the changes during the late 1960s!

Remember John XXIII ?  Everybody thought he wouldn’t do much and he was the one who started Vatican II under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit !!!  Who knows ?  Maybe the next Pope (even if he’s tag as a conservative person) will let the Holy Spirit guided him to call for Vatican III !!!  On this subject, I agree completely with you !  It’s about time that a new council happen and the main subject, along with the permission for Priests to get married and for women to become Priests, should be, in my mind, a complete and profound reform of the Sacraments…\n\n","date":"February 18, 2013 at 9:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/17/in-the-running-for-pope/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-24681","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In the running for pope?","post":"I read or heard, cannot remember where that this will be our last Pope.\nR\n\n","date":"February 19, 2013 at 2:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/17/in-the-running-for-pope/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-24778","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In the running for pope?","post":"Ron:\nThe Prophecy of the Popes (Latin: Prophetia Sancte Malachiae Archiepiscopi, de Summis Pontificibus) is a series of 112 short, cryptic phrases in Latin which purport to predict the Roman Catholic popes (along with a few antipopes), beginning with Pope Celestine II.
