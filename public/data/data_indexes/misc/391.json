The brightness encoding that translates to depth.  The gruesome image with it’s historical congruence with what is said to be a Roman crucifixion.  The interesting historical tracing of Wilson.  The blood studies of Adler.  The forensics of Zugabie, etc.  The congruence of the biblical story with the Shroud.  It is not doubt that causes me to look at the Shroud and wonder.  It is the wonders of the Shroud that make my faith more relevant to me and the world around me.  Perhaps that is the core reason why there is so much doubt about things that have already been established about the Shroud.  M. Yves Delage the Atheist & Barrie Schwortz the Jew are honest to admit they believe in the authenticity of the Shroud based upon the scientific evidence.  Makes me wonder if those who refuse are not doing so not from scientific evidence but from some other reason.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2012 at 9:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/12/reading-the-shroud-backwards/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20278","author":"Andy Weiss","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Reading the Shroud Backwards","post":"I’d rather say a shadow of doubt about the shroud. \nAnd Science helps seeing the shroud as the actual burial of Christ, whereas the Church would ask faith to fill the gap.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2012 at 7:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/12/reading-the-shroud-backwards/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20420","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"}]
