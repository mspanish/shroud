[{"title":"More on the movie: I’m Not Jesus Mommy","post":"I just saw the film.  I watched it because I found the concept interesting.  The film was ok.  It could have explained things a little better.  I would have enjoyed it more if it delved deeper into what happened to the world after the cloned boy was born.  The acting was good though.  I didn’t feel like I wasted my time watching it.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2012 at 5:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/06/more-on-the-movie-im-not-jesus-mommy/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-12942","author":"Cher","site":"shroudstory"}]
