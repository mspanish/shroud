[{"title":"Who took which sticky tape samples where and when? 6BD Pictured?","post":"Looks like we need a cryptanalyst here! However, looking at the new picture, which is wholly inconsistent with McCrone’s 1978 plan, and presumably shows 1973 samples, is it possible that these slides show cartesian co-ordinates, dividing the shroud into, say 10cm squares, labelled A, B, C etc along one axis, and a, b, c along the other? It still looks inconsistent though, doesn’t it? Is Avinoam Danin contactable, I wonder?\n\n","date":"December 16, 2012 at 6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/16/who-took-which-sticky-tape-samples-where-and-when-6bd-pictured/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20500","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Who took which sticky tape samples where and when? 6BD Pictured?","post":"I will write to him.\n\n","date":"December 16, 2012 at 6:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/16/who-took-which-sticky-tape-samples-where-and-when-6bd-pictured/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20501","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Who took which sticky tape samples where and when? 6BD Pictured?","post":"Hypothetically speaking, even if Aninoam confused a 1973 sticky sample with a 1978 sticky sample, it shall be reminded here it was also said then (i.e. in 1973) NO sticky samples had been removed from the face!\n\n","date":"December 16, 2012 at 8:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/16/who-took-which-sticky-tape-samples-where-and-when-6bd-pictured/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20504","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Who took which sticky tape samples where and when? 6BD Pictured?","post":"Typo: Avinoam\n\n","date":"December 16, 2012 at 8:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/16/who-took-which-sticky-tape-samples-where-and-when-6bd-pictured/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20505","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Who took which sticky tape samples where and when? 6BD Pictured?","post":"It is quite possible that the sample being discussed was taken in 1973 as Max points out, but I have no information on those samples at all.  However, maybe the questions should be addressed to the man who now holds the Frei collection, Dr. Alan Whanger, or to Paul Maloney, who had the Frei collection and studied it extensively for several years before transferring it to Whanger.  They might be able to provide more accurate information than either Danin or Lucotte. \nAs I said in my earlier post, in 1978 I photographed Frei’s sample taking from beginning to end and, at one point, he did reach to put tape on the Shroud face. It was that moment that John Jackson intervened and physically stopped him from doing so and a moment later I made a well known photo of the resulting confrontation. (See http://www.shroud.com/gallery/thumbnails/5-B-5.jpg). \nI think the idea that the samples in question might have come from Frei’s 1973 examination makes a lot of sense.\n\n","date":"December 16, 2012 at 7:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/16/who-took-which-sticky-tape-samples-where-and-when-6bd-pictured/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20522","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Who took which sticky tape samples where and when? 6BD Pictured?","post":"Barrie your comment agreeing that a tape sampling may have been done in 1973, rings a bell in that I have read that the eye area (where the leptin coin supposedly can be seen) was damaged somewhat. Apparently the threads were twisted or something to that line in 1973…one would suppose maybe from this tape sampling action? I would deduce that since the area ‘may’ have been damaged prior to the 1978 photographs, it is quite possibly the reason no such image can be seen on any photos taken afterward. I seriously cannot remember where I read this,; Would you have any idea about this? As to the photo you have linked us to, I am curious as to what kind of conversation transpired between the two, lol, I’m sure it was quite entertaining. Did you happen to hear it?\nThanks.\n\n","date":"December 20, 2012 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/16/who-took-which-sticky-tape-samples-where-and-when-6bd-pictured/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-20804","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Who took which sticky tape samples where and when? 6BD Pictured?","post":"I believe Dr. Alan Whanger made that statement some years ago, although he was not referring to damage done by tape samples, but rather by rolling and unrolling the Shroud.

Were there not two sets of tape samples? Does the diagram above refer to the STURP’s sensitive pressure-determined samples or to Max Frei’s?
