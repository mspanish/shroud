[{"title":"The Great Christopher Hitchens Has Lost His Voice","post":"“And, Lord, if it be your will,\nLet Christopher speak some more”\nAt this point I’m sure God has turned His back on Hitchens. Why should God grant him full or partial healing when Hidchens has blasphemed and ridiculed God all of his adult life. Hitchens destiny is eternally set from which he’ll reap his rewards for all eternity, I’m really sorry Hitchens…\n\n","date":"August 11, 2011 at 3:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/11/the-great-christopher-hitchens-has-lost-his-voice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3576","author":"Tom","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Great Christopher Hitchens Has Lost His Voice","post":"I guess we believe very differently about a forgiving, loving God.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2011 at 5:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/11/the-great-christopher-hitchens-has-lost-his-voice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3579","author":"episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Great Christopher Hitchens Has Lost His Voice","post":"Lol, @Tom: There are plenty more blasphemers in Hollywood and elsewhere who are living the good life and don’t believe in God or have anything good to say about him/her/it. There are also a great deal of religious individuals who are plagued with illness and, if living in America, are probably facing bankruptcy. \nOn the other hand, I’d like to commend the author for being so level headed and fair. It’s nice to see someone give credit where credit is due despite the difference in beliefs.\n\n","date":"September 27, 2011 at 9:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/11/the-great-christopher-hitchens-has-lost-his-voice/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-4052","author":"CPB","site":"shroudstory"}]
