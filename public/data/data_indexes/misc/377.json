[{"title":"PZ Myers Wreathed In A Fog Of Smugness","post":"Sullivan is right. From what I have seen of his attention seeking stunts and blog posts, he lives by “the assertion that it is religion and that he therefore knows all he needs to know about it.  That is pure fundamentalism, no less extreme and no less open to evidence than someone who believes the earth was formed 6000 years ago.  Myers is a Fundy. \nBTW: I disagree with you on capitalizing atheism. Would you say someone is a Doubter or an Environmentalist?\n\n","date":"November 23, 2010 at 11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/11/22/pz-myers-wreathed-in-a-fog-of-smugness/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-1767","author":"Laura","site":"shroudstory"}]
