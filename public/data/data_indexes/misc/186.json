Or rather Sir Kenneth Clark’s cent, as he said\n“… the average man had become progressively less able to recognize the subjects or understand the meaning of the works of art of the past. Fewer people had read the classics of Greek and Roman literature, and relatively few people read the Bible with the same diligence that their parents had done. It comes as a shock to an elderly man to find how many biblical references have become completely incomprehensible to the present generation.”(KC, introduction to”Dictionary of subjects and symbols in Art” by James Hall)\nThe object is labelled a globe because a globe is the correct attribute for an image meant to depict Christ as the Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World). The globe or sphere does stand for the Universe.\nNot knowing this has lead some fancyful people  to draw very odd conclusions\nhttp://sprezzatura.it/Arte/Arte_UFO_1_eng.htm\n(scroll down to “ESALTATION OF THE EUCARISTY” (Detail of the Trinity) by Ventura Salimbeni)\nViviana Castelli\n\n","date":"January 24, 2012 at 8:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/23/has-playful-leonardo-left-us-a-clue-in-the-salvator-mundi/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7471","author":"media-e-midia","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Has Playful Leonardo Left Us a Clue in the Salvator Mundi?","post":"Dorothy, puede usted encontrar una imagen de gran resolución del Salvator Mundi atribuido a Leonardo en:\nhttp://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Salvator-M…\nUna magnífica iconografía comentada (en francés) de OTROS Salvator Mundi con “bola” de cristal (¿) en:\nhttp://www.arretsurimages.net/vite.php?id=11679\nUn magnífico foro con muy interesantes comentarios (en español) y muy buena iconografía en :\nhttp://terraeantiqvae.com/forum/topics/anuncian-el-descubrimiento-de?groupUrl=historiadelarte&groupId=2043782%3AGroup%3A16225&id=2043782%3ATopic%3A128261&page=1#comments\n\n","date":"January 24, 2012 at 8:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/23/has-playful-leonardo-left-us-a-clue-in-the-salvator-mundi/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7465","author":"co","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Has Playful Leonardo Left Us a Clue in the Salvator Mundi?","post":"El primer link parece no funcionar.\nPruebe con:","date":"January 24, 2012 at 8:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/23/has-playful-leonardo-left-us-a-clue-in-the-salvator-mundi/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-7467","author":"co","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Has Playful Leonardo Left Us a Clue in the Salvator Mundi?","post":"In Hebrew my name (Hamon) means “Universe”, “Vast World”.

XXVII, 59 : « Et accepte corpore, Joseph involvit illud in sindone munda. »). Besides, the Constantinopolis Holy Mandilyon, as a “monstrance”, had a large central pearled oculus made of a rock crystal for beholders to see the Holy Face through it (“and the rock was Christ”). It might well mean “seen/painted after the Face of the Sindone Munda”. I hope the information is useful and… crystal clear. \nIn two previous blog postings, I also wrote:\nNovember 23, 2011 at 9:01 am | #1\nIt is most likely Leonardo Da Vinci had access to either the Veronica (The actual Veil of Manoppello) or the Turin Shroud or both as a member of the secret society of Artists called The Knights of The Mist.\nNovember 23, 2011 at 9:06 am | #2\nIt is also most
