One can be sure that the ecclesiastical authorities in Turin and Rome know about this and now more care has to be taken with what is published in Shroud newsletters and websites. Why?

This is not conducive to producing reliable Shroud studies, to attracting academics and to winning the confidence of those who decide in Rome.\n\n","date":"September 18, 2013 at 1:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/18/email-of-the-day/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-44629","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"}]
