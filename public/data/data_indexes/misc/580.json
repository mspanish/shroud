[{"title":"Voice of Russia: Relics of the True Cross and More","post":"Perhaps there’s some consultancy positions here for some surviving members of the STURP team.  The Voice of Russia web-site mentions that a few of the alleged relics from the True Cross proved to be fir, and I guess there wouldn’t have been much of that ever growing in Jerusalem. \nI’ve written postings on the Vera Crux on this site before.  The Crusaders carried the cross-beam, found by Helena, as a talisman into battle; It was lost in 1187 on the field of Hattin in Galilee in the Frankish battle with Saladin, who dragged it tied to the tail of his horse through the streets of Damascus, after which it disappeared.  I guess his soldiers might have used it for firewood.  I’d say there wouldn’t be many authentic relics from the cross-beam, although possibly some fragments might have found there way back to Europe. \nA surviving fragment of Helena’s Titulus Crucis was said to have been rediscovered in 1492 in the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome.  The surviving fragment is clearly only a portion of the original.  It weighs 687 gm, measures 25.3 cm × 14 cm × 2.6 cm, is made of walnut wood, was originally painted white, and with incised letters showing traces of red or black.  The sequence of the lettering is Hebrew (or Aramaic), Greek and Latin, which is at variance with the gospels of Luke and John who both give different sequences.  Some have argued that this sequence difference is an argument against forgery. The Greek and Latin lettering reads from right to left, either through ignorance or as a parody of the Hebrew.  In 2002, the University of Arizona conducted carbon dating tests, and asserted that the present artifact was made between 980 and 1146 AD.  But of course we’ve heard all about problems with C14 tests before.  On the other hand it may have been intended as a replica of the original, which certainly existed as attested by several witnesses including Egeria 383 AD, Antoninus 6th c, Saints Cyril of Jerusalem, Ambrose of Milan, and John Chrysostom.  \nA good reference work which makes a fascinating read on the True Cross is: “The Quest For The True Cross”:by Carsten Peter Thiede and Matthew D’Ancona; Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2000.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2012 at 7:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/voice-of-russia-relics-of-the-true-cross-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10855","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Voice of Russia: Relics of the True Cross and More","post":"One of the most remote and ancient monasteries in Spain is Santo Toribio de Liebana. The monks custody what according to tradition is  the biggest piece of the Lignum Crucis (cross). Its vertical stick is 69 cm high and the horizontal one measures 39 cms. In 1958 the Spanish Highest Council of Scientific Research (CSIC), the most important research body in Spain at that time (and probably now) analyzed this relic. They concluded that the wood was cypress being its botanic name “sempervivens L”, a very common species in Palestine. Their analysis- I don`t exactly know which ones- concluded that the relic might well be 2000 years old. However, nobody can go any further and claim that Jesus was nailed on that cross.

He then set off for Rome to obtain ratification of Herod’s final will from the emperor.  During his absence, a rebellion broke out resulting in the Syrian governor crucifying 2000 rebels.  Unless provenance of the Spanish relic can be tied to Helena’s discovery (which is supported by the Titulus), I guess it could be anybody’s cross even if it proves to be 2000 years old,  That so many were executed by crucifixion may be one explanation of why alleged relics of the True Cross were so plentiful, although of course many others have also proved to be definitely fake, even made from European fir.  \nWe might speculate whether collective memory of the troubles following Herod’s death led to Matthew’s infancy narrative of the Slaughter of the Innocents, for which there is no other written corroboration.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2012 at 4:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/voice-of-russia-relics-of-the-true-cross-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10870","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Voice of Russia: Relics of the True Cross and More","post":"Daveb, the tradition says that this cross was, as you mention, discovered by Helena. More precisely, three crosses were discovered and to identify the true one, Macarius the bishop of Jerusalem at that time put them on the body of a recently deceased man. In contact with the authentic cross that man came back to live. Please note that this is tradition and legends.
