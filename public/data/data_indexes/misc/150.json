[{"title":"Everyone Goes to Heaven?","post":"Based on what I’ve read, early church fathers such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Macrina the Blessed, and Isaac of Syria to name a few, endorsed Christian universalism, i.e. all mankind will eventually go to heaven. Gregory of Nyssa, a revered saint in both the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, even believed that Satan himself would one day be healed, redeemed, and restored through the mercy and power of Christ. In addition, Basil the Great, Augustine, and Jerome, all of whom supported what we now call the traditional view (eternal damnation for the impenitent), wrote that during their day (4th & 5th centuries), ‘the mass of men’, ‘many’, and ‘very many’ in the Christian community endorsed the Christian universalist view. Christian universalism, along with eternal damnation and annihilationsim (God simply destroys the impenitent & wicked) were the three main eschatological views during the first 500 years of Christianity. With the influence of Augustine and the Origenist controversies in the 550s AD, Christian Univeralism would become a tiny minority position over the next 1500 years.\nFor clarification purposes, Christian universalism is not to be confused with religious pluralism (many paths to God) or Unitarian universalism. Christian/Trinitarian Universalism accepts the following: the Holy Trinity as the one true God, the divine inspiration of scripture, the virgin birth of Christ, the miracles of Christ, the Deity of Christ, the sacrificial death of Christ, the bodily resurrection of Christ, the reality of Hell (albeit of finite duration), and the concept of eternal life as a gift of God’s grace through the merits of Christ.\nWhen it comes to the reality of Hell, more specifically, Christian Univeralism posits that Hell is very real, but is meant to cleanse, humble, purge, and reform the sinner. In this view, it has been said, God is seen as a Cosmic Physician, not a Cosmic Sadist. \nFinally, as the article stated, Julian of Norwich seemed to be a Christian Universalist. On a side note, Ann Bronte and Abraham Lincoln were Christian Universalists. Even today, ‘hopeful universalism’ is tolerated in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some evangelical sects, though ‘dogmatic universalism’ is not.\nA fascinating topic. I wonder if this view, much like the status of the Shroud, would be more effective in potentially opening the hearts and minds of skeptics? After all, this view seemed to be most prevalent when Christianity was taking on and besting the premier Roman and Greek philosophers in ancient times.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2014 at 1:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/04/everyone-goes-to-heaven/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-110898","author":"Ryan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Everyone Goes to Heaven?","post":"Ryan, I find it strange that you never referenced Jesus in your long comment.

Greek was their mother tongue, and as you well know, Greek was the original language of the New Testament. Based on their writings and the writings of some current Christian universalists, the english word ‘eternal’, in certain contexts, does not necessarily mean endless. Instead, it (in the original Greek) can mean a long, but finite period of time. It’s a long, complex grammatical debate, of which I am not an expert, but I’ve read that ‘Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts’ is a good resource on the topic.\nAlso, when it comes to ‘proof texts’, one can read certain bible verses which seem to clearly support eternal damnation, others which seem to clearly support annihilationism, and others (particularly in the Gospel of John and several of Paul’s epistles) which seem to clearly support universal salvation, through Christ. Obviously, they can’t all be right, so Christian universalists often attempt to view these specific verses through the lens of the whole biblical narrative, from Genesis to Revelation.\nFinally, if you are an evangelical, I’ve heard ‘The Evangelical Universalist: Second Edition’ is a thought-provoking resource on the topic.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2014 at 6:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/04/everyone-goes-to-heaven/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-111095","author":"Ryan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Everyone Goes to Heaven?","post":"Ryan, I am Orthodox.

Anyone who shows it to experts can expect to be laughed out of court. I did on-site research in different kinds of spiritualist sects when I was doing a course in Parapsychology. There were different worldviews, different rituals, prayer meetings, different reactions, emotional outbursts, people who claimed to be possessed by evil entities, others who claimed to be receiving messages from those beyond this world. The purpose was to try and determine how much could be traced to the subconscious, how much was genuine spiritual experience, and how much was what Freud would call catharsis.\nSister Lúcia of Fatima (Portugal) said she had seen souls suffering in hell, but no description was provided. I went there many years ago, when in college, and the place seemed to be one appropriate for such visions.

I also believe that God is all merciful, but he is also all Just. The cross is where perfect Mercy meets perfect Judgement. Unfortunately, perfect freedom precludes universal salvation. People can, and do reject and ridicule Jesus, who is the only way out of hell. I only referenced the video because you mentioned NDE’s. These videos are not essential for my belief in hell, but the bible is. There is no mention of any Purgatory like punishment before salvation. We are cleansed by the blood of Jesus and He paid the price in full, once and for all. I don’t believe that Jesus left any room for doubt, I can list a multitude of references clearly indicating the concept of Hell, from parables to straight talk by Jesus. You are right, people would laugh at these videos, but Jesus himself said that even if people came back from the dead no one would believe them. Sister Lucia’s testimony is also very interesting, thank you for bringing that up.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2014 at 10:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/04/everyone-goes-to-heaven/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-111281","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Everyone Goes to Heaven?","post":"Thanks for the comments, Mike. I do agree with a lot you are saying and the saying of Jesus you refer to. Since you are an Orthodox Christian it may interest you to know that there is another claim about Fatima. Pope John Paul II is said to have dedicated Russia to the Virgin, as that was said to be one of the requests during the apparition, and had asked Catholic and Orthodox bishops all over the world to join him, at a given moment, which is what they did. Soon after, it is said, Gorbachev put an end to communism in the country. This was around 1985.There was a report in the Italian monthly “30 Giorni”, that was published in about six languages before it closed down, however the archives are still available online and you may find it there if you have the time to search.

General Sisi (army commander) was personally hired by Morsi (MB ex-president). God works in mysterious ways and prayer and fasting can really move mountains.

It was a crusade which deviated from the purpose and fought by mercenaries paid by the Doge of Venice. Patriarch Barthlomew will be in Jerusalem together with Francis and the Maronite patriarch al Rahi also plans to join them, if he can go without problems.

The difference is that there is separation of church and state in the US, in England the head of state is also the the head of the Anglican Church, which is official. During the coronation in Westminster Abbey the prince is anointed by the head of the Church. It is not like that in the US, where the next president can take the oath on whatever book he wants, that is what real separation of church and state means. If it has not happened now, that is only because society there is largely religious, but this is slowly being corroded with the rise of secularism.\nThe opposite is taking place in Muslim countries, with Christians butchered in a number of these countries.
