[{"title":"From Nature News: On Science and Religion","post":"I beg pardon for this very long message.\nBut I tried to contact the website (Nature) and I was not able to send the following message :\nIn the past (year 2002) appeared an interesting study :\nAnalysis of Pigmentary Materials on the Vinland\nMap and Tartar Relation by Raman Microprobe Spectroscopy\nby\nKatherine L. Brown and Robin J. H. Clark\n— — —\nThe VM is a world map on parchment measuring 28 cm by 40 cm which\nincludes, significantly, representations of Iceland, Greenland and\nthe north-eastern seaboard of North America (“Vinland”).\n— — —\nThe map and manuscript were analyzed by Raman microprobe\nspectroscopy using a Renishaw System 100 with a 632.8-nm laser\nand fiber-optic probe. Laser powers of between 0.5 and 5 mW at\nthe sample were used over accumulation times of up to 800 s.\nThe laser spot size was \u00185 ím in diameter using a 10\u0002 lens as\nthe probe objective.\nAreas of study were selected on the basis of pigment density\nor other specific features of interest.\n— — —-\nThe use of Raman microprobe spectrometry has conclusively\nidentified the materials used in the construction of two significant\nhistorical documents, the Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation.\nAlthough the inks used for the Tartar Relation are entirely\nappropriate for the period of its construction, one of those used\nto draw the Vinland Map is not. The presence of a yellow line\ncontaining anatase, closely associated with a stable carbon ink,\nindicates that the VM is a modern forgery.\n— —-\nBut the Raman analyses are very interesting also in another case.\nHere the question :\nWhat were the results obtained for the Holy Shroud of Turin using the Raman analyses ?\nUnder the address :\nhttp://www.renishaw.it/it/restauro-di-opere-darte–7982\nyou can read the words :\n>Raman analysis is non destructive, and the use of remote fibre probes allows analysis to be performed on virtually any sample in-situ. Renishaw’s expertise in this area was recognised in 2002 when the Sindonic Conservation Committee in agreement with Cardinal Poletto of the Turin diocese, selected their Raman instrumentation to provide analysis of the Holy shroud (also referred to as the ‘Turin’ shroud).\nApparently (and after near ten years) we cannot yet say what happened in 2002 because there is not a public paper on this particular argument.\nSo we cannot see the truth about the Raman analyses …\n— —\nIn the past we have read the old results published in “Nature” (in 1989) and these data are very questionable with respect the probable truth about the age (see : the wrong Chi square value and other presumed errors indicated years ago) also because the recents remarks by prof. Jull (Univ. of Arizona) seemed to be a sort of inconclusive step regarding the total truth for the true epoch (= the main question !) for this ancient relic.\nWhat is the answer from the scientific community ?\n— —\nI believe there is an interesting opportunity for the scientists who want to show the way to obtain the truth : the future papers for the review “Current Physical Chemistry” (see : bentham.org/cpc/FantiHT%20rev.pdf) recollected by the prof. Giulio Fanti.\n—\nI believe that preliminar experiments on several AFM-Raman apparels are able to furnish the useful explanations in order to try the important exploration about the linen fibrils of the famous relic.\nIn any case the silence about the Raman analysis on the Shroud during the year 2002 seems to be an enigma.\nWas that Raman control a failure ?\nHave you found the solution of this enigma before to read the new papers ?\n— —\nRegards,\nPiero Iacazio\n\n","date":"February 18, 2011 at 1:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/18/from-nature-news-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-2516","author":"Piero Iacazio","site":"shroudstory"}]
