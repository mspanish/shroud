It has been mainly left as a field for individual scholars who had sufficient enthusiasm for it.  When it comes to the wider religious aspect, there seems to be a dichotomy.  For example, most New Zealand universities have a Religious Studies department, and there are opportunities for obtaining a major, and post-graduate qualifications.  I suspect most of these tend to be studied on a phenomenological basis in their general approach. However I also suspect that enrolments in the RS departments are probably fairly small, and would have little influence within the wider university campus. Back in the 1980s I obtained a RS major from Massey University in Palmerston North, which I found to be particularly broadening and enlightening. Both Auckland and Otago Universities offer courses in Biblical Studies for a B Theol degree, and again there are opportunities for post-graduate studies. The various church seminaries also have their curricula of course, but these would usually have vocational and ministerial objectives, rather than academic.  The general university approach in our present age has tended to become in my view far too compartmentalised and narrow, diected at specific occupational training, and truly educated people with a broad range of knowledge and understanding have now become a rarity. I have cited the NZ experience, which is what I know, but I dare say the situation is not much different in other westernised countries.\n\n","date":"September 15, 2013 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-44344","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?","post":"Father Joseph A.

I’m personally aware of several instances in New Zealand and such incidents are typically found in Earthquake Engineering journals. One of the evangelists (John, from memory) even attributes movement of the stone to the EQ, but includes an angel in the story. My personal view is that the story of the EQ is not intended as a mere literary device, but was an actual event. It provides a “naturalistic” explanation for the movement of the stone. It’s also possible that the EQ may have had a role in forming the image, such as by the release of radon gas which commonly occurs during EQs, and also possibly by concurrent variations in the geo-magnetic/electric fields.

If the learned doctors, or whatever they are, really believe  that ‘concurrent variations in the geo/magnetic gobbledy-gook’ could account for the image of the Man, then reproduce it in a laboratory.

The TS happens to be one of the very few burial cloths that no longer contain human remains. Clearly the image formed before corruption set in. Are images that form soon after death then eradicated by corruption products. We do not know, because no-one has ever looked, and it has never been researched. \nIt is not necessary to believe that the TS image was caused by naturalistic means, nor is it necessary to believe it was caused by some supernatural agency.  However, before asserting that the image was created by some miraculous means, then one ought to eliminate the possibility of it being caused by some as yet unknown natural process.  To date this has not been done.\nThere are very many amazing cures, such as at Lourdes, and other various wondrous events. However only a very few of those that are examined are eventually declared to be miraculous.  The Medical Councils at both Lourdes and at the Vatican Causes of Saints exercise extreme caution in attesting that examined events have no natural explanation, and only a small percentage are so validated.  That is not to say that other unattested cures may also be miraculous. The TS, arguably the most important relic in Christendom, needs to be approached with similar caution, before making any rash assertions about it. \nConcerning the role of earthquakes in forming the image. I did not say that radon gas caused the image, only that it may have had a role.  This has been researched by Giovanna De Liso in the seismically active area of Piedmont over a period of 12 years. Her efforts are one of the very few cases where I have seen any naturally caused images that appear at all persuasive. She used variously treated cloths, measured the various effects of radon gas, atmospheric conditions, variations in the magnetic and electric fields and so on. It seemed that the presence of iron-bearing rocks were important. She claimed that images only formed under very specific circumstances. She produced images of a snake and a metallic key. Her paper has sometimes been criticised, because these were only small objects. You can find her paper at:\nhttp://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf  \nI am personally inclined to the view that the TS image is what I call a second-order miracle.  That is, Providence so arranged matters that the very many necessary rare conditions that would produce an image, came together at the same time. It may not have required that the Laws of Nature be suspended for it to happen. However, for all we know, it may not be as rare as we might imagine. We need to remember that the image is not that of a glorious resurrected Christ, but is that of a very dead corpse. To my mind that would seem to rule out the likelihood of the image being caused by the Resurrection event.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2013 at 12:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-44488","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?","post":"I must admit you lost me.  “It is not necessary to believe the image was caused by naturalistic means, or miraculous means.”  Are there any other possibilities? If there are, could you suggest some? I mean, maybe I don’t quite “get it” but if it did not happen by forces in nature, or out of nature, then what are we left with? I think the TS has been approached by the most sophisticated scientific equipment and the soundest methods available to modern man, for upwards of forty years now.  I have been following events concerning the TS since the STRP team in the 1970’s.  “We don’t know if any other burial cloths contain images,” archeological evidence has never produced any, has it? “We need to remember that the image is not of a glorious resurrected Christ, but of a very dead corpse. That would seem to rule out etc.”  I am sincerely looking forward to your sharing your unique insights on the mechanism of the Resurrection.  I had always believed that, barring the information given in the Gospels, this constituted a mystery known only to the Almighty. Christ’s physical body did, indeed, die.  Without his complete, utter, physical demise, the whole idea of the Resurrection kind of collapses. Experiments attempting to re-create artificially an event that you freely admit occurred providentially  would only seem to preclude an accidental occurrence. In fact, you don’t have to look that far.  Any photograph produces a negative, doesn’t it? But who knew how to “treat’ a linen cloth in the first century? Has anyone found any chemicals on the TS that would produce such an effect?  By me, go ahead, study TS all you want. But all you need to know is right before your eyes. I mean, it would have been truly great to get an image of the Lord smiling, waving “toodle loo” or giving the “thumbs up” sign. But that would preclude the need for any faith at all.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2013 at 3:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-44543","author":"Josie L.

In the Gospel, Jesus Himself derided and mourned over the generation that expected “signs and wonders” to prove His sovereignty over the natural and spiritual world.  Perhaps you should read my posting with a little more critique and a little less prejudice.  I have no problem with scientists of any discipline investigating the TS. What could it hurt?  But perhaps you could explain how Mr. Daveb of Wellington NZ can ascribe the production of the TS to neither the natural, or the supernatural.  My clear, and I believe, very fair question was, to what other agency could one ascribe the production of the TS, or indeed the production of any object? Does it not have to be one or the other? Not knowing which is one thing, and I assume that could be the object of scientific inquiry. But it came from one or the other, and a course of investigation must start somewhere. The scientific method demands the formation of an hypothesis. “Neither” does not cut the mustard.  My second concern is how does one spend decades creating the exacting conditions needed to produce an artifact so unique as to merit world-wide scientific attention, and then ascribe its creation to accident and happenstance?  My third, and I believe most overriding concern, is the how Mr. Daveb can assert with any expertise whatsoever that we can “rule out the formation of the image to the Resurrection.” If Mr. Daveb has some knowledge as to the exact, or even approximate, circumstances surrounding the events of Easter Sunday 33 C.E. I would hope he would share them on this blog.  My point is, how can he even begin to theorize about what evidence constitutes, or does not constitute, evidence of the Resurrection or the effects of the same on the ST?And my favorite quote so far?”It might not be as rare as we imagine.” If in the history of scientific inquiry or archeological discovery the like has been found, I don’t know of it. I would call it rare, sir.  Finally, thank you for your heartfelt concern for my frustration levels. Not that you sounded condescending or anything. The simple, the lumpen, and the hoi polloi have as much interest in the progress of Syndonology as those in the exalted and rarified realms of academia.

However I see a strong objection to that hypothesis in that the image is that of a corpse. The gospels refer to the appearances of Christ after the Resurrection, St Paul records his own experience of the risen Christ, and in John’s Revelations, the images of Christ are of a triumphant Son of Man in glory.  None of that is consistent in my mind with the image displayed on the Shroud. One of the reasons why there has been such little progress in arriving at a decision on the origins of the image over the last 40 years, is the inaccessibility of the Shroud to scientific enquiry.  In 1978, the nature of the image was quite unknown, apart from a few properties such as the negativity of the image and its apparently 3-D properties caused by its variations in brightness.  This last is I think strongly suggestive of a possibly naturalistic cause. In 1978, it was not even known if the image was a product of painting or not.  Since then, the Shroud has been largely inaccessible to further enquiry. Investigations have since been confined to very small samples of threads only. I mentioned De Liso’s investigations above, which I think demonstrate that a naturalistic cause may be feasible, and there have been a few other suggestive although less successful attempts as well. As previously mentioned, I’m inclined to consider that the image may be what I have called a seond-class miracle, in that Providence so arranged matters, that the particular circumstances that would produce a naturally caused image combined to do so. We do not even know if in fact whether it is normal for images to form on burial cloths or not, only to be obliterated by subsequent corruption, because no-one has ever bothered to research it.  There are one or two other cases, not as spectacular as the Shroud image, where images were known to form by deceased persons.  The image on the Shroud is not perfect, and there a few gometrical distortions. This would tend to argue against a miraculous cause of the image, which one would expect to show a high level of perfection if it were indeed miraculous.\n\n","date":"September 18, 2013 at 4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-44639","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?","post":"“Matthias: I would be prepared to allow that the Shroud image may have been some kind of by-product of the Resurrection process, whatever that might have been.

However, this is my way around that problem…\nPerhaps the image on the shroud was recorded from the first moments of the resurrection process, perhaps just as the body was commencing dematerialisation. Somehow – I don’t know how, and I am not concerned with that absence  of knowledge given the unknowable mystery of the miraculous resurrection – the image is recorded, then  the body dematerialises. The shroud is left behind, with its image which I might add in my very subjective view is serene in expression rather than tortured, almost expressing a knowing expression of His coming glorified transformation.\nJesus then rematerialises in a spiritual bodily form, and that is his resurrection.\nSo in this way of thinking, the shroud image is a last snapshot of Christ’s mortal body immediately prior to his dematerialisation and then rematerialisation (ie. resurrection). It is the physical record of Christ’s human mortality, which complements the historic record (the bible) and the spiritual record (his immortal presence) of his glorified resurrection    \nSo we have been left with physical, intellectual (the written word) and spiritual confirmation of his status.  ;\n\n","date":"September 18, 2013 at 9:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-44656","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?","post":"You may believe it if you so wish, and you may offer it as an opinion, and you may even be right.
