Next we’ll have theologians discovering atomic particles!  Having had a life-long interest in both disciplines, I’ve come to the conclusion that neither are both as smart as they might imagine.  In the 1930’s Kurt Godel proved that in every rigorous system of mathematics, there are propositions that can neither be proved nor disproved, on the basis of the axioms in that system.  The most successful attempts at rigorous analysis to date were Russell & Whitehead’s “Principia Mathematica”.  A specific example of Godel’s theorem  was given by Paul Joseph Cohen in 1966, demonstrating that the “Continuum hypothesis” was independent of the axioms of set theory.  .  \nI suspect that attempts to prove the existence of God are in a similar category, notwithstanding Aquinas, Kant, or anyone else’s attempts, ladudable as they may be.  . \n“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and not rely on your knowledge.  In all ways, acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight.”  Proverbs 3:5-6.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2012 at 5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/07/higgs-boson-and-religion-and-science/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-13591","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Higgs Boson and Religion and Science","post":"That is not to say that there are not propositions that can be either proved or disproved..  This gives the lie to post-modernists who claim that there can be no objective knowledge, and that therefore everything is subjective.  The point I was striving at, was that very likely the existence of God cannot be rigorously proved as an objective truth.  In many cases we have to fall back on likelihoods, and probability, for much of what passes for actual knowledge.  Essentially I assert that the existence of God is a matter of an INFORMED Faith.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2012 at 8:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/07/higgs-boson-and-religion-and-science/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-13599","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Higgs Boson and Religion and Science","post":"After all it may not be the bosson of Higgs yet…http://www.technologyreview.com/view/428428/higgs-boson-may-be-an-imposter-say-particle/?ref=rss\n\n","date":"July 11, 2012 at 12:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/07/higgs-boson-and-religion-and-science/","cat":"off_topic","id":"comment-13740","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Higgs Boson and Religion and Science","post":"Yep. “IT” wasn’t actually found.
