[{"title":"Really? More evidence that verifies Shroud of Turin is Real","post":"First of all, I’d like to say your blog is great.\nNevertheless, I disagree with you about the validy of the “pareidolia hypothesis” in this case.\nIn her last book, which I read, Frale writes she asked his opinion to an expert, papyrologist Mario Capasso, about a possible datation of the letters “discovered” in 1995. Capasso dated the inscriptions from -50 to 50 and found them coherent. \nIn my opinon, clearly, this expert advice is incompatible with pareidolia. (cf. a discussion on this  french forum http://www.linceul-turin.com/forum/forum.html )\nConcerning  the 1995 peer-reviewed paper, I haven’t got it, but in his book (Le linceul de Turin et la tunique d’Argenteuil, 2006) Marion wrote that during his research he worked not only with a real size Enrie photograph but also with other photographs in order to corroborate his findings.\nAnd in an article published a few months ago in the french Revue Internationale du Linceul de Turin (RILT) Thierry Castex said he could also distinguish the inscriptions Marion saw with Barrie Schwortz photography (1978).\n\n","date":"January 20, 2010 at 5:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/01/20/really-more-evidence-that-verifies-shroud-of-turin-is-real/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-938","author":"cazab","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Really?

More evidence that verifies Shroud of Turin is Real","post":"The fact that the letters on the shroud say ‘Jesus the Nazorean’ is revealing, for if it were written during the Middle Ages is would most likely have said ‘Jesus of Nazareth,’ or ‘Jesus the Nazarene’ both of which are inaccurate.\nJesus or Yeshu was a Nazorean and not from Nazareth a town no one at that time had ever heard of until the fifth or sixth century when a Christian Roman Emperor made the town of Nazareth in Galilee the official home of Jesus because he wss embarrassed that no such town existed.\nThe Nazarenes were an order of Nazarites created by Apollonius of Tyana about a decade after the crucifixion so quite obviously Jesus could not have been a Nazarene. To learn more about how the Romans usurped the ancient scriptures of Yeshu and the Nazorean religion and proclaimed them the revelations of their godman Jesus Christ visit: http://www.nazoreans.com The site is packed with much factual evidence of the Roman fraud.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2010 at 11:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/01/20/really-more-evidence-that-verifies-shroud-of-turin-is-real/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-1224","author":"Donald Shankoff","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Really?

More evidence that verifies Shroud of Turin is Real","post":"THREE THINGS –\n1) In the absence of definitive exclusionary evidence I am stuck with all the other stuff, including:\nNnazarennos “Nazarene” – http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/big-pic-shroud-turin-claim.html\n2) I found a you-tube clip that included both the enhanced photo and the investigator’s script ABOVE AND BELOW each other. NOT superimposed. Unless someone actually jiggerred the pixels even I can make out most of the letters.\nIn the you-tube presentation the incription has been moved from a vertical position on the right hand side of the shroud face and superimposed accross the face. In the original position it would be close to foot long and two or three inches wide.\nA: YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGnEGCJuaA\nB: Large facial representation with all the inscriptions superimposed. http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/big-pic-shroud-turin-claim.html\n3) The coin evidence is a conundrum. The larger full body enhancements clearly show a ‘bug eyed’ look on the right eye [left side of the shroud].\nI used the coin close-up enhancement, copied it to my own software, and bingo. Unless someone has jiggerred the pixels, I can easily see the outline of a coin. More importantly, I can CLEARLY identify the coin as a Pontius Pilate Lepton.\nThe Pontius Pilot Lepton from 30AD [LIZ} or 31AD [LIH] is a distintive coin. It includes a Lituus that looks like a shepherds crook with a surounding inscription TIBEPIOY KAICAPOC. \nMy enlargement clearly shows the outline of a coin and the Lituus sticks out like a sore thumb. It is in the horizontal position with the Lituus starting at the right side of the image, running horizontally then curving up and clockwise and turning in on itself. Just like all the Leptons I have studied that are for sale on the internet.\nBut here it gets interesting. Whanger claims to observe KAICAPOC includes a misspelling where the K is misspelled as a C. My enlargement clearly shows a distinctive C at about the 8:00 position, with the Lituus horizontal.\nHowever, ALL the Leptons I have studied have KAICAPOC starting at near the very top of the Litus and rotating clockwise to near the bottom of the Lituus. Accordingly, I believe Whanger’s ‘C’ is nothing more then a badly executed O or even P in TIBEPIO, given its appearance on the LEFT side of the Lituus.\nNow it gets even stranger. I have identified an actual Lepton where KAICAPOC is CLEARLY spelled with a C at the beginning. But THAT C is located way to the left of the Lepton. If the Lituus is placed horizontally, as in the shroud, the C in CAIPOC is at the 12:00 possition. Not 8:00.\nThis is where I would EXPECT to find the beginning of the word KAICAPOC, whether with C or K.\nSTILL. If the image was not jiggerred, I clearly found a lepton coin on the right eye with a very distinctive Lituus on it.\n\n","date":"April 11, 2010 at 1:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/01/20/really-more-evidence-that-verifies-shroud-of-turin-is-real/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-1246","author":"David Rapalyea","site":"shroudstory"}]
