[{"title":"Update on the Debate Blog Proposal","post":"So the Debate itself will be limited to a few knowledgeable participants: with outsiders being able to read the “conversation”… is that the idea? I think it’s unique and interesting. \nI’m glad the participants will be limited, otherwise it’s bound to degrade into emotional outbursts from all sides. Controlled participation is more likely to end up with a very intelligent and indepth discussion, with a Full Presentation of ideas from both sides. \nI don’t care to participate but I’d like to Lurk and see how the discussion plays out. It’s a noble effort, in my opinion. :)\n\n","date":"September 16, 2011 at 2:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/15/update-on-the-debate-blog-proposal/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3891","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Update on the Debate Blog Proposal","post":"Annie,\n– Thanks.  We encourage lurkers, but lurkers can become participants (advisers) anytime they wish.\n– Great to hear from you.  (I don’t use “great” lightly.)\n– The two sides will each have just one spokesperson — one person ultimately responsible for the content — but, each side may recruit as many advisers as desired.\n– My email address is rsavage@nycap.rr.com.  Get in touch, and I’ll put you on our mailing list.\n— Rich (Jabba)\n\n","date":"September 16, 2011 at 1:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/15/update-on-the-debate-blog-proposal/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-3909","author":"Jabba","site":"shroudstory"}]
