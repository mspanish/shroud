Admittedly, I have not read the five sequential articles you mentioned above.  I did read the paper referenced in the blog.  One of the main issues, which I’m sure you can appreciate, is that the objectivity of pattern recognition is at best, controversial.  This is a different technique than reading a number off of a machine or visualizing a radioactive band on a gel at a specific defined mobility in reference to a standard.  Then again, pathologists are trained to critically observe specific details of tissues to decide if they are diseased or healthy.  So, certainly within one’s own perspective.  \nIn reading the (linked) article, there were figures showing embryonic patterns in scorch/patch areas.  If no such fire had occurred, or the cloth had not been folded as such to create a template for the regularity/symmetry of such burn patterns, this would not be an observation.  Is this really a property of the cloth, per se or just a result (“artifact”) of the cloth’s storage history?

I have now examined Dr Diaz’s paper in detail, and those of his observations which are true are very simplistic, and those which are scientifically complex are not supported by evidence. Trying to understand how the connection came to be made leads me to guess that because chaotic cell growth sometimes produces blobs that loosely resemble embryos, and because some vaguely embryo-like shapes can be seen in the burn marks of the shroud, there must be some connection. No such connection is established.\nSection 1 is devoted to the observation of embryo-like shapes observed in irregular cellular masses. They range from the shape of a very early embryo with no observable limbs to an almost fully formed looking fetus with well defined wrists and ankles. In only one picture is there any evidence of an umbilical cord. So far, so unsurprising. These shapes could be found in any random assemblage of blobs. In spite of considerable care in discovering and photographing these shapes, there is no suggestion that they are, in fact, anything more than that. No evidence of spine, brain, bone or any organs is attested. Although some of the pictures shows a dark spot on the “head,” others show spots dotted around the body, and random separations and smudges. \nSection 2 is devoted to materials (photos of the shroud) and methods (attempting to match shapes on the shroud to “prior morphological visualisation” – start with a vague shape and try to match it somewhere). It is a very short section and does not explain what the prior morphological visualisations were or how they were matched to shapes on the shroud.\nSection 3 begins: “In horizontal position by extracting the central man that appears in the front image, we identify dark emission of central 10 -12 spectral lines.” This is nonsense. No evidence is shown of how the ‘central man’ was ‘extracted.’ If he was, and it is possible, then we could be left with the famous ‘bands’ which are usually explained as artefacts of the random distribution of different darknesses of the hanks of warp threads in the cloth. The term ‘spectral lines’ is genuinely meaningless in this context.\nThe next sentence is: “These spectral lines evince narrow alignment that delimiting head area and undergoes a curve, broadening at level of the lower extremities, this signify that some type of photon source energy its generate in the brain and decay slowly at distal level.” This is illustrated by a picture of the shroud, with 7 longitudinal lines sketched in stretching from wrists to ankles, spaced sufficiently widely to touch the patches on both sides, and 7 more from the top of the head to the stomach, closely spaced so that they fit within the frame of the hair. Allowing from translational difficulties, this appears to mean that Diaz observed dark lines radiating from the brain and widening out towards the feet. This observation is not illustrated in the paper, and the illustration which does accompany it does not show anything of the kind.\nNow the paper takes off into wild speculation without any evidence at all, and in direct contradiction to every previous observation or explanation of the shroud, whether for or against authenticity. “Outside the main body man image there is no evidence of these spectral lines.” This is simply not true, as a glance at shroudscope will verify. “The spectral lines generate a hexagonal pattern.” This is also not true, as a glance at the paper’s own accompanying illustration will verify. “Other chiral pattern are identified in terms of helicity waves.” This is an attempt to turn the outlines of the big water stains into wave pattern, which is explained in the caption to an accompanying illustration as due to “electromagnetic field wave polarisation.”\nNeed I go on? After finding some vaguely embryo-like shapes, Figure 18 compares them to a couple of fully formed foetuses, complete with fingers and toes.\nIt really won’t do.\n\n","date":"October 14, 2013 at 5:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-a-peer-reviewed-scientific-journal/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47454","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In a peer-reviewed scientific journal","post":"God   day,   I  would  like to  continue    TO    explain  in this  scenario   the  defense  of  our  published    article …  the  title   “Geometric triangular chiral hexagon complexes and clonal embryogenic body organization on the Turin Shroud crucified man image: A predictable tissue response to injury”   Please forget for now the embryogenic patterns, “  Diaz EMBRYOGENIC  STRUCTURES   AND   Mary  T ortilas “         and concentrate for a moment m in the geometry that we documented ;  Geometric  triangular  chiral hexagonal  like   crystal  complexes  (  GTCHC ) complexes.

This study is based essentially on macroscopic and histopathologic analyses of 3000 surgical specimens: 2600 inflammatory lesions and 400 malignant tumours  Based on the hypothesis of a collision genesis mechanism and because it is difficult to carry out an appropriate methodological observation in biological systems, the authors designed a model base on other dynamic systems to obtain indirect information in which a strong white flash wave light discharge, generated by an electronic device, hits over the lines of electrical conductance structured in helicoidal pattern. In their experimental model, the authors were able to reproduce and to predict polarity, chirality, helicoid geometry, triangular and hexagonal clusters through electromagnetic sequential collisions. They determined that similar events among constituents of extracelular matrix which drive and produce piezoelectric activity are responsible for the genesis of GTCHC complexes in pathological tissues. This research suggests that molecular crystals represented by triangular chiral hexagons derived from a collision-attraction event against collagen type I fibrils emerge at microscopic and macroscopic scales presenting a lateral assembly of each side of hypertrophy helicoid fibers, that represent energy flow in cooperative hierarchically chiral electromagnetic interaction in pathological tissues and arises as a geometry of the equilibrium in perturbed biological systems .    Pathological tissues are an excellent means of analyzing chaos states and molecular disorder, and identifying order expression through geometry and mirror images in the core of this biological environment, it is a unique fact\nIn a collision state, electromagnetic field generates electrons, and ions split-up and take opposite trajectories and travel to the boundaries of the system where the particles twisted 360° one of another, and appear as mirror images. In physics this is determined as chirality, and chirality is a property of most of the biomolecules. This means the biomolecules are able to produce mirror images. This is one of the vital characteristics that are seen in pathological tissues, polarization from its side induces chirality,\n NOW  please observe  , not  the image of the  man   that  appear in the  centrall   core   of the   shroud    ,  but  around it :  WHAT  you observe  are  patches   and  stagnant  blood ,   , please   observe  the  patches ,…..  what   pattern  has  the  patches?

Geometry that perfectly delimits the man body background. \n How   explain   that  a  man  body   are  structured in the interior   of  a   perfect   spatial hexagonal   formed  and   delimited    by  perfect  order spatial location of   4   triangles  …  how   explain this  visible  order  ? by     fire ,,,,,      scientists who have analyzed so far have focused exclusively  in the  shroud  man image  f without placing attention  un  the    patterns that appear around the main image   .\n What we  observe    here    around  the body it’s the   expression    the   we  called  irreducible  geometry     matrix  .  generated     by  the  piezoelectric  activity   of   collagen    This is the intelligent design that nature selects to generate order from disorder. These are not flat geometry; on the contrary, it has surfaces and volumes and is essentially functionaL ,  geometric order occurs through magnetic field activity In this magnetic domain are attraction and repulsion forces that interact continuousl This law is the only way to explain the elaborate and structured art-like mosaic images that have been documented   which means that there is a nexus, that is, an active intercommunication between these geometries that neither needs to be adjacent nor close   . In this fractal geometry, the distance of the particles is irrelevant because the entangled pairs are created. When pairs of triangles were identified   they become visible and identifiable structures. hidden variants exist and they become visible only when pairs are created. We believe that pair components influence the other component of the pair system even when apart. This communication behavior may come into play by virtue of a strong attraction developing between the colliding partners. that triangular geometric pattern represents for less the way to reorganize disturbed systems This complex is fractal always evolving into more complex geometric hexagonal structures over time-space intervals. It is a predictable and reproducible dynamic system. It is identified on systems in states of disorder regardless of the type of system involved. It has an invariant morphology with sets of triangular mirror images in opposite positions n conjunction with the dimensional organization of intelligent functional geometry   it is determined that an invariant single common denominator pattern can drive multiple change scenarios that emit the precisely shaped signals necessary to incorporate notions of location control.\n    Accordingly, the geo- metric patterns in the cloth appear to be younger than the spectral lines, the embryogenic bodies and the man im- age complete the end sequential space time energy sce- nario and are younger than the geometric complexes, indicating that the collision surface spectral lines geo- metric complexes and embryonic bodies were structured in a sequential way.\n Its this  only  theory?, “ bad  science “ munbo jumbo” “ mary  tortillas “  difficult to prove    a  profesor  that  “ Methinks a mischievous colleague has been sprinkling something on the Professor’s cappuccino that is not chocolate (nor cocoa, unless misspelled)…” (  colinsberry            your   attitude is not the problem     the problem is in your  brain that   not have the  sufficient synaptic connections to understand what we say  you are a pathetic individual , )  sorry, continue,,\nwas necessary to prove    to people   like   colinsberry   that we are were not crazy  or we were under the influence of substances like  “ cocoa” according colinsberry …     how to prove   TO\ncolinsberry       like  brains  that    the  existence  of    GTCHC   COMPLEXES    IDENTIFIED  AT   MICROSCOPIC   LEVEL    WERE REAL.?

The authors have described and documented frac-tal self-assembly of geometric triangular chiral hexagonal crystal-like complex organizations (GTCHC) and interface comet tail effect patterns in cancer processes.

I won’t comment on your medical observations, except that for a scientist to say something like: “Light and magnetism are reflections of the same substance,” in an introduction to some form of “Collision Event” theory is a disappointing start. There is no sense in which either light or magnetism are substances, nor in which they are reflections of any substance or each other. You go on to suggest that you made a model of light discharge over “lines of electrical conductance structured in helicoidal patterns.” If this means anything, it means flashing a lamp over some twisted wires carrying electric current. A diagram of your apparatus would seem to be a basic, even minimal requirement.\nBut no matter, I am happy to leave you to your cancer cells. What you can’t get away with is your description of, and deductions from, the shroud. The core of your argument begins: “please observe the patches ,….. what pattern has the patches? Easy …. Triangular pattern ….

Not.” You go on later to say: “scientists who have analyzed so far have focused exclusively in the shroud man image without placing attention un the patterns that appear around the main image.” This is simply not true, although it is possible that you have not read the articles by Aldo Guerreschi and Michele Salcito (at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo3.pdf and http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo4.pdf) which comprehensively demonstrate how these marks, and the pattern they make, could have arisen without any need for the “piezoelectric activity of collagen.”\nThe whole of the rest of your paper seems to be based on the idea that all the patched holes appeared more or less independently of each other, with the shroud opened out. Some very confused ideas about chirality, reflection, piezoelectric effects, electromagnetic, helicoidal waves and quantum entanglement are adduced to explain what would indeed be a remarkable event, if it were not entirely adequately explained by folding the shroud up and sticking a hot bar through it.\nThis having been done, some water appears to have been poured through the damage, creating clear, dark rimmed stains just above each burn hole. These you liken to the heads of twin foetuses, and the area below them, which has no definition but is fortuitously bordered by burns and scorches, to their aborted bodies. I note with interest the distorted photo from wikipedia that you use to illustrate one of these “embryos;” and am disappointed that I can’t find the other one!\n\n","date":"October 14, 2013 at 3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-a-peer-reviewed-scientific-journal/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47492","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In a peer-reviewed scientific journal","post":"R.I.P. science – thanks to the open-access aka vanity press.   :-(\n\n","date":"October 14, 2013 at 1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-a-peer-reviewed-scientific-journal/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47485","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In a peer-reviewed scientific journal","post":"[deleted because of the insulting content]\n\n","date":"October 14, 2013 at 2:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-a-peer-reviewed-scientific-journal/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-47487","author":"jairo diaz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In a peer-reviewed scientific journal","post":"The gentleman uses the open-access PLOS-ONE in which to publish his bizarre potpourri of ideas.
