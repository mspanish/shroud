Even the plethora of scourge marks, allegedly 372 of them, could be said to make the nudity less explicit, less controversial, via complex patterning of the otherwise bare skin.\n\n","date":"December 6, 2015 at 8:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215714","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Hey Collin, sorry I don’t comment much because of the time it consumes but you referenced an older discussion so I am kinda dragged back into this.

But those same viewers would straightaway have spotted it was not a portrait in the usual sense, and indeed an imprint, with hollows for eyes etc, i.e. what today we would call a tone-reversed negative. If an imprint of the face alone, that would make it essentially no different from the Veil of Veronica, but with a difference, namely that the guardians would know that most of the image was concealed from view. How could they bring themselves to withhold that information, knowing they were preventing viewers seeing all the extra information that could be used to describe the image as that of the entire Jesus, and not just on any old sheet of linen, but on Joseph of Arimathea’s “fine linen”, with the visible herringbone weave surely making some viewers make that connection? How many custodians could be relied upon to repress the knowledge that there were scourge marks all over the hidden body, something that could not be deduced from seeing the face alone? How many could repress the information that there was evidence from the blood of nails in hands and feet, and of a lance wound?\nIt’s one thing to suggest that a single squeamish owner may have preferred to display an entire body imprint as if simply a “Veil of Veronica”, suppressing a treasure trove of information that backed the biblical account.  But to suggest that generations of custodians all conspired for 1300 years to maintain the same pretence, the same ‘conspiracy of silence’ without a single word getting out is frankly asking too much.\n\n","date":"December 6, 2015 at 10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215726","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"PS: have just done a quick back-of-envelope calculation. If the TS had been folded so as to expose just the face with a bit of border and then mounted in a frame, anyone picking it up would notice first of all the weight, given that the total linen would weigh approximately 24 times what was expected if a simple single-layer portrait. Their next response might be to tap the stretched linen lightly to explore  further and instead of getting the expected springy response expected from a single layer of linen, their fingers would sink into a wad of linen 24 layers thick.\nSo they would realize immediately that they were looking at a small part of a much larger image. \nLet’s now suppose that the lowest part of the face terminates at chin and/or neck level say. The natural thing would be to slip in one’s fingers to see what was lower down. Do that and one starts to see scourge marks on the upper torso. That would surely be the cue to investigate further down, or to see what was above the head (though admittedly one has to probe a fair distance to discover the second ‘inverted’ head).\nSorry, I simply do not buy into the idea that a heavier-than-expected framed face with no image cut-off at chin/neck level would be taken for granted as “just a compact portrait” of the face only, especially given the enigmatic ‘negative’ character alluded to earlier, to say nothing of the reasonably realistic-looking bloodstains on the forehead, hair etc that would indicate that one was looking at something ominously different from a standard portrait, or even a Veronica-like imprint of the face only.

Relics are treated with great respect in our church, the weight difference is a nonstarter for me because the weight of the cloth could easily evaporate in the weight of the reliquary (probably made of solid wood &/or metal). This is not a 1300 years conspiracy theory. It just takes one believer early on (probably in Jerusalem, Antioch or Edessa) to make that decision and hide the body for respect and the Mandylion would be treated as a Mandylion ever since. It was probably unfolded after it was taken into Constantinople, displayed and witnesses by the crusaders (which is documented). That’s what I believe in and will leave it there.

I gather that that the TS has never been weighed, but from taking samples (radiocarbon analysis etc) and scaling up, the estimated weight is in the region of 9 kilos.\nImagine going into a supermarket with a hand basket, and loading with 9 bags of sugar, each 1 kg. You would soon be looking for a trolley instead. Now imagine you were charged with the task of making a long-term mount for 9kg of linen. That’s going to require a sturdy frame, and a strong backboard too. Overall, you are looking at something probably in excess of 12kg in weight – a conservative estimate.\nHow likely is it that generations of shadowy custodians would observe an initial injunction made centuries ago, indeed close on millennia, to not go peeking, given that a framed face weighs 12kg or more with protective woodwork? The temptation to go peeking would surely get the better of one or other custodian sppner or later, wanting to find what else was in that heavy container. Yes, I know that some churches insist on strict discipline, but 1300 years without a single free spirit or maverick? As much as one is tempted to ‘agree to disagree’  I say “get real”.

The TS has a size of approximately 113cm x 430 cm. For that size, we get 0.021*113*430 = 1020.39 g. This is just slightly above one kilogram. I have a linen cloth of that size and it weighs very close to one kilogram. This is far from the 9 kilos you mentioned.\nBut talking about physics of the Mandylion and whether or not it was a single sheet or a folded sheet, please look at the “Abgar Icon”, where Abgar, represented as Constantine VII, is holding the Mandylion. The right hand is under the Mandylion and the left hand is holding one corner.\n\nCan a single layer sheet of linen of that size be held that way without having the sheet slide down from your hands? It cannot. Can a single layer sheet looks that way? It cannot has the corner would crumple down.\nBut, this is the way it looks if you take a sheet of the size of the TS, fold it to the size seen on this icon, and hold it that way.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2015 at 12:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215759","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Thanks to Mario for his comments, but he has not addressed Colin’s main arguments(which I personally adhere to).\n\n","date":"December 7, 2015 at 12:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215761","author":"PHPL","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Is he sure about his presumption?\n\n","date":"December 6, 2015 at 9:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215720","author":"Dcn Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"“Had there been that iconic double image – both sides of the same man, aligned\nhead-to-head – in someone or other’s possession for 1300 or years prior to Lirey,\nit would have leaked out into the public domain.”\nThere are numerous examples of relics kept at Constantinople and even closer to us, at the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris, for which we have no clear complete description.

That’ll teach me not to go googling in the wee small hours under time pressure. The list of returns showed “9kg” in several places, with references to radiocarbon samples. This morning, in the cold light of day, I find they all go back to a single paragraph in the middle of a 1998 article by a certain controversial microscopist, the one that can be found in the middle of this link:\nhttp://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry/skeptic/shroud/as/mccrone.html\nIt begins with “Some STURP authors admit that the Shroud …”\nWhile considering that 1kg (approx) makes a lot more intuitive sense than 9 times as much, a caveat is necessary. The weighed samples for radiocarbon dating were image-free. What if the image was NOT entirely chemically-modified , i.e. additive-free, linen fibres. Suppose it still had remnants of an applied substance (nope, not gesso or paint, but something more subtle and interesting, like say, er, white flour, er, toasted). Then the weight of the entire TS linen, had it been measured directly, might turn out to be more than 1kg. Even if a mere half or even quartrer kilo greater, that would be a significant new data point that would need to be flagged up to anyone seeking an explanation for the body image.

I even provided some clues as to the presence of the full length image seen in Constantinople and elsewhere.  But the discussion then degenerated into some infantile visual lampooning of my comments making sensible discussion impossible, and I do not seek to make the same mistake twice. \nBriefly, it was not only mere prudery that would have concealed the full length double image, but several other factors as well, and indeed it would be difficult if not impossible to identify a time window within the first millennium when the true nature of the Shroud image could have become publicly known.  \nSome of these factors included:  need for secrecy in face of imperial persecutions until the time of Constantine;  continuing need for later secrecy in face of imperial acquisitiveness of Passion relics;  early reluctance (based on O.T. prohibitions) to depict icongraphy until about the sixth century;  Periods of iconoclasm 726 – 786 & 814 – 842, with icon veneration not being restored until 843;  Byzantine reluctance to reveal to the public gaze those relics considered especially sacred (Mike M comment above);  Byzantine superstition concerning the use of Christ imagery on coinage and for military purposes; a specific reason relating to fear of earthquakes, and likely implicating the Shroud specifically.   \nPrudery also may indeed have played a part.  Even early crucifixion scenes showed a fully robed Christ on the cross.  The Syriac Gospel Book of 586 shows Christ dressed in a full length sleeveless tunic, and as late as the ninth century he wears a colobium over a loin-cloth or a perizoma. \nIn 740 AD Constantinople experienced a series of continuous earthquakes, and this would seem to mark the time when what is likely to have been the Shroud was sealed in a golden chest, and remained closed to all but the emperor for fear of further earthquakes, until about 1201 when it was then regularly displayed in an elaborate ritual.  This seems to have been the ritual observed by Robert de Clari in 1204.  \nThis Byzantine reluctance to expose those things considered particularly holy to the public gaze survive even to the present time.  A vestige of it might be seen in the use of the iconostasis during the consecration in the formal liturgy, concealing this sacred moment from the eyes of the general congregation.  Even in the Roman church until the 1950s we were taught that only the priest might touch the sacred vessels.  \nI mentioned that there were clues.  Perhaps the most salient can be found in the Hymn of the Pearl composed by the Edessan Hymnodist Bardesan about 200 AD, probably on the occasion of the baptism of the court of King Abgar VIII the Great.  It would seem likely that Bardesan might have had the opportunity to view the full-length image at this time. \nA Prince, the son of the King, is divested of his shining robe, and must wrest a pearl from the serpent;  he travels to Egypt, snatches pearl, returns home, but his robe now seems an image of himself;  There are several interpretation, but an obvious analogy is that of Christ being sent to redeem humanity from Satan.  The hymn concludes: \n“On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness. And the image of the King of kings Was depicted in full all over it…”   \nOne interpretation of this strange verse would seem to be: Mirrored image on previously clean robe represents mirrored image of Christ on his clean burial cloth; Robe’s reflecting images suggest ventral and dorsal sindonic images; Suggests that Bardaisan had seen the full body-image at Edessan royal court.  Note the particular recognition of a “Mirror Image”. \nYes, the verse is enigmatic, but recognizable in meaning in terms of the Shroud image.  It had to be enigmatic, to avoid provoking the Emperor in Rome.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2015 at 5:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215779","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"So we have the lack of written records not opposing but in fact supporting authenticity.

This folded Shroud has a total of 32 layers, for a thickness of around 1.2 cm (32× 0.39 mm ≅ 12.48 mm), but because a folded cloth has some fluffiness, it will be between 2 to 3 cm thick, depending if it is bound in a trellis or not. The folded Shroud is 54 cm long by 28 cm wide, which fits nicely in the reliquary of the Mandylion (about 5 cm deep, 60 cm long, 40 cm wide), leaving a few centimeters all around the Shroud at the bottom of that box, and enough space to attach a trellis lengthwise.”) you don’t get the face visible.\nBut the facial image of Mandylion was publically displayed at least in 944 (and perhaps in 1032)! Symeon Magister recounts that while Constantine could see the faint image in its details (eyes and ears: ophthαlmoύς κaι oτα) his two brothers‑in‑law and rivals for the throne could barely make out an outline, see https://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos-jesus-images-in-constantinople-the-documentary-evidence/ Document II.\nAnd take also into account the Jackson’s study on foldmarks:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi11part4.pdf\nThe extended, wider than longer portrayal  of Mandylion, is one of the most often featured characteristics of it (although not unique), see the gallery in Wilson’s presentation:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/wilsonvppt.pdf\nSee also the Templar Mandylion from Breton Calvary:\nhttp://www.cirac.org/infos-uk/shroud.htm\nThere are perhaps ways to fit the Mandylion face into the Sainte-Chapelle reliquary (something similar to the way below), but they are quite bizarre, and do not correspond to the known depictions. \n\nHow do you reconcile the dimensions of Sainte-Chapelle reliquary with known depictions of Mandylion?\nIn my opinion, this is the only serious argument against the Mandylion-Shroud identity hypothesis.\n\n","date":"December 8, 2015 at 12:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215902","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"O.K.,\nAs I have written several times now on this blog, and in the conclusion at http://www.sindonology.org/sainte-chapelle.shtml, it is unlikely that the Mandylion was folded in such a way to show the face only. And as far as it is known from documents available to us today, it was not shown in public with any visible image, not including the face.\nSee in particular the paragraph:\n“It is doubtful that the Mandylion was folded in such a way that only the face of the image on it was visible, either inside or outside of its reliquary. It was folded in its reliquary with all the image hidden, and when shown in public it was most often in the same state because it was likely bound with a trellis to keep it folded. Some depictions of the face directly on the Mandylion were simply an informative method to remind the observer that an image existed on the cloth, not that it was directly visible. For example, this method would have been used in the depiction of Abgar V holding the Mandylion (see Figure 1).”\nAnd as discussed in several places in http://www.sindonology.org/sainte-chapelle.shtml\nthis conclusion is *based on the documents* describing the Mandylion reliquary and the cloth when it is sent and arrives at the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris. This is not a supposition pulled from the imagination, but from descriptive historical texts and observations.\nYou wrote: “But the facial image of Mandylion was publically displayed at least in 944 (and perhaps in 1032)! ”\nWhich historical document states that the Mandylion’s face was shown publicly? References?\nThe face is seen by Constantine VII and his brothers-in-law, but that does not mean it is shown in public. As a matter of fact, the description is such that this appears as a private viewing.\n\n","date":"December 8, 2015 at 1:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215912","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Mario:\nI have checked Gregory Referendarius’s sermon from 944, and Constantine Porphyrogenitus’ The story of the Image of Edessa, and they do not specify whether the mandylion was publically displayed in 944 AD.

It cannot have been shown that way for many reasons….” \nAs it happens, I agree, certainly if one reads the Wilson account with its relatively few foldings being used to isolate the face from the rest of the image (the precise number of foldings depending on how one interprets ‘tetradiplon’). I reckoned on 24 layers of linen to isolate the face, but stand to be corrected (but at least I resorted to your Shroud Scope with a graduated steel rule to arrive at that estimate, so must surely deserve some brownie points for effort).\nBut even if Wilson is wrong, and we need to suppose that a few foldings would have exposed much more than the face alone, it doesn’t alter the main point I am making, namely that there is no record of a full length DOUBLE body image ever being displayed prior to Lirey in 1355 approx. What’s more, there is no evidence, at least in the written  or artistic record, of such a double image ever being in the public domain prior to Lirey.The latter  would not necessarily have required a public display, merely ‘leakage” by a loose-tongued insider of what lay hidden in a frame or reliquary behind the Image of Edessa/Mandylion.\nI shan’t mince my words. I believe it’s time for sindonology to relinquish all the what-ifs and other speculation and fantasizing. The rational position is to accept the TS provisionally at any rate as a one-off 14th century forgery, and concentrate attention on how that remarkable image was achieved using simple and appropriate technology. One should only abandon that position as a last resort if or when something is discovered that definitely lies beyond the realms of known physics, chemistry and biology.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2015 at 1:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215813","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"I don’t see the lack of public display as a deal-breaker at this point.

Constantine VII had a narrow face, and this is what is represented. The face on the cloth is not to scale and it is not even positioned parallel to the cloth edges.

A heavenly vision revealed that the city would not be freed of such ill until such time as the linen cloth with the Lord’s face on it should be locked up and hidden away, far from human eyes. And so it was done. The sacred linen cloth was locked away in a golden case and carefully sealed up, and then the earthquake stopped and the heaven-sent ills ceased. From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake.”  \nAlthough it refers only to the face, it cannot be the Mandylion which had been frequently displayed since its arrival in Constantinople as recently as 945.  This cloth is evidently held in greater esteem than even the Mandylion.  The only other acheiropoietos Christ-image impressed upon linen then present in the city of Constantinople was the Image of God Incarnate.  The reference to the face can be easily attributed to the writer’s limited understanding of what the golden case actually contained. \nThere were two significant candidate earthquakes in Constantinople which might have prompted this seclusion of the relic, the series in 740, and another in 869.  Damage was limited in the 869 quake and it could not be described as continuous, but the 740 series of quakes endured for a year: \n“In the same year (740) a violent and fearful earthquake occurred at Constantinople on 26 October, indiction 9, a Wednesday, in the 8th hour. Many churches and monasteries collapsed and many people died. There also fell down the statue of Constantine the Great that stood above the gate of Atalos as well as that of Atalos himself, the statue of Arkadios that stood on the column of the Xerolophos, and the statue of Theodosios the Great above the Golden Gate, furthermore, the land walls of the City, many towns and villages in Thrace, Nicomedia in Bithynia, Prainetos, and Nicaea, where only one church was spared. In some places the sea withdrew from its proper boundaries. The quakes continued for twelve months.”  [Theophanes, A.M. 6232, p. 412.6 ff]  \n‘The imperial covenant with God was broken at the turn of the thirteenth century. Nicholas Mesarites’ statement, in 1201, that Jesus’ resurrection was being reenacted in Pharos Chapel ceremonials which involved a sindon that had “…wrapped the mysterious, naked dead body after the Passion” confirms that he, and the other participants in this rite, had viewed the image, very likely whenever they lifted the cloth to a vertical position. Three aspects of Mesarites’ statement identify this sindon as the Turin Shroud: his description of the body as naked, his use of the adjective aperilepton, meaning “unoutlined”, which aptly describes the relic’s blurry image, and his claim that the cloth had defied destruction, alluding no doubt to the fire damage evidenced by the relic’s so-called “poker holes”. ‘ [Markwardt, St Louis conference paper]  \nThe covenant was evidently broken by the disreputable emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195-1203).  He was deposed by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade at the instigation of the newly-installed Byzantine co-emperors, Isaac and his son, Alexios IV.  His serial treachery and flagrant desecration of the tombs of his imperial predecessors amply demonstrate that he cared nothing about loyalty or honor, and that he would have thought nothing of breaking a centuries-old imperial covenant with God. \nSo that for some 460 years from 741 to 1201, the Shroud had been consigned to utter obscurity.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2015 at 2:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-215825","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Daveb, you wrote “Although it refers only to the face, it cannot be the Mandylion which had been frequently displayed since its arrival in Constantinople as recently as 945.”\nThe Mandylion was frequently displayed in Constantinople since 945?

Ciggaar, published a French translation of the anonymous Tarragonensis 55 (generally known as the Tarragon manuscript), datable to ca. 1075-1098, written in Latin, and maintained in the Public Library of Tarragon, Spain: Ciggaar, Krijnie N., Une Description de Constantinople dans le Tarrogonensis 55’, Revue des Etudes Byzantines 53, pp. 117ff. (1995). ]\nNor would it seem were there any disastrous earthquakes in Constantinople following the Mandylion’s arrival there in 945, that would have prompted such an action.  But there were such earthquakes there in 740 and a lesser one in 869.  \nPrior to its departure from Edessa, the Mandylion had been viewed several times during the preceding centuries, its container had been opened and the cloth had been viewed by the clergy and the faithful.  Bishop Abramios of Samosata had closely inspected it on its acquisition by the Byzantine Army.  On its arrival in Constantinople it had been viewed by the emperor’s sons after having been carried in procession.  Symeon Metaphrastes recites that, upon the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople, “everyone was looking at the marvelous image of the Son of God on the holy cloth … “.  John Skylitzes’ Synopsis of Byzantine History recites that, in 1036, the Mandylion was carried in procession through the capital in an attempt to end a six-month drought, and Abu Nasr Yahya, a Christian-Arab writer, claims to have viewed the icon within the Hagia Sophia Cathedral in 1058.  It is virtually certain that some Byzantine artists were given access to the Mandylion in order to produce the copies which are dateable to 944-ca. 1090.  \nThis is in stark contrast to the cloth described in the Tarragon manuscript, hidden from all eyes except that of the emperor!  So, what was it?  \nThere is little mention, if any, of the Image of God Incarnate after the iconoclasm periods of 726 – 786, and 814 – 842.  Some had therefore concluded that this Image had been destroyed during the iconoclasm.  However there is no known report of this image having been destroyed.  In fact, as it was acheiropoietos, “not made by human hands” its destruction would have been deemed a sacrilege, as opposed to those images that had been made by human hands, and so deemed legitimate targets for destruction.  Fr Heinrich Pfeiffer believes it was not so destroyed, but possibly adopting a Mandylion = Shroud thesis, he associates it with the Veil of Manoppello.  I have been unable to discover his justification for this conclusion, but perhaps someone else might know his reason.  \nNote that the 740 year of the severe continuous earthquake coincides with the first iconoclasm period, and might well be deemed a justification for ongoing iconoclasm, if depictions of icons were deemed to prompt divine wrath such as in the form of earthquakes, or incidentally even military defeats. \nHowever the fact that the Image of God Incarnate, aka Image of Camuliana, was deemed to be acheiropoietos, would be sufficient to shield it from iconoclasts, and so the solution of sealing it away in a golden casket hidden from all eyes would be adopted. \nThere are several problems in the attempt to identify the Mandylion with the Shroud, as many have reported.  But it seems that a Shroud-like image was being displayed in the Pharos chapel in 1201 accoring to Nicholas Mesarites.  And yet the Mandylion continued to be separately identified in the inventories. \nA good case can be made for the survival of the Image of God Incarnate from the iconoclastic period, that it was the cloth sealed away in a golden casket for some 460 years, hidden away from all eyes except those of the emperor, and this was the cloth that came to be known as the Shroud of Turin.\n\n","date":"December 10, 2015 at 5:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216111","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Returning the plot back to Colin’s main observation, that being the glaring lack of artistic representation (of the non-allusion type) in the historic record, we have to acknowledge this is a very curious fact. But as I’ve mentioned in other comments, it’s not without parallels to other objects.\nIf the faithful truly believed the Shroud was ‘an image not made by human hands’ but a miraculous gift — an imprint of the Son of God — this would make it more than a relic. It (and it’s reliquary) would be akin to the Ark of the Covenant that held the Commandments. The Shroud — sign of the New Covenant.\nTo this day the Ark, supposedly housed in a small chapel in Ethiopia, is not opened for anyone. Such is the power of superstition and/or faith.\nGiven the superstitious nature of the faithful of the turn of the millennium (as DaveB has commented upon), led to believe whatever the clergy told them, is it difficult to imagine that the Shroud was kept from direct viewing? For who can look upon on the face of God and live?!\nNo doubt this will all seem like fanciful authentist claptrap, but God is both Science and Narrative.

This might account for the absence of any representation of the Shroud double image from the first millennium.  On the resumption of iconography in 843, the likeness of the Image of God Incarnate would have been long forgotten, until the casket was re-opened around 1201.  But with one possible exception:  Bela III, as heir apparent to the Byzantine Imperial Throne, might well have been entitled to view the image.  Upon returning to Hungary, after his betrothal was annulled, his recollections of what he saw may have informed the illustrator of the Hungarian Pray Codex.

Indeed, we now have not just one but two qualifying assumptions being fielded to explain the non-appearance of the double body image until the Lirey badge – first, that the face only was ever displayed, the rest being hidden, and now we’re told that even the face was not displayed on the ritualistic two days per week (non) showings but only once a year, and then only viewable from a distance (a third qualifying assumption).\nI need hardly remind you that science has a standard response to an argument, any argument, that is hedged about with qualifying assumptions.

I suspect that it was Jeanne de Vergy who actually started putting the  Shroud up as a relic. Unfortunately she was not canny enough to create a back story to give it some claim to authenticity as was  usual in these cases- or if she did it has not been recorded.\nIn her unsuccessful attempts to prove ownership of the Shroud, Margaret de Charny did at one point claim that it was given to her grandfather as a spoil of war.

It was as early as 1343 that the French king, Philippe VI,  granted de Charny permission to raise the money for building by amortizing feudal land. With the money in hand, de Charny then petitioned the papal court at Avignon for the right to have masses said continually for his family and to have a family burial ground near to the church. None of these documents mention a shroud. Lirey was essentially a church in which prayer would be offered for Geoffroy and his family after his death. There are many cases where indeed a church was built specifically to house a relic (usually in a place on an existing pilgrimage route!)  but remote Lirey was not one of these.\nI suppose it is possible that the de Charny family gave the Shroud to the canons of the church perhaps after pope Clement VII declared that it was not the authentic burial shroud but no surviving document mentions this.  Yet Pierre d’Arcis claiims that the Dean procured the Shroud and this could only have been after the official election of the canons on October 1354. When Margaret’s  second husband , Humbert de Villersevel, removed ‘a cloth, on which is the figure or representation of the Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ’, presumably our Shroud, he promised it would return to the CANONS when peace had returned. But as we know, Margaret grabbed it, tried to fight off the canons when they wanted it back and then passed it on to the Savoys in 1453. The canons eventually gave up but they, not  the de Charny family,  were certainly seen as owners at the beginning of the fifteenth century and, according to Pierre d’Arcis, as early as the 1350s.\nNo problem in ploughing your lonely furrow, Colin, and doing whatever detective work you want but you do need to provide documentation if you are going to be an effective historical detective.

But your section on the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge, taxing, indeed mind-numbing  as it is to anyone attempting to extract any meaning, finally seems to say that the makers of the Lirey badge chose to show the body as naked, implying there was a loin cloth on the original TS (which you claim has since selectively worn away, along with crown of thorns). That suggestion is TOTALLY without a shred of evidence, and has to be seen as a self-serving attempt to embroider a junk hypothesis.\nHere’s the passage in question. I leave folks here to judge for themselves.Enjoy! \n“There is one more fascinating feature of the painting of the Shroud and it concerns the loincloth. A Pilgrim Badge of c.1355 shows the images on the Shroud as naked. Two hundred years later, in a depiction of the Shroud taken from a prayer book of Marguerite de Valois, dated to 1559, the images are still naked. Only 20 years later, when the Shroud was exposed in Turin in 1578 after its transfer to his new capital by Duke Emanuele Filiberto I, the loincloth was on it: an engraving of this exposition by Giovanni Testa shows it clearly. It continues to be shown in depictions of the next two centuries, with enough similarity between portrayals to suggest that artists were copying from the original. Why was it suddenly there?\nWhile I was researching depictions of the Shroud I was shown an engraving from the Royal Library in Turin. Engraved by Carlo Malliano in Rome in 1579, it had been reproduced in different formats with the Shroud as a template, always with a loincloth in place, although with different figures and backgrounds associated with it. In the Turin Library example the presiding clergyman was Francesco Lamberti, Bishop of Nice (which was then within Savoy territory). Intriguingly, Lamberti had been present at the Council of Trent in 1563 and had signed the decree banning lascivia in religious art, the same decree that had led to the nude figures in Michelangelo’s Last Judgement being covered up. Had Lamberti insisted on placing the loincloth on  the Shroud? Possibly: but there was another candidate.\nThe exposition of 1578 was important because the star guest welcoming the Shroud’s arrival in Turin was none other than the archbishop of Milan, Carlo Borromeo, a devotee of the Shroud, who visited it not just in 1578 but in 1581, 1582 and 1584, the year of his death. One of the most powerful figures of the Counter-Reformation, Borromeo had been secretary to his uncle, Pius IV, in the closing sessions of the Council of Trent of 1562-63. He approved of the decree on lascivia and insisted that Milanese artists followed it. It is likely, therefore, to have been either Lamberti or Borromeo who insisted that the naked buttocks of the image be covered up with a painted loincloth. Today the loincloth has vanished and only a lighter patch over the buttocks suggests its previous existence.”\nAs for peer-review, the process for books, intended for popular consumption, is ENTIRELY different  from that of paper submitted to a learned journal.\neasy:\n\n","date":"December 11, 2015 at 3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216238","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"No, I don’t imply there was ever a loin cloth on the original Shroud.

We have evidence that he ordered other nude figures to be covered up.\nI am quite happy with the support I have received from academic historians and others who have contacted me over my article.

My own suspicion, no more than that, is that it came from the Rhineland but that is another issue which I need to accumulate a lot more evidence on.\nThe Lirey badge has two clerics holding up the Shroud in front of the empty tomb. This is what is laid down in the Quem Queritis ceremony with the  two clergy representing Peter and John who found the empty tomb and the grave cloths. The ceremony was a re-enactment of this with the two holding the burial cloth in extenso in front of the tomb and the\ncongregation  early on Easter Monday.\ni suspect that the Shroud is too big to have been made for  a small private chapel as Lirey but I found an interesting reference to the fact that the altar in Cologne is the  same size as the Shroud and cloths were displayed on it at Easter,.

It is common practice to suggest avenues of research that one might not be able to carry out oneself in the hope that someone with the right linguistic skills, professional expertise and time  might pick them up.\nIn many areas, research on the Shroud has hardly begun. Too much time has been spent navel gazing at the Shroud images and virtually nothing on the painted linen possibilities although to be fair it is only in the last fifteen years that serious work has been done on these and scanners are able to show what the original painted surfaces and primers below them were made of. I hope that one day an expert will simply fit the Shroud into the research, just as the horses of St. Mark’s, Venice can now be seen,from work on the gilding of similar statues, to be second or third century AD.\nUnlike some I am happy to wait for the origin of the Shroud to become clear probably in the next five to ten years. I am keeping a watching brief on work on painted linens and will certainly let everyone know if the Shroud Turns out to be a typical of other ‘once painted now decayed’ linens. The Zittau Veil is the best similar example I know of ( original pigments steamed off leaving images similar to the Shroud on discoloured linen) but no doubt more will come to light and some expert in formerly painted line cloths will be able to make effective comparisons with the Shroud. \n I cannot really start retraining as an expert in the conservation of linen so I will have to leave this to the existing experts! Patience needed but with the enormous strides in scanning techniques in recent years I am sure that the Shroud will yield its secrets or other cloths so similar will be analysed and  make it obvious how the Shroud images were created.\nThe calcium carbonate found by STURP seems an important clue as it was used in the sealing gesso and, as in medieval times, this was mined for this purposes in Northern Europe, this is one small pointer to the origins of the Shroud there.\n\n","date":"December 11, 2015 at 5:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216246","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Dealing briefly with two points, in reverse order:\n1. Where is the evidence that STURP found calcium carbonate? Finding calcium was not surprising, given that flax has Ca++ in counter-ion association with the negatively-charged pectin, i.e. calcium pectate. Since the  pectin  and assoiated Ca++ is not completely biodegraded in retting,  there’s still calcium pectate in linen. I repeat: where’s the evidence for calcium carbonate specifically? I have yet to see any., or even recognition that calcium does not equate with calcium carbonate unless one has hard analytical data in support of that contention.\n2.  Let’s consider for a moment  the prominent bas-relief nature of the  figure on the Lirey badge, and the need to fashion  a complementary sunken-relief mould from the soft stone. That’s sounds like a lot of intricate work, especially given the small scale. I shall try and find what tools and/or techniques were needed to end up with smooth sunken contours in the stone mould, making the reasonable assumption that the Lirey badge was produced from a Machy-type  mould. For now the key question is “Why would anyone go to all that trouble if merely wishing to represent a painting in miniature? They could simply have engraved, ie scratched lightly,  as per the herringbone background, if wishing to portray a mere painting.\nYup, someone here seems to have overlooked the fact that a medieval artisan must have gone to a great deal of time and  trouble to link the Shroud double-body image on its very first display with 3D properties, reinforcing the idea of an IMPRINT left  by a real 3D person, albeit recently deceased, on the authentic or proxy Joseph of Arimathea’s ‘fine linen’ (take your pick). One picture, or in this instance, 3D bas-relief artefact, is worth a 1000 words, especially as words in the wrong or inept hands can so easily be misrepresented or misconstrued..\n\n","date":"December 12, 2015 at 12:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216266","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Calcium carbonate.

That interpretation is supported by the passage you quote from Heller. It refers only to calcium, not calcium carbonate, making no claims specifically for calcium carbonate. I shall check my copy later for the full passage.\nIn short, no one need doubt there is calcium in the TS fibres, and/or adventitious particles of aragonite rock etc, but the “calcium carbonate” that you and others assume to be present would appear to be nothing more than a casual uninformed guess, with no attempt to place on a scientific footing.\nThat’s really all I have to say on matters of detail re the TS double image (which is where we came in).  However there’s a small housekeeping detail that needs attending to.

The Narratio explicitly states that twice a week “The image was beheld by all the congregation,” and you’re saying that it wasn’t?”\nYes, the full analysis of the context let me conclude that the image was not directly visible by the crowd (i.e., congregation). \nThe translation made by Guscin does not appear precise for that passage. Indeed, other translations are possible, and Nicolotti published another one, which essentially does not state that “The image was beheld by all the congregation”. See it in Nicolotti’s book, “From the Mandylion of Edessa to the Shroud of Turin”, p. 77.\nThe pertinent text reads: “And since the ancient chest of the divine form was covered by shutters, so as not to be visible by all whenever they desired, on two days of the week, namely Wednesday and Friday, it could be seen by all the gathering crowd through very fine, studded irons — that among them were called “scepters” — when the windows were opened [ or: when the windows were pulled open by very fine, studded irons that among them were called “scepters”]; and everyone, with prayers, propitiated its incomprehensible power, although it was not permitted to anyone to approach, let alone to touch, the holy image with the lips or the eyes.”\nAs you can see, in that translation the word “image” (or “form”) occurs at the beginning and end. Indeed, on this particular aspect, this translation corresponds to the Greek text. Guscin instead of using “it” used “image” in the segment “it could be seen”, but Guscin was over specific, because the text does not use the word “image” in that segment.\nThe main point is: what does “it” refer to in the segment “it could be seen by all the gathering crowd[…]”? I think that the specific context of that text and the overall context of the description of the ritual at Edessa makes “it” refers to the chest, not the image. Nicolotti appears to also think that way, because on pages 78-79 (of his book) he argues mainly to prove that the bishop had seen the image on the cloth, but never argues that the crowd saw the image.\nI think that the Greek text has to be analysed carefully to understand this text and that also the general history of that text has to be understood to interpret it properly.\nHugh, does it convince you that the Narratio does not state that the crowd, at Edessa, could not see the image of the Mandylion?\n\n","date":"December 14, 2015 at 4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216505","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Oups, my last sentence used incorrectly a double negative.

You beat me to it. Here’s the relevant passage from the Rogers & Schwalbe paper verbatim:\n“Morris et al reported relatively uniform concentrations of calcium and strontium in all of their spectra. The large quantities of calcium (200+/- 1.0 mg per cm squared were tentatively interpreted as dust accumulations, probably natural calcium carbonate on the Shroud. Riggi similarly observed substantial quantities of calcium compounds in the samples that he vacuumed from the back-side of the cloth. Although Riggi’s observation tends to support Morris’s interpretation, subsequent microscopic examination of the tapes showed little or no calcium debris from the Shroud image surface. Heller and Adler have since postulated that the calcium and strontium were absorbed into the linen during the retting process. They draw support for this hypothesis from both an experimental demonstration of the ion-exchange process and the observed presence and the observed presence of iron and calcium in several other antique linen samples.”\nWould you agree that there is simply no experimental basis or  justification for our historian friend to bang on endlessly about “gesso” when there’s no evidence, at least that I’m aware of, or which he has been repeatedly challenged and failed to produce, namely that there is calcium carbonate specifically on the TS, excluding occaional flecks of wind-blown or otherwise acquired dust? As I said earlier, here and many moons ago on this site, calcium is expected to be present, admittedly more before than after retting, because it’s a natural constituent of flax bast fibres, being an essential component of the pectinaceous cement matrix. But NOT as the carbonate.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2015 at 5:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216286","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Colin, the gesso is not proven but has to be checked out. What Heller reports of the Morris paper, the impression is that the calcium is there in good quantities and spread over the whole surface and this is just what you expect if the cloth was coated according to the prescriptions laid down in medieval manuals, such as Cennino Cennini. Cennini as a Tuscan ,would have used calcium sulphate in his gesso, the northerners had access to calcium carbonate in their local mines and used this So don’t you think that the next time the Shroud has a scanner applied to it we should check this out further?? \nI have also been told that the aragonite found near the feet might actually be part of the original calcium carbonate. As it appears to have been mislaid  we may never know and I certainly know nothing about the relationship between aragonite – which is spread  throughout the Mediterranean – and calcium carbonate so cannot assess this. Any mineralogists able to help here?\n The calcium fits well with the other evidence of paint and also with the evidence of animal proteins ( the gesso binding) which the professor of physiology I consulted over the Heller Adler  papers thought they had confused with blood. So it is one part of the picture but fits with a lot else including two direct accounts of the Shroud being painted ,1389 and 1449, and references (De Beatis 1517) to being able to see the images from a distance. So I am taking it as number one hypothesis. From what you say you would not even consider it- which suggests something a closed mind\nThe retting scenario means nothing unless there are comparative examples in linen which should be fairly easy to check out. It gave the impression of being a rather desperate solution picked out of the air especially as flax was often retted in the open air (!). As so often in Shroud research, no one ever seems to think of relating what is found to comparative examples whether pilgrim badges, other formerly painted linens, etc. yet this is almost certainly where the solution to the Shroud’s origins will eventually be found. I may be biased in favour off unfolding research being helpful but this is just how the dating of the horses of St.Mark’s, on which I have written a book ,was settled and fixed conclusively to the second century AD when the previous big study  had said 4th BC. We shall wait and see but it would be so good to have a state of the art scanner look at the surface of the Shroud again.\nI seem to be on a limb here in that I just assume that developing technology will offer totally new insights into the Shroud as time goes by. Others clearly think we have enough evidence to be certain as to what it is and when it was dated and so we can close the books. I am taking a bet on my solution and will cash in if the Shroud is shown to be a fourteenth centUry painting. I shall have to eat humble pie if science proves that it is not! But the question remains open in the present state of knowledge.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2015 at 5:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216288","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"My problem with Charles’s painting hypothesis is the complete uniformity with which the gesso and pigment has been eroded away.

You can see them in detail at http://www.zittau.eu/fastentuecher/grosses_fastentuch_bild.htm. The same applies to every old eroded picture I can find. If Charles is correct, which is still possible, then I think there must have been a deliberate, and successful, attempt to erase all traces of the original paint, by washing, rubbing or whatever. Maybe it did begin to erode away, exposing the ‘negative’ underneath, and a decision was made to erase the superficial pigment completely, but I find it difficult to accept that not a shred of paint would remain anywhere simply as a result of continuous usage.\nPursuing Charles’s loincloth idea, the particular sensibilities of Charles Borromeo, and that extraordinary dichotomy of depiction (either crowned, loin-clothed and with feet apart, or uncrowned, naked and with feet together) I wonder if there wasn’t a ‘standard form’ for public depiction, set down by the church authorities, which all painters were commanded to adhere to, regardless of whether they knew what the shroud image actually looked like or not. Actual copies of the Shroud – ex extractum – could, of course, be as close to the original as the artists could make, but the engravers of ceremonial occasions had to produce the ‘official’ version, which they knew, and no doubt many of those who saw it knew, was more of a symbol of the image than a depiction of the image itself.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2015 at 6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216291","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"One would only need to find ONE painted copy of the TS showing a nude figure, probably early on before the obligatory loin cloth add-on became de rigueur  to be near 100% certain there never was a loin cloth on the original.\nLier copy (1516) anyone?\nhttp://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/History/Western-European/manycopies.html\n\n","date":"December 12, 2015 at 6:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216293","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Yes.

Still I take Hugh’s point- we need to get the linen conservationists who have studied painted linens that have deteriorated onto this. The Shroud was kept well past its image date- usually these linens appear to have been thrown away when the painting disintegrated.\nThere is a possibility that the Shroud was repainted before its transfer to Turin in 1578. This fits if you take a chronological sequence of the depictions which the legs apart painted over an earlier painting. I was surprised to find that repainting a treasured linen was actually quite common- modern scanning of some painted linens has shown up different layers from repainting. However, we can get nowhere on this until someone brings together all the known depictions of the Shroud- as it was displayed- not copies. Even modest exploring dug up two ones I had never seen, one lurking in the British Library of 1608 and one sent to me in error by the Royal Library in Turin when I ( or rather the picture researcher) had asked for something different. Once again there is tons to uncover about the Shroud’s history ,\nespecially of how it looked at different moments in its history.This is an unfolding story.\nOn pilgrim badges. The Lirey 3D is actually very conventional.  Brian Spencer has an excellent  section on moulds and metals (pp.7- 13). Mould making was a skilled occupation and ,as I mentioned earlier, the Lirey Badge is crude compared to some of the star finds. Original moulds for pilgrim badges  have even been found- one from Yorkshire is illustrated on p. 9 of Spencer. The metals varied from lead to pewter to gold at the top end of the market. An amazing amount of work has been done on all this and it seems that the Lirey badge is totally typical of mass-produced pilgrim badges from minor (and in this case short-lived) shrines.\nRepeat-this is an unfolding story. We have not got there yet although I think the evidence of a medieval origin is overwhelming. For me the iconography of the all-over scourge marks both front and back, not known before 1300, is the clincher ! (As well as the evidence that was woven on a medieval treadle loom.)\n\n","date":"December 12, 2015 at 7:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216304","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Charles\nWould your opinion change if that was real blood was on the shroud?

Then there was dried blood such as the miracle of Bolsena – a host which bled to show that it was truly the blood of Christ- and the blood was kept on the floor.\nWhere did all this blood come from? The incentive to add some to a relic must have been strong. So when you read the 1449 eye-witness account  of the Shroud by a Benedictine monk, Corneille Zantfliet, in which he describes a shape of the body of Christ that was miro artificio depicta, ‘admirably or skilfully painted’, and goes on to say that the wounds on the hands, feet and side of the images were so bloody that they looked as if they were recent, one does wonder.\nStill ultimately anyone who has a piece of the Shroud or a sticky tape with blood on it needs to have it tested in an independent forensic lab to test out the blood. The testing methods of 1978 have long been superceded and, in any case, those tests have never been independently replicated.\nFor further info. see Caroline Walker Bynum’s Wonderful Blood which has a mass of information on these blood cults in Germany.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2015 at 9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216309","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Charles\nIt’s one thing to have something they believe to be the blood of Christ it’s another to paint a picture and use real blood in spots rather then just paint it like the rest of the picture. \nI just don’t see why anyone would do that.

One expects to see lateral distortion in a 2D image that has been obtained from a fully 3D person, or effigy thereof, when in fact one sees little of that effect in the TS. But that  latter observation has to be qualified. Everyone is agreed that there is no imaging of the sides. In one of the the models you quote, namely radiation, there has to be a quite extraordinary assumpttion made to account for the absence of sides, namely orthogonal projection of emitted radiation as if controlled by the Earth’s gravitational field (one suspects Einstein would have had words to say about that!).\nBut these considerations apply less to an image that has been produced by medieval technology to simulate what a contact imprint might look like centuries later, formed by transfer of sweat and blood. The image did NOT have to match that which would really be obtained by imprinting. It had only to match what could be claimed  to have been made by natural, unassisted imprinting. \nWhile I hesitate to mention it, there is an imprinting mechanism that captures as little or as much of frontal v (partial) lateral topography as is desired. It’s one which uses a fine powder (white flour) as imprinting medium which can be applied to the highest, flattest parts of the anatomy that one wishes to imprint, being careful to leave it off ‘sides’ especially. There’s a second safeguard to avoid or minimise lateral distortion, namely that in the simulation scenario with white flour/wet linen, there is manual moulding of cloth to flour-coated subject, allowing further control to be exercised over what is or is not imprinted.\nThus far, I have imprinted off my hand (easy, satisfactory imprint, negative, 3D enhancible) and my face (total disaster, as expected). Luigi Garlaschelli  also recognized the problem, ruling out contact imprinting off the face in his paste or powder frottage model. He concluded that a bas relief was used for the face. I’d certainly concur with him re the face, and a bas relief would account for the arguably mask-like appearance with severe cut-off at both sides, and maybe account too for the somewhat peculiar look where head and neck joins the torso.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2015 at 4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216547","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"It is not possible to impose theory on practice, much more so in the case of the burial of Jesus when Joseph had little time.

As I pointed out previously, this water was used on very few occasions because it was very costly. It was not used to wash dead bodies, it was used to purify people who had touched a dead body.”\nFirstly, I’m not trying to convince anybody, just give people food for thought re a new avenue. My thought experiment or red heifer waters acting as light mordant/fumigation scenario is based on experimental archeological pre-reconstructions (wrapping in shrouds) in light of Christolipsology, philology (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek), achaeoastronomy, the Gospels, Biblical and Talmudic Literatures, Second Temple period burial practices, custom and rites, Ancient Textiles mechanics and chemistry, Paleaoantomopathology, archaeological bloodstain analysis, reconstructive cryptology etc. \nArchaeologically and chemically speaking my red heifer waters acting as light mordant/fumigation scenario, in the hypothesis the TS is Yeshu’a, is far less speculative than the gesso or flour scenarios. It does hold water (British biochemis/chemist, Colin Berry went as far as attempting to sort of recycle my theory and develop a fraudulist scenario that would sort of parallel mine in terms of use of an alkali solution and mordanting).\nSecondly I never wrote “the Shroud was washed with the ashes of a red heifer mixed with water” but Yeshua’ shed innocent blood had to be purified. \nOnce you misleadingly wrote: “it is HIGHLY (upper cases mine) doubtful that Joseph, being a member of the Sanhedrin, would have Jesus buried as an innocent man.” Oh really? Just prove it? What say the Gospels?\nreminder for the free lance journalist: Yeshua’s buriers were Sanhedrin members who HAD NOT TAKEN A HAND IN Yeshua’s sentence to death because most likely they were his secret disciples and thought him innocent. Yeshua died on the cross and was INNOCENT i.e. WITHOUT SIN if those words has a meaning for a Catholic as they had for Yeshua’s disciples then.\nBesides, you does seem to ignore SHED INNOCENT BLOOD WAS A POLLUTANT in the Second Temple period, which speaks volume on how familiar you’re with the Talmud literature and the halacha!!! \nNow I’m asking the 21th c. CE  free lance journalist, how could Second Temple period Judean allow themselves to  keep Yeshua’ burial shrouds had not their master’s shed innocent blood that was a pollutant not been purified via the red heifer waters whether on Yeshua’s burial or after his resurrection?\nIn my reconstructive scenario the sindon/himation was first dipped in boiling red heifer waters then stretched taut front and back lengthwise. Then the stiff rigid body was compressed widthwise in smaller burial shrouds prior to being fumigated with aloetic wood. On fumigation, the sindon/himation used as inner burial shroud shrank and get sort of taut again front ad back.\nMethinks you know very little about the red heifer waters as a slightly corrosive purifying/cleansing product! And you indignation is just a mask to hide out your mischief making on the sly.\nRe my expertise on Knight Templars, the Ancient Graffiti Museum Director, the late Serge Ramond,  Ulysse  , Director of the Château de Chinon, Director of the Château de Loches, Pascal Poirier asked me do make an oral presentation on Knights Templar’s graffitis at the 4th congress of glyptography, Loches, 2006 (see the proceedings published in 2010, ASPAG et le Conseil Général d’Indre-et-Loire). \nWhat about your discoveries in sindonology and Knights Templar archaology/glyptography?\nRe my FB, I regularly alternate a recent and an older  profile picture.

A rationale was found by supposing that the image was not that of the crucified Jesus, but of the roasted-at-the-stake Jacques de Molay, or his lieutenant, Geoffroi de Charney, claimed by some to have been uncle to Geoffroi de Charny of Lirey, first recorded owner of the TS.TheTemplar narrative served as adjunct to the science – but was not crucial in the sense that disproving the Templar link would not necessarily have invalidated the imprinting technology.\nIt was the “Veronica” like imprint on the Machy mould that was the signal to abandon the Templar link, and to see the TS as an attempt to extend the principle of imprinting a face onto fabric with sweat and blood, as per Veronica legend,  to imprinting of an entire double body image by the same body-fluid principle, a pretext for which was found with Joseph of Arimathea’s linen being used to receive the newly crucified body from the cross, prior to washing etc. That then led to a search for imprinting technologies that used the real human body as template instead of hot bas relief metal, finally settling on use of white flour as the imprinting medium, and again producing negative 3D-enhancible images (so still scientific), with the fit to biblical narrative still not crucial .\nIn short, it’s easy to misrepresent a  scientific train of thought as being fanciful, when at each stage there is a concrete imprinting model being proposed. But even if it were fanciful nothing I do has become a fixation, far less an obsession. I rarely mention the current white flour model on this site, knowing that anti-authenticity ideas do not do the business. There’s plenty of pro-authenticity ideas being flagged up on a daily basis (some obsessional, sad to say)  that lack for an actual mechanism for imprinting a negative image, and even when one is hinted at, e.g. Di Lazzaro’s uv laser pulses, there is no negative, 3D-enhancible image, only a faint brown discoloration of linen.\nTS studies should ideally be model-driven (something STURP failed to appreciate with its preponderance of engineers over scientists). Almost anything one does with practical hands-on modelling is bound to be scientific – more so than “thought experiments” – usually no more than non-systematic, non-structured fantasizing.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2015 at 6:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216517","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Just one example of Colin allegedly “impeccably scientific” reasoning: forensically speaking, the man of the Shroud was about 35-40 years old.

Most observers would give credence to “blood equals wounds” provided the blood was in all the biblically-correct location.  \nSo the onus is in fact on pro-authenticity pathologists to justify their use of the term “wounds” in their autopsy reports. But they can’t. There is no imaging of wounds. There is merely blood stains or imprints, which they were not entitled to interpret as open wounds, i,.e.torn or punctured flesh unless or until authenticity has been established or, more pointedly, that forgery has been rigorously excluded.\nIn short, this sceptic is not the  person to whom the question “what kind of wound imaging would you expect” should be addressed,  since I did not expect any, and don’t see it anyway. \nInstead, the pathologists should be asked “what kind of wound imaging did you find, and if you didn’t see any, then how can you refer so confidently to “wounds” when all you have to look at are blood stains that could in principle, certainly  post radiocarbon dating, disputed or otherwise,  have been applied by a medieval artisan to make the observer believe he was looking at wounds that in reality were not there?”\n\n","date":"December 17, 2015 at 6:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216742","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"One wound, or blood mark, I would expect to see (if this was a medieval work) is a mark across the forehead where the crown of thorns was traditionally thought to have been impressed into Jesus’s skin.

Elsewhere everything else was blurred and ill-defined. But there was a theoretical rationale that could be deployed in the event of a medieval sceptic or know-all claiming the body image was too simple. It would be pointed out that it was created from sweat, and sweat is a mobile and runny substance, even oily sweat, so could not be expected to produce a sharp imprint that incorporated fine details of body anatomy or wound damage.\nHaving made that decision to keep the body image simple, there was a price to be paid in the imprinting of the blood. There had to be a compensating overkill – one that would dispel any foolish notion that the figure represented was merely a stylized artwork. Quite the contrary, there had to be a gut clenching paramedical immediacy and impact that in modern day reporting would have resulted in a sensibility-preserving pixellated photograph on the newspaper front page.  No, for our secretive goal-oriented medieval imprinters, there was to be no prissy pussyfooting around in the manner in which blood was applied to the image. It had to be done in a manner that looked like the man had REALLY been flogged to within an inch of his life (even if the Bible gives no indication of that)  crowned with deep penetrating thorns, nailed, crucified and finally lanced. There were to be no half meaures. Indeed, nothing short of 100% reality-imprinting would do, given the imperatives of what they had set out to achieve, the motives for which one can only guess at (though King John the Good’s Order of the Star offers fertile ground for speculation, especially if he had had a premonition that he would be captured and held to ransom at the Battle of Poitiers,1356. Maybe widowed Madame de Charny (Jeanne de Vergy) had not been fully apprised of her late husband’s and King’s game plan, using the ‘genuine’ Shroud as a down payment, and more concerned post-Poitiers disaster to provide for herself and her orphaned children?\nThis comment is already quite long and starting to deviate,  so I’ll post this as a prologue and then return with the detailed haematology later this morning (my time zone). King John and his close buddy Geoffroi de Charny of Lirey will have to go onto the post-Apocalypse back burner for now, with maybe a speculative posting on my own site, sometime in the New Year.\nTo be continued…\n\n","date":"December 18, 2015 at 1:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216759","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"I wonder where Colin dreams all this up.

He has no need  of a Mr. Figuereidoc.\nSecondly, can Mr Fegueiredoc (who is not a true Biblical scholar nor even a true Shroud researcher or Templar researcher, tell me what are exactly his discoveries in sindonology and Templar archaeology?

Right in the beginning I pointed out that thix mixture was used to wash people who touched a dead body, it was a purification ritual. The mixture was also very costly, making it unlikely that Jews in general could afford it.”\nIn the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s (long inner) burial shroud:\nFirstly, Louis de Figuereido deliberately distorts/misrepresents my opinion to ridicule it (intellectual dishonesty = a lying tongue) as I never claimed “Jesus’ BODY was WASHED (upper case mine) with red heifer ashes mixed with water”. I just wrote Yeshua’s shed innocent blood should/had to be PURIFIED (since it was a pollutant as far as Holy land was concerned) and the best purifying product available then was the red heifer waters especially for his rich buriers who thought he was the prophesied Messiah and who had not taken a hand in Yeshua’s death sentence (they were his secret disciples).\nSecondly Louis de Figuereido misleadingly wrote (because he is a poor NT exegete: “The mixture was also very costly, making it unlikely that Jews in general could afford it” while totally overlooking the fact Yeshua’s buriers were Sanhedrin members (at least two of them) and consequently were rich men who could afford the costly ref heifer waters (reminder for the alleged Brasilian “biblical scholar”, Louis de Figueiredo: Yossef used his own newly hewn memorial cave-tomb  and fine linen sindon/himation on Yeshua’s burial while Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about 100 litra). \nThirdly: Can Louis de Figuereido account for the Yeshua’s Second temple period Jewish disciples  having kept their master’s sindon/himation that was used as inner burial shroud and came into contact with Yeshua’s stiff rigid corpse? Reminder for the alleged “biblical scholar”, Louis e Figuereido: the red heifer waters are NOT ONLY used “to wash people who touched a dead body” BUT ALSO to purify objects that came into contact with a corpse. Now the sindon/himation DID COME INTO CONTACT with Yeshua’s stiff rigid dead body. Can Louis de Figueiredo tell us how Yeshua’s sindon/himation used as inner burial shroud was purified so that his disciples could be allowed to keep it as a memento? Any suggestion Mr. Figuereidoc?\nFourthly: I never wrote the yellowish colour could be due TO THE SOLE use of the red heifer water (uric acid residues, time patina are involved too). The fact remains though because of the very presence of starch residues, soaking a linen fabric in a mildly corrosive lye water (i.e. animal and/or wood ashes mixed with water) such as the red heifer waters allows them to have a yellowish white colour. On the other hand, it also causes the gelatinized starch not only to make the cloth-to-body unsticking easier but also to form a very thin gel-like texture in order to create a two thousand years old bloodied body image.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2015 at 1:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216809","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Edit: ….to form a very thin gel-like texture in order to create a two thousand years old bloodied body image slightly mordanted on the inner side of the inner shroud.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2015 at 2:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216812","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Reminder for the “arrognorant” Luis de Figereido, moons ago I wrote:  Most likely Red Heifer ashes mixed with pure living/spring waters to purify Yeshua’s shed innocent blood were used on Yeshua’s burial or/and afterward to purify his burial shrouds the disciples had kept as mementos.\nBesides red heifer ashes and/or Melche/Jerusalem limestone dust –mixed with warm/hot (55°-85° Celsius) waters with or without lactic and/or uric acid– can gelatinized starch.

Reminders: (light) mordant is known to be used for intensifying stains e.g. in cell or tissue preparations. Red Heifer ashes and/or Melche/Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with warm/hot (55°-85° Celsius) water can gelatinized residual starch (alkali gelatinization) present in the ancient linen cloth (if starch was really detected or used on the TS) and could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now it is well known gelatin is a breakdown product of collagen.\n– collimation in terms of self collimated light mordanting extended to the back and front of the stiff rigid corpse of the crucifixion victim’s bloodied body (the crucifixion victim’s ‘smooth wet and dust-covered textile skin’ –or ‘second skin’ aka his aqueous alkali solution in-soaked inner winding burial sheet now known as the Turin Shroud–, tightly moulded over his dust-lactic acid residues-blood covered body, acting as an image enhancing membrane for accurately aligning (collimating) compressible and de-compressible vapour flow and orthogonally moving in terms of body-to-cloth gradual shrinking and unsticking front and back by means of the said flow as a thermal actuator.\n– 3D volumetric recording of the crests and valleys of the bloodied body (the clean sindon/himation being used as a long narrow inner winding burial sheet in-soaked with an aqueous alkali solution and tightly moulded over his dust-lactic and uric acid residues-blood covered body) was first tautly wrapped lengthwise around the stiff rigid bloodied body from head to toe and then manually compressed widthwise in shorter dry clean outer shrouds to be subjected to a (myrrhic?) xyloaloetic fumigation and then the inner burial winding sheet slightly decompressed while sort of getting taut again through drying and shrinking). \nReminder: whether it be 3D printing of a crucifixion victim body between two sheets of linen cloth or small sprigs of fresh herbs, the fresh individual flowers and/or freshly caught fishes between two sheets of (blotting) paper, such a process requires moulding by either manually rubbing, pressing or compressing crests and valleys between the said sheets\n– neatness and tidiness (or integrity) of blood clots (through a cloth-to-body skin sticking and gradual unsticking process) while the very presence of “opaques” from the Judean desert could account for the Body image fuzziness.\n…just to name a few.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2015 at 3:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-216813","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That","post":"Reminder one for the alleged “biblical scholar Louis de Figueiredo: the ashes of the red heifer (mixed with spring waters = water of lustration) were used NOT ONLY  in the ritual purification of persons AND objects defiled by a corpse (Num. 19 (BTW Yeshua’s long inner shroud had been defiled by its very contact with his stiff rigid corpse all the more so as it was all covered in his shed innocent blood).BUT ALSO to atone for the bloodguilt of the unidentified manslayer (Deut. 21:3) that is for anyone (be he an unnamed Sanhedrin member who, along with his fellow colleagues had had a hand in sentencing to death an innocent whose innocent blood had been actually shed in the Holy Land).\nReminder two: In the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s long inner burial shroud, in the gospels, it is written Yeshua was buried according to the JUDEAN burial custom besides Yeshua’s stiff rigid body was not just draped but just wrapped/encircled, but COMPRESSED and FASTENED too (see the 3 different conjugated koine Greek verbs used by the 4 evangelists and the koine Greek word for ‘shorter shrouds/pieces of linen’ (othonia).  Besides  in light of the Hebrew time markers and translation entropy (from Aramaic/Hebrew to koine/translation Greek), the burial time frame between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath is four hours (maximal time frame) and two-two and a half hours (minimal time frame) NOT about  half an hour (according to a die-hard misinterpretation LdeF, one among many, keeps parroting unawareas they  are of the translation entropy).
