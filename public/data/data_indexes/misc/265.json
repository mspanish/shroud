[{"title":"LiveScience Goofs Again","post":"The image on the Shroud was created when Jesus’ body dissolved into a stream of radiation, creating a  photographic negative on the cloth.  Called the Rainbow Body, it has occurred thousands of times in the past in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the most recent being in September, 1998 by the Buddhist monk Khenpo A-Chos. Other examples of Rainbow Body in the Christian tradition are Enoch, Elijah and possibly Moses.  The non-cannonical reports of Mary’s death, called the Assumption, indicate that she too acquired Rainbow Body.\nIn late August of 1998,  A-Chos told his disciples he was going to leave this world.  Without signs of any illness he passed peacefully and comfortably while chanting a mantra.   Following Buddhist tradition his body was covered in a yellow cloth whereupon it was noticed that his now unwrinkled skin had turned a soft,  pinkish color.  As days passed his body continually shrank to childlike proportions until finally, on the seventh day, it completely disappeared.  During this seven day period outsiders noted a display of rainbow colored radiation coming from the burial hut.\nThe truth is, something very significant and natural happens to the human body when it is exposed to a lifestyle of selflessness and love and compassion to others, all taken to the extreme and demonstrated in an unwavering commitment to a virtuous cause.  Such a lifestyle is the common denominator among the Rainbow Body adepts. A human body that vanishes into mid-air seems miraculous.  However, when viewed from a quantum perspective it all makes sense.  Quantum particles of which we (and everything else in the universe) are made cannot exist unless they are observed through human consciousness.  Now, one can have an opinion about anything except one cannot have an opinion about fact.  And, that atomic particles do not have an independent existence is a proven fact.  So, if an atomic particle can be brought into existence by observing it then it necessarily follows that it can be made to disappear by not observing it.  And that is exactly what  the Rainbow Body adepts do; they stop observing (and catering) to self through extreme asceticism and compassion for others.  Atomic particles are nothing more than vibrating energy.  So, when they cease to exist the vibrating energy is released into the surrounding area.  \nJesus’ death was the most spectacular Rainbow Body of them all for his body dissolved in less than thirty-six hours while most dissolutions take place in seven days.  Thus, the energy that was released as HIs body dissolved was released in a much shorter period of time producing a high intensity radiation.  Italian researches at the National Agency for New Technologies have confirmed that linen cloth is sensitive to high intensity radiation. The short nature of His release compared to other adepts confirms Him to be the greatest manifestation of the divine the world has ever seen.\nAnd the thing about it is, the Rainbow Body adepts have no special skills or traits.  We all come from the factory with the same factory installed equipment.  The adepts knew how to bring forth the spiritual component better than most.  The question each person has to answer is, “how spiritual do I want to be”?  “How much material lifestyle do I want to sacrifice in order to bring forth my innate spiritual nature”?\nEven though the Catholic Church has studied the strange death of Khenpo A-Chos you don’t hear much about it.  For its implications are far reaching.  It questions the claim of divinity that early Church fathers made on Jesus.  Without question the greatest human to ever live, the operative word is “human”.  Human yes, divine no.  And when that claim is removed the virginity of Mary comes under the microscope, then the notion of original sin and so forth.  And the walls come tumbling down.  As the Catholic Priest who conducted an on-site investigation of Khenpo A-Chos death said, “we may have done a number on the flock.”  For sure, the words in Genesis, “…and to dust thou shalt return” need to be appended with the words “but only if you so choose.”\n\n","date":"December 13, 2012 at 11:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/13/livescience-goofs-again/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-20361","author":"Tom Devins","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"LiveScience Goofs Again","post":"Dan you wrote: “Is there pareidolia on the shroud?

I tend to blame Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida for their impact on present educational systems through their philosophies of relativism.  The comments there are in sharp contrast to the intelligence of the readers frequently displayed here on Dan’s site. \nThe question of what is real and what is imaginary was first examined in great detail by the 17th c. mathematican, philosopher and scientist Rene Descartes.  Beginning at “Dubito, ergo sum” and then proceeding to “Cogito, sum”, he finally arrived at his ontological proof of the existence of God in his work “Meditations”.  However even this conclusion was flawed, as the God that Descartes had constructed by this means was no more than Descartes’ own idea of God.  It was one of a number of key errors in Descartes’ reasoning, which even extended to mathematics.  He would not believe for instance that the lengths of various curves could be resolved, despite the discovery of the calculus, and his own invention of coordinate geometry, and as demonstrated by the the work of Pierre de Fermat.    \nIf Descartes made major errors.in his philosophy, and in other fields, what chance have lesser minds to arrive at the truth?  Perhaps most of us resort to falling back on the empirical principle:  “What is reasonable?” or “What conclusions would a reasonable, well-informed person come to?” as a working principle for daily living.  But of course, even this has hazards and to be wrong is to be human.  To fall back onto earlier certainties such as the philosophies of Aristotle and St Thomas would appear to be retrograde.  Even the principles of so-called “scientific scepticism” can be demonstrably unproductive.  Can scientific experiment yield truth?  It seems only about the material world, and only then if rigorous sampling protocols are followed!  The interpretations and conclusions therefrom are another matter. What does “What is reasonable?” mean?!\n\n","date":"December 13, 2012 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/13/livescience-goofs-again/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-20380","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"LiveScience Goofs Again","post":"Enjoy reading this blog, but unfortunately, I don’t have the training/knbowledge nor the HP to fully appreciate this and wish I were 20 years younger with an additional 50 IQ points.
