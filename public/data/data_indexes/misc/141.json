Colin has been working on STuRP’s own assessment of the image as degraded cellulose. This, as they all pointed out, looks just like a scorch. They decided it couldn’t be because a) a scorch fluoresces and b) a scorch burns through to the other side. Colin quickly demonstrated that b is nonsense, and various other things as well – a scorch can show image density resembling a body/distance correlation, and a scorch is essentially a contact mechanism, not a radiation mechanism. However, niggling problems remained, and so he began to work on how to produce an effect indistinguishable from a scorch, but with lower heat and different chemicals. This is what I mean by “a kind of” scorch.\nHis point about sweat is in contrast to Charles Freeman’s brighly coloured paint hypothesis. One thing a scorch does not look like is a brightly coloured painting. However, the Shroud has been described as being derived from sweat several times by pilgrims, who were saying what they saw, not suggesting a manufacturing process. If the Shroud was originally brightly coloured, then it could not have been intended to be its current brownish tinge, and any kind of scorch would have been a incidental byproduct, not a deliberate intention. This is my position, currently, although it could change any minute, and was cheerfully derided by Stephen Jones as he deliberately misinterpreted my statement to the effect that I thought the whole thing had been created by accident. Colin’s position is that Charles is wrong, and that the Shroud was deliberately intended to look like a sweat imprint from the start, so the “kind of scorch” that we see today was an integral part of the plan.\nRather than vague derogatory remarks, which suggest that anoxie either has not read or has not understood Colin’s, Charles’s or my ideas and comments, he might do better to offer more specific criticisms, that one or other of us might be able to address.\n\n","date":"November 24, 2014 at 4:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-172847","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"This is just another version to save his face after giving up his classical “scorch” theory. \n30 months to conclude to the obvious, put it the way you want, i’m done with his mumbo jumbo.\nHe has written to the Vatican, the Royal Society and now even wikipedia is bored with his propaganda…\nThibault has already pointed the pb, Colin has never written a single pdf you can simply answer too, that’s why he has focused on his classical “scorch” hypothesis.

The predominant observation was of the ‘blood’ on the Shroud ‘ as if it had been recent’. David Mo has suggested that they may have exaggerated the blood and this is possible as there was certainly an obsession with the blood of Christ from the fourteenth century onwards that may have led to observers highlighting it more than it deserved but this is not sweat. One also has to explain the descriptions and depictions of the Crown of Thorns that was certainly not a sweat imprint. I am so confused about what Colin is arguing but presumably his sweat would only have created the outline of the body and not extras such as the Crown of Thorns.\nI am not sure whether anyone has done any work on whether the copies themselves have faded over the centuries. We must remember that we are dealing with at least seven hundred years and very vulnerable materials. The vast majority of linens recorded in church and monastery inventories with images on them have vanished without trace and this can only mean that they proved all too vulnerable to damp, decay or\nfire.

Note the speed which which they decayed- I think that the Shroud did well to hang on to its images as long as it did. Note the ‘experiments with modern replicas” certainly worth following up.\nFrom The Hangings About the Hall: An Overview of Textile Wall Hangings in Late Medieval York, 1394-1505 by Gr. Charles Kightly in Medieval Textiles  Issue 28, June 2001.\nPainted cloths\nIn York, as throughout England, painted cloths were much the most popular cheap wall hangings from the late medieval period until the mid seventeenth century. The earliest York reference I have found is to a painted dorser belonging to John de Birne, rector of St. Sampson’s, who died in 1394 (C). Their great attraction was that they offered brightly coloured and often figurative wall decoration – much cheaper to paint than either to embroider or to work in tapestry – at a very low cost. The shop stock of the York tailor John Carter (d. 1485 B), for example, included twelve yards of ‘panetyd clothes’ at 2/8d, or only 2_d a yard, while that of the chapman Thomas Gryssop (d. 1446 B) included six whole painted cloths (admittedly ‘old’) at 5/- the lot. Their cheapness, however, was counterbalanced by their lack of durability: experiments with authentically produced modem replicas have shown that they degrade quite rapidly, especially when the painted surface is cracked or damaged by rolling or folding for storage. For this reason their second-hand value could be very low indeed. The most expensive York example was Richard Dalton’s (1505 B) complete painted hallings at 7/-, but their average second-hand value seems to have been only one or two pence a yard, and two whole cloths belonging to Henry Thorlthorp, vicar choral (d. 1427 B) were appraised at only a penny each.\nThe low value and ephemeral nature of painted cloths has ensured a very low survival rate, and no indisputably medieval English examples are known to exist. \nWhat did they show?\nAmong the earliest described belonged to Robert  Lyndesay (d. 1397 B), parish clerk of All Saints North Street, which depicted ‘the image of Christ sitting in the clouds’. John Underwode, clerk of the vestry at York Minster (d. 1408 A), had a cloth ‘of the Last Resurrection’, Henry Thorlthorp (d. 1427 B) and John Danby (d. 1485 A), vicars choral, both had cloths ‘with the Crucifix’; and cloths ‘with the Trinity’ are recorded for the goldsmith John Colan (d. 1490 B); the widow of Thomas Person (d. 1496 A), and John Clerk, chaplain of St Mary Magdalen chapel (d. 1451 B), whose hanging also depicted St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist. These two saints also appeared on a cloth belonging to John Tidman, chaplain at All Saints, North Street (d. 1458 C), who likewise owned painted hangings with ‘a great image of the Virgin’ and with ‘the history of the Five Joys of the Virgin’. Agnes del Wod (d. 1429 A) favoured images of St. Peter and St. Paul; William de Burton, vicar of St. Mary Bishophill (d. 1414 A) had a cloth with ‘the history of St. Thomas of Canterbury’; and John Colan (d. 1490 B) one with ‘the Virgin Mary and St. George’; while both John Kexby, Chancellor of York Minster (d. 1452 B) and Janet Candell (d. 1479 C) owned cloths depicting ‘the Seven Works of Mercy’. Secular subjects were seemingly much rarer, though the vicar of Acomb, Henry Lythe (d. 1480 A) had a ‘halling painted of Robyn Hude’.\n\n","date":"November 25, 2014 at 11:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-172958","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"Leaving the science aside for a moment, can we imagine that a perfectly obvious painting could ever have been thought of as the genuine Shroud of Christ? I think that it could. As I have suggested several times before, the genuineness of a relic in the 4th century does not seem to have been related to its verisimiitude, but only to its attestation. Nowadays, we expect our miracles to at least have some semblance of scientific rationality, even if they defy the laws of physics, but I don’t think the medieval mind was so constrained. A painting might have appeared miraculously after Jesus had simply wiped his face on a cloth, just as curing somebody need not require the laying on of hands or the application of any substance. After the Shroud of Besancon appeared, both Shrouds were considered equally genuine without any one seeming to have queried whether this was possible or or not – the words; “it’s a mystery” were a perfectly valid explanation for contradictory occurrences in a way that no longer applies.\n\n","date":"November 25, 2014 at 8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-172930","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"To Hugh,\nApparently destroyed during the French Revolution, most likely the Shroud used in the Easter liturgy at the cathedral of St. Stephen at Besançon (then capital of Burgundy and straddling\nFrance and the German Holy Roman Empire) was a 16th c.

That enlightening tome “Last Journey and Memorials of the Redeemer, or Via Crucis, as it is in Jerusalem” by the Rev. J.J. Begel, published in 1880, explains how.\n“Since, as in the case of the cross, this abundance might become a pretext for denying their authenticity, we will endeavour to show that the Jewish manner of burial required large quantities of linen.” … “Hence the multiplicity of shrouds is now no longer a problem, and that great question of former times, who possesses the true shroud, the authentic shroud of our Saviour, has no longer any weight, and merely proves long ignorance of a fact.”\nNor was the existence or not of an image at all a problem.\n“We know that after the embalming and enshrouding the ancients painted the mummies exteriorly. This was the last operation before restoring them to the family or bearing them to the tomb. From this cause, I think, among the holy shrouds that remain to us, some bear the image — not, indeed, very artistic, and traced with hurried hand— of our Saviour extended lifeless, and others do not.”\nInterestingly:\n“The two shrouds which bear the print of the body of Jesus Christ are that of Turin, in Piedmont, and that of Besancon, in Franche-Comte. … In this last the painting is not so vivid nor the traits so distinct as in the shroud of Turin.”\n\n","date":"November 25, 2014 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-172992","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"Hugh, \nDon’t you overgeneralize and mispresent the case alike Charles.

Here goes for about the 12th attempt: \nConcerning the D’Arcy memorandum alleging that the image was painted: \nThe position is clearly set out in Markwardt’s 2001 paper “Conspiracy against the Shroud”, and Wilson 1978 also comments on it.  \nIn 1900 Ulysse Chevalier apparently had available to him a near-finished Latin draft from the Troyes diocesan archives addressed to a Scribe, which would imply that the alleged memorandum was never even sent to the Scribe, let only to Anti-pope Clement VII.  However rather than producing this draft, Chevalier cobbled together a text from prior separate notes, which included editing marks such as marginal notes, cross-outs, and substitute wording, and manufactured for it an end of 1389 date; as by its archival retention it would be clear from the near-finished draft for the scribe that the memorandum had not in fact been sent to Clement.  \nMarkwardt refers to the two source documents: “In 1993, Hilda Leynen discovered that two distinct drafts of the D’Arcis Memorandum were maintained in the Champagne collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, one very rough and containing bracketed words, and the other a relatively neat and polished product.”   \nFrom Chevalier’s cobbled Latin text, Herbert Thurston published an English translation in the Catholic periodical “The Month” in 1903.  Wilson 1978 provides the full text of Thurston’s translation as Appendix B, the fraud apparently even escaping Wilson’s attention.   \nThe relevant text cited by Markwardt is included in his Note 6:\n‘6  The memorandum refers to an alleged investigation conducted, in about 1355, by Henri\nde Poitiers, Bishop of Troyes. “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he\ndiscovered the fraud and how the cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being\nattested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not\nmiraculously wrought or bestowed.” ‘ \nWilson makes the point that Latin lacks a definite article, and that the verb used was not “pingere” (to paint) but “depingere” (to copy).  Thus the key phrase can be just as easily translated as: “… by an artist who had copied it … ”  which sheds rather a different light on the whole bizarre episode.  Thus relying on a questionable translation of a fraudulent memorandum may be the stuff by which art historians might make a living, but to others it may seem rather slender grounds for asserting that the origin of the Shroud image was ever an artist’s paint-brush! \nVery likely, D’Arcis’ alleged copy assuming it existed, may have been commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original she had taken from St Stephen’s at Besancon for safe-keeping and the venerable cleric was confused about the matter.  The 1880 assertion that both the Besancon and Piedmont Shrouds were authentic burial cloths beggars belief, would seem to be based on no more than an excessive piety, by 1880 the French Revolution would already have deposed of the Besancon icon, the reverend gentleman would no longer have had access to it, nor would he have had access to the 1898 Pia photography.\n\n","date":"November 26, 2014 at 4:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-173070","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"All the comments above illustrate the lengths various commenters, and the adherents of each particular cloth, would go to in order to demonstrate that their relic was as authentic as all the others. If it was a clumsy painting, it was painted on by Nicodemus; if it was a uniform smear, it was made by sweat; if it had a diiferent design, it was used in a diiferent place; if it had no marks at all, it was lying on top of the others. There are even convoluted explanations as to how some shrouds had one image while the Turin Shroud has two. Max’s comment: “Its veneration was not so much linked to its being considered genuine as both being a shroud copy of or shroud substitute” is not borne out by the remarks of the 19th century commentators. In case of misunderstanding, I don’t think Colin personally thinks the Shroud was any kind of body-bag; however he is perfectly correct in saying that it was often described as the sheet into which Jesus was immediately placed after being taken down from the cross, or the sheet in which Jesus was transported to the tomb, in order to differentiate it from the several sheet/s in which Jesus was wrapped once in the tomb.\nIt is perfectly possible that the Shroud of Besancon was destroyed in 1349, and also that that of Turin was destroyed in 1532. This had no effect on popular belief, as the replacements were invariably “rediscoveries” of the previous ones, which happily turned out not to have been destroyed after all, as was massively attested to by as many bishops as could be gathered to the site.\n\n","date":"November 26, 2014 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-173072","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"Hugh first you wrote: \n“Nowadays, we expect our miracles to at least have some semblance of scientific rationality, even if they defy the laws of physics, but I don’t think THE MEDIEVAL MIND (upper cases mine)  was so constrained.”\nAnd then: Max’s comment: “(The Besançon shroud) veneration was not so much linked to its being considered genuine as both being a shroud copy of or shroud substitute” is not borne out by the remarks of the 19TH CENTURY COMMENTATORS (upper cases mine).” \nActually you misleadingly changed the time-perspective of the issue…\nFirstly you just overlook the fact I was referring to late 14th c.

When a “new” relic appeared, such as the Shroud, I suppose it was natural for supporters of rivals to try to denigrate it as much as possible. Nearly all the miraculous images, whether or not we include the Shroud, looked like obvious paintings, so it was easy to claim that while my painting was a miracle, yours was cooked up by an artist a few years ago. After a while, when the new relic had achieved popularity, respectability and episcopal, or papal, approbation (invariably in that order), then of course it had to be assimilated into the canon. The only denigrations I have seen are those of Pierre D’Arcis, but I dare say there were others of the various veronicas, shrouds and other images as they turned up.\nIt is true that my sources are 19th century rather than, say 15th or 16th century, but can anyone say that individual relics were being denouced as fakes then? Apart, of course, from people like Calvin, who didn’t think any of them had any validity.\nMax’s next two points do not support his own argument. The Shroud which was turned into bandages was destroyed in the face of popular belief in its authenticity, as a deliberate challenge to it, by an avowedly atheistic authority. His third point, that relic authenticity was based first and foremost on certificates of authenticity not just popular beliefs, does not fully reflect the close relationship between the two. If a relic wasn’t popular (or thought likely to become popular), it didn’t receive hierarchical authority, although once it had done so, it’s popularity was no doubt enhanced.\n\n","date":"November 26, 2014 at 8:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-173095","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"Hugh: Two corrections: \n“It is true that my sources are 19th century.”\nBaillet: beginning of 18th century.\n“If a relic wasn’t popular (or thought likely to become popular), it didn’t receive hierarchical authority”.\nA lot of relics were accepted by the Church because they were owned by a powerful  aristocratic family.

If you can’t answer it then there is no point our continuing this discussion as that will mean you are proposing something like the bilirubin hypothesis proferred by Dr. Zugibe. Did Father Francis O’Leary swallow that? No he didn’t.\nAs for telergy, it is rare and can be invisible. Do you think Jesus believed that the “demons” he expelled  from the Gerasene madman entered the swine and that is why they fell from the cliff and were drowned? If you think he did, it will mean he also believed in metempsychosis, and such a view has no support at all in the New Testament.\nClue: Why does the Gospel of Mark end the narrative by saying that the man was sitting “in his right mind”?\n\n","date":"November 27, 2014 at 10:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-173315","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5","post":"I’m sorry that you (… and maybe even … Colin Berry!) do not understand that there really is a chance to do something with cold dyeing of polyamidic materials …\nSo if you just can not understand the question of cold dyeing (of polyamide 6) … all the other stories seem to become just frills, minor problems!\nListen to me!
