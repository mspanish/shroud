We only have occasional earthquakes to deal with.  Haven’t had a disastrous volcanic eruption in well over 100 years, although one is expected in Auckland City some time in the future.  We’re well clear of any hurricane corridor, just get the occasional storms and floods.  Your East Coast storms have received extensive coverage in all the media here.  The hearts and minds of the people of NZ go out to you in sympathy.  It was satisfying to see both President Obama and Governor Christie adopting a mature political stance in the face of such a disaster.
