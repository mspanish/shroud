I have not heard it referred to as “Partial Least Squares” before, and I have not heard of this as a form of analysis distinct from “Least Squares”.  I might guess that it could get its name from taking the Partial Derivatives of the Least Square equations on each of the multiple variables to obtain the coefficients  and equating the various partial derivatives to zero to minimise the various least square sums.  \nIf you are familiar with ordinary multivariate regression analysis, I’d be inclined to use that, if not, then consult any standard text on Statistics and Probability theory, most of which will include a chapter on MVR.  \nVery tersely:  Let there be n sets of data points in k independent variables x(j) where the x(j) are measured about their sample mean values.  Then the objective is to obtain an estimate y’ of the dependent variable y about its mean value.  Geometrically the problem is one of finding the equation of the plane which fits best, in the sense of least squares, a set of points in k + 1 dimensions.  The equation will be of the form:  y’ = Sum [ a(j) . x(j)] (j = 1 to k) where a(j) is the coefficient to be found for each x(j).  \nTaking the partial differentials of the sum of the least squares expression yields k separate equations which must be solved to obtain each of the a(j).  \nEquation j will then be of the form:  Sum [ a(i) . Sum [ x(j) . x(i) ] ](i = 1 to k) = Sum [x(j) . y] \nNowadays, one would use one of the multivariate spreadsheet packages which include matrix analysis such as that in MS Excel, and it’s all a lot easier.  But check out the technique in a textbook first if you’re not familiar with it.  \nRegarding the earlier destructive tests of the Dali paintings, I would presume that only very small samples of the canvasses were destroyed in the test, and I would hope that the main works were not too badly damaged.\n\n","date":"July 8, 2015 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/08/todays-featured-article-in-wikipedia/","cat":"wikipedia_content","id":"comment-204949","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Today’s Featured Article in Wikipedia","post":"First of all, with regard to destructive tests,\nwhen you wrote:\n“… Regarding the earlier destructive tests of the Dali paintings, I would presume that only very small samples of the canvasses were destroyed in the test, and I would hope that the main works were not too badly damaged…”.\nI believe that with the generic term (= “destructive”), in reality, they are referring to measures around the viscosity (and these are measures that [first of all] require the dissolution of the cellulosic material to be examined and then the measurement of the viscosity, which then it is correlated [or referable] to the degree of polymerization of the cellulose … unfortunately when there are present certain impurities [for example: TiO2 = Titanium dioxide, in the viscose rayon, etc.], the  viscosimetric test fails to provide an exact answer […or you have to calculate the inherent differences due to the pollution]!).\nSee, for example, the norm:\nUNI 8282:1994\n= Cellulose In Dilute Solutions – Determination Of Limiting Viscosity Number – Method In Cupri-ethylene-diamine (ced) Solution  \nor\nStandard Number:  UNI UNI 8282-1994\nTitle:  Cellulose in dilute solutions.

PLSR and PCR are both methods to model a response variable when there are a large number of predictor variables, and those predictors are highly correlated or even collinear. Both methods construct new predictor variables, known as components, as linear combinations of the original predictor variables, but they construct those components in different ways. PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all. On the other hand, PLSR does take the response variable into account, and therefore often leads to models that are able to fit the response variable with fewer components. Whether or not that ultimately translates into a more parsimonious model, in terms of its practical use, depends on the context.\n— —-\n>… These data are described in Kalivas, John H., “Two Data Sets of Near Infrared Spectra,” Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, v.37 (1997) pp.255-259.\nLink:\nhttp://it.mathworks.com/help/stats/examples/partial-least-squares-regression-and-principal-components-regression.html\n—- —\nThe Collinearity Problem in Linear Regression.

By varying the upper bound of correlation coefficient between absorbance and analyte’s content, the CCO-PLS method achieved multi-band selection. Two PLS-based methods, which used a waveband having positive peaks of the first loading vector (FLV) and a combination of positive peaks of the correlation coefficient spectrum, were also conducted for comparison. Based on the leave-one-out cross-validation for CCO-PLS, appropriate waveband combinations for ALB and GLB were selected, the root-mean-square errors of prediction for validation samples were 1.36 and 1.35 (g L−1) for ALB and GLB, respectively, which were better than the two comparison methods.
