[{"title":"The shroud, in part thanks to the debates surrounding its authenticity","post":"The msyterious ways of God. \nMaybe there was a reason for the flawed cabon dating that calls to mind something I have already writen. The issue is provenance but providence. Could it be that the erroneus carbon dating was a way of oushing the ball down the court to give science a time to catch-up with the “sign” of the Shroud and insure the controversy which would allow it to be again the center of attention. \nAnd who should emerge as the re-eminent spokesman for the Shroud but a man who in 1978 was a gangly young photographer and in the interim has now aged, and created the number one Shroud source on the web.\nI kidded Barrie, that his April sojurn was like a missionary trek of St. Paul. But the astounding coverage given his interview with the Cathoilic New Service and other media outlets on his missionary journey has raised interest in the Shroud. Certainly his perspective, as one raised in e Jewish family who was reluctant to get involved provides power to his message.\nAnd now America, the Jesuit Magazine that  Fr. Peter Rinaldi avoided beacsue of the sway of Thurston, reports on his views.\nBehold the signs of the time, He is coming, but he is coming not a cloud but therough science and Internet.\nAlleluia!\n\n","date":"May 14, 2013 at 8:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/14/the-shroud-in-part-thanks-to-the-debates-surrounding-its-authenticity/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-33649","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
