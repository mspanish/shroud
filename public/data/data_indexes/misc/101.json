[{"title":"CNN is Laying It On Thick","post":"It is nice to see that the Shroud has been included. The same cannot be said about some of the other material. As commented previously, the Rev. James Martin raises questions that he cannot answer and then points to his book. I have not read his book, however another book by the late Father Jacques Dreyfus, O.P., a Jewish convert to Catholicism who lived in Jerusalem can be recommended; “Did Jesus know that he was God?”.\nThis topic will be part of a review that I will have to write. It was the great liberal Protestant scholar Harnack who hit the nail on the head. Catholic scholar Schnackenburg came to say the same thing in a different way and Benedict XVI began to write “Jesus of Nazareth” where Schanackenburg had finished.\n\n","date":"February 25, 2015 at 3:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/cnn-is-laying-it-on-thick/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-191830","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"CNN is Laying It On Thick","post":"As everyone knows I have strong doubts about the authenticity of the Shroud but if you believe it is authentic, you also have to show the flagellation as affecting the whole of Jesus’ body, front and back, top to toe – unless you happen to believe that the criss-cross of flagellation marks were a later addition…..\n\n","date":"February 26, 2015 at 10:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/cnn-is-laying-it-on-thick/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-191889","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"CNN is Laying It On Thick","post":"Charles wrote: “(…) you (authenticists) also have to show the flagellation as affecting the whole of Jesus’ body, front and back, TOP TO TOE (upper cases mine)”.\nReminder (once more) for Charles: \nOn October 22, 2014 at 11:39 am, I wrote: \n“Isaiah 1: 5-6 does NOT specifically refer to scourge-marks as it reads:\n“Your whole head is injured,\nyour whole heart afflicted.\n6 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head\nthere is no soundness—\nonly wounds and welts\nand open sores,\nnot cleansed or bandaged\nor soothed with olive oil.”\nCould Charles show us scourge-marks on the TS man’s ‘crown of the head” and “soles of the feet”, PLEASE? The fact is there are none in those specific body areas! \nMarrow’s forced interpretation of Isaiah and consequently Charles’ is irrelevant and biased as too reductive to back up his 14th century made Lirey shroud hypothesis as far as the TS bloodied body image is concerned.” \nIsaiah 1.6. is not merely “the premonition of the flagellation”, as Charles wants us to believe, but that of Yeshua’s WHOLE Passion (crown of thorn wounds, spear wound, foot nail wounds etc included).\n\n","date":"February 26, 2015 at 11:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/cnn-is-laying-it-on-thick/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-191898","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"CNN is Laying It On Thick","post":"Max, I was not referring in this instance to James Marrow, a far greater expert in medieval iconography and Passion narratives than either of us. ( I assume you have read Marrow in detail- it is quite a long study- in order to comment that his is ‘a forced interpretation’. He brings in a lot of supporting material from his own archival work and certainly there seems enough evidence to suggest that his interpretation is anything but ‘forced’. It is not me who wants to believe that Isaiah 1.6 is a premonition of the Passion. As Marrow shows this was a specifically fourteenth century interpretation of that verse and he gives archival and iconographical evidence in support.)\nNo, I am looking at the Shroud itself. Barbara Faccini’s interpretation of the marks of the flagellation claims that ALL the marks on the Shroud are the direct result of three specific instruments. If she is right (and perhaps she is not), then any representation of the flagellation must show Jesus bound in such a way that the flagellation can mirror the marks on the Shroud in that the instruments used must reach front and back. If you click in to the posting you find a flagellation image where this would have been impossible so it is perhaps by someone who has not absorbed how the flagellation would have taken place if the Shroud is authentic.There is no need to illustrate the flagellation but if you do, and believe in the authenticity of the Shroud, then you have to show how the scourge marks or whatever on the Shroud, were possible.\n\n","date":"February 26, 2015 at 1:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/cnn-is-laying-it-on-thick/","cat":"other_sites","id":"comment-191906","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"}]
