Certain Christians may choose to accept selected miracles (the loaves & fishes, walking on water), whereas discounting others, such as the virgin birth.  For Catholics, transubstantiation could also be included in the mix, as it is a central tenet of the Roman Catholic faith.  A companion consideration to those above is where one’s own personal belief lies regarding whether our current understanding of science and scientific laws is complete in 2015, soon to be 2016.\nIn the situations described in the article, the de la Chapelle syndrome, there is uneven crossing over between the X and Y chromosome.  For the 1 out of every 100,000 males who are XX, there is still an involvement of (a portion of) a Y chromosome.  True, as Tipler contends, it would not be detected by the standard amelogenin X & Y genetic tests.  But a Y chromosome (or portion thereof) would be involved at some point in his scenario, just not that region that was evaluated (hence, the “negative” result).  If God intervened as some interpret the gospel to read, is it reasonable that God would be limited to just a portion of the Y, including only enough to technically qualify as male?  Why not the entire Y chromosome?  Why would God’s Son be anything other than a perfectly healthy, normal (XY), diploid human being? \nRegarding the 1995 results by Canale, additional gene sequences from chromosomes other than the X and Y were evaluated.  Several are polymorphic, that is, they show variation in sequence among the population (not everyone expresses the exact same form).  These are important in that they can provide information as to whether contamination of a sample (apart from any results from X or Y regions) may be present.\nFrom http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/kearse3.pdf : “In 1995, Canale and coworkers performed DNA analysis of samples taken from both the Turin Shroud (from the soles of the left and right feet) and the Sudarium of Oviedo. Several sequences were examined, including the amelogenin X and Y genes, THO1 (tyrosine hydroxylase), vWA (von Willebrand factor), FES/FPS (tyrosine kinase), and F13A1 (coagulation factor XIII), (16). Two of these regions, THO1 and vWA, are part of the CODIS standard 13 STRs (6,7). The authors reported that contamination between male and female DNA, and all of the other sequences examined was evident (16, 17). It was stated that the presence of male DNA on the Shroud was more noticeable that female DNA, and contamination by persons who touched the cloths was considered as a contributing factor (16,17). Consequently, such results were considered essentially null and void. “\n\n","date":"December 8, 2015 at 3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-215921","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jesus, the XX Male","post":"Short personal reflection: If Jesus would have been born from a virgin through a direct divine intervention, nobody in his own family (starting with his mother) would have been surprised to see him start to preach and performed miracles and all that…  However, that’s exactly the opposite that we see in the Gospels.

The fact that his own family didn’t understood his actions and speaches is very telling about this whole issue. The virginal birth is most probably an addition of Matthew and Luke to strengthen the faith of their new Christian communities.  There are a lot of things like that that were probably added because of the difficulty to believe in a Jewish Messiah that has been crucified (which is not at all what the Old Testament was thinking about the Messiah).  Most modern biblical scholars agree with me about that.  Again, that doesn’t mean Jesus was not the real Messiah.  That simply indicates that the new Christian communities of the First Century wanted desperately to back-up their claim about Jesus…  It’s pure human nature.\nConcerning the miracle of Cana, many scholars even think that the whole story is not historical at all and it is much more a made-up story to teach the community to always have faith and confidence in Christ.\nPersonaly, I have no problem believing that the heart of this story is historic, but the details concerning the faith and confidence of Mary versus Jesus that we found in the story can well be an addition to help a teaching about faith and confidence in Christ.\n\n","date":"December 9, 2015 at 9:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-215996","author":"Joe","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jesus, the XX Male","post":"It has been proposed that Luke, a doctor, spent much time with Mary in the post-resurrection era tending to her in her elder years.

He had to accept the unborn child as his, or see Mary stoned for dishonouring her marriage pledge to him.\nHe chooses, after the dream, to acknowledge the child as his own.

With the greater understanding we now have of the science of genetics, perhaps as expressed in our knowledge of human chromosomes, we ask: “If Jesus did not have a human father, how can he be truly man?  Conversely if he did have a human father, how can he be truly God?”  The traditional response has always been that he obtained his human nature solely from Mary, and his divine nature from being conceived by her being overshadowed by the Holy Spirit.  But the modern question of chromosomes now arises and remains with us. \nThe enigma certainly created problems for the early church fathers, as any review of the patristic literature certainly demonstrates.  But they saw the problem through the perspectives of classical Greek philosophy, rather than through our modern scientific perspective.  It led to many divisions within the early church, and the efforts to wrestle with the problem led to a variety of heresies.  \nPerhaps the most critical of these heresies was that of Arius, which prompted Constantine I to summon the Council of Nicea in 323.  Arius had attracted a large following through a message integrating Neoplatonism, which accented the absolute oneness of the divinity as the highest perfection, with a literal, rationalist approach to the New Testament texts.  He had taught that Christ is not divine but a created being.  The council condemned Arius and, with reluctance on the part of some, incorporated the nonscriptural word homoousios (“of one substance”) into the Nicene Creed to signify the absolute equality of the Son with the Father. The emperor then exiled Arius.  \nThe Council of Nicaea, in May 325, declared Arius a heretic after he refused to sign the formula of faith stating that Christ was of the same divine nature as God. Influential support from colleagues in Asia Minor and from Constantia, the emperor Constantine I’s daughter, succeeded in effecting Arius’ return from exile and his readmission into the church after consenting to a compromise formula. Shortly before he was to be reconciled, however, Arius collapsed and died while walking through the streets of Constantinople.  \nThe enigma had also I think created problems even for the gospel writers.  When did each believe that Jesus became God?  For Mark it is at his baptism by John the baptizer in the waters of the Jordan, when John sees the Holy Spirit descending on Jesus in the form of a dove and hears a voice from heaven affirming that this is God’s Son;  For both Matthew and Luke, it is right from the time of his conception, so they tell the story of the Annunciation by an angel.  But for the evangelist John, it is even before the beginning of time: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.”  \nBut the evangelist John also inserts in the same chapter, Mark’s story of the baptism: “John testified further, saying, “I saw the Spirit come down like a dove from the sky and remain upon him. I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘On whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain, he is the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit.’ Now I have seen and testified that he is the Son of God.”  \nThe enigma continues, and from whatever any limited human perspective we attempt to comprehend it, I think it will remain a divine mystery to our limited understanding.

By whom? How authoritative?  “It was a common enough practice”?  And that proves what?\n The four Captivity Epistles were written by Paul during his first imprisonment in Rome — Colossians, Ephesians, Philemon and Philippians, sometime between A.D. 61 and 63.  When Paul appealed to Caesar, Luke accompanied him from Caesarea, and was with him during the stormy voyage from Crete to Malta. They went on to Rome, where, during the two years that Paul was kept in prison, Luke was frequently at his side. He was present when the Epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians and Philemon were written, and is mentioned in the salutations given in two of them: “Luke the most dear physician, salute you” (Colossians 4:14); “There salute you . . . Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow laborers” (Philem., 24). \nsecond para:  “only late-2nd century traditions claim that Paul was the guarantor of Luke’s Gospel”? \nPaul himself quotes Luke twice in his Epistles.  Paul quotes Luke 10:7 in his letter to Timothy (1 Timothy 5:18).  Paul actually calls this 1 Timothy quotation a “Scripture”, “graphe” , meaning the written word, not an oral saying.\nPaul also used wording in describing the Lord’s Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 that is unmistakably from Luke 22:19, plus, the words are not found in any other gospel.  So Paul must have had access to a copy of Luke when he wrote 1 Corinthians, about AD 55.  \nProof well before the “late 2nd century”…  \nthird para:  “References are often made to Luke’s medical language, but there is no evidence of such language beyond that to which any educated Greek might have been exposed.” \nWow — big assumption.  Are you “up” on the status of the educated Greek of the first century?\nFurther, there is a striking resemblance between the prologue of the Gospel and a preface written by Dioscorides, a medical writer who studied at Tarsus in the first century. The words with which Hippocrates begins his treatise “On Ancient Medicine” should be noted in this connection.  It is believed that Luke met Paul at Tarsus.\nAlso third para:  “Of more import is the fact that in the writings of Luke specifically Pauline ideas are significantly missing”.  \nFor starters, of the characteristic words and phrases which mark the three Synoptic Gospels, a little more than half are common to Matthew and Paul, less than half common to Mark and Paul, but two-thirds common to Luke and Paul.\nIdeas:\nJustification by faith: Luke:  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. They asked, “Who then can be saved?”  Jesus replied, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”  “Truly I tell you, no one who has left home or wife or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God [true faith] will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come, eternal life.” (Luke 18:25).\nPaul:  “Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” (Rom. 5:1). \nThe Sacrifice:  The death of Jesus was associated with the Passover sacrifice in the context of the Lord’s Supper.  This conclusion can be drawn from I Corinthians 5:7.  If this is so, then for the Gospel, a connection is established between the significance of the Passover and the Last Supper (Luke 22:7-20).\n\n","date":"December 10, 2015 at 2:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-216157","author":"Nabber","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jesus, the XX Male","post":"Nabber:  “daveb’s first para: “it has been asserted this epistle [Colossians] is pseudonymous”? By whom? How authoritative? “It was a common enough practice”? And that proves what? ”  \nNabber, my position is that I think very little can be proved conclusively.  I am only reporting what I read from an authoritative source, which, succinctly, results from the analyses and consequent opinions of reputable exegetes who have studied these problems.  \nThe authors of these particular sections from the Biblical Literature article I mentioned above would have included:  The Rev. Krister Stendahl: Bishop of Stockholm, 1984-88. Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Divinity, Harvard University, 1981-84; Dean, Divinity School, 1968-79. Author of Paul Among Jews and Gentiles and others. … …Emilie T. Sander: Associate Professor of New Testament, Yale University, 1973-75. Coeditor and translator of The Bible and the Role of Women.  \nThe article’s introduction to the Pauline Letters states:\n“In the New Testament canon of 27 books, 21 are called “letters,” and even the Revelation to John starts and ends in letter form. Of the 21 letters, 13 belong to the Pauline corpus; the Letter to the Hebrews is included in the Pauline corpus in the East but not, however, in the West. Three letters of this corpus, the Pastoral Letters, are pseudonymous and thus are not considered here.” \n“Of the remaining 10, the Letters to the Colossians and Ephesians are from the hand of a later Pauline follower and II Thessalonians is spurious. How this Pauline corpus was collected and published remains obscure, but letters as part of Holy Scripture were an early established phenomenon of Christianity.”  \n“The letters of Paul, written only about 20-30 years after the crucifixion, were preserved, collected, and eventually “published.” In general, they answered questions of churches that he had founded. When all the Pauline Letters as a corpus were first known is difficult to determine. Because Pauline theology and some quotations and allusions were certainly known at the end of the 1st century, the Pauline Letters probably were collected and circulated for general church use by the end of the 1st century or soon thereafter. A disciple of Paul, possibly Onesimus, may have used Ephesians as a covering letter for the whole collection.”  \nConcerning the Authorship status of the three Pastoral Letters to Timothy and Titus, it is stated:\n“The Muratorian Canon (a list of biblical books from c. 180 includes references to the Pastoral Letters and notes that they were written “for the sake of affection and love.” They have a place in the canon because “they have been sanctified by an ordination of the ecclesiastical discipline.” These letters, however, do not appear among the Pauline letters in P 46, an early-3rd-century manuscript, and there is no clear external attestation in the primitive church concerning them until the end of the 2nd century.” \n“… … Linguistic facts-such as short connectives, particles, and other syntactical peculiarities; use of different words for the same things; and repeated unusual phrases otherwise not used in Paul-offer fairly conclusive evidence against Pauline authorship and authenticity.”  \nYou are entitled to a different opinion, if you so choose, and I respect it.  Peace.\n\n","date":"December 10, 2015 at 8:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-216177","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jesus, the XX Male","post":"Directed to Sampath Fernando:\nSampath, there are different ways of interpreting the Bible:\n https://www.academia.edu/12850351/Book_Review_The_Interpretation_of_Scripture_In_Defence_of_the_Historical-Critical_Method\n\n","date":"December 10, 2015 at 7:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-216119","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jesus, the XX Male","post":"Yes….but I doubt Jesus meant several different ways to interpret what he said…that’s why we have many many  Christian faiths…..interpret the bible your way and start your own church…..dance with vipers, pray that people die, homosexuals go to hell, only members of my church go to heaven, rapture stuff etc…..not saying you are incorrect Louis….just that interpreting incorrectly can be a big problem\n\n","date":"December 10, 2015 at 11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-216141","author":"rick","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jesus, the XX Male","post":"Sampath….you might enjoy this: National Georgraphic..this month…How Mary became the most powerful woman in the world”\nhttp://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/virgin-mary-text\n\n","date":"December 10, 2015 at 7:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","id":"comment-216173","author":"rick","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Jesus, the XX Male","post":"Thank you Rick.
