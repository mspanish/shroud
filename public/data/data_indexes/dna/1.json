In this work, surface-enhanced\nRaman spectroscopy (SERS) was applied to\nthe analysis of textile fibers dyed with madder\nfrom two different botanical species, Oldenlandia\numbellata L. and Rubia tinctorum L.\n>The resulting SERS spectra were interpreted\nin light of the actual composition of the madder\ndyes as determined by high-performance liquid\nchromatography. Interestingly, the SERS spectra\nwere found to exhibit very distinctive spectral\nfeatures depending on the different anthraquinone\nderivatives present in the dyes. In particular, the\nSERS spectrum of O. umbellata L. was found to\nmatch the spectrum of alizarin, while the SERS\nspectrum of R. tinctorum L. was surprisingly\ndominated by signals due to the less studied\nanthraquinone compound pseudopurpurin.\n>With this study, we demonstrate that SERS spectra\nmay offer valuable information regarding the major\ncoloring constituents present in different madder species.\n>Moreover, our work shows that not only can SERS\nbe used successfully to differentiate among closely\nrelated anthraquinone derivatives, but also that\nthis technique is particularly suitable for the detection\nof pseudopurpurin, leading to the identification of\nthis compound in a number of works of art. \nCopyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n— —\nI want to add that I don’t believe\nthis interesting (but possible misleading …or mad?!?)\n“problem about investigation on madder”\n(this also in reference to “the madder-dyed\nShroud” by Adrie van Hoeven and to the\nprevious words by Louis:\n“…There is mention of the Harappan (Indus Valley\nCivilisation) custom of dyeing cloth and there\nseems to be evidence of dyeing with red madder…”)\nas the “main solving key” for Turin Shroud Enigma…\n\n","date":"October 8, 2015 at 9:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-212046","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Louis makes it a point to substantiate what he writes:\nhttp://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/indian-textiles-introduction/\n\n","date":"October 8, 2015 at 10:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-212050","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin","post":"First of all:\nDyeing techniques (I am a technician dyer …):\n>Distinctive features of Indian textiles include\nthe use of madder dye, which gives a vibrant\nred, and a consistent range of decorative motifs.\n>Madder comes from the roots of a herbaceous\nclimbing plant known as ‘chay’. … etc. …\nWords found under the same link:\nhttp://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/indian-textiles-introduction/\nYes…\nBut in our time, marked by the emergence of\nspecific techniques (and then, here,\nI can refer also to the CRISPR technique)\nis certainly interesting to talk about DNA …\nLink:\nhttp://labiotech.eu/sorry-crispr-youll-have-to-wait-another-year-to-win-a-nobel-prize/\n>Even if CRISPR was in the short-list to win the prize,\nthis trio’s DNA repairing mechanisms were awarded\nthe Nobel prize in Chemistry (which if we’re honest\nat Labiotech, did not see coming at all…).\n>Arguably, one possible reason for this is that\nLindahl & co.’s discovery is over 30 years old,\nwhilst the gene-editing system CRISPR/Cas9\nwas only published in 2012.

Bring in the scientists, let them study the micrographs, and the truth may then be revealed, and it’s no longer the mystery that it was.  The fear is that the cloth may be proved to be not what it appears to be.  Goodbye to the tourist dollars.  Goodbye to the worshippers. \nBut what if indeed it is the burial cloth of the Christ?

The map diagrams in the paper illustrate the regions throughout the world that such signals are primarily associated with.   A previous posting had confused the authors discussion of human DNA (from India) plant DNA.\nThe studies show that DNA from multiple plant species and (not surprisingly) multiple persons are present on the cloth.  With the latter findings, It’s important to emphasize that this is not DNA isolated from bloodstains threads themselves, but from vacuumed surface dusts. \nWhen a DNA signal is detected that correlates with a particular geographical location, India, for example, it’s impossible to know from just that data exactly how or when that DNA signal got there. The authors are appropriately cautious & conservative in their conclusions.\nFor example, If someone who lived in the U.S. told you they found fifty euros in their pants pocket, it’s possible they could have traveled to Italy recently and obtained it themselves.  It’s also possible that someone else could have traveled from Italy to the U.S. and given it to them.  Even still, a third party could have received it from someone else and placed it there.  Without other info, one is unable to distinguish between the possibilities-all you can really say is that the fifty euros is there.  Sort of like the bird DNA they found on the Shroud-maybe a bird landed directly on the cloth at some point or perhaps the bird landed on a plant, that eventually came in contact with the cloth.\nThe comment about DNA from flax refers to sequencing (plant) DNA from the Shroud fibers as opposed to the surface dusts.  For this to be particularly meaningful, enough genetic variation would have to exist among flax from different geographical regions-I don’t know if this is the case or not.  (The flax genome has been recently sequenced). \nThis wasn’t particularly brief, but I hope it helps.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2015 at 8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-212185","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Thanks Kelly, it did help.

Not that I think you’re doing this, but the current studies do not readily extrapolate to the bloodstains.  The bloodstains would need to be examined directly.  DNA sequencing has the advantage over immunological testing there in that it shows both the similarities as well as the differences; immunological (antibody) tests just show reactivity or no reactivity.  Only similarities are revealed, making it difficult to distinguish between the two (primate vs. human); although antibodies are now available (2010) that can do this.  On the other hand, immunological testing has the advantage over sequencing in that it specifically denotes a blood cell product; with DNA sequencing, you can’t tell if the signal comes from blood cells or skin cells.  DNA rearrangement of immune receptor genes (specific for lymphocytes, i.e. white blood cells ) would have to be examined, if doable, to specifically claim that a DNA signal was present from blood cells.\n\n","date":"October 11, 2015 at 8:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-212324","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Ok, thank you for your answer.

To begin to make any specific conclusion about the DNA present in bloodstains, sample(s) would have to be taken directly from there.  Regarding the amount of DNA material, who knows?  Degradation and contamination could preclude any meaningful interpretation, but (only my opinion), you don’t know until you look.  The bloodstains may hold somewhat of an advantage in that samples could be taken from the back of the cloth (even below the surface to minimize visual alteration).  Sampling from multiple sites (CODIS approach) is absolutely key.\n[Separate from the most recent report, DNA studies have the potential to address additional questions, including confirmation of blood type, blood touch up throughout the years, and if other types of blood (cow, goat, chicken, etc.) might also exist on the cloth, (in addition to primate which was reported).  The only other species for which any data exists is rabbit, which serendipitously fell out of the previous studies years ago (in control samples).  The species question could also be approached serologically, in ways that maximize the sample (using a sequential approach on a single sample).]  \nIt is important to bear in mind that even sampling from bloodstained areas technically does not prove that the DNA signal originated from blood cells.  In the Garza-Valdes studies, bloodstained fibers were reported to be positive for the betaglobin gene (a subunit of hemoglobin).  All one can conclude is that the sample tested positive for betaglobin DNA.  Skin cells also contain the betaglobin gene.  Similarly, skin cells and lymphocytes both contain mtDNA.  \n[To definitely prove that the DNA signal originated from blood cells, one would need a means to distinguish a signal that was uniquely present in one cell type but not the other.  Lymphocytes are unique among all cell types in the body in that their receptor genes (immunoglobulin, T cell receptor) undergo DNA rearrangement as part of their normal development.  The variability that exist among immune receptors is beyond huge, but there are certain so-called constant regions without such variability (e.g. kappa light chain) adjoining the splice, which could potentially allow rearrangement to be evaluated.  Of course, degradation could be a major obstacle, though much is being done with smaller & smaller amounts of DNA.]\nI think there are a lot of Shroud questions to focus on, C-14 and DNA are just two of them.  Even apart from DNA studies, there are many basic questions about the Shroud bloodstains that remain unresolved.  The most important question to focus on, above all, is the message which the Shroud represents.  This extends across scientific disciplines (and beyond).  The message will remain, whether the Shroud is authentic or not.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2015 at 10:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","id":"comment-212436","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"}]
