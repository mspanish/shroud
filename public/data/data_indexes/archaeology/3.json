It is meant to be part of a maniple or stole and dated to the fourteenth century.\nOne of the experts in ancient weaving I have been consulting has used three-in one in weaving silk vestments.\nDoes not prove much other than that weave was known at that time.\nRarity again does not help us much. Villers has an article (.p.77) on the silk  Parement of Narbonne ,a sole survival from a chapelle, a set of vestments, altar cloths and church hangings, usually made up of at least twenty cloths.   It was made for the French king Charles V in the late fourteenth century  but he had 57 chapelles, in total more than 1000 decorated, painted cloths, and this is the only one we still have!\nWe have already noted that herringbone of one sort of another is vary ancient and common and has nothing to help us with the Shroud- it is the distinct  three in one that is rare, at least as a survivor.\n\n","date":"January 28, 2015 at 7:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/28/is-that-another-example-of-medieval-herringbone-linen/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-186911","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is that another example of medieval herringbone linen?","post":"“Rarity again does not help us much.”  So true.  But best to look at the whole rather than the sum of the parts.\nLet’s recall Spinoza’s saying, “All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.” Excellant and and difficult and rare the shroud is.  The quality of the cloth adds to the mystique of the shroud.  Certainly worthy of burial cloth of the Christ!\n\n","date":"January 28, 2015 at 2:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/28/is-that-another-example-of-medieval-herringbone-linen/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-186992","author":"Stan Walker, MD","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is that another example of medieval herringbone linen?","post":"Excellent!
