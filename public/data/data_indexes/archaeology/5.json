We are dealing with someone commissioned to produce a souvenir badge with-  I believe – an ulterior motive to deflect unwelcome attention from the local bishop, and who was incredibly superb at his craft, incorporating a vast amount of fine detail into a relatively small badge. What’s more, his finished product would have been closely scrutinized by the de Charney/de Vergy family who set out to market their mischievous and enigmatic Shroud.
