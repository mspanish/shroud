I was a Christian for nearly 40 years before I discovered the Shroud. So if the Shroud was a fake, it would not affect my Christian faith.

Although it has to be conceded that there are a minority of non-Christians who do accept that the Shroud is authentic, because the evidence for it being Jesus' burial sheet is overwhelming, and they are somehow able to reconcile their non-Christianity with it. >Belated Christmas blessings to you and yours,Thanks.

It seems as though many Christians today of a variety of camps, think that something so fantastic is very questionable. We are all infected to varying degrees with the dominant philosophy of our age, Naturalism, i.e. nature is all there is, there is no supernatural.I have debated with Christians who are almost practical atheists, i.e. they live almost as though there is no God.Then there are Protestant Christians who are opposed to the Shroud because it is Roman Catholic, not realising there were no Protestants until 1517 and   the RC church did not own the Shroud until 1983 and it has always hedged its bets on the Shroud's authenticity. A quote in historian Robert Drews' (a non-Christian who accepts the Shroud is 1st century and of Jesus but it is a form of imprinting now lost to us) book hits the nail on the head, why even most Christians (including me until 2005) dismiss the Shroud out of hand as a fake, \"The Shroud ... is obviously too good to be true.\"\"That the scholarly world has been so reluctant to turn its attention to the Shroud may at first glance seem puzzling, but is explicable all the same. The Shroud is a sheet of linen bearing frontal and dorsal images of a body said to be the crucified body of Jesus Christ. This sensational, or even preposterous, claim is itself an explanation for the indifference of scholarly historians: an object touted as a memento from the crucifixion of Jesus, and so from the central episode in Western history, is obviously too good to be true.\" (Drews, R., \"In Search of the Shroud of Turin: New Light on Its History and Origins,\" Rowman & Allanheld: Totowa NJ, 1984, p.2).>But from my viewpoint, the same Lord that was raised to life, could certainly allow for such a blessing to be deposited in a physical form.

Interest in the Shroud is definitely picking up. The news stories about the supposed debunkings only create more interest in it, as the public increasingly asks, \"why all these continuing new claims to debunk the Shroud when it was supposedly proven to be a fake over 20 years ago?\"The 2010 exposition of the Shroud should create even greater interest in it.

See \"Pliny the Elder - Natural History.\" How could a forger know all this?

Mt 27:57 says that Joseph of Arimathea was \"a rich man\" and Mk 15:46 says he \"bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock.\" That is, Joseph of Arimathea , who was \"a disciple of Jesus\" (Mt 27:57; Jn 19:38), and risked all to claim the crucified body of Jesus and then buried it in his own new tomb, would have bought the most expensive linen shroud available in Jerusalem. So in that sense the Shroud was not typical, because it was top-of-the-range 1st century Jewish. >Trying to disauthenticate the Shroud of Turin with such a weak claim is ludicrous.Agreed.

No. The Shroud is fully consistent with the Bible and in fact supports the Gospels' account of Jesus suffering, death and resurrection. As an evangelical Christian, the Shroud would never have got to first base with me if there were major discrepencies between it and the Bible.There are many books on the Shroud by Christians who have pointed that out. For example, Stevenson & Habermas' \"Verdict on the Shroud\" (1981) have a whole chapter, \"The New Testament and the Shroud.\" Their \"The Shroud and the Controversy\" (1990) answers many other Biblical objections. Habermas is a leading Bible-believing evangelical theologian and he fully deals with all the Biblical issues.>This article points out in the light of the Bible that the shroud of Turin is a fake: http://koti.phnet.fi/petripaavola/shroudofturin.htmlThanks for the link. But the article is wrong on all its key points. Significantly his reference list does not include any actual books on the Shroud, which discuss the Biblical and Jewish issues at depth. It is typical of well-meaning but uninformed criticism of the Shroud by some Christians. Also, many of the leading Shroud advocates are Jewish, including Barrie Schwortz, the owner of the world's leading Shroud website, Shroud.com, and in online interviews he has defended the compatibility of the Shroud with both 1st century Jewish custom and the Bible. A Jewish scholar called Victor Tunkel has defended the Shroud's compatibility with 1st century Jewish burial customs. A Google search on \"Shroud\" and \"Tunkel\" together will bring up quotes by him defending the Shroud's authenticity from a Jewish perspective.

But I could have made it clearer that the Old Testament prohibited Jews wearing clothes \"made of two kinds of material\" (Lev 19:19); and in particular \"You shall not wear cloth of wool and linen mixed together\" (Dt 22:11); so the wearer of this shroud was most probably not a Jew.>Plus the fact this man suffered of the so mentioned deceases and these deceases were not common in the Jewish population of the time. Disagree.

Which is itself an amazing proof of the overriding hand of God in the crucifixion and burial of Jesus. There `just happened' to be a rich man, who `just happened' to be a disciple of Jesus who `just happened' to own an unused tomb:Mt 27:57-60. 57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. 58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.near to the site of Jesus' crucifixion:John 19:38-42. 38 After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus ... asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. 39 Nicodemus also ... 40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths ... 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 42 So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.and who `just happened' to be a member of the Jewish Sanhedrin, so he could obtain permission from Pilate to take Jesus body and bury it:Lk 23:50-53. 50 Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council ... 52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 53 Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid.>... Joseph was a wealthy man, traveled to distant lands, obviously the shroud was the finest he could find – not a local weave. It doesn't follow that the fine linen shroud which Joseph \"bought\" in the Jerusalem markets (Mk 15:46 \"bought\" is Gk. agorasas \"bought in an agora - a market\"), was \"not a local weave\". >He had prepared the tomb and obviously the \"fine linen' cloth for his own use. The tomb yes, but not the cloth. Mt 27:60 says of the former that it was Joseph's \"own new tomb,\" but none of the Gospels say that of the Shroud. And Mk 15:46 says that Joseph had \"bought\" the shroud but not that he had bought the tomb also. So there is a clear distinction that Joseph already owned the tomb but he had to buy the Shroud that day.>The fact that the recent found cloth was a 'simpler two-way weave' doesn't prove that the Turin Shroud could not be authentic???? Agreed. It's so fallacious it is amazing that a scholar could have said it, and that a journalist could uncritically report it.>In addition, perhaps the fact that the cloth was so fine/expensive, is the reason it was saved, not discarded after the resurrection???It may have been a factor. But the fact that it was Jesus' burial shroud left behind after His resurrection was a more compelling reason why the disciples did not leave Jesus' burial clothes in the now empty tomb to be taken by graverobbers.In support of this is the fact that another item of Jesus' graveclothes, the Sudarium of Oviedo, was also saved and not discarded, and there is nothing intrinsically valuable about that.
