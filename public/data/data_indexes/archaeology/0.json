[{"title":"An Early Beardless Jesus with Short Hair","post":"In the absence of any known reputable acheiropteios (not made by human hands) image of Christ, the cultural norm would have been to represent Christ and the saints according to the cultural norms of the artisan.  The bearded Christ only seems to have become traditional following the emergence of the Image of Edessa around the sixth century.  In an oriental culture, Christ would have been depicted with oriental features.  I am acquainted with several Maori depictions of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, commonly wearing moko (facial tattoo) huia feather in the hair (signifying chieftainship), and wearing a feathered cloak (sign of royalty), notwithstanding known European depictions.  The statues in the early colonial NZ churches normally had light Irish features, usually with blue eyes.  Artisan’s motives are not solely religious, they are also (even subconsciously) culturally affirming.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2014 at 3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/an-early-beardless-jesus-with-short-hair/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-160191","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Early Beardless Jesus with Short Hair","post":"I agree. Even if there is an “established” image, regional influence is often seen. Take for  example the Guadalupe and the several depictions that color her skin darker than the stereotypical depictions of Mary.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2014 at 5:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/an-early-beardless-jesus-with-short-hair/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-160212","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Early Beardless Jesus with Short Hair","post":"Interesting question as to why the bearded Jesus came to be.\nwas it because of the mandylion / shroud…\nor was it because of the Greek influence (bearded equals wise).\n\n","date":"October 8, 2014 at 1:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/an-early-beardless-jesus-with-short-hair/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-160319","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"An Early Beardless Jesus with Short Hair","post":"Obviously a stylized depiction of Jesus the philosopher.

This isn’t news except it is the earliest find of an image of Jesus (which is cool history, but has no bearing on the Shroud).\n\n","date":"October 7, 2014 at 9:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/an-early-beardless-jesus-with-short-hair/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-160252","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"}]
