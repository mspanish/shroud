[{"title":"Newly Discovered Very Early Image of Jesus?","post":"Louis mentioned this a few days ago Apr 27, report was from a different web-site.  We both noted that subject identity was still speculative – [Archaeologist Padro says “could be… Jesus”, inscriptions still to be translated].  Conceivable it could be a saint [St Mark supposed to have been in Egypt], If it’s meant to be Jesus, it might only be representational, [Augustine said nobody knew what he looked like] Tombs date to 6th-7th century.  Mandylion emerged in Edessa ~540AD, earliest known icon of Jesus is Christ Pantocrator, St Catherine’s, Sinai, 6th century.  No images of finding available yet.

When I found a link to the Syriac bible the first time, the article mentioned a sculpture of Jesus was found in a village in Turkey.  I then searched on both google and bing images, but there was no photo of the sculpture. I cannot find that original article, but I saw it today.   I’d really like to see a photo of the sculpture and how far back it is dated.  I’ll try to locate that particular article.\nBest,\n\n","date":"May 4, 2014 at 9:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/30/newly-discovered-very-early-image-of-jesus/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-111246","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Newly Discovered Very Early Image of Jesus?","post":"Angel, I remember now that I too saw it but didn’t pay much attention as it was 11th century.
