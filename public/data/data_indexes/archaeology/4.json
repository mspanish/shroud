If the material had been assembled into a single sheet, it must have been a patchwork rather than uniform, which is perhaps odd as other findings suggest that although the dead man had leprosy, he was nevertheless well cared for in life and death.

The mixture of wool and linen is curious, and would seem to breach Judaic laws mixing the two.  Perhaps as a leper, this may not have been objectionable,as he was already unclean.  Diana Fulbright’s paper has a variety of shroud types, some also from the 1st century, some of animal hides.  There was a wide variety of burial garments in the 1st century, some excessively expensive, to the point where Gamaliel II directed that he be buried in a plain shroud, and this became the subsequent custom, unless the deceased happened to be clothed in his normal attire.  The anniversary custom of placing the bones in an ossuary, discontinued after 70 AD, was apparently not intended here, as unusually the tomb was sealed.  The 1st century ossuary practice means that few other 1st century Jewish shrouds have survived, and a unique case cannot be said to be typical of anything.  Discovery of a single pine box cannot imply that all modern western burial coffins are pine!       .\n\n","date":"March 21, 2015 at 10:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/21/tabor-a-distinctive-1st-century-weave/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-193988","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tabor: A Distinctive 1st Century Weave","post":"One would think textile research is an obvious and potentially lucrative avenue for shroud research\n\n","date":"March 22, 2015 at 2:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/21/tabor-a-distinctive-1st-century-weave/","cat":"archaeology","id":"comment-193999","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tabor: A Distinctive 1st Century Weave","post":"The most authorised comment on the relations between first century textiles in Palestine and the Shroud is: Orit Shamir: “A burial textile from the first century CE in Jerusalem compared to roman textiles in the land of Israel and the Turin Shroud”, 2014 Workshop on Advances in the Turin Shroud Investigation,  SHS Web of Conferences , Volume 15, 2015.http://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2015/02/shsconf_atsi2014_00010/shsconf_at\nFulbrigth’s article (Fulbright, Diana (2010): “Akeldama Repudiation of Turin Shroud omits evidence from Judean Desert”.

Yes I can understand how the mixture  might be acceptable in the case of a burial cloth, I may have come across this info previously.  She mentions that some fabrics are S twist and some Z, but does not make clear whether these refer to wool or linen.  I do not see a problem with authenticity merely the fact of the TS being Z twist, nor that it is not plain weave, because of various active trade routes, the possibility that it may have been imported, even from outside of the Middle East.  I do not see that it is necessary for the TS to have a Jewish nor Middle East origin in order to be authentic.
