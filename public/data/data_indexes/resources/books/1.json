The spontaneous recovery was so unexpected for him that he cooperated with the Church commission in Malta and went to Rome for the canonization.\n#22 The reference was to incorruption.Some years ago I interviewed a scholar who was studying the phenomena and heard that there were around 500 of these bodies, in varying conditions of incorruption, and of these about ten were in perfect condition, saints like Isabel, queen of Portugal, Philip Neri, the one in Lourdes and so on. There are other cases where people involved in some religious phenomena like apparitions have been found incorrupt, such as Jacintha, but not her brother Francisco, of the Marto family, in Fatima, Portugal.

The article is by Mgr John Broadbent, a highly regarded church historian in NZ. It concerns Fr Antoine Marie Garin, 1810-89, a French Marist missionary to NZ associated with Bishop Pompallier, and a major founder of Catholic education here, particularly in the Nelson province (Ernest Rutherford country). I’ve since discovered other material about Fr Garin, including a college student’s competition essay, but Fr Broadbent’s piece will have the authority of proper historical research behind it.  \nThe full article can be found at:\nhttp://wel-com.org.nz/wel-com-articles/3633-catholic-pioneers-fr-antoine-marie-garin and includes a portrait by noted artist Goddfried Lindauer. The article concludes:\n“Following his death on 14 April 1889 Fr Garin was buried in a temporary grave in Nelson’s Wakapuaka cemetery [I have a great-grandfather buried there (db)]; the whole district wanted to build a memorial chapel over his remains. The body was disinterred 18 months later and found to be completely intact, though the vestments had rotted.” “It is now buried under heavy concrete in the chapel’s crypt.”\nElsewhere it is stated that although the coffin was water-logged and his vestments had rotted, Fr Garin’s body was incorrupt, a number of winesses signing an affidavit to this effect.  The article also mentions that Fr Garin suffered severe bronchitis in his last years. It is possible that he had been taking medication for it, which I suppose might satisfy a naturalistic explanation. Apparently the heavy concrete was placed over the grave as a disincentive to a popular cult developing.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2013 at 4:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","id":"comment-38654","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles","post":"That is a good lead, David, and a similar case was seen by me some years ago, the difference being that it was the body of an archbishop dead for a hundred years and whose body was being transferred to the crypt of the recently completed cathedral.

It is for this reason that the second interview left some gaps when the topic was incorruption and no further explanation was available. Anyway, there are some details that should help you clear your doubts regarding true and false incorruption:\nFalse incorruption:\nArtificial techiques\nEmbalming\nFactors such as dry lands, with the climate influencing the state of the body\n“Larvas” – the body remains intact depending on the conditions in which it is preserved,\n                 then turns into powder instantly when exposed to air. This can happen when\n                 some coffins are opened.\nCalcification – organic material can influence the preservation or decomposition of the\n                       body\nFreezing – due to natural conditions, in places like Siberia, the Himalayan region etc.\nFat – Fat derived from pork can be used to preserve bodies, some tribes in Africa have\n         used this method\nLightning and radioactivity – These can also influence the state of a body, but it seems that\n                                             it depends on the body \nHypha Pombicina Pers – fungus that can preserve the body, at least for a while. Can\n                                       apply to the bodies of the Capuchin monks in Palermo, Sicily\n                                       and Malta\n“Saponification” – ammonia is involved and the external skin becomes hard\nTrue incorruption;\nThere are hundreds of bodies of saints that are partially incorrupt, some in a\ncardboard-like state. This is the case of the body of the Basque saint Francis Xavier,\npreserved in Goa, India, from which it can be deduced that it remained totally incorrupt for a long time. Many of the bodies still have blood in them, or oil/fragrance emanates from them, and these are in a perfect or semi-perfect state. Some of the saints cited were Francis de Sales, Bernadette Soubirous (Lourdes), Queen Isabel of Portugal, Philip Neri. The blood of some martyred saints has remained intact,outside the bodies. \nHope you will find this helpful and, as mentioned earlier, the Church is still investigating the phenomenon.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2013 at 4:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","id":"comment-38665","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles","post":"Another notable case of incorruption is that of Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati, 1901-25, son of a prominent Italian family, dying at the early age of 24 abd beatified by Pope JP II in 1990.
