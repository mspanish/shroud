Alternatively, one can say that the human soul is spiritual. Thomas Nagel does not fail at the level of reflective judgment, he fails at the level of intelligence. Usually intelligence has to do with how fast or slow it takes someone to grasp a concept. Nagel doesn’t even grasp the theory of the human mind judged to be true by Catholic philosophers.\n\n","date":"December 13, 2013 at 3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/please-only-discuss-michael-judes-book-and-claims-here/","cat":"books","id":"comment-58970","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Please Only Discuss Michael Jude’s Book and Claims Here","post":"$15.00 for a book by an author I’ve never heard of making some pretty outlandish claims?

I decided to produce and market a brochure. Because certain parts of the book are, admittedly, not an ‘easy read’, I wanted to take one of the many many topics of the book and write about/explain it in simpler terms. I decided upon the Shroud of Turin for its high profile even among people who are not interested in religion, philosophy, etc. I also wanted the context and syntax of the brochure to be such that it mimicked the ‘ here it is, read it and just believe it without thought’ style of so many organized religions. I convinced one book store to stock it and it sold there for about a year when I decided to pull it off the shelf. I had an opportunity to speak with the owner of the chain of stores. He told me the brochure had great potential and suggested I find a distributor for it. I tried to find a distributor but could not seem to cut through all of the red tape necessary for me to contact them vis a vis. I’ve often thought of resurrecting the brochure….\n\n","date":"December 14, 2013 at 6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/please-only-discuss-michael-judes-book-and-claims-here/","cat":"books","id":"comment-59257","author":"michael jude","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Please Only Discuss Michael Jude’s Book and Claims Here","post":"Dan….I will refrain from any further comments.

Describing a revelatory vision I experienced ( one of two ) whose influence later enabled me to concisely explain how the image was formed I wrote in my 1990 book ( page 29 ) titled Thirteenth Apostle: The Coming Transubstantiation, the following….” my affiance to the task implacable, it came to pass that I was to resolve the mystery of his appearance and other areas on concern regarding his presence through the distinct manner of his posture as He first appeared to me. For in the premonition His physical wounds via His crucifixion seemed to be emphasized, accentuated, set apart from the rest of his physical form as though they were being in a third dimension holographic style”. In December 2013 I contacted the person who is considered to be the innovator of using 3D holograms for such a purpose and asked when he first initiated the process. When he wrote back saying the year was 2004 I wrote him again asking if the idea of doing so had previously existed. He responded saying, verbatim, ” no, nobody ever thought of that possibility and that surprised me too in 2004″. Again, my book was written 14 years before….\n\n","date":"December 31, 2013 at 10:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/please-only-discuss-michael-judes-book-and-claims-here/","cat":"books","id":"comment-70740","author":"michael jude","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Please Only Discuss Michael Jude’s Book and Claims Here","post":"I left out the word PORTRAYED in the above comment….the line should read ” as though they were being portrayed in a third dimension, holographic style”   if anyone took the time to read it, I apologize for the error\n\n","date":"January 2, 2014 at 7:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/please-only-discuss-michael-judes-book-and-claims-here/","cat":"books","id":"comment-71070","author":"michael jude","site":"shroudstory"}]
