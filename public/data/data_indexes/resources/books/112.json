[{"title":"Penguin: We wanted to get it out before Easter","post":"Frankly, I think the author’s principal premise has as much reality as “da Vinci photo shopped” it. Yet he authors of that disputable premise  begin by destroying the Shroud is a “painted”  fake premise. I await the Cambridge Shroud explanation. It will be necessary to sift the facts from the theory reported and see what of value is there.\nHowever, don’t sneeze at the fact that a major publisher is giving a “Shroud is real” book real exposure. The door to renewed public understanding may be opening.\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 10:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/penguin-we-wanted-to-get-it-out-before-easter/","cat":"books","id":"comment-9692","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Penguin: We wanted to get it out before Easter","post":"Unbelievable. And they want to get it out before EASTER?  Why, because it’s so SPECIAL or because three idiots at Penguin want to SHOVE this trash in the FACES of all Christian Believers and make them CHOKE on it?  Right in the midst of the most Holy of all Christian holidays?  \nThis whole thing, every bit of it, could be labeled Blasphemy.\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 10:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/penguin-we-wanted-to-get-it-out-before-easter/","cat":"books","id":"comment-9693","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Penguin: We wanted to get it out before Easter","post":"Annie,\nBefore you get too apoplectic check out the U-Tube.
