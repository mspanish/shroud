[{"title":"On Early Reviews","post":"I may have been a little too critical of Hugh. His confusion at my use of an “Americanism” was sincere.

Whatever you write, however well researched, however much you have specialist knowledge others do not have, you will still get people who say what you write is garbage, or plagiarism or dishonest . Just learn to live with it and never respond with the same kind of abuse! I think you are too sensitive to even the most mild of criticism. Wait until somebody really pulls your book apart!\n\n","date":"October 21, 2014 at 3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/21/on-early-reviews/","cat":"books","id":"comment-164405","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"}]
