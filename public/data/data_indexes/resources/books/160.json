Meanwhile, I have just read one by another intrepid Shroud researcher, Mark Guscin.  I can recommend it.  It is not often the trail of the Shroud is so entwined with such a passionate and sensual love story. Guscin also approaches it from a most unusual direction so that the Shroud, although the quarry, sneaks up on the reader from behind.  http://markguscin.createsend4.com/t/ViewEmail/r/DB9E2B2204CE1BC9/076978B99E3211473D3F7F9A22A6E02E\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 3:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/31/new-book-wrapped-up-in-the-shroud-of-turin-chronicle-of-a-passion-by-joseph-g-marino/","cat":"books","id":"comment-6507","author":"David Rolfe","site":"shroudstory"}]
