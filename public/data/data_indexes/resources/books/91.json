It also becomes necessary to add that one has to be doubly careful when it comes to late gnostic documents that also have something to do with biblical figures.\nThe latest byJacobovici/Wilson is some reweaving of gnostic documents with the Joseph and Aseneth (Old Testament) sixth-century story and the result is that we get Jesus and Mary Magdalene instead of Joseph and Aseneth. That is the “Lost Gospel” of Jacobovici/Wilson. It is not a Gospel at all.\nThere seem to be no limits to this agenda-driven pseudo-scholarship.”\nIt seems that since the “Jesus family tomb” has been rejected by top biblical scholars and archaeologists, both in Israel and abroad:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III\nthis is an attempt to try to lend credibility to the proposition. There is no evidence, what we see is desperation, the authors clutching at straws.\n\n","date":"November 12, 2014 at 7:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/12/utter-hogwash/","cat":"books","id":"comment-170807","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Utter hogwash","post":"S.Jacobovovici also bases some of his contentions on a book authored by Keith Laidler.
