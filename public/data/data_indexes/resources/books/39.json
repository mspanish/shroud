[{"title":"So what is Josh McDowell’s take on the Shroud of Turin these days?","post":"I posted the following to an Internet group on 12/22:  \nI recently saw a new book by Josh McDowell, author of Evidence That Demands a Verdict.  McDowell has traditionally been skeptical of the Shroud’s authenticity.  Ken Stevenson knows him and tried at one point to get McDowell to reconsider all of the evidence.  McDowell’s new book is titled (as I remember)  Evidences for Christianity:  Historical evidences for the Christian Faith.  The book is over 600 pages.  And how much mention is made of the Shroud?   ZERO.  But I guess that since he usually makes a point to mention it to debunk it, maybe this is progress?\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/so-what-is-josh-mcdowells-take-on-the-shroud-of-turin-these-days/","cat":"books","id":"comment-7860","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is Josh McDowell’s take on the Shroud of Turin these days?","post":"I don’t know anything about Josh McDowell’s position on the Shroud. But my experience is that right-wing Protestants tend to treat the Shroud as a threat to the authority of scripture. Mining the words of scripture to understand what happened–that’s a good thing. But something outside scripture that could provide hard, physical evidence for key events reported in scripture, and could thus conceivably carry more authority than scripture–definitely not all right. \nIt seems odd at first that even conservative Protestants who argue for the resurrection don’t mention the Shroud. They muster detailed (and I think often quite good) historical arguments as to why Jesus was actually raised. You’d think they would give their eye teeth for something like the Shroud, which could turn out to be real, scientific evidence of the very thing they are arguing for. Yet it’s not on their radar screen. The idea I relate above is the only way I have been able to explain it.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 12:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/so-what-is-josh-mcdowells-take-on-the-shroud-of-turin-these-days/","cat":"books","id":"comment-7862","author":"Robert","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is Josh McDowell’s take on the Shroud of Turin these days?","post":"Thank you very much for the kind words and the link!\nRichard\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 2:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/so-what-is-josh-mcdowells-take-on-the-shroud-of-turin-these-days/","cat":"books","id":"comment-7875","author":"Richard Barrett","site":"shroudstory"}]
