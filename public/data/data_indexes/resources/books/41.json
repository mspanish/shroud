Rather, it is evidence that God does not exist because it is evidence that the universe is not intelligible. The evidence that the universe is intelligible is the success of the scientific method and the fact that things don’t pop into or out of existence without a reason. This evidence is contradicted by the Big Bang, etc.\nThe evidence for God’s existence is that we have free will. Free will means we possess a center of action that makes us unified with respect to ourselves and different from other beings. Hence, we are finite beings. An infinite being exists because a finite being needs a cause. If all beings in the universe needed a cause, the universe would not be intelligible. In the West, we call the infinite being God.\nThis raises the question of what motivated God to create finite beings. The only thing that could motivate God to do anything is self-love. Finite beings exist because God loved Himself as giving. But God could just as well love Himself without giving. Why God created finite beings is a mystery. God’s existence raises the question of whether or not God has communicated Himself to mankind. That is another matter.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2013 at 11:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/18/stepping-out-beyond-science/","cat":"books","id":"comment-24696","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"}]
