The DHM implements digitally this\npowerful hologram …\n— —\nIn any case I believe that Giulio Fanti is able to work in the\nfield of Applied Mechanics in order to show something of interest about the linen fibrils.\n— —\nSee also, for example, the study :\nComparative Research of the Dynamic Young’s Module of Fibres\nby\nWięcek T, Konecki W.\npublished in :\nFIBRES & TEXTILES in Eastern Europe 2012; 20, 5(94): 36-40.\nAbstract:\n>This work presents an investigation of the dynamic Young’s modulus for fibres of varied thickness performed on an Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer (IMS) and Dynamic Mechanical Analyser (DMA). The IMS was designed and built by the authors and the DMA instrument was produced by TA Instrument Co (USA). Because different methods are applied for determination of the dynamic Young’s modulus it was necessary to perform a comparison analysis of the results received from the IMS and DMA, which are currently the most frequently used testers. This analysis shows that an IMS can be used when a DMA cannot be applied. The parameter set comprising the dynamic Young’s modulus for longitudinal vibrations can find application in material engineering in industry. The DMA method does not require the application of mathematical formulas to determine Young’s modulus but requires calibration as apposed to IMS. Measurements of the elasticity modulus were carried out under automatically stabilised climatic conditions. The compliance of the results obtained allows us to evaluate positively the performance of the Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer. Comparison of the results makes it possible to determine the measuring possibilities of the DMA and IMS and show the advantages of IMS over DMA.\n — —\nWhat is your opinion ?\nProbably we can work (with a particular device)\nusing a single linen fibril …\n— —\nDo you know Structural Mechanics ?\nThere is the three-point bending test with an AFM apparel that is an interesting way to use.\nIn my opinion this is the way to know the answer\nfrom the linen fibrils.\n— —\nI hope in your reply …\n\n","date":"March 26, 2013 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/26/new-italian-book-the-mystery-of-the-shroud-by-giulio-fanti-and-saverio-gaeta/","cat":"books","id":"comment-28405","author":"PIERO","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Italian Book: The Mystery of the Shroud by Giulio Fanti and Saverio Gaeta","post":"Well, I’m always fascinated to hear you describe the latest in gee-whizz technology, Piero. In fact I was wondering only the other day whether your frequently mentioned AFM might be of use in revisiting the question as to what came first – blood or image.\nYes, there is a role for engineers, especially instrumentation engineers in Shroud research. But let’s not lose sight of the fundamental distinction between scientist and engineer. The first is concerned with ideas, hypotheses, theories etc, so has to be scrupulously careful about bias. The second is concerned primarily with practical applications of science, so on the face of it should not need to be so concerned on that score. But instrumentalists who discover a use for their ‘black boxes’ in solving particular scientific problems can get drawn in, and then slip by degrees into the role of scientist, which is OK, provided they know the pitfalls of bias and maintain self-discipline.\n But how much of the latter (self-discipline) can one expect from someone like our mechanical-engineer-turned author who thinks it’s OK to tack theological sections on the end of his conference papers, and who thinks he sees wound sites on the linen (wounds, not blood) where there are none, and highlights them in yellow, just in case folk fail to spot them? Or who claims to be able to see a time sequence in the different types of scourge mark despite the latter being imaged as blood – not as discernible lesions on the body image (skin indentations, cuts, tears, lacerations etc)\nAnd let me ask you this. Suppose the radiocarbon dating had returned a date for the linen of 20BC to 86AD. Suppose I had come along and said that the result was not to be trusted, because atom bomb testing had made the C-14 transmute rather than decay to C-12 at a faster than expected rate and that the statistics were wrong anyway, making the real age more likely to be 1260 to 1390. What do you think would be the response of the Fantis of this world? Would they have given me a fair hearing, and if so, how long would that have lasted – measured to the nearest femtosecond? \nSome might think that the “wrong”  radiocarbon dating should at least have been an occasion for a little thought and humility, for maybe less speculation about corona discharges etc. and more about imaging via conventional physics (conduction, convection and electromagnetic radiation). \nAnyway, do let us know if you think AFM or some other untried technology could help. I’ve just written to the UK’s Royal Society, requesting independent assessment of present claims and perhaps new state-of-the art technology too for resolving existing controversies, but could always send them a late postscript (always a good excuse for tracking progress).\n\n","date":"March 26, 2013 at 10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/26/new-italian-book-the-mystery-of-the-shroud-by-giulio-fanti-and-saverio-gaeta/","cat":"books","id":"comment-28409","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Italian Book: The Mystery of the Shroud by Giulio Fanti and Saverio Gaeta","post":"In one of my comment of yesterday, I said to Colin that I agree with him on the fact that the Shroud is often used for very bad motives and this book of Fanti “the engineer” fits very well into that category…  It is just one new example among a multitude of bad examples.

There are so many totems where the Shroud is concerned that need demystifying, one hardly knows where to begin. Like that alleged superficiality of the Shroud image that cannot be achieved with conventional physics or chemistry. How superficial? Er, well. less than 200nm. Are you sure about that?  OK, maybe as much as 600nm. How do you know? Er, it’s because you can’t see the image layer properly under a light microscope when you pull the fibre away from the sticky tape adhesive. So how do you arrive at that figure of 200, sorry 600? Well, that’s the maximum wavelength of visible light, so if you can’t see it properly it must be less than 600. So you haven’t measured it directly?  No, am I supposed to? Well, it would help, don’t you think, seeing as how you set so much store by it, and contemptuosly dismiss any model image that fails to meet your 200, sorry, 600nm criterion Oh, by the way, where do you think the image might be, if it’s a mere 200-600nm thick?  No problem there, guv, it’s on an impurity layer, Mr.Rogers said so, and one is not allowed to disagree with Mr.Rogers. So what’s this impurity layer? Oh, lots of things, like starch and saponins. Pliny said so. Did Mr.Rogers find any starch or saponins on the Shroud.? Well, no actually, but I think someone else did. How do you know it is an impurity layer? Might it not simply be the PCW?

The research includes three new tests, two chemical ones and one mechanical one. The first two were carried out with an FT-IR system, so using infra-red light, and the other using Raman spectroscopy. The third was a multi-parametric mechanical test based on five different mechanical parameters linked to the voltage of the wire. The machine used to examine the Shroud’s fibres and test traction, allowed researchers to examine tiny fibres alongside about twenty samples of cloth dated between 3000 BC and 2000 AD.\nThe new tests carried out in the University of Padua labs were carried out by a number of university professors from various Italian universities and agree that the Shroud dates back to the period when Jesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem. Final results show that the Shroud fibres examined produced the following dates, all of which are 95% certain and centuries away from the medieval dating obtained with Carbon-14 testing in 1988: the dates given to the Shroud after FT-IR testing, is 300 BC ±400, 200 BC ±500 after Raman testing and 400 AD ±400 after multi-parametric mechanical testing. The average of all three dates is 33 BC  ±250 years. The book’s authors observed that the uncertainty of this date is less than the single uncertainties and the date is compatible with the historic date of Jesus’ death on the cross, which historians claim occurred in 30 AD.\nThe tests were carried out using tiny fibres of material extracted from the Shroud by micro-analyst Giovanni Riggi di Numana who passed away in 2008 but had participated in the1988 research project and gave the material to Fanti through the cultural institute Fondazione 3M.\nSource : http://frbkirk.wordpress.com/\n\n","date":"March 27, 2013 at 10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/26/new-italian-book-the-mystery-of-the-shroud-by-giulio-fanti-and-saverio-gaeta/","cat":"books","id":"comment-28484","author":"Piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Italian Book: The Mystery of the Shroud by Giulio Fanti and Saverio Gaeta","post":"Thank you Piero for exemplifying the ideals set forth by colinsberry.
