[{"title":"The Inquisitor’s Key: Another Shroud of Turin Novel","post":"There is a podcast interview with the authors available for free download or listen at http://www.frankmurphy.com; Scroll down to the heading “Cruci fiction”.  The interview is about 30 minutes long.  I myself am about halfway through the book.  I’ve read all of the previous\nJefferson-Bass novels-This latest book is a bit of a departure from the typical\nJB adventure.  More pages to go, but suffice to say that I’m already\ndisappointed at the casual dismissal of the image properties of the Shroud & the\nbelief that Emily Craig’s “copy” pretty much explains how it was done.\nSurprised?  Not really.  De Wesselow’s book, now this one; are we due for\na(nother) cloning Jesus from the Shroud book next?\n\n","date":"May 10, 2012 at 10:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/10/the-inquisitors-key-another-shroud-of-turin-novel/","cat":"books","id":"comment-11268","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"}]
