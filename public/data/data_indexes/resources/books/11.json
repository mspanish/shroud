[{"title":"Oh, oh, the Wells Fargo Wagon is a coming . . .","post":"Dan\nThanks for the mention but thanks too for all the work and effort you put into this blog.\nIt’s a real service.\nI received word this afternoon that Amazon Kindle had accepted and published an update I has sent to them so that the latest revision is on Kindle and directly available from Amazon. \nYou included all the blurbs, but today I updated the book description page on CreateSpace with the following (which precedes the blurbs): \n“If the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, it is the most important object on the face of the earth with the possible exception of nuclear weapons. This book explains why.\nQuantum Christ is about the confluence of religion and science in the study of the Shroud which assumes cosmic importance as humanity faces extinction in an Apocalypse of Selfishness. Selfishness which was one of the driving forces of evolution is now, through the selfish abuse of the environment, driving humanity to an inevitable extinction. Christ is the crucified martyr of unselfish love. Only prodigious, unselfish conduct by humanity can save it from extinction.”\n\n","date":"January 18, 2015 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/oh-oh-the-wells-fargo-wagon-is-a-coming/","cat":"books","id":"comment-184340","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Oh, oh, the Wells Fargo Wagon is a coming . . .","post":"Nice work John.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2015 at 12:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/oh-oh-the-wells-fargo-wagon-is-a-coming/","cat":"books","id":"comment-184423","author":"Robert W.
