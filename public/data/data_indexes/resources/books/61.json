[{"title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned","post":"You need the flagellation of Christ scenes and the Crucifixion scenes – you can see there how the globules of  blood on the hair of Christ and the blood running down the arms as well as flagellation marks and sores covering the whole body echo those of the Shroud. The Bible dates from c. 1330 .If those imagesare not here they come up easily on a Google images search. The important thing is to contrast these with illustrations of c 100 years earlier and you can see the dramatic changes in the iconography, e.g. The Pray Codex, much discussed here!!, had no signs of the scourging or the flowing blood on the arms. The Shroud and the Holkham Bible as well as other fourteenth century images such as the Roettgen Pieta do.

Both depictions above show marks on the front of the body and on the arms.  The Shroud image shows very few if any at all flagellation marks on the front of the body, and there are none on the arms.  There are a few marks on the front of the legs as the whip flicked around to the front (the pellets were at some distance from the tip of the thongs).  Practically all of the flagellation marks are over the back as shown on the dorsal image.  Even the Carolingian Psalter illustration (800-814 AD), previously noted by Max, shows a more accurate depiction, even though the wrists are crossed over the groin as shown on the Shroud.  The prisoner was normally flogged bound to the post with his arms tied above his head, hence no marks on the arms.  If the depictions were at all influential or related to the “painting(?)” of flagellation marks on the Shroud, then clearly the “artist” forgot to paint the marks on the ventral image and on the arms.  The plain fact is that the Shroud imagery of flagellation corresponds more closely to the factual reality of flagellation than any artist’s gruesome imagination.   \nAgain, the crown of thorns depicted on the 1465 Man of Sorrows illustration shows a circlet instead of a helmet as indicated by the blood flows on the dorsal image of the hair (see my previous comment on Freeman Beat thread).\n\n","date":"November 3, 2014 at 3:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","id":"comment-168337","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned","post":"David Mo has already made clear that the Shroud does not show a representation of a ‘real’ flagellation as there is no sign of the skin being broken at all.

The crucial point , Marrow suggests, is whether you have scourge marks that cover the whole body back and front and the Shroud does in accordance with the inspiration of Isaiah 1.6. Obviously different  flagellations will vary  but this is certainly not a ‘real ‘ one and read my article to understand the OT textural background to the way the Shroud marks are displayed.

All those which caused ecchymosis (a severe bruise) have left no mark on the shroud. ”  This is also consistent with the view of Dr David Willis.  \nThe Faccini-Fanti paper is their particular interpretation, and neither are they forensic pathologists.  In particular the Type I weapon they illustrate cannot be the weapon used to produce the Type I flagellation marks.  It shows four thongs with three pellets each thong located near the tips.  Barbet states that the majority wounds occur as dumbbells in pairs, implying two pellets for each of two thongs.  Most of the flagellation marks on the front of the body are produced by the tips of the thongs whipping around to the front, implying that the pellets were at some distance from the tips.  \nThe Faccini-Fanti Type II wounds they say are not clearly visible to the naked eye and have been elucidated by image enhancement, a method unavailable to any medieval copyists.  They seem to envisage that the Type II wounds were produced by a type of lictor fasces.  Very likely they were inflicted during the journey to the crucifixion site.  \nA close-up inspection of the Mario Latendresse Shroudscope images, either Enrie negative or Durante positive, shows that the vast majority of the flagellation marks are on the dorsal image, with only a few visible on the ventral image.  Faccini-Fanti show several marks on the ventral thorax, but that is their interpretation, and they are much less obvious on the Shroudscope images.\n\n","date":"November 3, 2014 at 5:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","id":"comment-168378","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned","post":"David cited “15 years of experience in a NGO human rights organization” and having seen victims of flagellation victims as his rationale. \nI don’t think that “proves” the point, but that’s just me.

All the paint just happened to flake off? I might add that none of these images show any anatomical realism–they just show the body scourged more than usual. How these images from the Holkham bible are used as a reference point seems a little obtuse.\n\n","date":"November 3, 2014 at 7:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","id":"comment-168412","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned","post":"Hugh, you STILL do not seem to have neither the foggiest notion of what iconosteganalysis and iconocryptanalysis is all about nor how they can be very accurate for identification’s sake.\nThey both can lead to A SERIES OF SMOKING GUN PIECES OF EVIDENCE…\nA- ‘Iconosteganographically’ speaking, the Pray Codex Ms folio 28 UPPER section does show:\n1/- ‘the red smudge’ on the HP MS threnos epitaphios-like Christ’s forehead is the accurate depiction of the lower portion of the tailed-epsilon-shaped shaped blood trickle on the TS man’s forehead with its clotted extension on the eyebrow ridge (this is eye catching as a clincher for the ‘iconosteganalyst’)\n2/- though apparently very dissimilar, the HP Ms folio 28 Christ’s face and Turin Shroud face does have strikingly similar ACCIDENTAL characteristics.\n3/- The HP M Christ’s head tilted at a gentle angle is anatomically consistent with the TS man’s slightly tilted head.\n4/- Though more realistic, the life model’s face pencil drawing by the Hungarian American professional artist, Isabel Piczek, is far less congruent than the cartoon-like Christ’s face Hungarian Pray Ms folio 28r ink drawing by the Hungarian Benedictine monk illustrator\nB -‘Iconosteganographically’ speaking, the Pray Codex Ms folio 28 LOWER section does show:\n1/- symbolic depiction of the scourging via three diagonal red Xs that is to be seen in conjunction with the TS man’s scapula regions.\n(In the 1268 CE T’oros Roslin/Armenian miniature of the Resurrected Christ, the flagellation mark-covered body on the Sindon, now kept in Turin, is cryptosymbolically depicted as Christ’s palmette-covered white himation or sindon)\n2/- simplified yet recognizable depiction through one accidental characteristic of the blood flow on the TS man’s right arm in conjunction with a steganosymbolic depiction of the TS man’s side wound (The double wriggly lines are a simplified version of the TS man’s right arm blood flow indeed).\n3/- the TS  as Christ’s burial cloth lying almost totally flat on the sarcophagus lid as it does show the same stepped-pyramid simplified pattern when seen in close-up\n4/- the TS as a camouflaged burial cloth, does show the same two (L- & P-like shaped) series of water marks and burn holes\n5/- the ‘embedded yet perfectly recognizable symbolic depiction’ of the TS frontal image right foot two lateral symmetrical bloodstain patterns.\nWhether on their own or in conjunction, those striking accidental characteristics do lead to\nconclusive evidence of the HP Ms-TS connection. The 28 folio upper and lower sections are\nderived from the TS image indeed.\nToo bad one of my crucial illustrations to prove my point is totally messed up via conversion\nfrom a DOCX to a PDF. Still methinks people can get a fairly good idea of what\niconocryptanalysis is all about.\n\n","date":"November 4, 2014 at 9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","id":"comment-168603","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"}]
