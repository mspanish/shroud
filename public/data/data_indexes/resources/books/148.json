[{"title":"The book, The True Icon, is now shipping.","post":"I got my copy today.  The book does not delve into the scientific aspects of the Shroud, but it is very lavishly illustrated and the black & white closeup of the negative (lifelike)of the face on page 13 is absolutely STUNNING.  Every sindonologist should get this book, which is very reasonably priced for a book with so many great color pictures.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2012 at 6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/17/the-book-the-true-icon-is-now-shipping/","cat":"books","id":"comment-8413","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The book, The True Icon, is now shipping.","post":"Got my copy this past week.
