Shameless Self-Promotion Alert!)”The Chimera”  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1483630196/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1380279381&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX110_SY165 I guess by O’Reilly’s standards God told me to reply to your blog.\nUnlike aforementioned novel (in which the Shroud plays a crucial role) O’Reilly claims his book is factual. (Hell, it’s not even scriptural!)\nThe gospels agree (a rarity to be sure) that the women went to the tomb PRECISELY to anoint the body, carrying with them the spices and myrrh. And if, according to some non-existent Jewish tradition of visiting the tomb “on the third day” which God must have vouched safe to O’Reilly alone, other problems arise. The gospel account of Lazarus in John’s gospel clearly states he had been in the tomb “four days” and the women protest Jesus’ request to role away the stone. But more germane, it is that very phrase “on the third day” that has caused fundamentalists and scripture scholars alike such àgita, nigh these 2,000 years.\nCalendar days from Friday to Sunday might allow the names of three days, but by Jewish counting from sunset, Jesus had been in the tomb barely a day and a half. Thirty six hours max.\nThe women went to the tomb WITH SPICES because the onset of the Sabbath on Friday evening precluded them from preparing the body of Jesus for burial properly.  At sunrise Sunday they went, and the rest is history, although not apparently the one O’Reilly researched.\n\n","date":"September 27, 2013 at 7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/27/the-gospel-according-to-bill-oreilly/","cat":"books","id":"comment-45608","author":"Joe Veneoso","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Gospel According to Bill O’Reilly","post":"This can only be seen as an attempt to fatten the wallet because, unfortunately, Scripture linked with rubbish does sell.\n\n","date":"September 27, 2013 at 10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/27/the-gospel-according-to-bill-oreilly/","cat":"books","id":"comment-45622","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Gospel According to Bill O’Reilly","post":"Joe Veneoso: “The women went to the tomb WITH SPICES because the onset of the Sabbath on Friday evening precluded them from preparing the body of Jesus for burial properly.”\nIt has been seriously argued on this site that this common assumption is in error.  See John 19:40, “They took the body of Jesus and wrapped with the spices in linen cloths, FOLLOWING THE JEWISH BURIAL CUSTOM.” \nIrrespective of the onset of the special sabbath, it seems that the completion of certain burial rites may have been a permitted work. Archaeocryptologist Max Patrick Hamon has argued that with the assistance of oil lamps for lighting, John 19:40 can be taken at face value, the work was completed, that the purpose of the Sunday morning visit was in fact in connection with a common practice, that the purpose of the women bringing spices was to mask the smell of the onset of corruption. \nI have no quarrel with the arguments against O’Reilly’s apparent claims to divinely inspired self-promotion.\n\n","date":"September 27, 2013 at 4:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/27/the-gospel-according-to-bill-oreilly/","cat":"books","id":"comment-45650","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Gospel According to Bill O’Reilly","post":"Why would the body not have been prepared following the jewish burial custom ?

Others present arguments as to why the Shroud was merely draped loosely over the body, and the purpose of the women’s visit was to complete the burial. Both sides have their arguments; I prefer to say I’m neutral and to admit that I don’t know.\n\n","date":"September 28, 2013 at 3:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/27/the-gospel-according-to-bill-oreilly/","cat":"books","id":"comment-45750","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Gospel According to Bill O’Reilly","post":"Thank you, i didn’t know wether there was a consensus among exegetes.\n\n","date":"September 29, 2013 at 3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/27/the-gospel-according-to-bill-oreilly/","cat":"books","id":"comment-45841","author":"anoxie","site":"shroudstory"}]
