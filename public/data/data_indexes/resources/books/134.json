[{"title":"New Novel: The Blood of the Shroud","post":"Might there be a niche market for a “Turin Shroud Book of Jokes”?\nSample:  \nShroudie goes to see his doctor.\nD.  So what’s the problem?\nS. Everywhere I go I keep seeing images of the Man on the Turin Shroud.. I look at clouds in the sky, I see him. I look at tea leaves, I see him. I look at ink blots I see him. I look at bedroom wallpaper I see him. Everywhere I look I see the Man on the Turin Shroud.\nD. So what makes you think I can help?\nS. Holy Jesus. Don’t turn your back on me now. For a start it makes you upside down.\n\n","date":"July 11, 2014 at 5:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/11/new-novel-the-blood-of-the-shroud/","cat":"books","id":"comment-137026","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Novel: The Blood of the Shroud","post":"Hold on to your day job.\n\n","date":"July 11, 2014 at 5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/11/new-novel-the-blood-of-the-shroud/","cat":"books","id":"comment-137029","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Novel: The Blood of the Shroud","post":"Surprising, perhaps, a new novel about the Shroud turns up about once a month. Mostly they involve the theft of the Shroud and the cloning of its DNA. And a lot of people get horribly killed. They range from children’s detective stories right up to X-rated slashers. I wonder if any other artifacts generate a similar novel-rate.\n\n","date":"July 11, 2014 at 8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/11/new-novel-the-blood-of-the-shroud/","cat":"books","id":"comment-137064","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
