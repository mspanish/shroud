[{"title":"Timothy Cardinal Dolan: Se non e vero e ben trovato","post":"On Nov. 19, 2012, I filed a complaint against Cardinal Dolan for suppressing my slideshow/lecture about the Holy Shroud on the grounds that I was not promoting its authenticity. I sent it to the President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization, Archbishop Salvatore Fisichella by registered mail. \nI haven’t gotten a response from either Cardinal Dolan or the council. The Italian post office was unable to tell me what happened to the letter.\n\n","date":"July 18, 2013 at 6:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/18/timothy-cardinal-dolan-se-non-e-vero-e-ben-trovato/","cat":"books","id":"comment-39186","author":"David Roemer","site":"shroudstory"}]
