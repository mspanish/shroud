So did all the 46 fragments of wool damask from the Mons Claudianus site in Egypt (second century AD). A study of 21 linen textiles from Coptic Egypt from the Katoen Natie collection in Antwerp that have been dated to between the fifth and tenth centuries AD showed all had S twist yarns. A possible exception to the eastern S twist lies in the very finest cloths as in a (wool) diamond twill of the third century AD from a tomb in Palmyra (its weft had a staggering 160 threads to the centimetre) which was Z twist.\nIn contrast the pre-Roman Celtic cultures of Europe all used Z twist. John Peter Wild, a leading authority on textiles, writing in 1970, knew of only one piece of linen from the Roman west that was S spun and as it was found with silks, it was probably an import. ( Wild’s Textile Manufacture in the Roman Northern Provinces, p. 44.) The wonderful silk damask from Milan of the fifth century is another cloth with Z twist threads. The ‘Roman’ Z twist continued into medieval Europe. For instance, all the linen textiles recovered in excavations from London that are dated between 1150 -1450 have a Z twist in their yarns. In general, therefore, a linen textile that uses a Z twist in its yarn is likely to come from Roman or medieval Europe, and a yarn with S twist invariably comes from the east. \nNow would you like to present your evidence to contradict this ‘coherent argument’?\nPlease realise that some of us are professionals working in these fields and we do try and get things right before we go public.\n\n","date":"November 6, 2013 at 6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","id":"comment-50234","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin","post":"O.K.: You are missing the point.

I only intervened on one issue, the Z twist. When I first read it, I simply assumed that the author had got S and Z mixed. I do not know where he got his idea that Z twist indicated that the tunic ‘was probably made in the near or Middle East’ . A glance at a standard text, e.g. the first volume of The Cambridge History of Western Textiles would have shown him that he was wrong. It has long been recognised that Z is rare in the east, and S rare in western Europe.\nI do take the point,however, that there was trade. In fact, trade between the east and Spain has been plotted through the discovery of S twist textiles in Spain. Accounts suggest that the Temple priesthood in Jerusalem imported their linen from India or Egypt, there being little high quality flax in Palestine until the second century. So one can have an imported Z spun cloth in the east- I was simply making the point that ‘PROBABLY MADE IN THE NEAR OR MIDDLE EAST’ is certainly wrong. \nI did not intervene on the blood issue so that is irrelevant here.Obviously the fact that non-human primate species may have AB blood is neither here nor there as the species don’t cross.

I do not consider myself a “blood expert” or a “DNA expert”, either.  I do have a working knowledge and professional experience with the methodology and scientific principles.  I have also taught the subjects at the graduate, medical, undergraduate, and high school levels.  I think the word “expert” is way overused.  It implies a certain infallibility that I, myself, am not comfortable with.  That being said, I think I have something to add relevant to the topic that may be beneficial (or not).  If truly interested in the subject, I would recommend independent validation from multiple sources.\nInteresting that the premise that real blood exists on the Tunic isn’t protested with a similar vigor as that on the Shroud.  Even though AB is the most infrequent blood type in the population and percentage variations exist among certain ethnic groups, having the same blood type is only suggestive evidence, at best.  These results are consistent with the idea that the blood on the two objects could have come from the same individual, but that’s as far as it goes (or that the collagen binder could come from the same animal, if you want to go really far).  Typing tests are most conclusive at ruling out the relationship between two objects (i.e., when both show different blood types), than ruling them in.\nThe most effective test(s) that could be done to determine the relationship between these two objects is DNA analysis (nuclear and/or mitochondrial).  This is the most conclusive set of experiments that would help include or exclude that the blood on the two objects is from the same individual.  \nFinally, it is often mentioned that the DNA on the Shroud is degraded; true, but it is also relevant that portions of 3 genes were cloned and sequenced: a subunit of hemoglobin, and genes located on X & Y chromosomes.  It’s been concluded from these studies that the blood is that of a human male.  However, it’s not as though portions of these 3 genes might exist and everything else is wasted.  It could be, but there is no reason to think that portions/segments of certain other genes or noncoding sequences might similarly exist.  \nThese 3 particular genes were able to be analyzed because they were targeted with specific probes that allowed them to be selectively amplified and examined.  This is similar to using a large magnet to pull certain needles out of a haystack. Or, if possible, to apply a word search engine to a pile of shredded documents and asking it to find certain key phrases; many other things may be in there, they are just not the object of that particular analysis.\nEven with a small percentage of the entire genome remaining intact, who knows?  \nIf additional, more sophisticated DNA testing could reveal useful information is an if.

It does not show it is from the same person.  I am unsure about the results from Lanciano based on the results I’ve seen.  Some, including Zugibe have raised doubts regarding the AB blood type because of contamination by bacteria, fungi, etc.  Such antigens are shared by those organisms-I have addressed this in my previous articles.  When discussing the blood type on the Shroud, I am always careful to say it is type AB as determined by forward typing methods.  In a blood bank, a transfusion is only performed if the blood type can be cross-checked by an alternative complementary method (typically reverse typing).  In the case of AB, particularly with older blood, this is somewhat of a catch-22-see previous articles).  Molecular (genetic) testing can circumvent such issues, provided sufficient DNA is intact at that region to evaluate.\nI am familar with percentages of frequency of expression, even if the answer was 1:80,000-if 4 items were brought into a courtroom, which were thought to be linked to the same person, and all showed type AB blood, would this prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the same person?  No.  Consistent with, yes.

If there was one, no doubt the skeptics would try to deny the fact that there really is blood on this cloth as hard as in the case of the Shroud because the blood evidence on the Shroud alone is enough to understand that the Shroud image is not due to a man made forgery (see: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf).\nColin Berry (for one) knows this and that’s probably why he try so hard to deny the fact that the bloodstains on the Shroud are made out of real blood material coming from exudates of blood clots.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","id":"comment-50349","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nO.K. :\nKelly I know, I discuss this widely in my article.The problem is of course interpretation.

I am pretty comfortable accepting the typing results on the Shroud studies because of the inclusion of specific and nonspecific controls, and the use of both polyclonal & monoclonal antibodies, in different studies.  In the Miracle of Lanciano results I have seen, there is only the presentation of reactivity with anti-A and anti-B antiserum, no control data is presented.  Which specific controls to include are not always intuitively obvious to those who don’t work with antibodies on a regular basis.  I remember as a young graduate student getting very excited about isolating several proteins based on their reactivity with specific antibodies.  The label on the tube said the antibody was specific for them, so I had no reason to question it.  When I went back and ran several irrelevant, unrelated antibodies, I saw exactly the same pattern.  So much for specificity in those particular experiments. I have reviewed numerous papers over the years where the controls on specificity were assumed, but not proven.  In immunology, it’s a must.  \nFrom the other side, Zugibe might have argued that the presence of AB antigens on all of these relics was really due to contamination by other organisms.  (He mentioned this in his book).  These carbohydrates are not unique to red blood cells but are expressed in other microorganisms.  I don’t think this is the case for the Shroud because adjacent white fibers are non-reactive with anti-A and anti-B.  Shroud fibers have also been examined with anti-O reagents and shown to be negative.  (The O antigens are the branch from which the A and B are assembled-if simple contamination, I would think there might be reactivity here as well).  I don’t know if the typing on the other relics is as thorough.  I would like to see the actual data.  If it were totally air tight, I would still be at the same place: certainly consistent with, but I don’t think you can definitely conclude anything unless the blood types are different.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","id":"comment-50356","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nO.K. :\n\nKelly Kearse :\nThanks-are they are specific details as to which markers and if multiple forms (>2 for each gene) were present?\n\nI will send you the scans from Le linceul de Turin et la tunique d’Argenteuil, but unfortuantely not until tomorrow.\n\nGreat-I appreciate this very much\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","id":"comment-50357","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nO.K. :\nNo, something much more intereesting… ;-)\nAsk Joe, let he quote that!\n\nOK!\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","id":"comment-50358","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin","post":"O.K. had mentioned a passage on pg. 191 concerning the blood.

I may have to get a copy to understand their ideas fully.\nAnd has anyone read “Une si Humble et si Sainte Tunique” by the man who commissioned some of the investigation? Does it contain anything the Lucotte book doesn’t? (I’m too mean to buy both books if one will do!)\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 8:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","id":"comment-50426","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nO.K. :\n\nKelly Kearse :\n\nO.K. :\n\nKelly Kearse :\nThanks-are they are specific details as to which markers and if multiple forms (>2 for each gene) were present?\n\nI will send you the scans from Le linceul de Turin et la tunique d’Argenteuil, but unfortuantely not until tomorrow.\n\nGreat-I appreciate this very much\n\nKelly I have those scans for you:\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/6954/01p2.jpg\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/51/5ifw.jpg/\n\nO.K. Thanks very much for providing the scans.  The DNA analysis is looking at expression of STR (short tandem repeat) sequences, most of which are found in noncoding regions of chromosomes that show high variation among the population.  The FBI in the US utilizes a panel of 13 of these markers (plus the amelogenin genes for X & Y chromosomes) as part of their standard DNA analysis.  It would be interesting to see sampling from several sites (on the Tunic) and compare the profile-this would speak to the heterogeneity that may or may not be present.  (I’ve gone on before about the limitations of proving the DNA truly originates from blood cells from analyzing non-blood cell specific gene sequences, I’ll refrain).  This data shows there is human DNA on the Tunic.  For the Shroud, the claim is often made there is blood from a human male that is present.  Yet, at the same time, it is said the DNA is so degraded that it really can’t tell us much.  I don’t think you can have it both ways.  If the DNA is so degraded, where are such signals coming from, contaminating DNA, if that’s true, then…\nIf some sequences are obtainable, perhaps others are as well.\nThanks again very much providing the scans, including the RBC micrographs.  Looks like this book has a good summary of the work that’s been done, think I might pick up a copy.\n\n","date":"November 8, 2013 at 1:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","id":"comment-50451","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"}]
