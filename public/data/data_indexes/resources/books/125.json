Since then having met many shroudies, American and European, attended many conferences and having seen the Shroud at all exhibitions since 1978.  It has been a life changing experience thanks to John Walsh.  He epitomized the melding of scholarship and faith, stressing the need for scientific exactitude and historical accuracy.  His creativity was wide-ranging and enlightening; a master of his craft.  Thank you John.\nRichard Orareo\n\n","date":"March 30, 2015 at 2:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/30/rip-john-evangelist-walsh/","cat":"books","id":"comment-194878","author":"Richard Orareo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"RIP John Evangelist Walsh","post":"What clarity of thought in the quote you chose, Dan.
