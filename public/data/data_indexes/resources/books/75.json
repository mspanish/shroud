[{"title":"The Shroud of Turin Carbon Dating in a School Textbook","post":"I agree with you Dan, the right reasons should be taught and it is an important point. Also it should be taught that C-14 is NOT infallible, which it is not by far and there are many examples to back that statement up. Furthermore, it should be expressed strongly, that no single c14 dating sample should be looked at as 100% proof of anything. It must be understood; ALL information must be taken into account as a whole and that more then one sample is required from ‘different areas’ for c14 tests to be reasonably conclusive, which definitely was not the case with the Shroud.\nRon\n\n","date":"September 1, 2011 at 11:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/01/the-shroud-of-turin-carbon-dating-in-a-school-textbook/","cat":"books","id":"comment-3757","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
