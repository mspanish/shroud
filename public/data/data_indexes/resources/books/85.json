[{"title":"New Shroud of Turin Novel, The Chimera by Fr. J. R. Veneroso","post":"There are dozens of movie scripts floating around Hollywood that have the ‘cloning Jesus from the Shroud’ set-up. The one that got closest to being greenlit a few years ago was a comedy. A friend of mine wrote a kids book using a teen-aged Jesus clone angle, Emmanuel McClue and the Mystery of the Shroud. The idea that we could ‘manufacture’ the Second Coming is tantalizing.\n\n","date":"June 18, 2013 at 9:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/17/new-shroud-of-turin-novel-the-chimera-by-fr-j-r-veneroso/","cat":"books","id":"comment-37307","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Shroud of Turin Novel, The Chimera by Fr.

J. R. Veneroso","post":"Hi. All of my characters are fictitious products of my overactive imagination. Some are composites; others archetypes or caricatures. Dr. Linda Gramm, mother of protagonist Jeannette Gramm, represents the second largest “denomination” in the United States: “ex (as in exiled) Catholics.”\nShe and her daughter represent the “chimera combination” of scientific yet spiritual. Her marital status is all too typical of many who no longer feel at home in the church.\nAll the scientists in my novel are likewise fictitious.\nBeyond that, no, I don’t know where you were going! Care to elaborate?\nJoe Veneroso\n\n","date":"June 19, 2013 at 8:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/17/new-shroud-of-turin-novel-the-chimera-by-fr-j-r-veneroso/","cat":"books","id":"comment-37373","author":"Joe Veneodo","site":"shroudstory"}]
