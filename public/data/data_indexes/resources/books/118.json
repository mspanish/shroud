This is considered “proved beyond a reasonable doubt” in American jurisprudence.  If there is reason to doubt the testimony, responsible jurors will refuse to convict on the grounds that the case wasn’t proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  In the New Testament we have the testimony of eyewitnesses to the resurrection of Jesus.  These are individuals who dedicated their lives thereafter to telling this story and suffered brutal martyrdoms without recanting.  In the eyes of the law, that is proof of the resurrection.  It’s proof in my eyes, too.  And if there are any lawyers reading this comment who wish to challenge the assertion on the basis of being hearsay evidence (testimony that is not subject to cross-examination), I would remind them that “dying declaration” is an exception to the hearsay rule.  \nAs for believers for whom no proof is necessary, this is foolish.  Beliefs that cannot withstand scrutiny in the context of the world in which we live, such as belief in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, are rightly called childish.  There is nothing about Christianity, or the Shroud of Turin for that matter, that falls in the category of belief without proof.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2015 at 11:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/31/proof-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","id":"comment-214004","author":"Jim Carney","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Proof of the Resurrection?","post":"For myself the Shroud does not establish much of anything we don’t already know. Assuming it is authentic of course It proves Jesus existed, but we already know that. It proves he was crucified, but we already know that. It proves he was buried, but we really already know that was likely anyway. It nearly proves the empty tomb, but again we already know the empty tomb is likely. So I think what the Shroud does best is further the case for the reliability of the Gospels, and bring up some interesting thoughts about the Resurrection like why do the blood stains look how they do why is there no clear evidence of manual extraction? Then of course the image and what caused that. Is it a byproduct of the Resurrection? BTW, that image in this post could easily be replaced with “something natural happens”.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2015 at 2:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/31/proof-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","id":"comment-214013","author":"Matthew L.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Proof of the Resurrection?","post":"Mark means “proof beyond any reasonable doubt” in the legal sense, not 100% scientific proof (not sure that even exists) or like proving a math theorem. Mark’s a lawyer.\n     As far as the historicity of His Bodily Resurrection is concerned; that kind of proof has been long established, without the Cloth.  Mark is using the Shroud as exhibit A in this sort of line of evidence concerning this event.  History matches the observations.\nOccam’s razor.  Just like any jury member, you decide the best answer to ALL of the evidence.  Unbiased.\nJackson himself would agree that the probability Jesus’ Resurrection being in some way responsible for the data is a very high probability.\n\n","date":"November 1, 2015 at 10:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/31/proof-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","id":"comment-214071","author":"chuck hampton","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Proof of the Resurrection?","post":"We need to keep in mind the distinction between knowledge and faith-based belief.  A mathematical proof cannot be denied, but might only be refined.  A scientific proof may be questioned, but once all the data are in, most would be obliged to accept it, otherwise it can’t be called a proof.  A jury verdict may be questioned, and incorrect decisions have been recorded.  One analogy between faith and knowledge involving true parentage is sometimes cited.  Mrs Brown knows she is the mother of her children;  but Mr Brown on the basis of faith-based reason probably does not require a DNA test to satisfy himself the children are his, unless genuine questions of paternity arise.  John Klotz has often mentioned a legal basis of proof, that we do not seek to order our lives beyond a reasonable doubt.  \nMost of the matters mentioned by Matthew L are I think more matters of a rationally-based faith rather than matters of knowledge as he claims them to be.   Others they could not be doubted by humanist skeptics, who for the most part might be considered to be otherwise quite reasonable people.  \nThe Shroud therefore may have the potential to be a useful means of providing a historical basis to these faith-based assertions.\n\n","date":"November 2, 2015 at 2:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/31/proof-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","id":"comment-214078","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
