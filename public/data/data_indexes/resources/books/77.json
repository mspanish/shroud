[{"title":"The single dumbest idea in the history of…dumb stuff","post":"Dumb is, what dumb thinks, lol…Mr.Johnson is right, I guess de Wesselow didn’t think about Saul of Tarsus and his hate for Christians. It would have been more likely, if the Shroud was all he saw that he would have had the people who had shown him the Shroud arrested and stoned to death for breaking a serious Hebrew Law; (being in possession of a three times unclean burial cloth). Unless one believes the Shroud ‘appeared’ to Saul floating in the air and speaking to him…NOT.\nI think it’s pretty obvious to anyone with even a slight knowledge of scripture and of the Shroud, that de Wesselow has not done much research ‘himself’ and just made this all up from a very uninformed imagination…From all the media he’s getting though, I’m sure his goal of making a quick buck will be fullfilled.\nR\n\n","date":"April 10, 2012 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/10/the-single-dumbest-idea-in-the-history-ofdumb-stuff/","cat":"books","id":"comment-10256","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The single dumbest idea in the history of…dumb stuff","post":"Certainly would have to agree that it is stupid beyond stupid.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2012 at 10:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/10/the-single-dumbest-idea-in-the-history-ofdumb-stuff/","cat":"books","id":"comment-10257","author":"Shroud Encounter","site":"shroudstory"}]
