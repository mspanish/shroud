Is it justified? Have “Shroudies” now solved the problem of the mysterium Christi, something that not even the world’s best biblical scholars have been able to do?\nFor instance, Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ, considered to be one of the twentieth century’s greatest New Testament scholars, sees a distinction between the pre- and post-Easter Jesus in the Gospels. On the other hand, Monsignor John P. Meier, the world’s topmost historical Jesus researcher, does not think so:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJ\nJesus was subtle even in his actions sometimes, as Yigael Yadin, the Israeli archaeologist, clearly understood. His views do not necessarily clash with what Fr. Fitzmyer has gleaned from the Dead Sea Scrolls, although Professor Geza Vermes did not take these into account:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/12851672/The_Historical_Jesus_The_view_of_Professor_Geza_Vermes\nSo let us leave Jesus’ self-awareness, and what the disciples understood about him. in the pre-Easter phase, out of the discussion.\nMost of the disciples abandoned Jesus when he was arrested. If anyone could put coins over the eyes it would be Nicodemus, who must have had money in his pocket. There are, however, two problems with this hypothesis:\n1) There is still no clear evidence that any coin can be seen over an eye. Giorgio was supposed to upload a paper with images to support the coins-over-the eyes-theory\n2) Max thinks that coins in tombs justify his position. He does not take into account that the Sadducees were heavily influenced by the Greeks, in fact imitated their lifestyle in some ways. Since “Sheol” was very much in the collective unconscious of all Jewish groups, whether Sadducees, Pharisees or Essenes, nothing rules out the possibilty that coins were used to pay Charon to ferry souls across the river Styx. That was how Israeli archaeologist Zvi Greenhut interpreted his find.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2015 at 10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-202809","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

To me, it seems a well-written piece of research, and I hope you will be able to find a suitable place to publish it in due course. \nWhat I take from the article is that the Jews were able to accept the coins as suitable for temple use, as they were able to interpret the symbols in terms of their own culture.  However I am a little confused concerning the assertion that the Romans made an effort to avoid offending Jewish sensibilities, by not including images of persons or animals on their coins. \nFrom the story in Mark 12:14, which both Matthew and Luke also include, we know that the poll-tax coin must have had an image of Caesar (presumably at this time, Tiberius).  \n“Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar’s.”  Matthew 22:15-22 \nClearly the silver denarii had an image of Caesar.

Their mission was to seize on Yeshua’s likely unguarded answer to their political and theological question (“Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?”)  as a basis of handing him over to the Roman procurator on the charge that he taught the people not to pay tribute to Caesar. This would amount to a charge of seditious rebellion against Rome and would carry the death penalty. \nThe denarius, which had a bust of Tiberius Caesar on it, was a relatively small silver coin issued from the imperial mint in Lyons by the command of Caesar himself. Its “superscription” read: “Tiberius Caesar Augustus, son of the divine Augustus.”The reverse of the coin had an image of the emperor’s mother, Julia Augusta (Livia), sitting on a throne holding a scepter in one hand and an olive branch in the other, and an inscription that read Pontifex Maximus, that is, “High Priest.” The denarius thus proclaimed the power and glory of Rome and the divine origin and character of Tiberius.\nNow all sacred taxes were to be paid in silver Tyrian currency not silver Roman dinarii with and image of Caesar. Besides the latter were not allowed to enter the Temple and were to be changed for Tyrian currency whereas the poll tax denarius was paid in silver Roman currency only to the Roman authorities via the Sadducean authorities. In Judea a Roman procurator took over control and was responsible for securing the taxes while the Sadducean authorities, whose loyalty was proved again and again, were his agents. So not only did they advocate the payment of the tribute, they were loyal agents in seeing that it was collected.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2015 at 8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-202781","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

I personally think it a piece of “top of the head speculation” and is irrelevant to the custom.  I see it as a Greek rationalisation of a fairly universal practice.  On another recent thread on the same topic I wrote:  \n“Placing coins over the eyes of the dead is a very old folk custom, probably dates from the time of Croesus who invented coinage, and before that it was pebbles. The Charonic obol legend is merely a piece of aetiology, a false explanation to rationalise a long-held fairly universal practice, in the local contemporary terms of Greek mythology. It signifies no more than what family members believed was a respectful duty towards the deceased.” \nThey needed only one coin to pay Charon, so why two?

This when he does not appeal to Dan because of his age, which is nothing more than emotional blackmail.\nThe latest demonstration of his unbecoming behaviour is his comment above, where he says “Louis and his archaeologist acquaintances”.

They did not listen to the prophets: “I will have mercy and not sacrifice”. It is for reasons like these that some scholars have now suggested that there should be no “biblical studies”, it should be a part of “Near Eastern studies”.\nEven the Essenes were not immune to pagan influence, having derived their dualism, although subordinate to monotheism, from Iran. 300 BC to AD 200 was a period of intense pluralism, as both Jewish and Christian scholars have noted:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/12734802/Book_Review_Beyond_the_Essene_Hypothesis_The_Parting_of_the_Ways_between_Qumran_and_Enochic_Judaism\nThe Essenes tried to tackle the problem of evil that began dividing Jewish groups in 300 BC and reached what they believed was a solution: “God has has put two spirits, good and bad, in human beings”, but then, as they believed they were the “sons of light” while all other people, including other Jewish groups were the “sons of darkness” they formed an “eschatological army”, again demonstrating the influence of Iranian dualism. In the process they also absorbed details from a Hebrew Herodian army manual, which is turn, was based on a Roman army manual and the Romans were the “kittim” whom the Essenes hated. Little did they know where Herod (Idumean ancestry) got his ideas.\nThe question of the Essenes had Yigael Yadin, respected Israeli archaeologist and scholar, and biblical scholars Fr. J.A.Fitzmyer and Prof. G.Vermes come to different conclusions:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/12851672/The_Historical_Jesus_The_view_of_Professor_Geza_Vermes\nHugh (below) has commented on the coins found in tombs and that is what I also thought.\nThe images used to support the coins-over-the-eyes hypothesis are far from clear.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2015 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-203081","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

Strictly, Charon’s obol is a single coin placed in the mouth, and coins that are sometimes found in the mouths of skulls, have sometimes dropped there from the eye sockets.  The ancient practice extended from Ireland, to Britain and most of Europe, and further east.  There were actually more Roman graves with coins in the skulls (about 50%) than ever occurred in Greece.  Greek playwrights were fond of lampooning the practice, because of its association with paying the ferryman.  (What would happen to the deceased, if they did not pay the ferryman?)  On another web-site, a Magyar grandmother explained the practice of placing coins over the eyes, so that visitors might not see their own death reflected in the person’s eyes.  Clearly there are a variety of cultural reasons for the practice.  The eyes are the windows of the soul, and visitors should not intrude thus far into the deceased’s privacy.  Archaeologists typically call it “Charon’s obol” as a catch-all phrase for the more universal and general practice, without necessarily attributing it to the specifically Greek practice.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2015 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-203049","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

A skull doesn’t really have a mouth, and very few intact brain cases are found with coins rattling around inside, having fortuitously fallen through the rather small slits at the back of the eyesockets, or dropped in through the foramen magnum. A fair assumption is that if you find one coin near a skull, it was placed in the mouth, and if you find two, they were on the eyes.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2015 at 6:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-203055","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

As well as several papers in English Literature, Language, and Applied Mathematics and Statistics, it also included a major in Religious Studies.  This last was no mere narrow focus on Biblical Studies, which I have not neglected, but was extremely broad-ranging. \nAs well as the core subjects of Universal Religions, (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism), it included papers on Primal Religions (African, Pacific, NZ Maori, Australian Aboriginal), Oriental Religions (Chinese & Japanese), Ancient Religions (Egyptian, Babylonian, Iranian, Persian), Phenomenology of Religions, Critical Issues in Modern Religion, and many more. \nI have presented seminar papers on the Bhagavad Gita, on Baal Hadad, the Epic of Gilgamesh, Teilhard de Chardin, Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII, Japanese Shinto and various others.  I have been acquainted with and studied the Hindu Vedas, the Upanishads, the Darius inscription, the Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl, the Zend Avesta, Boethius and Augustine, and oh yes, Biblical Studies.  I have read such authors as Rudolf Otto, Ninian Smart, Eric Sharpe and many more.   \nI continue in later life to be intrigued by the manifold human expressions in religious matters.  The passage of time necessarily narrows one’s focus and I would need to revisit some of the more arcane topics to comment usefully on them.  I have throughout much of my life been personally involved in my own church activities.  \nSome might find my eclectic range of studies a cause for some amusement and derision.  I have found it extremely broadening.  My intentions in setting them forth here is not in a spirit of boastfulness, nor to establish a claim of specialist expertise, but merely as a response to accusations of ignorant inexpert amateurism.  I think I have some competence in being able to make useful comments on many of these topics.  \nIf others find anything of interest in what I might have to say, that is sufficient reward in itself.\n\n","date":"June 22, 2015 at 3:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-203155","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

The sources I used included the recommended texts, departmental publications, most of which I still retain, and other texts found in the Religious Studies section of the University Library and elsewhere.  There are no secret sources.  Such formal papers are the appropriate forum for the citing of sources, and are not normally expected in the casual blog comments of a public web-site.   During the 1980s, the internet had yet to be invented and those sources were not then available.  Preparation of the papers required very many hours of research, marshalling of ideas, writing and re-editing, and in those days, hammering out the text on a portable type-writer, altogether no simple task, all the while maintaining professional work commitments to my employers and family.   \nComparative Religion is an extremely complex discipline, and extends well beyond the subject of Biblical Studies, but I have always found it intellectually rewarding and stimulating, as Religion has been a major human preoccupation from time immemorial.    \nMatthew’s gospel in particular is quite complex, and on which professional scholarly opinions continue to be sharply divided as to its composition and intended recipients.   \nI have no particular wish to flaunt my identity and my use of a pseudonym is an accepted convention on this site.
