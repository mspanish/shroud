While it is perfectly possible to draw all sorts of interesting comparisons between a couple of images – and I treasure your comments regarding “The Shroud of Turin Blimp” more than I can say – it is also possible that none of these was intended or noticed by the people who made the images, and have only been recognised by people whose profession is to do just that.\nNow I’m bothered by how you might be able to persuade us doubters that your parallels between the Pray manuscript and the Shroud are deliberate, as it seems hardly fair just to say ‘I don’t believe you’ without suggesting how you might go about changing our minds. Being supported by other experts in iconocryptanalysis would be a start, as David Goulet has suggested, or demonstrating more unequivocal comparisons. To me, the blood smudge is trivial, but the diagonal line of crosses and the L&P holes, although I do not agree that they are connected with the Shroud, are clearly deliberate, and not easy to explain. A picture of Christ being flogged leaving cruciform welts would be good, and your ‘palmette’ illustrations are a good start, but they don’t convince me. Similarly, some kind of artistic tradition showing a rigid rectangular shroud in a Three Marys painting, or a herringbone design being represented as stepped pyramids rather than stacked zig-zags would also be effective.

The Annual General Meetings of the International Society of Cryptostenographologists must be a riot.\n“So what do you make of the loros as Byzantine imperial insigne symbolic of Christ’s Shroud?” Not nothing at all. It seems that this was a pre-Christian tradition overlaid by Christian symbolism, rather like Saturnalia turning into Christmas. Actual loroi, as you have mentioned, seem to have been richly decorated with jewels and bore no relation to the real thing. The Grandson antependium is indeed somewhat different, in that it is more simple, but there is nothing to suggest that the herringbone needlework is intended to represent the herringbone of the Shroud, particularly as the insense burners are filled in in exactly the same style. I do agree that if the Shroud were ever convincingly shown to be ancient, then the herringbone loroi might constitute a contributory corollary, but I do not think that they can be assumed to be derivative until that occurs.\n“How can you explain this striking departure from the traditional Byzantine depiction of the lavishly adorned ceremonial long and narrow stole.” The relatively late date and the Western artistic tradition are adequate in themselves as explanations without needing any knowledge of the Shroud by the embroiderers.\n“I have produced a comparative iconography of the lower portion of the TS face ‘tailed-epsilon’ shaped blood trickle dripping onto the eyebrow ridge in BOTH the HP Ms Christ’s and the TS man’s forehead. The HP Ms Christ’s is REMARKABLY SHROUD-LIKE while the TS man’s is REMARKABLY HP MANUSCRIPT-LIKE!” I have studied your article carefully. The two alleged blood smears are not remarkably similar at all to me, and I think it is special pleading to suggest that the Pray artist only used the bottom third of the epsilon stain, which he then smudged downwards to represent the pendant tear-drop.\n“I never said ‘the nose on the Shroud (was) sufficiently crooked for anyone to have depicted it on a painting or a coin’.” Well forgive me; I must have misinterpreted this section, as it appeared to me that you only mentioned the skewed nose in connection with “Fanti’s solidus” to which you provided a link, and you now say “This is totally consistent with one (Edessenian-Byzantine?) engraver incorporating Christ’s skewed nose in his engraving of the Pantocrator’s face.” So did they or didn’t they?\n“When it comes to your opinion on the three issues, bad will and bad faith are sheer euphemisms!” That’s just rude, and also untrue. (Unconnected speculation – is it only authenticists who find it difficult to face contradiction without abusing their antagonists? Can anybody quote an example of an abusive non-authenticist?)\n““The coins of Justinian II’s first reign (685 – 695 AD) are indeed remarkably shroud-like, and it is difficult not to think it was indeed the model.” I did write that, and it’s surely true. It doesn’t mean that the Shroud was the model for the coins, but it is certainly interesting. I’ve no doubt that a Byzantine art historian would attribute it – and perhaps by association the Shroud of the 14th centrury – to the influence of a Roman or Greek image of ‘the wise old man’ being brought from Rome to Constantinople, but I wouldn’t know the truth of the matter.\n“In all likelihood and obedience to a specific iconological canon, the TS man’s forehead clot DISlocation in centre hairline of the forehead and stylization as a double stranded quiff of dropping hair, was deemed more suitable both within the general economy of the Justinian II’s Solidus obverse Christ face and… the engraver’s eye.” Not in all likelihood as far as I’m concerned. In all likelihood there is no conection whatever between the double stranded quiff and the epsilon.\n“NumidsBids, ancientcoins.com, lot numbers: 1729; 578; 579 and 580.” Alas I can only find the last two of these, as you forgot to provide the auction details. They are good specimens, beautifully photographed, but no more convincing than any of the others, in my view.\n\n","date":"November 6, 2014 at 11:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/decrypted-iconosteganalysist-or-iconocryptanalyst/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-169281","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Decrypted:  Iconosteganalysist or Iconocryptanalyst","post":"Hugh, to make it short here, methinks you do have a vivual problem if you just cannot see how remarkably similar the blood smear on the HP MS Christ’s forehead and the lower portion of the TS face ‘tailed-epsilon’ shaped blood trickle dripping onto the eyebrow ridge ARE!\n\n","date":"January 20, 2015 at 11:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/decrypted-iconosteganalysist-or-iconocryptanalyst/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-184867","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Decrypted:  Iconosteganalysist or Iconocryptanalyst","post":"Typo: visual problem\n\n","date":"January 20, 2015 at 11:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/decrypted-iconosteganalysist-or-iconocryptanalyst/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-184870","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"}]
