Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a promising technique for the detection of these materials, yet concerns over the sensitivity of SERS spectra of dyes to chemical and instrumental variables (such as pH, choice of SERS substrates and/or aggregants, and excitation wavelength) have prevented its widespread use in analytical applications. Over the last few years, the development of several microanalytical approaches has considerably increased the chances of success in the identification of minute amounts of dyes by SERS. However, the need for searchable databases is still largely to be fulfilled. In this work, we have assembled the core of a comprehensive library which contains 100 Raman and SERS reference spectra of natural and synthetic organic colorants. Experiments to classify 20 query SERS spectra of dyes from a variety of museum objects were conducted using principal component analysis (PCA) and the correlation coefficient (CC) algorithm. … etc. … etc. …\nAnal.

Until recently I’d assumed that the two-stage imprinting model, using a real person as template, flour paste as imprinting medium, and any one of at least 3 developing agents, was entirely original thinking. Not so: here’s what John Heller wrote towards the end of his 1983 book (well written ,except for the flyleaf that he hopefully did not see and approve):\n“Sam Pellicori, a champion of the body-contact hypothesis, had done some interesting experiments. In three separate experiments, he had placed oil, lemon juice and perspiration on his fingers. Then he placed linen on top of his hand and pressed it gently to his flesh. He then placed the cloth samples in an oven at low temperature to produce an accelerated aging effect. In each case there was indeed a yellowing of the contact area. he had brought the linen samples with him. the team examined them and, although there was a surface effect, several of us insisted that we could see some capillarity in several of the fibrils, which is not the case of the Shroud.”\nMy experiments match those of Pellicori’s almost down to the last detail, but with one crucial difference. My imprinting medium is macromolecular, indeed whole cell in size, namely the crushed endosperm of wheat grains (“white flour”) so greatly reducing the theoretical risk of “capillarity”, though I still have to do detailed microscopy.\nIf this model is only approximately corrrect (and it’s gratifying to know that  Pellicori, a STURP team investigator was thinking along exactly  the same lines 30 years ago) then the science and technology were well within the capability of a medieval forger if needing only white flour paste and a hot iron or oven (not nitric acid as initially suggested). What’s more there’s a clearly stated rationale for doing it the way suggested – namely to simulate an ancient sweat imprint left on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen/sindon en route from cross to tomb, pre-empting any notions of fancier imaging mechanisms (laser uv light, neutrons etc) occuring on winding(?) cloths/othonia much later, or due to miraculous events that are non-reproducible in the laboratory – and thus a scientific dead end, no pun intended.\nThis blogger does not do scientific dead ends, and places great emphasis on having a coherent narrative from start to finish. But the technical details – like ringing all the changes with imprinting technique, oven temperatures etc – he prefers to leave to others. What concerns me is scientific feasibility – not reproducing every tiny detail of the Shroud image. There’s no compelling need to re-forge a forgery. One need only show that the science is feasible and credible, requiring no lasers etc. Naturally, I can only speak for myself. I can’t speak for those convinced that the Shroud is beyond known science.\n\n","date":"August 5, 2015 at 5:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/05/scientist-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"article","id":"comment-207506","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Scientist Barrie Schwortz","post":"Very interesting discussion.\nI don’t know the person who created an image on the Shroud is a Scientist or Artist or Photographer or a any other person or the creater of this universe?\nHowever I can describe that person as a one of the greatest scientist as he created this image before highly developed science came to existence.

So why bother with a side-by-side comparison? It’s hard to imagine diimide being any faster, but even if it was, then so what? There are so many factors affecting chemical kinetics that it’s hard to see what point is served. What matters is the principle. Did STURP overlook to test hypochlorite? Would hypochlorite  ave bleached the “Shroud” image? If so, what conclusions might have been drawn (e.g. that would quickly exclude McCrone’s tunnel vision – due to his over-reliance on a microscope to mis-identify iron oxide as the chromophore) and whether there might have been an opening, hitched onto Ray Rogers’ know-how with pyrolysis mass spectrometry to explore the nature of the “Shroud” chromophore (admittedly destructive)? Might it be something other than the supposed dehydration of carbohydrates?  \nThe half-tone effect (if true) suggests an all-or-nothing action on a minor constituent of linen, as does the strong absorption in the uv that might account for coloration seen with Di Lazzaro’s intense laser-generated uv. Is he right to assume it’s cellulose being coloured, given that’s a bulk component, generally regarded as transparent or unaffected by uv?   Cue Hugh’s suggestion on this site, November 2012, that lignin may be the susceptible chromophore. Lignin absorbs and bleaches in the uv  and visible spectrum. My money’s on the lignin. I might try doing some experiments with sodium metabisulphite to see if that blocks certain modes of linen coloration (bisulphite is used in paper-manufacture from wood pulp to solubilize or otherwise deal with lignin).\nBack now to preparing the first instalment of a new weekly posting, addressing the claim from a certain over-prescriptive, over-dogmatic MD that my current images fail to respond to 3D-rendering programs.
