Even if it is “proved” to be authentic, that it did really wrap the body of Jesus, that the Resurrection can be observed when we look at the image, it will still not answer all questions. On the contrary, it will raise more questions for both science and religion, but that is for another paper that will have to go deeper into the nature of reality…\n\n","date":"May 16, 2014 at 12:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/16/a-reality-that-cannot-be-ignored/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-120471","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A reality that cannot be ignored","post":"The Charles Marcos letter which referenced the Shroud of Turin continued with another comment which Dan didn’t reproduce but has relevance to what I am currently working on: Chapter 17, The Apocalypse of Selfishness:\n“The geologic history of the past 4.5 billion years bears witness to several apocalyptic changes on planet Earth. However, the current vector to a climate change apocalypse implicates that it may be due to human activity. Both unprecedented population growth and pollution-generating technologies are the fruits of scientific “advances.” Heaven forbid that science “reality” replaces God’s reality.”\nCharles Markos\nChicago Tribune\nMay 14, 2014\nJohn Klotz\nhttp://johnklotz.blogspot.com\n\n","date":"May 16, 2014 at 3:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/16/a-reality-that-cannot-be-ignored/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-120532","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A reality that cannot be ignored","post":"This is funny, Charles Markos is mixing things up, talking about “Science reality” and “God’s reality” and then, as though driven by fear of reality, as it is, he places his faith in the TS.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2014 at 4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/16/a-reality-that-cannot-be-ignored/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-120545","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A reality that cannot be ignored","post":"Louis, I didn’t read Markos this way.  I really think Markos’ point suggests that the TS forges ahead from the old mythologies of Religion including the Judeo-Christian mythologies which do not serve us so well today and noting the TS there is a whole field of Science and a whole new field of Religion that we’ve yet to tap into… that’s all.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2014 at 5:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/16/a-reality-that-cannot-be-ignored/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-120558","author":"Annette Cloutier","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A reality that cannot be ignored","post":"Hi Annette, I don’t think Markos expressed himself enough, he could have been more explicit.\nIf the Shroud is where the Resurrection can be observed, then it emerged from “Judaeo-Christian” mythology, which then ceases to be mythology, if it is a natural image then it emerged from Judaeo-Christian archaeology.
