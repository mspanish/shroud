Here is what is said about it:  “Like every piece of new research connected to the shroud, the detailed findings from the 1988 radiocarbon tests raised doubts:  the swath of cloth that was tested was not from the original shroud, but came from an edge of it that had been patched, and touched by many grimy fourteenth-century hands as the icon was moved from place to place.”  If one is intending to educate an audience, I would think a little more thoroughness is warranted.\n\n","date":"February 28, 2015 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192027","author":"Joe Marino","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series","post":"Joe, may I ask one question?\nDid they mention any radiocarbon of any alleged piece of the True Cross?\nCharles Freeman mentioned in some comments that they planned to do so, and CNN trailer indicates that as well http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/02/19/cnn-original-series-finding-jesus-03-01-15.cnn-creative-marketing\nMike, thanks for the link.Very interesting.\n\n","date":"February 28, 2015 at 1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192037","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series","post":"The book indicates that a sample was taken for Oxford to sample but it   doesn’t list any results so Oxford evidently has not completed the  testing.\n\n","date":"February 28, 2015 at 2:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192041","author":"jmarino240","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series","post":"Thanks. \nWe will see the results  in TV.

Despite many documented accounts of specific Holy  Land relics, no  mainstream scholar specialising in ancient artefacts or early relic legends knows of any that are genuine.\nI have never heard anything but ridicule of Thiede from established scholars. Certainly his book on the titulus, which I have seen in Rome, was totally unconvincing and the carbon  date reflects an age when many ancient objects were given relic status. I am in Lucca at the moment and again the Volto Santo, believed to have been carved by Nicodemus,has again come up medieval, as have other apparent relics that have been carbon dated. This does not mean ,of course, that they were designed as fakes, though some were, the majority was objects of lost origin which became associated with miracles or visions and so got their relic status that way. Common were stories of them travelling from the Holy Land, as the Volto Santo did In a boat without any oars!\nActually the people of Lucca know that is it is medieval but  this does not stop them having a wonderful feast day in September in which it is paraded through the streets.

Publication of the authors’ book preceded the C14 dating of the St Croce relic.  Whatever, the original relic certainly seems to have existed, being attested by Egeria 383, pilgrim Antoninus 6th c, Sts Cyril, Ambrose & John Chrysostom.  The sequence of lettering on the present relic is: Aramaic/Hebrew, Greek & Latin, at variance with the gospel accounts.  Curiously the Latin & Greek lines read from right to left, either from ignorance or as a parody of the Hebrew.  These two features (language sequence, and the right to left script) would seem to argue against forgery in the earlier relic. \nIt was hidden in 455 because of an attack by Visigoths, and not rediscovered until 1492 by workmen behind a brick inscribed “Titulus Crucis”.

The Wikipedia article, although pretty elementary, does mention the important figures in elevating relic cults such as Ambrose and Augustine.\nThere were certainly memories of where some martyrs were buried but there was no systematic use of the actual dug -up bones being used as spiritual forces before the fourth century. Ambrose of Milan’s opportune discovery of the bones of Gervasius and Protasius in the 380s when he used them as a means of boosting his own reputation is one of the best known early examples and his transfer of some  dust from them to Rouen one of the earliest examples of a translatio- the placing of a relic in an above ground shrine where it could be openly venerated. By 400 the emphasis was on public display, carrying relics in processions, having them in shrines,etc. No need for secrecy, in fact the opposite. There is no point in having a relic if you hide it away from veneration.\nOf course, in many cases the relics are new or are old bones ,etc, that are assumed to be genuine. So there are lots of stories of discoveries .e.g the bones of the martyr Stephen in Jerusalem in 415. No reason at all to think that they were the real thing and until any of these are actually dated to the first century or have some definite evidence of provenance then I am sceptical. There was just too great an incentive to produce a relic which was claimed to be authentic. So far, but we are waiting on CNN, not a single relic has been proved to be first century.\nNo need to answer the rants of OK.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192824","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series","post":"Charles:\nThe start of relic cults is three hundred years on covering a time when almost no attention was paid to relics so there was no reason to preserve them.\nI say straithorward: you are deliberately LYING! . It is THIRD time that I must correct this deceit cynically spread by you! \nThe cult of relics is much earlier than Constatnine. In fact, it predated the origin of Christianity.\nJust a few of the examples from the Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic#History\nOne of the earliest sources that purports to show the efficacy of relics is found in 2 Kings 13:20–21:\n    20 Elisha died and was buried. Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring. 21 Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet. (NIV)\nAlso cited is the veneration of Polycarp’s relics recorded in the Martyrdom of Polycarp (written 150–160 AD).[13] With regard to relics that are objects, an often cited passage is Acts 19:11–12, which says that Paul’s handkerchiefs were imbued by God with healing power.\nCharles (further):\nIt needs a particular mind set to preserve relics which is why they are not part of many Christian traditions.\nYes -especially those Protestant traditions that originated 1500 years afterwards, and possesed no relics, and no previous traditions at all (thus they adopted sola scriptura principle). I can’t recall any pre-Reformation Church that doctrinally rejected veneration and prservation of relics by principle, even despite critical voices about cult or provenace of some relics raised from time to time.\nHugh:\nCan you fill out a bit of chronology for us, Charles. I understand there was a huge expansion in relic collecting from about 300 AD, presumably mostly in the East? \nI don’t think there was a great expansion in relic collecting about 300 AD, except for the Saint Helen and her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where she rediscovered True Cross, and gathered many other relics. Simply since the Constantine, and the end of persecution, most of the relics (like Crown of Thorns for example) didn’t have to be hidden, and could be publically venerated. Before that time they were mostly kept in the judeo-christian society, and passed from generation to generation, in rather secretive way.\nDo any other allegedly 1st century relics appear later than 1350?\nYes -or rather they reappear after several centuries. For example:\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120618-john-the-baptist-bones-jesus-christ-bible-bulgaria-science-higham/\nPurported skeletal remains of John the Baptist have been dated to the first century A.D. and so could conceivably have belonged to the “forerunner of Christ,” who baptized Jesus, scientists say.\nDiscovered in 2010 among the ruins of a Bulgarian church, the remains include six human bones: a knucklebone from the right hand, a tooth, part of a cranium, a rib, and an ulna, or forearm bone.\nDNA and radiocarbon testing of collagen from the knucklebone show that the remains likely belonged to a Middle Eastern man who lived in the first century A.D., which fits with the story of John the Baptist.\nNote every sentence ending in a query – I really have no idea, but would be grateful for your opinion.\nTruly Hugh, Charles’ biased, deceitful and misleading “opinions” are not worth a penny. He has discredited himself completely in this matter.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2015 at 4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192121","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series","post":"In an interview with the late Professor Geza Vermes, teaching Jewish history at Oxford, I questioned him about Dead Sea Scroll fragment 7Q5 that Father José O’Callaghan believed to have been part of a Gospel and received support from Carsten P.

When did all the Crowns of Thorns and Tunics, Lances, Nails, Swaddling Clothes and stuff appear in Western Europe? Wasn’t it earlier?\n\n","date":"March 1, 2015 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192126","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series","post":"Hugh:\nThe trouble is, it’s difficult to substantiate an opinion of secrecy – the idea that there was a relic culture but it was too secret to leave any trace is possible, but the evidence for it seems to be exactly the same as for the idea that there was no relic culture at all.\nIf you have any orientation in ancient history (especially the number and condition f preserved written sources and historiography) you will know that is one should expect. There were little written records of relic cult before 300 AD, yet there were a few, showing us that the relics were in fact venerated, although not openly like after Constantine. Besides people who took care about them rarely left written records. Writing history besides was rather Greek and Roman (and on the other side of the world Chinese) hobby. 90 % of historical Jewish writings comes from two sources: the Bible and Josephus (who wrote in Hellenic manner). There are no preserverved historical writings from Persians for example , up to the Arab conquests. There are no Persian, or Parthian Herodotus nor Livy, nor Sima Qian. The same is for Indinas, there are only a couple of historical writings in India before. 1200 AD.\nSo the lack of records is fully understndable.\nWhen did all the Crowns of Thorns and Tunics, Lances, Nails, Swaddling Clothes and stuff appear in Western Europe? Wasn’t it earlier?\nThe main periods of major transfer of relics from the East to the West are 1.) The Persian conquest of the Holy land in 614 when several relics were trnasferred to Spain 2.) The Charlemagne times circa 800 AD, 3.) The outcome of the 4th Crusade, when several relics were looted, or sold to the West. Of course diplomatic relations brought several pieces of relics (a few thorns for example) to the West at different times.\nIf you are interested in history of relics, Micheal Hesemann’s Die stummen zeugen von Golgatha are must read. Besides Grzegorz Górny Witnesses to Mystery as illustrations (Górny in fact derived half of the text from Hesemann if you read the two carefully).\n\n","date":"March 1, 2015 at 6:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192128","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series","post":"O.K.\nYes, that was one positive aspect of C.P.

Read this:\nOrigen, Contra Celsum, Book I, Chapter 51 (http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04161.htm  ) :\nWith respect to the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, if any one desires, after the prophecy of Micah and after the history recorded in the Gospels by the disciples of Jesus, to have additional evidence from other sources, let him know that, in conformity with the narrative in the Gospel regarding His birth, there is shown at Bethlehem the cave where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes. And this sight is greatly talked of in surrounding places, even among the enemies of the faith, it being said that in this cave was born that Jesus who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians.\nHere you have the photo of the remmants of this manger, described by Origen around 250 AD, and transferred to Rome, to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in the VIIth century by patriarch Sophronius, after Muslim invasion.\n\nThe tradiion of it seems fully trustworthy.

Now deceased, Rogers was one of the scientists involved in the carbon-dating tests of which the results were published in 1988 saying the Shroud dates back tom the 14th century. Rogers did his own research at the behest of someone who contacted him and asked him to take another look: Here’s what he found:\n   -The sample provided for the carbon-dating test was taken from a patch sewn into the cloth in the 14th century following a fire which damaged it.\n  -A cloth purported to be the Shroud was kept in Jerusalem, Edessa and finally in Constantinople from the time of the death of Christ until it was taken  from Constantinople by Crusaders.\n  -Christos Pantokratur – a Byzantine painting that goes back to the 5th century. Rogers overlaid the head on the Shroud onto this painting and clearly demonstrates that it’s the same person – exact forehead, nose, chin, hair-line, size, etc. Rogers concludes that the early Christians were familiar with the Shroud,  although not many had access to it due to the fear that enemies of Christianity would destroy it, and that the face on the Shroud was used as a model for early Christian artists. Just take a look at some of the ancient art depicting Christ. It’s the same face as on the Shroud. I saw it for myself in a church in Greece that goes back 1,500 years.\nRogers concluded that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Christ.\nAnother item missed – an Israel scientist found pollen on the Shroud from plants growing only in Jerusalem which pollinate only in the Spring. Christ was crucified in the Spring. There is also pollen from plants found only in Edessa and Constantinople. How, in God’s name, would a forger from 14th century Europe even think about getting pollen from Jerusalem? It’s invisible to the naked eye!\nThere is also residue on the Shroud where the knees made contact containing dust and particles from dirt and stone found only in  Jerusalem.\nOn a final note, getting back to Rogers, he does not know how the image got on the Shroud (and neither does anyone else), but he did add that it would have had to appear within the first 4 or 5 days of death, because by that  time liquids would begin to ooze from the body creating an unrecognizable mess, not a clear, concise, detailed image that we have.\n\n","date":"March 2, 2015 at 1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-192211","author":"leon ward","site":"shroudstory"}]
