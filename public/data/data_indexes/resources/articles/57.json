To say the bilirubin hypothesis is “accepted” or “not accepted” implies that the amorphous entity called “scientists” has at least heard of the Shroud, which I fear it hasn’t.\nHeller and Adler’s first paper on blood, “Blood on the Shroud of Turin”, 1980, in spite of some detailed discussion of the degradation of blood, does not mention bilirubin at all. It is a review of some microspectrum photometry carried out on “less than a dozen possible bloodstained fibrils and a single brownish red translucent crystal.”\nThe first mention of bilirubin in connection with the Shroud seems to be in ‘A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin’, Heller and Adler, 1981. “Characteristic blue azobilirubin colors could be positively detected in reflected light on the surfaces of the olive coloured shards, the orange globs, and, also, weakly on the more orange colored red coated fibrils.” The redder coloured fibrils are specifically excluded from this analysis.\nAnother roughly contemporaneous paper, “The Origin and Nature of Blood on the Turin Shroud”, which I can only find in ‘The Orphaned Manuscript”, goes in more detail into the bilirubin content, based on the microspectrum photometry previously mentioned. “There is an extraordinarily high bilirubin count, almost as high as the methemoglobin.” There is no explanation of how this was derived, and it is not apparent to me, after studying the spectrum as illustrated in the 1980 paper. In further discussion Adler proposes that mixing orange bilirubin with brown methemoglobin would result in the carmine red stains we see on the Shroud today. I disagree.\nBilirubin is orange.\n\nIt cannot be made red by mixing it with brown.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2015 at 9:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/28/is-bilirubin-still-accepted-as-an-explanation-for-the-red-blood/","cat":"article","id":"comment-194698","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Bilirubin Still Accepted as an Explanation for the Red Blood?","post":"Sorry Hugh.

You say, “Adler never said that the bilirubin is what made the blood still red.”\nBut in “The Origin and Nature of Blood on the Turin Shroud” by Alan D. Adler published in “The Orphaned Manuscript: A Gathering of Publications on the Shroud of Turin”, Dr. Adler did actually say, “You now mix bilirubin which is yellow-orange with methemoglobin in its para-hemic form which is an orangey- brown and you get blood which has a red color.” \nWhat am I missing? \nYou put a great deal of emphasis on Dr. Adler’s expertise. Fair enough. I don’t doubt it. But if you do so you should also consider the expertise of Dr. Colin Berry and his questioning of Dr. Adler in his blog posting, “It’s clever, some might say pretty, but is it science?” at https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/ (2012/4/20). To wit,\n“re Alan Adler’s protocols: it’s easy to be impressed by lists of the tests he did perform to confirm “real” blood, albeit degraded. But one has to be a specialist in the area of tetrapyrroles, whether cyclic, like the porphrins, or linear like the bile pigments, to know that uv.visible and fluorescence spectra alone do not provide proof positive. For two years I was a bile pigment specialist, working on Philadelphia on the phototherapy of neonatal jaundice, and teamed up with a then major drug company (SKF) to use state-of-the-art methodology for identifying bilirubin photo-derivatives. key among those were initial thin layer chromatography, followed by derivitization to form volatile TMS-derivatives, followed by mass-spectometry. We were not content to look just for finger-printing fragments – we regarded detection of the molecular ion as our goal.\n“That was in 1972, well before the STURP studies, but nowhere have I seen Alan Adler using such rigorous methodology to confirm that he was detecting porphyrins, as distinct form substances with porphyrin-like spectra and fluorescence. Nor have I seen any real evidence for the existence of bilirubin, apart from diazo-reactivity and fluorescence. Why no chromatography? Why no mass spec? Why inflict a quirky conjecture involving a trauma induced bilirubin and “para-hemic” methaemoglobin to explain the permanent red colour of the “blood”? That is not science – that is daydreaming and pure fantasy.”\n\n","date":"March 29, 2015 at 2:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/28/is-bilirubin-still-accepted-as-an-explanation-for-the-red-blood/","cat":"article","id":"comment-194760","author":"Daniel Carter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Bilirubin Still Accepted as an Explanation for the Red Blood?","post":"Barrie is entirely correct to defend Adler as the most qualified and the most experienced scientist to work on the blood of the Shroud, and his (and Joseph Heller’s) account of what they did is extremely useful.

The latter property, if really true (and not misheard) may conceivably be demonstrable under test-tube conditions, using protein-free buffers at non-physiological pH, but is unlikely to be seen in vivo, given the poor solubility of (unconjugated) bilirubin in aqueous buffers and its near complete binding to serum albumin that helps to “keep it out of mischief.”\n\n","date":"March 29, 2015 at 12:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/28/is-bilirubin-still-accepted-as-an-explanation-for-the-red-blood/","cat":"article","id":"comment-194792","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Bilirubin Still Accepted as an Explanation for the Red Blood?","post":"Pause for thought? It’s needed certainly, if one’s to go on quoting (misquoting?) Alan Adler, correctly or otherwise, as having (allegedly) described bilirubin as a “hemolytic agent”.\n Bilirubin is an end-product of hemolysis. I have never heard it described previously as a hemolytic agent. Were that the case, then jaundice would be a horrendous condition, subject to positive feedback control (more bilirubin, more hemolysis, more bilirubin, more hemolysis etc etc).\nIt’s time the bilirubin story was given a decent burial.  There was simply no solid analytical foundation upon which to implicate bilirubin in the colour of the Shroud blood stains. \nBilirubin is unstable to light and oxygen anyway, as Adler himself acknowledged several years later in his conservation paper. Bilirubin never preserved anything. Biliribin cannot even preserve itself (self-sensitizing its own destruction via generation of the active oxygen species – singlet oxygen).\n\n","date":"March 30, 2015 at 12:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/28/is-bilirubin-still-accepted-as-an-explanation-for-the-red-blood/","cat":"article","id":"comment-194873","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Is Bilirubin Still Accepted as an Explanation for the Red Blood?","post":"Knowing absolutely nothing whatsoever about the chemistry of blood, I should still think that working on what purport to be ancient bloodstains, badly fragmented, is rather a different matter from working on blood samples recently taken from persons in a modern clinic, whether suffering from neo-natal jaundice or otherwise.  During the period 1969-76, a secret commission appointed by Cardinal Pellegrino attempted to analyse the stains on the Shroud.  The several scientists included Prof Frache at Modena (forensics & blood), Prof Filogamo at Turin (blood-analysis).  At that time the normal tests for blood included: Peroxidase method commonly used to detect hemoglobin; benzidine turns blue, phenolphthaline turns pink; tests unsuccessful; failed to dissolve granules with acetic acid, oxygenated water, glycerin of potassium.  Clearly they faced a problem which they were not able to resolve at that time.  When their work was put to Adler around 1978, he had at that time had achieved some success with examining blood under UV light and with the resulting fluorescence. \nThe tests that Adler was able to perform seem to have been constrained by the inability to put these ancient stains into solution by the normal methods used when faced with a recent sample.  Consequently he seems to have been obliged to carry out such tests as could best be achieved according to his recent research.  \nI have little doubt that Dr Berry is fully knowledgeable about aspects of blood chemistry, including bilirubin.
