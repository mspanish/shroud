John Kerry’s face is long and narrow and it was long and narrow when he was young.\nGo to Google images and type in John Kerry, age 20\nYou will see the shape of his face was the same as a young man.  He’s now 71.\nBest,\n\n","date":"April 27, 2015 at 7:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/27/computer-generated-young-jesus-from-image-on-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-197787","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Computer Generated Young Jesus From Image on Shroud","post":"I wonder if this reverse aging took into account the fact that the face on the Shroud had been badly beaten and so can be expected to be swollen somewhat out of shape.  Personally, I prefer the portrait painted by Akiane Kramarik at age 8 (!).  Here’s a link to her website: http://www.akiane.com/store/ although you may have to do a little digging to find the “Prince of Peace” portrait.  She claimed at the age of four to have met God and angels in heaven and later to have seen Jesus.  The little boy in the book “Heaven is for Real” (also made into a movie) identified Akiane’s portrait as the one that looked the most like Jesus, whom he claimed to have seen in a near death experience.  Thin reeds, perhaps, but Akiane’s talent is so prodigious that I am inclined to take her claims at face value.  Personal preference, I suppose, but these Italian suggestions don’t appeal to me.  In fact, I don’t think any of them look much like the Shroud image.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2015 at 5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/27/computer-generated-young-jesus-from-image-on-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-197965","author":"Jim Carney","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Computer Generated Young Jesus From Image on Shroud","post":"Jim, Akiane Kramarik is as talented as Isabel Piczek.  Yet, the image to which you refer (painting at age 8) reminds me more of a Brad Pit type photo…too handsome.\nIf Isaiah 53 references Jesus, the Shroud image would be more representative than Akiane’s painting.\nIsaiah 53:2\nKing James Bible\n“For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.”\nI showed the Shroud facial image to two five year old little girls and only asked one question of them, “Who is this man?”\nThe first little girl said “George Washington” and the second girl (who was Latino) said Jesus.\nTherefore, I will equate George Washington to the Isaiah 53 verse, “…and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.”\nThis is only my opinion.  :)\nBest,\n\n","date":"April 30, 2015 at 8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/27/computer-generated-young-jesus-from-image-on-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-198055","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Computer Generated Young Jesus From Image on Shroud","post":"edit:  girl = Latina\n\n","date":"April 30, 2015 at 8:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/27/computer-generated-young-jesus-from-image-on-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-198056","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Computer Generated Young Jesus From Image on Shroud","post":"edit:  Oops, Brad Pitt\n\n","date":"April 30, 2015 at 8:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/27/computer-generated-young-jesus-from-image-on-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-198057","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"}]
