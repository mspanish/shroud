It’s that the Shroud continues to seep into the culture and appears it surprising places as metaphor even.\nMaybe that’s progress.\nThere’s an old story about the magnificent Missouri mule trainer who promised a farmer  that he could  train the farmer’s mule on a whisper.for $100. The farmer paid the man  and brought the mule  to the trainer. The trainer approached the mule with a baseball bat in his hand. “Haa,”, he whispered into the mules ear. The mule didn’t budge. He then hit the mule in the head with the baseball bat. Then he whispered again into the mule’s  ear. Still the mule didn’t move. He then hit the mule again. \nAt this point the farmer had seen enough. “What are you doing? he yelled. “I thought you would train him to move n a whisper.!”  “Oh,” the trainer repleied, “He’ll move on a whisper, but first I have to get his attention.”\nWhat the post demonstrates, is that we are getting their attention.\n\n","date":"May 17, 2014 at 7:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/17/the-shroud-continues-to-become-part-of-the-lingua-franca/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-120735","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"}]
