It’s pretty much like all the parables of Jesus who talks about one single character, while in truth, this anonymous character was referring to every human being that ever lived on this planet!  \nIn reality, it is the first Christian communities who stretched these lines from the Old Testament in order to link them directly to Jesus; all this in a great effort to make believe that all that was concerning Jesus of Nazareth (especially his Passion, death and Resurrection, along with things like his birth) had already been described by the ancient Jewish prophets of the Old Testament…  Every biblical expert who is not biased will tell you this is a FACT.\nImportant note: That doesn’t mean these lines from the Old Testament cannot be linked with Jesus and his actions in a symbolical way, but it’s important to understand that every Jews from Jesus time (starting with all the Jewish religious leaders and all the specialist of the Jewish scripture) never understood these lines as referring to him personally, because they knew perfectly that they were first and foremost talking about the suffering of the Jewish people who had been deported in Babylon a long time before Jesus’ birth.\nBelieving that all these lines were originally intent to describe the Messiah is simply wrong…\nLast comment: In his paper, Andy talks about the nailing of the wrist of the Shroud man and made an error…  He describe the nailing in the way Zugibe believed it to have been done, which would have started from the bottom of the palm and ended in the wrist area, through a space between the bones that Zugibe called as the “Z” space and not the Destot space.  The nailing through Destot space was originally described by Doctor Barbet (and not Zugibe who was against this idea) and this would involve a nailing that would be done solely and completely through the wrist area without involving any nailing at the bottom of the palm like Zugibe described it in his hypothesis (which I do not believe for one second).

In Isaiah’s mind, you can be sure that never he was referring to a Messiah named Jesus who would come many centuries later to take the suffering of the world on his shoulders.  It is the first Christian communities who desperately wanted to link Jesus with some texts of the Old Testament to comnfort their belief that he was truly the Messiah.  Nevertheless, as I also said, that doesn’t mean that, as Christians, we cannot used those ancient texts for our meditation about the sacrifice of Christ.  \nNote: I use the word “sacrifice” in the sense of someone who’s ready, like Jesus was, to sacrifice his life in order to remain faithful to the truth he wanted to reveal to all people, i.e. that God is merciful love and nothing else…  I will NEVER used that word like many Christian do (wrongly and sadly in my opinion) in the pure sacrificial sense, like the sacrifice of animals in the Temple by the Jews.  Never because if Jesus’ sacrifice would have been like this, that would mean he would have make a deal with God in our place for our salvation, which would have been a purely commercial deal that would be totally contrary to real love!  By the way, I believe that this is the true and profound meaning of Jesus’ chasing of the money changers in the Temple:  God is pure love and nothing else and, therefore, he don’t do any kind of commercial deal with anyone!  His love and mercy are FREE!  No more sacrifice (in the sacrificial sense) is needed no more!  The only thing that is truly necessary on our part is to simply recognize our state or poor sinner and, at the same time (one must go with the other), to recognize our deep need to be unconditionally loved and saved by God!  Jesus’ “sacrifice” on the cross is the guaranty of this unconditional love and salvation that God reserve for everyone of his beloved children!\n\n","date":"July 18, 2015 at 4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206099","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"I think the prophets, whether Isaiah or others, were granted, unwittingly or not, rather more insight than Yannick seems prepared to acknowledge.  It is correct that the ‘suffering servant’ section seems to be from the end of the Babylonian exile, whereas the ministry of the original prophet Isaiah extended from 742 – 701 BC.  \nChapters 40–55 (Second Isaiah, or Deutero-Isaiah) are generally attributed to an anonymous poet who prophesied toward the end of the Babylonian exile. From this section come the great oracles known as the Servant Songs, which are reflected in the New Testament understanding of the passion and glorification of Christ.  Subsequent chapters 56-66 (Trito-Isaiah) are post-exilic.  \nI see it is as no coincidence that there is a very close correspondence between Isaiah’s suffering servant, which he likely identifies as Israel, and the sufferings of Christ.  The document Lumen Gentium sees the Old Testament account of the Jewish people as a type of pre-figuring of the New Testament events.  I see it all as part of God’s purpose in revealing himself in the person of Christ over the course of very many centuries.

Some believed he would be a new King David.  Some believed he would be a new Moses.  Some believed he would be a sort of “super” high priest.  But no one ever thought he would be a humble carpenter from Galilee who would be rejected by the Jewish leaders, who would died at the hands of the Romans (what a shame for a Jew!) and who would resurrect later on to only appear to his closest friends!   \nTo me, this historical fact that Jesus was very different from any Messiah the Jews of the Old Testament (including the prophets) and even the Jews of his time had in mind is one of the strongest argument against the idea that some people could have build up a story like that during the First Century.  We just have to note another historical fact to be convinced: the majority of the Jews did not accept Jesus-Christ as the true Messiah and never became Christians!  All these facts tell me that the story of Jesus of Nazareth is not a fairy tale invented by some Jews during the First Century because they were tired to wait for the Messiah!  Of course, that doesn’t mean they really saw Jesus alive after his death, but to me, that means that they didn’t invent anything and that they were truly and honestly convinced to have seen him again after his death, even though he was looking different.  Could there have been a sort of “error on the person” on their part at that moment?  Possible, but for me, this hypothesis is far less credible than to think that the whole story of Jesus Passion, death and Resurrection is really true and was reported by people who were the first ones surprised by these events! \nIn sum, the story of Jesus Passion, death and Resurrection that is at the heart of every book in the New Testament is not the kind of story that could have been made-up by some Jews of the First Century because no one at that time had ever thought about a Messiah like that, even those who knew the scriptures real well, including all the books of the prophets!\n\n","date":"July 20, 2015 at 7:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206206","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"On the road to Emmaus: \n“25  And he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are!

We still see this constantly here today and a lot of time, we even see this on this blog!\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 8:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206319","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"It is a question of faith more than exegesis. The first believers, being Jews, looked back at the OT and connected these themes and prophecies to Jesus – one can see why. Did the OT author have Jesus in mind when he wrote of these things — no, how could he without a crystal ball? But that doesn’t mean the Spirit wasn’t inspiring him. \nDo you believe in prophecy – a divine foreshadowing of things to come? If not, then linking Jesus to these OT themes is an exercise in confirmation bias – reading into the past things we wish to see a pattern for. This is a valid, rationalistic viewpoint.\nBut if you believe in prophecy, and that God has written Himself into our human story, then the OT is more than just a history of the Jewish people. It is the precursor to what will be the heart of the story. And what author doesn’t use set-ups and pay-offs in his tale? The OT is the set-up, the Gospels are the pay-off.\nAs you pointed out, many Jews did not ‘convert’ to be followers of Jesus post-Easter. But many did. Some saw the connection to the OT, some did not. God doesn’t force belief on any of us.\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206327","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"Correction:  Most Jews did not see any connection.  That’s an historical fact and you can see glimpses of that in the letters of Paul, which shows how hard it was for him to convert a Jew!  As he said clearly:  A crucified Messiah was a SCANDAL (very strong word!) for a Jew!\nRead again: A SCANDAL!!!  If the words of the prophets would have been understood by most Jews as talking about a suffering Messiah, there would have been no scandal at all for a Jew to admit Jesus was really the Messiah.  The fact that it was a scandal for any normal Jew of Paul’s time truly indicates that no one had ever thought about a suffering Messiah prior to the Resurrection of Jesus.\nOn Good Friday, you can bet your house that even Jesus’ closest friends were thinking he was not the true Messiah of Israel since it was a SCANDAL for any Jew of that time to think the Messiah could end-up like that (dying on a cross like a criminal)!\nThe link that was made between some ancient texts and the events surrounding Jesus have been made later on by Christians who desperately wanted to convert Jews to Jesus (and to comfort the faith of the few Jews who had turned Christians).  But looking at history, it doesn’t seem that making these links really helped to convert a lot of Jews to Christianism…  The scandal (linked with the great novelty of this Messiah’s figure) was just to great for most of them to accept, while they prefered to stay in their old religious mindset, which is comforting for many people.\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 10:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206328","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"By the way, I don’t believe that any authors of the Old Testament had a divine foreshadowing of things to come…  Did Jesus had one?

I don’t care about your insult.

Period.  If this definition don’t fit with your point of view, fine.  If it does, then, like it or not, you’re a traditionalist Christian.

By meditating of what this mean, you should come to the same conclusion as me, i.e. that, up until the Resurrection, no Jew (including all the prophets) had any idea about a suffering Messiah!  And even after the death and Resurrection of Jesus, most Jews stayed in their closed-minded set, which did not allow them to come to the truth about Jesus and his mission, which was to reveal the true face of God who is merficul love and nothing else and his plan of universal salvation for, not only all mankind, but all the other living creatures he created with love.\nThe simple fact that this idea of a suffering Messiah who died on the cross was a scandal for any normal Jew of St Paul’s time should give you a great clue about the fact that I’m right about that: no ancient prophet had Jesus in mind when they wrote. Most of them (if not all of them) had the suffering of the Jewish people in mind, which was not a suffering that would happen in the future, but that happened in the past and that was still present at the time they wrote their books!  All these texts were meant to give hope to the people and, a lot of time, also to lead them to repentance…  This doesn’t mean we can’t read these texts and associate the suffering of the Jewish people with the suffering of Christ, but that’s not something obligatory.  Many Christians (and I include myself in that group) do not need these ancient texts for their faith and their hope.  The New Testament is enough for them.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2015 at 9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206384","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"Dave I agree 100%; “The words have a clear enough application to the sufferings of Jesus” and one does not need to be a scholar to see this…As a child reading this for the first time, one has the instinctive knowledge of whom it was written…with no dilutions or bias of interpretation.\n“unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter\nthe kingdom of heaven” Matthew 18:3.\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 2:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206338","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"Ron, please read my 2 comments above…  It’s incredible to note how much traditionalists are attracted by the Shroud! :)\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 2:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206339","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"There are prophecies in the Old Testament (aside from Isaiah 53) that predict Jesus as the Messiah.\nIf Isaiah 53 referred to a suffering servant or Israel, how would these scriptures apply?\n– Born of a Virgin\n– Born in Bethlehem – He will come out of Bethlehem and be called Mighty God, Everelasting Father, Prince of Peace – Micah 5:2\n– Pierced my hands and feet, cast lots for my garments – Psalm 22: 16-18\n– Riding into Jerusalem on a donkey – Zechariah 9:9\n– Daniel’s 70, 7s prophecy (Daniel 9: 24-27) predicted the exact date Jesus would be cut off.\nhttp://www.jesusplusnothing.com/studies/online/Daniel9c.htm\nBest,\n\n","date":"July 22, 2015 at 8:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206346","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah","post":"Re Isaiah 53 and a JEWISH READING OF IT in light of “Yeshua’s Acts”:\nhttps://video-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xft1/v/t42.1790-2/11103290_1000714013279891_1700743330_n.mp4?efg=eyJybHIiOjM4NSwicmxhIjoxMjgwfQ%3D%3D&rl=385&vabr=214&oh=e80a13d8906ebe871d04f74c95951fed&oe=55B62E2A\n\n","date":"July 27, 2015 at 5:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","id":"comment-206655","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"}]
