He has also identified DNA corresponding to a variety of animals, including an extinct type of bird not present in current-day catalogues. However, the most interesting part of his presentation was when he showed the results associated to human DNA. He has identified DNA to human linages from all over the world, although the most abundant is DNA corresponding to prevalent populations from the Arabic peninsula (semitic) and both sides of the Mediterranean. In the slide he showed,  these three major human linages converged in the area of Egypt~Israel~Jordan~Syria.\nSeemingly, he has used DNA from the sticky tapes.\nAnother interesting presentation was the one given by Orit Shamir, from the Israel Department of Antiquities. She is an expert in ancient textiles of the Middle East and clearly ruled out the possibility that the Shroud could have been manufactured in Israel during Roman times. She gave many solid reasons to support that conclusion, all of them based on her expertise on ancient textiles, thus posing a new challenge to those defending its authenticity.\nRegarding the HAL9000 high resolution images, the group of Turin thinks that since they have been taken in a non-continuous way, that is, each photograph only covers a part of the Shroud, the light conditions change and putting together all the partial images would not be realistic. This seems to be one of the reasons not to release these high resolution images.  Their current challenge is to do some sort of continuous scanning of the Shroud that would enable a whole homogeneous analysis of the pixels.\nPaolo di Lazzaro goes on with his research on lasers. A quick look in ScienceDirect indicates that he is author of more than 100 papers on lasers in peer-reviewed indexed JCR journals. Surprisingly enough, most of them are not related to shroud studies whatsoever. In the last years, by fine-tunning the operational conditions of lasers impacting on linens, he has been able to reproduce an increasing number of aspects observable on the Shroud. Whatever, this may mean it is worthwhile to follow his research.\nThe Spanish members of the CES prsented the chemical analysis of the dust they have extracted from the sudarium of Oviedo. The results are truly interesting.\nMarzia Boi has reanalyzed the photographs of pollens corresponding to the STURP period and has clearly identified some major errors on the type of plant they belong to.\nFinally, Jose Luis Rodriguez gave a most interesting presentation on the analysis frame needed for a comprehensive study of the Shroud. He is an independent senior consultant in aviation and has imported some breaking edge methodology used in his field of expertise (the concept of system) to study the Shroud.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2014 at 4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/12/surprising-paper-out-of-bari-plant-dna-studies-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","id":"comment-152013","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Surprising Paper out of Bari: Plant DNA Studies on the Shroud of Turin","post":"One of the biggest gaps in Shroud research has been anyone with any expertise in ancient textiles so it is good that Orit Shamir has become involved. As the Masada and other excavations in burial sites in the Middle East has shown there is a vast amount of material, much of it fragmentary, of course, that needs to related to the the Shroud. So far we only have that stitch! I hope the paper becomes accessible soon.\n\n","date":"September 18, 2014 at 2:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/12/surprising-paper-out-of-bari-plant-dna-studies-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","id":"comment-152135","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Surprising Paper out of Bari: Plant DNA Studies on the Shroud of Turin","post":"A most informative succinct summary of Bari from Gabriel.\n“… Orit Shamir, from the Israel Department of Antiquities.

Again, she ruled out that possibility because the characteristics of textiles from those countries did not fit in at all with those of the Shroud.\nFurthermore, she was asked whether new future findings could change things. She answered that in her view, this was highly unlikely because her institution has conducted in the last years intensive specific field campaings in caves and candidate locations throughout Israel,  and new findings in this field of textiles are highly unlikely.\n\n","date":"September 18, 2014 at 9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/12/surprising-paper-out-of-bari-plant-dna-studies-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","id":"comment-152218","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Surprising Paper out of Bari: Plant DNA Studies on the Shroud of Turin","post":"I would add that Orit’s paper along with Fanti’s first analysis of HUMAN DNA from the Shroud are apportions that may open new research lines in the future\n\n","date":"September 18, 2014 at 9:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/12/surprising-paper-out-of-bari-plant-dna-studies-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","id":"comment-152223","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Surprising Paper out of Bari: Plant DNA Studies on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Were her conclusions corroborated by any other textile experts?\n\n","date":"September 18, 2014 at 9:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/12/surprising-paper-out-of-bari-plant-dna-studies-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","id":"comment-152226","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Surprising Paper out of Bari: Plant DNA Studies on the Shroud of Turin","post":"The linen could have been produced in any number of places, from Gaul to Antioch, and made it’s way to Jerusalem which was a hub or trade and commerce.\nOne thousand years from now, experts may be examining a pair of running shoes that some believe were worn by a man named Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles circa 2014.

The 100 Years War was a series of conflicts between the Houses of Plantagenet rulers of England and of Valois for the kingdom of France from 1337 to 1453.  At this time the dominant producers of linen and of weaving generally were in the Low Countries, particularly Flanders.
