They were equally haunting.”\nYou still don’t get it do you Charles re the TS negative character.? This latest comment demonstrates that beyond a shadow of doubt.\nIt’s not your ancient negatives that had the haunting character.  Odd and unsatisfactory maybe, but not haunting. It’s what you see when you  convert them back to their positives that is remarkable, had you been seeing the final positives for the first time.\nNow trurn that on its head. The TS image is  NOT a positive. It’s a non-photogenic negative. IIt was Secondo Pia’s ‘inversion’ of light/dark that created the haunting image that no one had hitherto suspected was there.\nThe reason for the haunting character of the Secondo Pia character is an entirely different question that has to be discussed separately.   I’ve suggested previously that it’s something to do with the promotion of a lot of initial white space to dark space and vice versa.  That kind of inversion does not occur with ordinary 19th/20th century light-based photography. It’s a result of starting with a negative imprint produced by some kind of pre-photography, maybe thermography (my preference) or as Dan suggests, Rogers’ ‘chemography’. or maybe other kinds of -ography;\nIt’s the subtlety of the TS image , both as-is, and the way it responds to modern technology that should have told you the TS was no ordinary image, certainly not painted. Flaked-off paint? The onus is on you to deal with Occam’s Razor.\n\n","date":"November 9, 2014 at 10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/09/dear-charles-freeman-re-the-famous-arnolfini-portrait-by-van-eyck/","cat":"article","id":"comment-170103","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dear Charles Freeman, re the Famous Arnolfini Portrait by Van Eyck","post":"what are the odds that a13th century person made a completely NEGATIVE image of back and front human crucified body that is photographic quality before photography was invented versus a relic surviving from the first century that shows a crucified man very blurry but when run through newly discovered technology 1900 years latter yields a image that was not apparent to human senses.

There would be no scientific record of all the events it encountered.\nThe Shroud is surely similar , unless you really do believe that it has remained chemically constant throughout several hundred years ( unbelievable I would have thought).

It is not a matter of making a photographic negative and ending up with something that look rather mysterious. If anything it is the other way around. \nCharles, the images on the cloth are negative images. What that means, if your painted image hypothesis is to be thought valid, is that 1) an artist painted a negative image or 2) an artist painted a positive image that as it faded (or is it as the paint flaked off) became a negative image.  There is no evidence that this has ever happened in the history of art. Moreover, option 1 is near impossible to do and option 2 would be a startling scientific phenomenon. Actually if you could explain how option 1 is doable or option 2 is scientifically possible, you might have something. Otherwise, your hypothesis is baseless. Which is it? That is a simple question. \nAgain, some other questions come to mind: In defense of your hypothesis, do you know what Secondo Pia discovered in 1898?  Can you describe the difference between a mirror image and a negative image? Do you have any evidence of a painted grey scale negative image at any time in the history of art?

It seems important to stress this  as there are still people who argue that the Shroud is chemically unchanged from seven hundred, even two thousand years ago,. You then GO ON to look at the depictions of expositions. I use the Tempesta  1613 engraving as my first example, partly because we know from his meticulous view of Rome in 1593  that he was very accurate and partly because he was resident for some time in the royal court in Turin and it seems clear that he saw the Shroud on several occasions. It is not just the images are much stronger (as they need to be if you are going to get crowds to come and see the expositions ( now with the faded cloth you have to get up close to see anything)) , it is that you can see features you can no longer see, the Crown of Thorns on front and back of the head, the long hair at the back, the gap between the elbows and the body of the back image( showing that the crossed hands are impossible if this  is the same body) , the loincloth ( after 1578).\nAs I then note this is only one of perhaps fifty depictions of expositions . As they are made by different artists at different times , largely between 1578 and 1750 when – probably because the images were beginning to fade so large scale expositions are not so impressive- they diminish in number.\nYou then need to work on a data base. For instance from the Royal Savoy catalogue depictions of 1998, I have taken thirty photocopies and every one shows the loincloth in place and it seems to be the same loincloth recorded by different artists. A lot of the depictions show thumbs on the hands. As I argue in my article and would repeat here, we desperately need to do what should have been done years ago and create a data base of all the depictions so that we can confirm what features there were one on the Shroud but which now can no longer be seen. What is without doubt is that the images were stronger, they contained features no longer there, and that the bloodstains were in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the features that stood out.\nN.B. Contributors here have talked of paint flaking off. No, these were medieval ground pigments and they would have been in small particles. This is why the disintegration of the paint would have been very different from modern oil- based paint that, as we all know, does tend to flake off.\nNo one can possibly say that I don’t put out my arguments clearly and that I concentrate on hard evidence. But as my article says all I need to say( although you need the print edition of History Today to see how the flow of blood on the Shroud matches the Holkham Bible) and I have now provided the footnotes at charlesfreemanuk.tumblr.com, I think I can leave everyone , on this site and on others to get on with it! No one has any excuses for not knowing what my arguments are so I do not need to repeat them further. Phew!\n(Well unless Dan wants to keep things going through further postings but I have done my best to respond to everything he has posted ( and that is my privilege) and I don’t think he can expect anything more- the article and the footnotes are there for all to see!)\n\n","date":"November 10, 2014 at 2:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/09/dear-charles-freeman-re-the-famous-arnolfini-portrait-by-van-eyck/","cat":"article","id":"comment-170298","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dear Charles Freeman, re the Famous Arnolfini Portrait by Van Eyck","post":"So I’ve looked at the references in your article Charles.\nThey refer to the prominence of the bloodstains.

You can also use more accurate tools to correct the basic image of rubbing. A pad, for example. You can also use a technic of successive fine veilings, as Leonardo sfumato and the Dutch painters of the 14th century. The result will be a very modulate patina. The “pompiers” in France were masters in that effect, although they were horrific painters.\nSome drawings with these technics (rubbing) are been made and they have similar properties than the Shroud. The main objection is that they were bad fixed to the cloth and would be erased with the folded. Nevertheless, Charles has shown how some painted clothes in the Middle Age were used as banners or liturgical objects without problem. This problem is overcome if we consider the possibility that the Shroud was retouched, as it seem be the case of that of Besançon.\n\n","date":"November 10, 2014 at 2:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/09/dear-charles-freeman-re-the-famous-arnolfini-portrait-by-van-eyck/","cat":"article","id":"comment-170296","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dear Charles Freeman, re the Famous Arnolfini Portrait by Van Eyck","post":"Note too the painted side wound is still very apparent in the Lier 1516 copy as well as the “poker holes”\nSo the paint on the body image could fade away but not the paint on the side wound, or the poker holes….\nhttp://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/The_Lier_Shroud_and_Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder.html\n\n","date":"November 10, 2014 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/09/dear-charles-freeman-re-the-famous-arnolfini-portrait-by-van-eyck/","cat":"article","id":"comment-170309","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dear Charles Freeman, re the Famous Arnolfini Portrait by Van Eyck","post":"Colin – great point!\n\n","date":"November 10, 2014 at 3:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/09/dear-charles-freeman-re-the-famous-arnolfini-portrait-by-van-eyck/","cat":"article","id":"comment-170317","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Dear Charles Freeman, re the Famous Arnolfini Portrait by Van Eyck","post":"Colin what’s your view on the 1518 / 1568 depictions:\n1.

There’s been exposure to water of course, but that was limited mainly to a single ingress, given the repeating pattern across the fabric. There’s the 1532 fire, but Adler, Rogers and others were resourceful in looking closely at the encroachment of scorch areas onto blood etc to seek evidence for known artists’ pigments, and could find none, bar a few adventitious flecks, probably from elsewhere.. \n Apart from occasional displays it’s also been protected from sunlight and its bleaching uv component too for most of its history, being housed in reliquaries etc.\nThe degradation of paint pigments. like any other chemical reaction, has an energy hump to overcome, the so-called Arrhenius energy of activation. Take away the sources of that energy – radiant, chemical, biological etc.- then there’s no a priori basis on which to assume fading as a matter of course. Tut’s tomb  with all those bright murals etc  preserved in the dark interior of the Pyramids with dry desert air should serve as proof of that.
