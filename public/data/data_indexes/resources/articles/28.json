There would a tendency of flour to stick to the highest part of a wettened farbric anyway, since once wet it will tend to stay put and not migrate into the weave.

The subject is dusted with flour, wet linen is draped over and manually moulded to contours, transferring most of the flour to the linen. The fabric with its negative flour imprint is then placed briefly in a hot oven to convert the flour to a brown pigment. The linen is then washed in soap and water, leaving a final faint yellow fuzzy imprint.

predigested with HCl)…\nIn any case he (= Dr. Adler) underlined that these objects\nwere found predominantly only in the scorched blood areas\nand in waterstain margins.\nThe combustion of blood is

wrote about “Mc Crone’s tunnel vision” and the mis-identification: “iron oxide as the chromophore” I was able\nto solve the simple problem.\n>In other words: the use of diimide can be understood

destroy your proof you cannot win …\n>This was the point to consider.\n>Probably they (= “STURP”) had feared iron’s oxides presence.\n>Then I hope you want to pardon my previous waste of time with useless discussion.\n>Am I wrong in my conclusion?\n… etc., etc. …\n>Try to treat a cloth with particles of rust and\nthen try to use NaClO in order to show what happens (at different pH)…\n>And also I think you can adequately distribute rust particles in order\nto make pinholes in a cloth…\n… etc., etc. …\n— — —\n>In Industrial works the bleaching equipment\nshould be made of stainless steel, to

My point is that the word ‘scientist’ can be used as term of adulation or abuse somewhat indiscriminately, and has come to mean virtually nothing. Scientist is what scientist does in, my opinion, and although even Colin would admit that to a layman, a bloke in a kitchen smearing flour on his face seems very different from a bloke in a university laboratory with a squillion-volt laser, it seems that both these gentlemen have achieved a discolouration of the upper fibrils of a cloth which at least visually, even under a microscope, has many of the characteristics of the Shroud. Daveb’s gentle ribbing of Colin’s work by saying that there is no idea so preposterous that some scientist doesn’t promote it is fair enough, but we must remember that this swings both ways. John Jackson has impeccable scientific credentials, but his current attempts at explaining the ‘fall through’ hypothesis make Colin’s experiments appear the very essence of respectability.\nBob Brockie, who ought to have known better, made the popular journalist error of describing anyone who uses the words ‘quantum’, ‘hologram, or even ‘UFO’ as, by definition a scientist.

A paper entitled ‘The Event Horizon of the Shroud of Turin’ on shroud3d.com shows no understanding of particle physics or quantum theory, or even of the meaning of event horizon.” I have had no reason to change this since.

How was the cloth sensitized to scorch superficially in those parts closest to the hot skeleton? Check my 5 or 6 previous posts and you will find one possible method, using linen that had been lightly coated with charcoal slurry (maybe starch and/or simple sugars too) and then dried. The charcoal acts as a thermosensitizer, absorbing heat rays (infrared), producing a light tanning effect on the part of the cloth in immediate contact with the charcoal. The chemistry might involve caramelisation, or a carbohydrate/protein reaction to form Maillard reaction products). The latter can be washed out later, leaving just the sepia “stencil” and  the bemused (overawed) medieval religious pilgrim with no clue as how it was produced. It’s a process that I have dubbed thermo-stencilling.\nAlternatively, the cloth may simply have been impregnated with lemon juice or similar, relying on the old “invisible writing” trick we used to so as children with paper, lemon juice, a pen nib and a hot clothes iron.\n It was totally in the context of my first “scorch at a distance” model, one I called thermostencilling. \nTo suggest that the current role seen for Maillard reactions in my latest flour-imprinting model is derivative of someone else’s model, presumably Rogers’, though not specifically named, is simply not borne out by the facts. In fact it’s downright ludicrous, since my model depends on elevated temperatures of 200 degrees C and higher that are only relevant in the proposed scenario of a medieval modelling of an aged sweat imprint.\n I think a retraction is in order. If it stands, in spite of this corrective, then it’s yet another attack on both character and professionalism, albeit not quite as serious as a previous one from the same individual, having once accused me on this site of selecting/ distorting/ ignoring data that were inconvenient to my case. I seem to recall David Goulet coming to my defence, deploying the T word (and quite rightly so).\nWheat flour and Maillard reactions are both topics close to this investigator’s heart, having spent 12 years at the UK’s Flour Milling and Baking Research Association, first as Head of Biochemistry in the Nutrition and Toxicology Section (Principal Scientific Officer Grade), and later appointed to the new post of  Head of Nutrition and Food Safety.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2015 at 8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208487","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud","post":"I’ve been following your experiments daily. \nFor 2.5 years you’ve been directly scorching linen with a hot template, eventually bragging about having cracked the mystery.

I’ve tried my hardest to be restrained in my comments re Ray Rogers (RIP)  but the charge of Rogers-bashing keeps popping up on this site again and again, and is apparenty the reason why a particular troll is still allowed to make attacks on my character and professionalism.  Time then to take the gloves off re Raymond N. Rogers RIP and tell a few home truths about his professionalism, or rather lack thereof.\nChemistry is an exact science, based on a precise nomenclature. When one says “starch” one means the macromolecular form of polymeric glucose, whether linear (amylose) or branched (amylopectin). When one refers to “crude starch” it is taken by a chemist to mean starch and some unspecified non-starch impurities. When one refers to “starch fractions” it could mean anything, unless specified.  When one tests a “starch impurity” coating hypothesis using commercial dextrins, one is not testing starch but sugary fragments of starch produced under laboratory conditions, like exposure to strong acids or enzymes, something that does not occur in nature, except by action of yeasts and other microorganisms. When one refers to “reducing sugars” , especially if starch-derived, one has to demonstrate that starch has been degraded, with enzymes or acids. Fail to do that, and one is being totally unscientific.\nRaymond N. Rogers, chemical explosives expert, used the terms starch, crude starch, starch fractions, dextrins and reducing sugars INTERCHANGEABLY when attempting to promote his Maillard hypothesis. That was a travesty of chemistry, and a TOTAL ABUSE of chemical nomenclature. I realized as much within a week or two of entering Shroud research, but have tried to avoid criticizing “someone no longer around to defend himself”.\nSorry, but as I say, the gloves are now off, thanks to the persistemt trolling on this site. linked to those whom I regard as romanticizing Rogers “groupies”.\nWhen Rogers signed up to STURP he went ‘out of area’. He was a fine explosives chemist, of that I have no doubt. But he was a lousy carbohydrate chemist, and essentially misdirected Shroud research. His baleful influence can be seen and felt to this day, thanks to his misguided pro-authenticity fan club employing their troll tactics. They frankly do not understand the basics of carbohydrate chemistry, being even more ignorant – or blissfully indifferent –  than Raymond N.Rogers. \nThis blogger put a hitherto barely recognized form of starch – so called “resistant starch” – now acknowledged as valuable man-made “dietary fibre” – on the map with a highly cited single-author paper. The attempts by a handful of trolls, one in particular, to undermine his research credentials will not work. All these trolls do is to display their ignorance and delusions of adequacy.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2015 at 12:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208508","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud","post":"Maillard is not the answer.

Some of us even dare to call ourselves “applied scientists”.  My own training did happen to include the basic sciences, which then advanced to various studies of assorted materials, the analysis of structures, some four years of fluid flow and hydraulics, and various branches of mathematics which your run of the mill scientist is unlikely to have heard of.  There’s also the business of learning how to apply all this useful knowledge in a productive manner, how to design and put things together.  Of course that’s only the core stuff, and one grows in one’s own chosen profession according to one’s own particular calling.

I don’t hold a PhD and as a matter of fact, I only have 6 graduate credits toward my Master’s Degree.  I had to drop out of the graduate program when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, followed by my father’s liver cancer. \nYet, I’ve achieved quite a bit for someone who didn’t have a PhD, like Colin or you.  I was in line for another patent on a neuromuscular blocking drug, but our company was sold, prior to patent issue.  That really hurt, since I had worked on that particular compound for such a long period of time, in an effort to reduce the duration of the drug.\nAlthough Colin’s experiments may seem ridiculous to a person not familiar with scientific technique, all avenues leading to image formation on the Shroud must be explored and for this reason alone, I  give credit to and appreciate the effort Colin Berry has expended, referencing his research methodology.\nI may be incorrect, but I seem to recall either a documentary or a DVD on the “Event Horizon” that introduced Isabel Piczek as both an artist and a particle physicist.\nWhen I posted this information on an Amazon atheist site, in defence of the Shroud and Jesus, as God, all the scientists on that forum informed me Isabel Piczek was not a physicist, since they had thoroughly researched her background.  As well these scientists asked me to link them to Isabel’s university credentials.  I couldn’t find that specific information on the internet.\nThose scientists, who are atheists, can be extremely brutal at times and even today, they not only refer to the Shroud as the MIT (Magic Italian Tablecloth)  but they trumpeti the work of Garlaschelli.  And since they don’t believe Jesus existed at all (there’s no historical record) they have come to the conclusion the entire biblical story was merely fantasy.\nIt’s hurtful for a true believer to read such negative comments, concerning Jesus.  For this reason I am hoping scientists will either find some archaeological evidence for His existence or perform a novel type of scientific test on the Shroud that proves, without a doubt, the linen cloth dates to the first century.\nRegarding non-scientists, my belief is anyone is capable of presenting an hypothesis that eventually proves fruitful, in respect to the image on the Shroud.  It really matters not whether he or she is a scientist or not.  :)\n\n","date":"August 18, 2015 at 11:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208502","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud","post":"Angel:\nLa historicidad de Jesús está ampliamente demostrada y sólo  razones “oscuras” explicarían la negativa de algunos historiadores a aceptarla.\nVeamos cuáles son la totalidad de los escritos “originales”del siglo I d.C que nos ha legado la Imperial Roma (a excepción de los de Filón)\nDe los años 30 y 40 d.C:\n– Una historia de Roma por Vellius Paterculus, un oficial retirado del ejército de Tiberio.

Guste o no guste.\nSus adversarios confunden y mezclan en grado extremo el concepto de “ser histórico” con “cuántos datos históricos tengamos sobre ese ser”, que son bastante pocos, aunque desde luego bastantes más que infinitud de “otros personajes históricos” de los que tan sólo se conserva el nombre.\nLos intentos de atacar esta “historicidad” como “ser o personaje” se observa ya tan sólo en círculos de pensamiento ateo.\n-FUENTES NO CRISTIANAS\n1.-La primera información independiente proviene del judío acomodaticio, colaborador romano e historiador José Ben Matías, conocido como Josefo.\nVivió aproximadamente unos 60 años (del 37 d.C al 100 d.C). Fue protegido de los emperadores romanos Flavios, Vespasiano y sus hijos Tito y Domiciano.\nEn “Antigüedades Judías”, Josefo narra cómo el Sumo Sacerdote Anano el Joven, aprovechando que tras la muerte del Procurador Romano Facio, su sucesor Albino en el año 62 todavía no había llegado a Palestina, decidió deshacerse de algunos de sus enemigos\nAntiquitates judaicae 2O, 2OO.\n“Siendo Anán de este carácter, aprovechándose de la oportunidad, pues Festo había fallecido y Albino todavía estaba en camino, reunió al sanedrín. Llamó a juicio al hermano de Jesús, llamado Cristo; su nombre era Santiago, y con él hizo comparecer a varios otros. Los acusó de ser infractores de la Ley y los condenó a ser apedreados. Pero los habitantes de la ciudad más moderados y afectos a la Ley, se indignaron”.\nEstos hechos los narra Josefo para indicar que Anano fue destituído porque había ordenado la ejecución ilegalmente sin el consentimiento del Procurador Romano.\nSiendo Jesús un nombre comúnmente usado por los judíos, es muy probable que el historiador Josefo al referirse a Santiago decidiera identificarlo mejor añadiendo que era hermano del Jesús llamado Mesías.\n2.-La segunda información independiente sobre Jesús, proviene del historiador romano Publio Cornelio Tácito, en sus “Anales” (XV, 44), quien vivió del año 52 al 118 .\nTácito describe cómo Nerón culpó a los cristianos del incendio de Roma, ya que el rumor público se lo achacaba al mismo emperador: \n“Para acallar el rumor, Nerón creó chivos expiatorios y sometió a torturas más refinadas a aquellos que el vulgo llamaba cristianos, odiados por sus abominables crímenes. Su nombre proviene de Cristo, quien bajo el reinado de Tiberio, fue ejecutado por el procurador Poncio Pilato. Sofocada momentáneamente, la nociva superstición se extendió de nuevo no sólo en Judea, la tierra que originó este mal, sino también en la ciudad de Roma, donde convergen y se cultivan fervorosamente prácticas horrendas y vergonzosas de todas clases y de todas partes del mundo”.\n3.-La tercera información independiente proviene de Suetonio, otro historiados romano, comentó sobre el reinado de Claudio (41-54 de nuestra era):\n“Debido a que los judíos en Roma constantemente causaban disturbios por instigación de Cresto, él [Claudio] los expulsó de la ciudad”. Incidentalmente, Hechos 18:2 describe cómo una pareja de judíos llamados Aquila y Priscila tuvieron que salir de Roma debido a la persecución de los judíos.\n“Cresto” es otra forma de escribir “Cristo”\nLa confusión Khrestus por Khristos está atestiguada.\nTertuliano (160-220 d.C), dice que los gobernantes romanos pronunciaban erróneamente chrestianus por christianus (Apologético 3).\nDespués Suetonio comenta acerca de la persecución de los cristianos en el reinado de Nerón:\n“Después del gran incendio de Roma… también se aplicaron castigos a los cristianos, una secta que profesaba una creencia nueva y malévola”. Esta referencia a la existencia de un grupo llamados “cristianos” en el primer siglo sugiere que una persona llamada “Cristo” existió a comienzos de ese siglo.\n4.- Otras fuentes:\na.-Plinio el Joven, en una carta del año 111 ó 112 al emperador Trajano (carta XCVII), explica (en el marco del maltrato hacia los cristianos) que “en presencia mía… (algunos cristianos arrepentidos) han lanzado imprecaciones contra Cristo… Decían que todo su error se limitaba a… (reunirse y cantar himnos) en honor de Cristo, como si fuese Dios.” “Cartas de Plinio” traducido al inglés por W. Melmoth, Vol 2, X:96).\nb.- Luciano de Samosata (125-192) escribió en “La muerte de Peregrino” 11-13, “de aquel hombre a quien siguen adorando, que fue crucificado en Palestina por haber introducido esta nueva religión”, la de los cristianos, cuyo “primer legislador les convenció de que todos eran hermanos…, y adoran a aquel sofista crucificado y viven de acuerdo a sus preceptos.””Las Obras de Luciano”, Vol. 4, traducción de Fowler y Fowler).\nc.-. El Talmud, en Sanedrín 43a se refiere a la muerte de Jesús. Es aceptado que esta parte del Talmud data del primer período de la compilación de ese libro (es decir, en los años 70 a 200 de nuestra era):\n“En la víspera de la pascua Yeshu [Jesús] fue colgado. Durante 40 días antes de que se realizara la ejecución, un heraldo proclamó: ‘Él va a ser apedreado porque ha practicado la brujería y ha incitado a Israel a que apostatara. Cualquiera que pueda decir algo a su favor, que pase adelante en su defensa’. Pero en vista de que nada se presentó en su favor, fue colgado en la víspera de la pascua”.\nEl mismo tratado del Talmud da otra noticia: “Nuestros rabinos enseñan: que la mano izquierda rechace, pero la derecha atraiga siempre, no como Eliseo, que rechazó a Gejazí con ambas manos, y no como Rabí Yoshua ben Perahjah, que rechazó a Jesús (el Nazareno) con ambas manos” (T.B. Sanh 107b). \nEstas dos noticias del Talmud se pueden considerar tannaíticas, esto es, anteriores a la Misná y son importantes desde el punto de vista histórico, pues dan por probada la existencia de Jesús, aunque interpreten su actividad como obra de magia y su misión como la de un seductor y agitador\nEl Sanedrín 43a también describe cómo cinco discípulos de Jesús fueron sentenciados a muerte, mostrando de nuevo que los judíos habían creído tradicionalmente en la existencia del Jesús histórico. En Sanedrín 106b incluso dice que Jesús tenía 33 años cuando murió; exactamente como lo requiere el Nuevo Testamento. Maier (“First Easter”, pgs. 117,118) cita del documento judío del siglo V, “Toledoth Jesu”, que afirma que los discípulos trataron de robar el cuerpo de Jesús después de su muerte, pero que un jardinero llamado Judá se enteró de sus planes y trasladó el cuerpo de Jesús a otra parte entregándolo después a los judíos. Entre ellos, estos puntos de evidencia muestran que los judíos de los primeros siglos de nuestra era creían en la existencia y muerte violenta del Jesús histórico.\nSon sus adversarios los que comentan algo respecto de Jesús. Esto es muy significativo porque no son los amigos los que hablan, sino los adversarios. Esto quiere decir que de alguna manera se tiene en cuenta la persona, y no tiene caso iniciar un debate sobre una persona que se sabe jamás ha existido. Al hacer pues un debate, un comentario supone pues la existencia de Jesús.\nd.- “Testimonium Flavianum”.Antiquitates judaicae,18, 63 – 64\nSe ha conservado en cuatro versiones diferentes:\n-griega (Historia Eclesiástica de Eusebio de Cesarea)\n-latina (De Viris Illustribus de San Jerónimo)\n-árabe (Historia Universal de Agapios, s. X)\n-siríaca (Crónica Siríaca de Miguel el Sirio, s. XII).\nEl texto en columnas paralelas puede verse en A. Paul, Intertestament (Cahiers Évangile, 14), París 1975, 22-23; hay traducción castellana: Cuadernos de Evangelio, 12, Estella (Navarra); cf. también H. Lichtenberger, “Josephus über Johannes den Täufer, Jesus und Jakobus”, Bibel und Kirche 53 (1998) 67-71 donde el autor indica las expresiones de este texto que no pueden proceder de un interpolador cristiano, las que no pueden ser de Flavio Josefo y las expresiones neutrales que pueden provenir ya de Flavio Josefo ya de un interpolador.\n“Por aquel tiempo existió un hombre sabio, llamado Jesús, si es lícito llamarlo hombre; porque realizó grandes milagros y fue maestro de aquellos hombres que aceptan con placer la verdad. Atrajo a muchos judíos y muchos gentiles. Era el Cristo. Delatado por los príncipes responsables de entre los nuestros, Pilatos lo condenó a la crucifixión. Aquellos que antes lo habían amado no dejaron de hacerlo, porque se les apareció al tercer día de nuevo vivo: los profetas habían anunciado éste y mil otros hechos maravillosos acerca de él. Desde entonces hasta la actualidad existe la agrupación de los cristianos que de él toma nombre”.\nEste celebérrimo texto es conocido como el “Testimonium Flavianum”.Como se ve, el párrafo parece una confesión de fe cristiana, pues contiene la explícita aceptación de que Jesús “era el Cristo” y la afirmación casi tan expresa de su resurrección.\nPero Josefo no era ciertamente un cristiano, tal como se desprende del conjunto de su obra y de la precisa puntualización de Orígenes (185 – 253), según el cual el escritor judío no creía en el mesianismo de Jesús.\nEn los últimos años se multiplican los intentos por rehacer un texto originario de Josefo que sea neutral respecto a Jesús. Recientemente P. Winter y G. Vermés.\nEl texto así reconstruído vino a coincidir significativamente con una versión árabe del Testimonium Flavianum que Agapio, obispo de Hierápolis , siglo X, cita en su historia universal cristiana. Este texto fue alegado por primera vez en el debate sobre el Testimonium el año 1971, por el autor judío S. Pines (An arabic Version of the Testimonium Flavianum and its Implications,Jerusalem ,1971).\nDice así:\n“Josefo refiere que por aquel tiempo existió un hombre sabio que se llamaba Jesús. Su conducta era buena y era famoso por su virtud. Y muchos de entre los hebreos y de otras naciones se hicieron discípulos suyos. Pilato lo condenó a ser crucificado y a morir. Pero los que se habían hecho discípulos suyos no abandonaron su discipulado. Ellos contaron que se les había aparecido tres días después de su crucifixión y que estaba vivo; quizá, por esto, era el Mesías, del que los profetas contaron maravillas”.\nSalta a la vista la sobriedad de esta versión árabe, en la que faltan justamente las expresiones del texto griego que la simple crítica interna tendía ya de por sí a eliminar. Las afirmaciones “cristológicas” que permanecen son puestas en labios de los discípulos (“contaron…”), dejando de ser una afirmación directa de Josefo .\nFUENTES CRISTIANAS\nLos denominados como Evangelios Canónico, Evangelios Apócrifos, Cartas, Epístolas etc,etc,etc\nCarlos\n\n","date":"August 18, 2015 at 1:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208512","author":"Carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud","post":"Gracias, Carlos.\nBack in the 50s and 60s, I was able to speak and write spanish fluently, but I have been away from it for too many decades and, as a result, I have forgotten many words.

Yet the fact remains most eyewitness accounts of the same event often contain variances, so that 4 writings that did not conflict at all would be unbelievable.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2015 at 6:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208530","author":"Dcn Andy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud","post":"Louis says:\n “Although most people are unaware of it… in all probability this extra-biblical evidence not only provides evidence of Jesus’ existence, but, as I shall try to show, includes a number of salient facts about his life that confirm the basic outlines of the four canonical Gospels.”\n For more on biblical studies:\n https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about\n***Angel says:  Thanks, Louis.\nI was including what was being disputed by atheists.

Ehrman is a noted NT scholar at North Carolina University.  He became an evangelical Christian in his teenage years, but like many scholarly evangelicals abandoned his belief to become an agnostic.  Nevertheless I believe he makes an excellent case, even though I found fault with a few of his arguments.  I’ve noted that Louis tends to be somewhat dismissive of Ehrman, but B.E. still has the advantage of reputation, being a noted NT scholar, and I consider several of his arguments quite sound.\n\n","date":"August 19, 2015 at 3:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208586","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud","post":"Hi Angel\nI have been a Religion Writer for around twenty years, interviewing some world-renowned biblical scholars, reviewing dozens of books, writing articles, making on-site research into various religions and sects (some with weird rituals) and so on and can tell you something about what I could gather during this time.\nBart Ehrman came from a fundamentalist evangelical background, so one must presume that he believed that when it came to the Bible, “Everything is true or nothing is true.” There are many cases where fundamentalists become agnostics, atheists and even anti-Christian when they realise they are wrong.\nEhrman made some interesting points in his studies, but was wrong in considering that almost everything could be questioned. He did not take the oral tradition into consideration and his mistake was his inability to distinguish Bible from Scripture (as understood by all Christian denominations today). \nI could tell you much more, but suffice it to say that Ehrman does not even figure in a 1000+ page book on Jesus, where there are essays by prominent biblical scholars, which I will be reviewing.\nThere this really no need to read what the atheists say, as most of them, while not believing in Jesus’ divinity, do acknowledge his existence.

As one of the yahoo comments stated, engineers supply what nature has not provided.  But in those cases, we bend nature to our will!
