[{"title":"Happy Passover","post":"Very many years ago when our family was still growing up, we often joined with other Catholic families in our neighbourhood to observe the Haggadah ritual and afterwards share the Seder meal during the week before the Easter weekend. I think it was during the time that the “Christian Family Movement” founded by Cardinal Cardijn was active in our parish.  Nowadays other groups such as the “Passionist Family Group Movement” seem to have replaced the CFM movement. I think that some of these groups still sometimes observe the practice. \nOne of the priests sometimes brought along the unleavened bread usually supplied by the Wellington Jewish community. I remember the bitter herbs and the other set accompaniments of the meal. The young children would ask the set questions and an adult would give the replies.  \nAt the Holy Saturday Vigil Mass this year, I shall be delivering the compulsory Exodus 14:15-15:1 reading to the congregation.\n\n","date":"April 14, 2014 at 3:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/14/happy-passover/","cat":"article","id":"comment-99129","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
