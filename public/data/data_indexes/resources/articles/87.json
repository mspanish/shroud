He says that he now knows what would be required to do so and it seems beyond the bounds of possibility. So might it be that we can call it a day for radiation as a cause of the image?  If so this would be scientifically important.\n2) Some people talk as if the images were caused by the Resurrection but the images are not of Christ going through a Resurrection-they are pre-Resurrection images.\n3) If there is human blood on the Shroud, where does this fit in with the images, radiated or otherwise? What is the best thinking of when the blood came onto the Shroud, before or after the images? obviously the blood cannot be the result of radiation so how can it be separated out from the rest?\n4) Where does the funding for all this work come from? it seems to have taken up a lot of resources at a prestigious laboratory- or perhaps it is after hours work.\n\n","date":"August 13, 2015 at 8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/11/tantalizingly-close-enough/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208148","author":"Lyfe","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tantalizingly Close Enough?","post":"These are only some of the questions awaiting responses,and we can only speculate.

All he has been attempting over the last eight years or so is to reproduce a surface degradation of linen similar to that apparently observed on the Shroud, by means of electromagnetic radiation. Infra-red radiation (heat) could produce the right colour, but the heat generated within the fibres by the effects of the radiation damaged the threads in a dissimilar way to the Shroud. Radiation at 10.6 micrometres having failed to produce the desired outcome, radiation at 0.3 micrometres, and then 0.2 micrometres was tried instead, generated by an XeCl and an ArF laser respectively, of which the first was found less satisfactory than the second.\nThe problem is a little like cooking a rare steak, when a very high temperature is required for a very short time, in order to brown the surface without overcooking the inside. Very hot, very fast, is the answer, but even with the ArF laser, if the pulse was short, insufficient energy was transferred, but if the pulse was long, the penetration of the cloth was too deep. The answer was to deliver a series of very short pulses (200 pulses at 11 nanoseconds long, for example). Appropriate degradation was achieved by a total reception of about 26 J/cm2, which requires an intensity of about 10MW per pulse. Even so, some aspects of the colour and penetration of the Shroud image were not duplicated, and require further experimentation.\n1) Di Lazzaro’s experiments never extended to more than few square centimetres, and no attempt was made to reproduce any aspect of the image per se. To do so would either take a very long time or a great many more lasers, or a process unknown to science, or a process unknowable to science – a miracle. Scientists do not engage in the last, and the second last is very much a fringe pursuit.\n2) The image on the Shroud is that of a man in repose. To what extent it reflects the process of Resurrection is beyond any current knowledge, either scientific or theological.\n3) If it were ever established that the linen of the Shroud within the boundary of a bloodstain, was degraded in the same way as the image outside the bloodstain, there would be a strong presumption that the blood was added after the image and the Shroud was the product of artifice. This has not been established. However the evidence that the blood was added before the image is not particularly strong either. Nor has di Lazzaro or any other of the radiation hypothesists carried out experiments on blood to determine its effect. One might surmise that a series of powerful laser pulses sufficient to ‘scorch’ cloth would create an observable alteration to a bloodstain.\n4) All these experiments could be carried out within a graduate or postgraduate study programme without incurring any extra expense.\n\n","date":"August 13, 2015 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/11/tantalizingly-close-enough/","cat":"article","id":"comment-208166","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tantalizingly Close Enough?","post":"Thanks, Hugh and Louis. It will be interesting to follow up more on Dr.Lazzaro. Not sure I am up to church politics on this one though. What does Di Lazzaro want to do that the Church does not want him to do? Can’t he just get on with his experiments even if they haven’t created anything positive  so far- they don’t seem to need access to the Shroud itself. Will need to get on with the reading to find out.\nIf the apostle Paul is right, that the Resurrection was the transformation of Christ’s physical body into a spiritual body, then the Shroud does not show that but something before that. So I presume the images could not have been from a source of  energy created by the body as it was being changed into a spiritual form as they would not have come out in the static form we have now. They would have shown something of the life that the apostles saw.\nWill get reading.
