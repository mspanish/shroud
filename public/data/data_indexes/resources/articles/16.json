I suspect my arms are shorter than average, they’re certainly shorter than my wife’s, (but then she does a lot of hugging) and I can manage the  position OK.  I also suspect that the corpse would not have been lying flat.  Rigor mortis would have set in (so much for being relaxed!) and this would have been from the crucified position, pretty much as demonstrated by the models above.  Maybe Stephen Wagner has never attended the laying out of a corpse and so doesn’t know as much as he thinks he does.  But Nicodemus and Joseph of Aramathea, being members of the Sanhedrin, would have understood the business well.    “Painted by an artist” Ha! What does he know??\n\n","date":"April 2, 2012 at 6:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/02/a-silly-why-the-shroud-of-turin-is-fake-article/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9858","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Silly “Why the Shroud of Turin is Fake” Article","post":"Dave, I believe “from close scrutiny of the body image and renditions as shown above” plus from measurements and angles taken by several scholistic studies, there IS slight deformation present; as the shoulders seem to have been dislocated when brought down in their rigor state, actually seeming to make the arms longer. Furthermore, taking in all aspects of the body posture; it shows a most typical position expected of one whom was crucified and entered rigor while still in the death position. One needs only draw a line horizontally across the rendition above and then turn the picture to the vertical to see this. It also shows details such as; there must have been a footrest used; showing from the angles of the feet, amongst other things. Anyways the position shown on the Shroud is easily attained if all aspects of the posture are recognised. Unfortunately many do not seem to have the capacity to see this.\nRon\n\n","date":"April 5, 2012 at 9:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/02/a-silly-why-the-shroud-of-turin-is-fake-article/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9974","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Silly “Why the Shroud of Turin is Fake” Article","post":"I’m with you Dan, it baffles me also that people are STILL making idiotic claims as in the article above.

Shoulder dislocation can happen fairly easily.  I remember my poor old Dad (RIP) when in his 80s incurred a dislocated shoulder simply by slipping and falling while gardening; The surgeons were able to reset it right fairly easily  This Stephen Wagner chap is evidently unaware that any laying out team needs some fairly vigorous action when working with a corpse in rigor mortis, and any talk of a corpse being relaxed is nonsense.\n\n","date":"April 5, 2012 at 5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/02/a-silly-why-the-shroud-of-turin-is-fake-article/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-9993","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Silly “Why the Shroud of Turin is Fake” Article","post":"You are an idiot.
