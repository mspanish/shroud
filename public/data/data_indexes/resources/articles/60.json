Schauf for the Prosecution: The Trial of the Shroud","post":"It’s fun, but, as any such reconstruction by one or other of the chief attorneys must almost inevitably be, it’s hopelessly biased. The article begins with that famous quotation from Walsh that is so simplistic as to be fatuous. “Either the most awesome and instructive relic … or one of the most ingenious, most unbeleivably clever products of the human mind … there is no middle ground.” This is transparent nonsense, and, while attempting from the start to prejudice the impartial reader in favour of the shroud, predudices me in exactly the other direction.\nSadly (and of course a realistic ‘transcript’ would be far too long to include in a magazine article) we cannot read of the examination, and cross examination, of the witnesses. We hear that “experts” have established the journey of the Shroud from 1st century Jerusalem to 21st century Turin, but we do not read how they established it, or how the defence attorney queried it. We hear Zugibe’s, Piczek’s, Marino and Benford’s and Rogers’s evidence, but we do not hear how they responded to cross-examination. We even read that the radiocarbon dating was “likely fraudulent” without any evidence at all.\nBut Shauf’s biggest error (and being a lawyer he may have made it deliberately) was to make the defence speech exactly the opposite of what he said it had to be at the beginning, namely an attempt to demonstrate how the shroud was made. He explains on on the first page that “the prosecution … must establish the defendant’s guilt … beyond reasonable doubt.” It is therefore quite unnecessary for the defence to attempt to provide alternative explanations, and the list Shauf presents is both incomplete and over-simplistic. If I were defending the putative thief, I would not bother with them at all. I certainly would not attempt to prove that one or other of them was the truth. But I would convince the jury that not a single one of the pages of evidence supporting the authenticity of the shroud was proof beyond reasonable doubt, and although many of them would instinctively think I was wrong, my client would walk free!\n\n","date":"April 8, 2014 at 7:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/08/lawrence-e-schauf-for-the-prosecution-the-trial-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-97610","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Lawrence E.

However, what is really wrongheaded about article is that there is no need to decide whether or not the Shroud is authentic.

The hymn is interpolated into the ‘Acts of Judas Thaddeus’ written in Edessa. The hymn tells how a prince the son of a king is divested of his shining robe, and is sent into Egypt to wrest a pearl from a serpent. He succeeds in snatching the pearl from the serpent, he returns home, and his robe now seems to be an image of himself. It is clearly an analogy of Christ sent to redeem humanity from Satan. \n“On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness. And the image of the King of kings Was depicted in full all over it…”  \nIt would therefore seem that Bardaisan had seen the full body image of the Shroud at the time that Bishop Avercius Marcellus, primate of Hieropolis, was sent by Pope Eleutherius to baptize Abgar VIII and his court at Abgar’s request, and given temporary custody of the Shroud from Antioch using it as a kind of visual aid for his mission. Other royal scribes wrote up the incident as an analogy, the ‘Doctrine of Addai’, including it in the royal archives, and relating it to an earlier king Abgar V Ukkama, to conceal its true meaning from the despotic anti-christian emperor Septimius Severus who succeeded the more tolerant emperor Commodus in 193AD, after the baptisms had occurred.    \nIt would seem that the noted Gnostic-Christian Bardaisan considered the Shroud image as authentic enough for him to write his hymn, and it would therefore seem to give the lie to any hypothesis that the Shroud was some kind of synthetic artifact created using some unknown and unspecified process by any Gnostic technologist of the 2nd century.\n\n","date":"April 9, 2014 at 7:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/08/lawrence-e-schauf-for-the-prosecution-the-trial-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-97953","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Lawrence E.

The fact that atheists may use the Shroud to interpret and rationalise the scriptural texts as an explanation of what the women and apostles believed about the resurrection is no argument.  Christians have recourse to the Scriptures to explain their belief, and yet the devil may also quote scripture, check out the Temptation of Jesus in the desert recorded in Matthew. \nI first came across the “Hymn of the Pearl” during the 1980s while studying ‘Ancient Religions’ under Dr Brian Colless of the Religious Studies Dept of Massey University in NZ, and using his own translations of several ancient texts from a variety of sources, Babylonian, Iranian, Phoenician and others. \nDr Colless has a view that the ‘Hymn of the Pearl’ may in fact be Iranian and does not seem to consider the possibility that it is Syriac, that it may even be more Christian than Gnostic, but that may be arguable.  It is not necessarily a view held by other experts in ancient literatures. For example Markwardt cites sources that attribute it to Bardaisan, the notable Christian-Gnostic hymnodist of Edessa during the reign of Abgar VIII.  For the full text of the Colless’ translation of the entire poem, followed by his own particular interpretation as a Christian text see:\nhttp://cryptcracker.blogspot.co.nz/2006/10/hymn-of-pearl-translated-from-syriac.html\n\n","date":"April 10, 2014 at 4:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/08/lawrence-e-schauf-for-the-prosecution-the-trial-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","id":"comment-98047","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Lawrence E.
