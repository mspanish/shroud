Good to have something we can agree on- after all the Oxford lab identified only one cotton fibre in their sample which they were able to remove before the radio- carbon testing. Rogers was misleading in suggesting that there was more than minor contamination , even a reweaving with cotton threads,- especially if he was extrapolating his conclusions to the sample of the Shroud actually tested by Oxford.\nGilbert Raes gave the good explanation that cotton and flax were often woven and spun in the same workshops and this would explain the presence of fibres. After 1200 there were massive imports of raw cotton to Italy and ,through Marseilles, to other parts of Europe, and so the presence of cotton fibres in some of the skeins of yarn, not necessarily all, depending on where the spinning of each skein took place, suggests a medieval date for the drifting in of the fibres.\nThe Cave of the Warrior textiles were woven on ground looms and one of the other textiles found there came from Egypt. At the most we can say the Shroud,if first century, must have been woven on a ground loom, which suggests Egyptian or possibly nomadic Bedouin manufacture- but then you can’t explain why the yarn was not spun in the native way with a S twist. The combination of a ground loom, a three in one herringbone and a Z twist is beyond any probability .\nWhen the Shroud could easily have been woven on a medieval treadle loom ( so the experts tell me), you are scraping the barrel a bit to find some esoteric loom and weaving process that somehow accounts not only for the Shroud itself in the first century but its miraculous preservation( but I suppose if it were a miraculous creation anyway none of this matters.)\n\n","date":"February 15, 2015 at 3:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","id":"comment-191094","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’","post":"“It does not seem to fit the pattern of a medieval provenance”. \nKing, Donald: “Un lino parallelo alla Sindone di Torino”.

If the Shroud is of Middle East or oriental origin, it is unlikely to be medieval.  There is no cotton in the main cloth, Raes found cotton in one of his samples but not the other.  The main weave could not have been carried out in a workshop where there was also cotton present, else there would be more cotton contamination.  The reasonable conclusion would have to be that the cotton has arisen from some subsequent repair.  If Oxford found cotton, they were dealing with a repaired section of the cloth which cannot be considered representative of the whole.  \nAs yet I see no strong argument against a 1st century provenance, regardless of the place of origin, which for all we know might be anywhere, allowing that trade caravans have always been common from ancient times.

It was a contested area even in the fourth century, when relics were first accepted as a legitimate means of worshipping Christ, as it was contested in the iconoclasm era and at the Reformation. The idea of an artefact through which one could access Christ/God is only valid in some Christian traditions and abhorred in others. In the early Christian era it was simply not an issue- these were Jews,of course,in the earliest days. At the  Protestant Reformation they simply burned the lot. So why would they have saved the burial shroud that we do know of course, once existed in the first century?\nThere are, as David Mo points out, immense difficulties in understanding how a linen of this size and weave and Z spin might have been around in Judaea in the first century to be used at short notice to wrap a body. So immense to my mind as to be beyond realistic probability. Even more difficult to understand is how a cloth such as this would have survived in this condition outside an Egyptian tomb. We only have a tiny, tiny proportion of medieval linens surviving  compared to the number we know from inventories to have existed in churches and as wall hangings in home. There is not a single medieval English painted linen still in existence. The trouble was that the painted surface disintegrated all too easily and the linen was thrown away if damp or fire had not got there first. So the problems of keeping a linen in good condition in damp areas for hundreds of years more is again beyond realistic probability. Two improbabilities multiplied together make the odds very long indeed.\nHistorians simply have to make judgements. When experts in weaving tell me that the Shroud is a typical weave of a medieval treadle loom, I don’t take this as an absolute fact but I see no reason to dispute that expert opinion as there are no realistic alternatives.\nSo gradually by eliminating improbabilities and imaginative solutions, one comes to a reasonable conclusion that is held until some evidence, ideally a first century carbon-14 date will do it, comes up to contradict it. As it is clear that a burial shroud of Christ did once exist, I shall be as interested as anyone if it is found, just as I would be if one of the large tomb blocking stones that still exist in Jerusalem is shown to be the one that closed Jesus’ tomb. That probably really does still survive in Jerusalem if only we could spot which one it is! It is said that the stone on which he was laid out, another likely survivor as it could hardly disintegrate or succumb to damp, was taken to Constantinople in the fourth or fifth century!\nI am not sure why the Shroud is talked about as if it were the greatest relic of all when all relic lists which have a hierarchy in them put pieces of the True Cross (the only relic of the Passion given a public showing each year in Constantinople), the Crown of Thorns (grabbed ,of course, by Louis IX for his Sainte-Chapelle) and, from the fourteenth century, the blood of Christ, higher up on the list than any burial shroud or sudarium.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 4:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","id":"comment-191253","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’","post":"I have been an expert in a few specialties in my time, I have worked with experts, and I know about experts.  They are fine for informing about little known information and for giving expert opinions, but you never put them in charge of anything as they are so narrowly focused that they don’t see the big picture.  \nAn expert demands to see an exact replica of a cloth, most of which have long since perished and no longer exist if they ever did, or the remains of a particular type of treadle loom, as if that were the only way of creating the cloth, or else specific references in historically proven documents which he can tease to pieces and if it suits him show to be false.  Any history of court cases will show any number of occasions when experts have contradictory opinions.  It is an attorney’s joy to find an expert that will support his client’s case, as it is his opponent’s.  Thankfully we don’t rely on experts for verdicts in court cases.\nThe generalist on the other hand sees an exceedingly complex weave in a carpet of comparable size originating within a 1000 km of Jerusalem, some 500 years beforehand, but it is discovered in a Scythian prince’s grave in Siberia.  If that is possible, then it is no less possible that a 3:1 herring bone weave in linen, less complex than any Persian carpet, should be available in 1st century Jerusalem, no matter how it originated, nor how it arrived there.  That is not writing a novel, but it is facing the reality of true possibilities.  \nThere are 2nd century and later apocrypha referring to the keeping of the burial cloths, and it needs no relic cult to find a reason for their being so kept.  There are sporadic references throughout the first millenium, and there are clues as to their having full body images.

By letting go of some of the details above, we may find cloths which, although not identical, at least bear some comparison.

A.M. van der Hoeven, http://www.JesusKing.info, October 14, 2011 \nAs Kelly states, Adrie makes a good credible case together with a plausible story for the Shroud having been a type of temple garment.  I was in touch with Adrie a few months ago, when she graciously contacted me.  One problem for many will be her associating the authors of the first and fourth gospels as being the same person, viz John Mark.  There is no tradition for the authors being the same person, and likely NT scholars would see valid objections to it.  So we differ on that aspect, but I don’t see that necessarily derogates from the Shroud having been a temple garment.  It might just as well have been the garment worn by Joseph of Arimathea, or even his own intended shroud.  \nPlain shrouds for burial did not become obligatory until the 2nd century under Gamaliel II, who objected to the excesses of luxuriant funerals, which sometimes resulted in pauperising families.  I see no reference to herring-bone weave, Z twist in her paper as being any kind of requirement.  Her biblical references as to requirements include Ex 28:5-6, Nu 15:38.  Other related papers can be found on her web-site above.  \nSignificant that white linen garments are frequently mentioned in both the OT and NT, so there must have been some degree of active production of them.  The inventiveness and enterprise of artisans, weavers and merchants for producing exceptional or special quality products of any genre is a common enough feature of any market-place.  Joseph is said to have been a rich man, and this might account for no other comparable linen cloths of similar weave being discovered.  The temple veil is said to have been torn in two as a result of an earthquake; whether Joseph or Nicodemus had access to its remnants is an intriguing speculation.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","id":"comment-191296","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’","post":"On checking web-site “The Tabernacle Place”, the veil in the wilderness tabernacle is said to have been: “This curtain, known as the “veil,” was made of fine linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn.

If indeed it was a replica, then presumably it was of linen, but how it could have been four inches thick seems a puzzle, unless it was padded, but there might be objections to that if it involved two kinds of material. \nIt does indicate that large linen cloths were likely available, but I’d doubt that the TS was made from remnants of the temple veil, particularly if they were embroidered.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","id":"comment-191299","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’","post":"It was a good idea, though.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 5:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","id":"comment-191301","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
