This is pretty obvious and was NOT the real issue under discussion! What I don’t really get is the reason why you had the ear cut incident come into the debate.\nyou also wrote: “It would seem that the only really good reason for asserting that Mark was the Sanhedrin’s secretary, was that all other three gospel accounts of the trial adhere to Mark’s version fairly closely, albeit with some minor additions. But both Nicodemus & Joseph of Arimathaea could also have provided oral accounts which all four gospels could have then followed.”\nReminder 1: According to Papias: ‘the Elder’ (Presbyter) used to say this, ‘Mark became Peter’s interpreter [hermeneutes, Greek that can also be rendered by ‘translator’ and/or ‘stenographer’] and wrote accurately (Peter’s memoirs).\nReminder 2: from a close scrutiny of the High Priest House nightly episode and knowledge of Sanhedrin procedures, the Sanhedrin could only be composed of 3 members.Thus the odds for “Nicodemus & Joseph of Arimathaea” to be both in attendance that very night are very weak. Now if we base our deduction from Hebrew-to-Greek translation entropy (Gr. hemeneutes + Gr. huperethen (applied to the same person namely John Mark) < Heb. sophereth, 'assistant secretary/assistant scribe = a young man), John (Mark) as High Priest Hanan's assistant/servant secretary (stenographer) does make more sense. Most likely he was the one to let Kêpha/Peter in and reported the dialogue between Yeshua and Hanan. Maybe we can go as far as deducing 'the young man who runs off naked' was John (later to be called) Mark. Maybe. The fact is this crypto-exegesis is totally consistent with our knowledge of Second Temple period Sanhedrin procedures, Aramaic/Hebrew-to-Greek translation entropy and NT Greek Version.\"\n\"Dave you wrote: Mark 14:53-56: “They led Jesus off to the high priest; and ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS AND THE SCRIBES ASSEMBLED THERE. [Peter warms himself at fire] THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE WHOLE SANHEDRIN were looking for evidence against Jesus on which they might pass the death-sentence. SEVERAL indeed brought false evidence against him, but their evidence was conflicting. …”\nAnd you comment: “It is plain from Mark that there were rather more present than the three rostered members of the Sanhedrin.”\nThe TRUE fact is this is ONLY PLAIN FROM the above CURRENT TRANSLATION. Is the CURRENT TRANSLATION from the ancient koine Greek version accurate? I very much doubt so. What about the most likely Galilean Aramaic substratum? The same text can be understood in a quite different way, it just depends of the translation strategy (word-for-word translation vs. sense-for-sense translation/source-oriented translation vs. target-oriented translation, direct translation vs. oblique translation (by Vinay & Darbelnet), adequacy vs. acceptability, formal equivalence vs. dynamic equivalence (by Eugene Nida), semantic translation vs. communicative translation (by Peter Newmark), overt translation vs. covert translation (by Juliane House), documentary vs. instrumental translation (by Christiane Nord), foreignization vs. domestication (by Lawrence Venuti), etc. While these binary oppositions have much in common, they reflect different perspectives and emphasize different translation aims and effects).\nThe other TRUE fact is the same text can be translated according to a time-perspective more consistent with the real chronology in terms of Yeshua’s trial by the Sanhedrin. The same sentences can be read as follows:\n1-They led Jesus off to the high priest\n2- And It was there all the chief priests and elders and the scribe WOULD assemble\n(…)\n3- The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin HAD BEEN looking for evidence against Jesus on which they might pass the death-sentence. Several (witnesses) indeed HAD BROUGHT false evidence against him, but their evidence was conflicting.\nReminder for Dave: Yeshu'a HAD ALREADY BEEN judged and sentenced to death in absentia. To confirm a death sentence in presentia ONLY 3 Sanhedrin members were needed.\"\nEtc.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2015 at 8:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/10/to-every-honest-seeker-of-historical-truth/","cat":"article","id":"comment-195931","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"To every honest seeker of historical truth","post":"You can use the AFM technique also for ancient scrolls…\n— —\nJohn Klotz wrote:\n>… anyone who wishes to seriously study the Shroud must be prepared to dig deeply into three disciplines: science, history and religion.  …\nToday I was looking for some news about Alessandro Paolo Bramanti (author of a book on the Shroud: “Sacra Sindone.

They have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose chains of a crystalline substrate because of their two-domain structure, i.e. cellulose-binding domain and catalytic domain, and unique active site architecture…\nCellobiohydrolases (CBH’s), attack cellulose from the non-reducing ends of the cellulose polymers and yield cellobiose (a glucose dimer) as a majorproduct. Two types of CBH enzymes are known: cellobiohydrolase-l (CBHI) which generates cellobiose exclusively, and cellobiohydrolase-ll ~CBHII) which generates a mixture of cellobiose and glucose. CBH enzymes have not been found in cellulolytic, non-filamentous bacteria, and thus appear to be limited to fungal and filamentous bacterial sources.\n— —\nThird question:\n I never try to polemizar with Jamon on what has instead written Agnoli …\nbecause I’ve already enough pockets full of false coins with what\nI jump out with the bad Google translations …\n — — —\nIn any case I have found the following paper:\nComplexity of Spoken Versus Written Language for Machine Translation\n Nick Ruiz\nConference: European Association of Machine Translation, At Dubrovnik, Croatia \nAbstract\n>When machine translation researchers participate in evaluation tasks,\nthey typically design their primary submissions using ideas that are not genre-specific.\nIn fact, their systems look much the same from one evaluation campaign to another. In this pa-per, we analyze two popular genres: spoken language and written news, using publicly available corpora which stem from the popular WMT and IWSLT evaluation campaigns. We show that there is a sufficient amount of difference between the two genres that particular statistical modeling strategies should be applied to each task. We identify translation problems that are unique to each translation task and advise researchers of these phenomena to fo-cus their efforts on the particular task\n— —\nIn short: what I wanted to say to you is that I’m curious about\nthe “machine translation” even in the case of ancient texts …\nI have found the following tool:\nhttp://perseus.uchicago.edu/Reference/LSJ.html\nI’m no expert on Ancient Greek and then I ask you:\nWhen it is possible to use that tool?\n— —\nAmong the many interesting things I have to confess that I’d like to better\nunderstand the dispute between Peter and Paul … because I recently read a book\nwritten by an agnostic archaeologist (an Italian professor, who teaches in Rome)\nthat perhaps confused my own ideas on the two great Apostles.\nHe also spoke of the interesting concept of the Pope viewed as a\n“primus inter pares” (in a council assembly) and not as an absolute\nmonarch out of date, typical of other historical times …\nPerhaps he too stressed the fact that Peter and Paul were not bishops\n(as now we conceive the role of bishop) …\nThe book, published by Laterza, was dedicated to Pope Francis.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2015 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/10/to-every-honest-seeker-of-historical-truth/","cat":"article","id":"comment-195940","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"To every honest seeker of historical truth","post":"I hope you will excuse me,\n for my mistake:\n>I never try to polemizar with Jamon on what has instead written Agnoli \nInstead of:\n>I do not want to discuss and make a controversy with Hamon on what was written instead by Agnoli\n… and other errors …\n\n","date":"April 11, 2015 at 5:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/10/to-every-honest-seeker-of-historical-truth/","cat":"article","id":"comment-196044","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"To every honest seeker of historical truth","post":"This is a good piece, but not exactly original, and Max rightly points to Claude Tresmontant.\nOne should also add Father Jean Carmignac, who worked on the Aramaic origin of the gospels decades ago.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2015 at 9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/10/to-every-honest-seeker-of-historical-truth/","cat":"article","id":"comment-195936","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"To every honest seeker of historical truth","post":"The book reviewed is ‘Luce dal sepolcro: Indagine sull’autenticità della Sindone e dei Vangeli’ by Emanuela Marinelli and Marco Fasol.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2015 at 9:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/10/to-every-honest-seeker-of-historical-truth/","cat":"article","id":"comment-195937","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"To every honest seeker of historical truth","post":"The title of the book by Andrea Carandini\n(= the “agnostic archaeologist”) is the following:\n“Su questa pietra” = Upon this rock…\nLink (Sorry, in Italian language!):\nhttp://www.laterza.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1286&Itemid=101\nHere a rough translation:\n>Jesus renamed Simon the fisherman “Kepha”, Aramaic name equivalent to the greek “petra”, stone, from which “Petros”, Peter.
