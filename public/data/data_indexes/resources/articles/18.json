Gospel of Nicodemus which we might expect to elaborate on such issues), no he enters the picture near the beginning in a passage continuing the main thrust of John’s opening: the need to be born from the beginning (misinterpreted as ‘born again’ ironically as modern translators make the same mistake Nicodemus did as the Greek has multiple definitions ((albeit it’s hard to express whats happening without a note)) which NT scholars use to claim Jesus and Nico spoke Greek here, however the Aramaic also has multiple definitions, only the latter has a definition that connects with John’s opening, “in the beginning,” hence born in the beginning/in the Word “Miltha”/from the head, etc).. side issue but helps show Nicodemus was not an ad hoc vehicle to deliver a second shroud nowhere hinted at. He appears again in chapter 7 defending Jesus in the Sanhedrin of which he and Joseph of Arimathea were members. \nLuke also has linen in the empty tomb without a mention of Nicodemus who only appears in John’s gospel. Nicodemus simply isn’t necessary for burial cloths.\nThe text specifically states Nicodemus provided the burial spices (Jn 19:39) just as the text specifically states Joseph provided the linen, “And he [Joseph] bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock..” Mk 15:46 (ESV), or if you don’t like that rendering, KJV: “And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock..” etc.\nI reiterate, the text never states Joseph’s shroud was ever discarded or that Nicodemus brought any, and the text even mentions Joseph’s linen was used with spices as would be expected for burial in John 19:40, “So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.” Is there any good reason why Joseph’s linen wouldn’t be used for burial after it was already packed with burial spices said it was used in the burial custom or is this just desperate denial?\n\n","date":"July 12, 2015 at 11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","id":"comment-205394","author":"AONU","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne","post":"What a pity that Joseph of Arimathea never got round to penning his own Gospel (if only as a counterweight to your academically-dubious reference to the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus).\nFrankly, I don’t care for your convoluted logic.

Again, the common sense reading of the Gospels is that the long sheet used to wrap Jesus’ body (like the Shroud of Turin) was placed under and over the body then wrapped with pieces of linen cloth to hold the body intact.  The spices were used to counter the odor of decomposition and were a sign of respect for the deceased.\nLike his argument for how medieval persons could have created the shroud by coating a man with flour and water (just wait 1000 years or more and you will see!), his reading of the plain words of the New Testament is just another tortured, convoluted bit of nonsense. \nAs I have said before, if you can reproduce the shroud in anything like its current form and characteristics, do so.

I don’t need to be told to read them again.  The following extracts are from the USCCB version which is on the web and can be easily accessed.  I haven’t included the informative annotations but you can easily check them out yourself, if you wish to learn more.  \nThe meaning is plain enough.  Mark’s is the basic original narrative, and the other evangelists have built on it either adding material known to them, or else omitting material by way of refinement.  The basic events are that Joseph took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and placed him in the tomb.  What part of this don’t you understand? Individual additions are:  ‘laid in a tomb hewn out of the rock’; ‘rolled a stone against the entrance’; ‘no-one had yet been buried there’;  ‘it was Joseph’s tomb and he had hewn it’; ‘Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes’;  ‘bound the body with burial cloths along with the spices according to the Jewish burial custom’; ‘there was a garden and the tomb was close by’.  All perfectly consistent!   \nMark 15:45-46   44  Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died. 45  And when he learned of it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 46  Having bought a linen cloth, he took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.\nMatthew 27:58-60  58  He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be handed over. 59  Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it [in] clean linen 60 and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed.\nLuke 23:52-54  52  He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 53  After he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried. 54  It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin. \nJohn 38:38-42  38  After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body. 39  Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds.  40  They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. 41  Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. 42  So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by.\n\n","date":"July 13, 2015 at 3:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","id":"comment-205458","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne","post":"Let’s avoid a lot of futile talking at cross purposes. I maintain that the Shroud is the realization of a thought experiment, carried out in the 14th century, freely admitting that requires mhaving to make some qualifying assumptions. That leaves you or anyone else free to question those qualifying assumptions if wishing to undermine and/or demolish my case. What you cannot do is come back with pro-authenticity thinking that makes its own qualifying assumptions and imagine they have any relevance to my medieval thought experiment scenario, with incomplete knowledge of actual historical events, and based instead on an imaginative  reconstruction of those events, accurate or otherwise (probably the latter).\nBut there’s a further sting in the tail, as I have flagged up on the News Sentinel artticle. The description of the Shroud as a “burial” cloth goes beyond the biblical record. It is based on making a number of qualifying assumptions, all presupposing authenticity, and then uses that label “burial cloth” essentially to promote authenticity via the back door, so to speak. That back door is then left open so as to admit further fanciful speculation, requiring still more qualifying assumptions e.g. thatthat the superficial body image could only have been formed by  miraculous flash of radiation at the instant of resurrection (overlooking to mention that the image thickness corresponds roughly with that of the primary cell wall of the flax bast fibre).\nThe desription of the TS as a “burial shroud” is an egregious example of “begging the question”. There is no greater academic sin one can commit, short of downright fraud, than to create and promote lines of argument that “beg the question”, ones that carelessly or shamelessly create a closed loop between preconceptions and conclusions.\nI can see why sindonologists want the TS to be seen as a burial shroud, and do NOT want it to be seen as having any transport role from cross to tomb – that creating all kinds of problems re stereo-register or lack thereof between blood and body image. But I’m not buying into any of that. Solid scholarship never begs the question, and scrupulously avoids terminology that eseentially begs the question. There are no legitimate grounds – scientific, historical or biblical – for describing the TS as a “burial” shroud. In fact it’s best not described as a shroud at all. It’s the Lirey/Turin body-imprinted envelope.\n\n","date":"July 13, 2015 at 3:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","id":"comment-205461","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne","post":"Nice job of simply repeating yourself ad nauseam.

Fortunately we need only skip back one gospel to find key information on what a Jewish burial entails in the time of Christ as we have a funeral in progress complete with the procession and means of carrying the body to its resting place recorded in Luke 7:11-15. Luke tells us that the dead body was carried on a “bier” as the King James bible puts it (as do many others).\n“Now when he [Jesus] came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.” Luke 7:12-14 (KJV)\nAccording to AV1611.com (King James bible dictionary online), a bier is “A carriage or frame of wood for conveying dead human bodies to the grave.”\nNo mention of “transport linen” anywhere because that was not the Jewish burial custom, neither is such indicated in the bible or Jewish sources, nor should we expect otherwise from the burial of Jesus Christ when John wants us to know Jewish burial custom was followed. Nicodemus who was a religious teacher, a Pharisee, and a member of the Sanhedrin along with Joseph would have known as well as any how to conduct a Jewish funeral properly, particularly for the Jewish messiah in whom they believed in. \nThe OT also bears witness to the burial custom of transporting dead bodies on a bier/bed and what may be its inclusion in the actual burial in the second example:\n2 Samuel 3:31 (KJV) And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier. {KJV note, bier: Heb. bed}\n2 Chronicles 16:14 (KJV) And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him. {KJV note, had made: Heb. had digged}\nAccording to http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3842-burial:\n“Coffins, though used in Egypt (Gen. 1.26), were not in general use in Biblical times; in most cases the dead were carried out to the burial-place upon a bed or bier (“miṭṭah,” II Sam. iii. 31; Ber. iii. 1; Josephus, “Ant.” xvii. 8, § 3, κλίυη; compare II Kings xiii. 21, and the story of the sham funeral of Johanan ben Zakkai, Giṭ. 56a). Occasionally coffins were used, either of wood or of stone (M. Ḳ. 8b; Yer. M. Ḳ. i. 80d), those of wood suggestive of the tree which brought death to man (Gen. R. xix.); cedarwood, “which does not decay,” being preferred (Test. Patr., Simeon, 8; compare Levi, 19; Zebulon, 10). In France it became customary to use for the coffin-boards the table upon which food for the poor had been served (Baḥya b. Asher, commentary to Ex. xxv.).\nAt first the bier used for the rich was more elaborate than that used for the poor; later, simplicity and equality became the rule (M. Ḳ. 27b).”\nSo the Jewish custom was to use a bier or bed, rarely a coffin — no makeshift stretcher of linen here. And how did John say Jesus was buried? By Jewish customs.\nAccording to the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia at http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/B/BURIAL/:\n“Missionaries and natives of Syria tell us that it is still customary to wash the body (compare Acts 9:37), anoint it with aromatic ointments (compare Jn 12:7; 19:39; Mk 16:1; Lk 24:1), swathe hands and feet in grave-bands, usually of linen (Jn 11:44a), and cover the face or bind it about with a napkin or handkerchief (Jn 11:44b).”\nAccording to http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ancientburial.html:\n“Bodies were buried clothed and carried to the tomb on a bier (II Sam. 3:31), but not in a coffin. Joseph’s coffin is to be understood as Egyptian custom (Gen. 50:26).”\nJohn 19:39 states Nicodemus brought 75 to 100 lbs of myrrh and aloes mixture (KJV says 100 lbs). Seeing as how the crucifixion and burial was outside the city gates/camp (again following Jewish custom as shown in Luke 7:12, John 11:30 and elsewhere) it’s highly unlikely Nicodemus by himself and in old age (John 3:4) carried these by hand alone. Either he had help or he brought them with some form of transportation (chariot, wagon, horse, etc) and so a bier could have been brought along by whatever means was used for this or even itself used to carry the spices, we simply are not told how but only that the Jewish burial custom was indeed followed and we know the custom always had a bier/bed/coffin for body transport and fortunately for elder men like Joseph and Nicodemus it was not a long transport (John 19:41).\n\n","date":"July 14, 2015 at 7:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","id":"comment-205721","author":"AONU","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne","post":"Colin isn’t saying the Shroud was the actual transport linen, he’s saying a medieval audience may have been convinced it was a transport linen.

Spot on as ever, which is impressive, given you are correcting the record on views that are not necessarily your own (though i suspect you are one of the few here to see some merit in them). Yes, this blogger sees the doubly-imprinted body envelope (what some choose to call the ‘shroud’  ;-) as having started in someone’s head as a thought experiment, one that was finally realized in an artisan’s workshop. As you and I say, the recreated scenario did not have to pass the test of 21st century biblical scholarship. It had only to seem credible to 14th century pilgrims who were drawn to a must-see relic that claimed to be a bigger-and-better version of the Veil of Veronica, both having natural or semi-supernatural  images captured as a result of brief contact between body and linen, the Veil’s en route to the cross, the ‘recently discovered’ rival en route from cross to tomb in J of A’s linen used in up-and-over mode, possibly but not necessarily as a makeshift stretcher.\nThat book of yours, David, re your childhood experiences in a family home that also served also as your father’s undertakers’ business: is it still available?

It was the top papal relic, the subject of enormous crowds when exhibited in St.Peter’s in 1350.\nSo how do you go bigger and better than that ? Clearly it was a PA disaster if only because no one at the time saw any resemblance to the image of a living Christ (cf. Image of Edessa), and the double image of a dead Christ.\nThe choice of venue was also a serious mistake- far too out of the way for a serious relic cult. Compare the Shroud of Cadouin which was on a major pilgrim route so you could hardly miss it!\nIt was also extremely easy to get it suppressed  in c.1355.

I show that Joseph’s linen was very much intended for burial not some ad hoc makeshift stretcher with no place in Jewish burial customs and that nothing supports the idea that Nicodemus brought any burial linen which Joseph had already brought anyways. This is the whole point of the discussion. \nColin is basically saying even if he can’t duplicate the image, you still shouldn’t see the image as being formed during the resurrection because it wasn’t used during the resurrection.\nHe concocted a story that an imaginary makeshift linen stretcher was provided by Joseph (admittedly, as some misinformed painters imagined, likely the spark that inspired this new farce) and was later removed for some other imaginary linen Nicodemus brought for the final burial (totally made up which no one was nutty enough to come up with previously) — while carefully ignoring and downplaying all the proof positive against this, biblical and historical. \nIf that wasn’t bad enough, Colin then projects this delusion back into the minds of alleged conspirators trying to sucker Christians in the middle ages we’re told, yet no evidence that such a conspiracy was ever dreamed up exists. Sorry published accusations of fraud with no evidence proves nothing; would we be as gullible if the same had asserted authenticity?

There’s no shred of evidence anywhere Nicodemus provided any linen nor would he need to as Joseph did.\nOnce you dodge all those pesky facts, you then have to shut off critical thinking and embrace a desperate conspiracy theory with absolutely zero evidence.

Stephen Jones is like a curse word around here, but at least his take on the C14 fiasco has some interesting facts and circumstantial evidence going for it.
