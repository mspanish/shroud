Knuckles has realized what Barrie Schwortz wrote 15 years ago: the concept of the Shroud being a 14th century photograph is absurd. Nickell thinks CNN gave Allen face time in order to discredit Shroud skepticism. That ignores the fact that CNN also gave Goodacre time to prate about the validity of the carbon dating.\nNo Joe, it’s not a plot to validate the Shroud. It’s the stupidity of the producers to present a “balanced” view that went off the tracks.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2015 at 4:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/crocumentaries/","cat":"article","id":"comment-192891","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Crocumentaries","post":"John.\nHave you tried to get in contact with Goodacre, just as I advised?\n\n","date":"March 9, 2015 at 4:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/crocumentaries/","cat":"article","id":"comment-192892","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Crocumentaries","post":"I am working on it.

I realize that armies of scientists with all the tools of the nuclear age available to them have not been able to determine how the image got there after years of study, but YOU, sir, seem to know and insist on not telling the rest of the world.\nOh, I know, I know. It HAS to be a forgery. Just keep saying “it has to be a forgery” in spite of evidence to the contrary and that takes care of everything.\nNow since it has to be a forgery, could you please tell us how the Medieval forger had the presence of mind to make sure pollen from plants that only grow in or around Jerusalem to take his forgery to Jerusalem in the 14th century in order to expose it to the environment there so the cloth could gather enough pollen that it shows up centuries later? And how do you think the forger traveled to and from Israel? Did he take Air France, Al Italia, or maybe even El Al?\nNow stop toying with us. Tell us everything you know.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2015 at 7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/crocumentaries/","cat":"article","id":"comment-192904","author":"leon ward","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Crocumentaries","post":"Well said Leon re: Mr. Nickell’s tired argument(s).
