Many legends are associated with the discovery, and the True Cross (Vera Crux) was said to be identified by a miraculous cure.\nAlthough several relics were sent to her palace in Rome and elsewhere, the Vera Crux was kept in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem until it was captured by Chosroes II of Persia in 614.  The Byzantine emperor Heraclius recaptured it in 627 taking it first to Constantinople, and then returning it to Jerusalem.  \nAlthough hidden for many years, the relic made its reappearance in 1099 during the first Crusade.  In 1187 a Frankish army under Guy de Lusignan was camped at Sepphoris and carried it into battle against Saladin.  The crusaders were utterly routed on the Field of Hattin, and Saladin paraded the relic through the streets of Damascus in triumph.  The cross-beam was eventually lost; fragments found their way back to Europe as Relics of the True Cross, some no doubt bogus.\nSepphoris is an ancient  city in Galilee, rebuilt by the tetrarch Herod Antipas, and is about 8 km north of the Nazareth of Jesus’ boyhood.\nAfter The Horns of Hattin, Saladin was master of the Moslem world, and rode through the streets of Damascus with the captured True Cross tied to his horse’s tail and dragging in the dust. Did his soldiers use it for firewood? \nDespite the valiant efforts of Richard I during the Third Crusade, the True Cross remained in Moslem hands. The beam itself disappeared, but fragments of the cross that came off were collected and brought back to Europe after the Crusades, some no doubt bogus.  \nAlthough the so-named True Cross was an inspiration and death sentence to many brave men of the time, no trace of the relic is believed to exist today. Was this focal point of the Crusaders, the True Cross as it was called. Perhaps we will never know. The important thing remains that for those soldiers who took up the cause of the Crusades, it was real enough to die for.\nThe “Titulus Crucis” the headboard relic taken by Helena to Rome is a related relic. It is either authentic, or else is a medieval replica of the authentic original. The original was known to exist for several hundred years.\n\n","date":"August 6, 2013 at 7:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/06/nbc-a-shroud-in-turin-is-said-to-hold-the-image-of-jesus-a-piece-of-jesus-cross-was-found/","cat":"press_coverage","id":"comment-40560","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"NBC:  A shroud in Turin is said to hold the image of Jesus & A piece of Jesus’ cross was found","post":"Thanks, Dave. I have “The Quest for The True Cross” on my bookshelf. Thiede’s books are really worth to read, as they put the early history of Christianity in a complete different light than what is presented in mainstream books, or documentaries on Discovery, BBC, NG etc. Although Thiede had still mantained some prejudice for some relics, Crown of Thorns for example.

There is a very comprehensive article on Wikipedia, but Helena’s dispersal of the Cross seems ambiguous and is not clearly stated:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Cross \nQuote: ‘According to Theodoret, “She had part of the cross of our Saviour conveyed to the palace (Constantinople or Rome?). The rest was enclosed in a covering of silver, and committed to the care of the bishop of the city, whom she exhorted to preserve it carefully, in order that it might be transmitted uninjured to posterity.” ‘\nNote that Rome isn’t mentioned. However, it is known that Helena took the Titulus to Rome and it was in the Church of San Gerusalemme there, see Thiede’s and D’Ancona’s ref above. They make a good case for the present titulus relic being authentic. Arizona C14 tests raised doubts. However the carved text inscriptions seem persuasively authentic, in which case if the present relic isn’t the original, then it would seem to be a replica of the original. The Wiki article indicates that part of the Vera Crux was broken up to be dispersed throughout Christendom as relics. It would seem that the portion Helena left in Jerusalem was substantial, and it was this portion that was often carried by the Crusaders into battle and later captured by Saladin.

The patriarch of Jerusalem partitioned it in 638, after muslim conquest, into 19 pieces, from which: 3 were sent to Constantinople, 2 to Cyprus, 3 to Antioch, 2 to Georgia, 1 to Crete, Edessa, Alexandria, Ascalon, and Damascus, respectively, and 4 remained in Jerusalem, of which the largest part was later carried into battle by crusaders.\nAbout recent discovery, it was not the Saldin’s prize.

I first came across Thiede’s book in our local lending library around 2003, took notes, and wrote up a piece for my church magazine. Much of what I’ve included above is from the notes and the article of that time.  A few years ago I had a special moment one Christmas at Midnight Mass, that one sometimes has. I took the book out again and wrote up a little fanciful piece called “Just a Simple Block of Wood” which also included a few personal allusions in it, to be understood by those “in the know”. By then the Titulus had been carbon-dated, and there’s also a mention of that.\nIf you want to follow it up, you can find the 2010 article at:\nhttp://tawacatholic.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TCN-Mar-10.pdf\nIt’s on pages 20-21 of that issue of Tawa Catholic News.
