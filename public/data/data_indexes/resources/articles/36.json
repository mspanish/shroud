They also make the point that asphyxiation would occur within about 10 minutes, even in the case of a loosely draped cloth. \nMy understanding of the spear wound is that it was a Roman legal requirement before the body could be handed over to family, and this was to ensure that the body was in fact dead.  I seem to recall that Barbet carried out experiments with cadavers, and on simulating the wound, he obtained both blood and serum, the “blood and water” of John’s gospel.  Wilson has a picture of the Dying Gaul statue in Rome, with precisely that spear wound, which was apparently taught in the military academies.  \nFundamentally, I see the posting above as an attempt to rationalise and support the Koranic doctrine that Jesus did not die as a result of his crucifixion, but despite their arguments above it would seem not to be supported by the TSM.  Dan had a recent posting of some Islamic pilgrims to the exposition in Turin.  Such interest in the TS is intriguing, and I wonder what conclusions they might have come to as a result.\n\n","date":"May 28, 2015 at 6:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","id":"comment-200412","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?","post":"Thank you Daveb.\nWithout knowing any scientific research (today), the fisherman John mentioned that the blood and water came from the body to prove that Jesus was really died on the cross.

It is not an idea conceived beforehand nor is it a questioning of seemingly inexplicable specific events, but rather the consequence of the study of objective elements that appear on the Shroud of Turin. The arguments are to be found in the Shroud itself and have been divided under two broad headings: On the one hand, the signs that indicate that the body which produced the image was not that of a dead person, and, on the other hand, the evidence of signs that somehow reflect vitality in the elements of the Shroud.\nGood on you Louis.

A couple of items I wanted to comment on.\n1. Sources for ‘Survival’ Theory\nWe can debate about extracts from the differing Gospel accounts or bring up the Quranic verses on the Crucifixion, yet in fact the Shroud itself – if proved genuine – will actually be the best possible ‘eye witness testimony’ as to the events that took place. Over the years I have observed that a large majority of those who study the Shroud of Turin are believes in Jesus and his physical resurrection. When I’ve hoped to get objective and scientific analysis around if the man of the Shroud was still alive or dead often religious belief, especially relating to the authenticity of the account in the Gospel of John, seems to win out. I saw this in the late Dr Fredrick Zugibe’s book.\nIt would be really good to get independent analysis on the different theories from a pathologist. If we do have this I would be very interested in seeing it.\n2. Crucifixion does not ‘equal’ death\nAs others have correctly pointed out there are accounts of people surviving Crucifixion in 1st Century Palestine. We know that certain sections of Josephus are interpolated, but have no reason to believe this about sections where Josephus talks about three of his friends hanging on crosses. He asked for them to be brought down, and they are and two do die, but one survives. Crucifixion usually took several days but Jesus’ was cut short due to the Sabbath.\n3. Dr. Felzmann\nI was not aware of the work of Dr Felzmann – thanks to this Blog I will now be able to connect to him.\nThanks again for the balanced coverage of the Review of Religions edition, and my article in particular, on this website.\nI’d be more than happy to keep in touch with the author and other readers.\n\n","date":"June 3, 2015 at 4:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","id":"comment-201008","author":"Arif Khan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?","post":"I like.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2015 at 2:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","id":"comment-201043","author":"Emmett McMahon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?","post":"Reminder for Arif: \nPilate released Bar Abba and had Yeshu’a to be scourged as a criminal sentenced to death prior to his execution by means of crucifixion, yet in the hypothesis the TS man is Yeshu’a, the latter was not subjected to fustigatio (a simple beating with rods or canes for minor offences) or flagellatio (a more severe beating with rods or whips, merited by criminal acts) but verberatio (a scourging of the most severe kind), which accounts for his rapid death on the cross. Actually Pilate was surprised to hear that Yeshu’a died after only three to six hours on the cross  since, most likely, te former was not aware the latter had first been subjected to verberatio (not just flagellatio) that is a savage flogging with a flagrum-type device because of the wanton cruelty of his executioners.

Yes, the scourging would have weakened Jesus, but the idea of Crucifixion was a long drawn out punishment. The pleural effusions do not specifically point to death. Joseph and Nicodemus quickly obtained the body and tended to it with healing herbs – Aloes and Myrrh.\nIn terms of the time of day and time of year – it is interesting how three of the Gospel accounts talks about of ‘darkness’ at the time of the Crucifixion. There is also an earthquake mentioned and people fleeing. While these could me later embelishments, if they occured they would also help allow Jesus to survive.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2015 at 1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","id":"comment-201250","author":"Arif Khan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?","post":"Dear Arif:  I commend to you the work of Pierre Barbet, “Doctor at Calvary”, a work that you may already be familiar with.  Barbet discusses the ‘Wound in the Heart’ at great length and in great detail, and he conducted a number of experiments with cadavers, piercing them in a similar way as shown on the Shroud.  He obtained similar results as recorded in John’s gospel.  In death, the right auricle is always filled with blood, and the ‘water’ that flowed out was pleural fluid.  Barbet obtained the same flows.  The blow given was a Roman legal requirement before the body could be released to family, to ensure that death had occurred, and if the person happened not to be already dead, death inevitably followed this blow, the “percussio”.  It was a blow taught in the military academies.  The exact wound is depicted in the “Dying Gaul” statue in Rome.  \nCertainly, Barbet approaches his subject as a committed Christian and Catholic, but his analysis throughout his work is thoroughly professional, and indeed at times he is critical of the pious interpretations of other writers, who adduce certain mystical or miraculous aspects to what are purely physiological occurrences.     \nThere is both pre-mortem and post-mortem blood flows on the Shroud and the Sudarium.  Particularly in the case of the Sudarium, there is more pre-mortem blood, as it seems to have been a type of hood placed over the head towards the end of the crucifixion to hide the grimace of the death rictus from passers-by.    \nIn the case of the three persons taken down from their crosses at the request of Josephus, only one survived, and yet none of them had been given the death blow, the “percussio”. \nIn the case of the blood flow across the back, Barbet makes a case for it having occurred during transport from the cross to the tomb.  Barbet is of the opinion that rigor mortis is manifest on the Shroud image.  \nAll four gospel accounts were written during the first century of the common era, but drew on pre-existing oral traditions and reports.  The Passion and Crucifixion narratives draw mainly on Mark as their basis, set down about 65 AD, but also use their own independent traditions and witnesses, corroborating one another.  They are unanimous that death had occurred.  The Quranic version on this interpretation was set down some hundreds of years later, cannot be said to have the benefit of eye-witness, and to this Christian, seems to have been written from a perspective to suit a doctrinal position only.  \nWhile Josephus is able to cite one single case of a survivor of crucifixion, I believe that no good case can be made that Jesus of Nazareth survived this terrible cruel punishment.  \nCordially, Daveb.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2015 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","id":"comment-201257","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?","post":"Late correction:  I am unaware of their being any pre-mortem blood flows on the Shroud.

Having been assured of this by the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph who bought a shroud, … (etc)”  Mk 15:42-46.  John enlightens us as to why the centurion was able to assure Pilate, because of the percussio.  John’s later gospel may even have included his passage on the piercing to correct and set aright any current rumours that Jesus had not died on the cross, because of the stories about Jesus having been seen after his death on the cross.
