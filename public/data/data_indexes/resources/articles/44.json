Look like they present a natural hypothesis involving a dead body as being the source of the image.  After all the “lunatic fringe” kind of proposals that have been made in recent years (burst of UV light, electric discharge coming from an earthquake, etc.) it’s great to see some rationality for once!  One thing’s for sure: it’s about time that a real forensic expert try to verify all those naturalistic hypotheses under good lab control.  This can be done.  Rogers made some preliminary experiments, so it is possible that someone else take over and do more testing (and not just of Rogers’ hypothesis but all the others natural proposals that have been made over the years).  I think we could be surprise of the results if this would be done properly.\n\n","date":"March 20, 2014 at 10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/20/from-gethsemane-to-the-tomb/","cat":"article","id":"comment-91195","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"From Gethsemane to the Tomb","post":"For the Tattoli article, see my reply to “Comment Promoted: Another hypothesis about the image formation.” For this recapitulation of Zugibe’s speculations, we have here nothing new. Interestingly McDermott begins: “Much has been written about the physical and psychological effects of the crucifixion of Jesus, often by surgeons, psychiatrists, and other doctors. While well-intentioned, the writings have largely been inaccurate by forensic standards and until now have relied on educated speculation and outdated medical and other investigative equipment.” I’m sorry to say that correctly translated this means “I have read Fred Zugibe’s book about the Shroud of Turin and accept what he says without further investigation. Every one of McDermott’s references, including the two from Doctor at Calvary, are from Zugibe’s book. Almost every one of his assertions has been questioned on this blog fairly recently.\n\n","date":"March 20, 2014 at 6:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/20/from-gethsemane-to-the-tomb/","cat":"article","id":"comment-91315","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"From Gethsemane to the Tomb","post":"The focus of the article is the pain Jesus went through in the passion. I don’t think these aspects were refuted in anyway in this blog. I remember the last time we were talking about Rigor mortis we were searching for someone with forensic experience. Guess what, there is none in that blog. with all due respect to everyone, you and Yannick included, Zugibe’s credentials in this field is far stronger than anyone here. His educated speculations have much more weight than our speculative refutations. Anyway, what has been debated in this blog (e.g. the nail entry point in the palm or the wrist..etc) had nothing to do with this article because Jesus would’ve felt the pain (causalgia) in either situations. So the article is a valuable summarization of Zugibe’s finding specially valuable around easter. Where christians are encouraged to reflect more over what Jesus went through for them rather than chocolate and easter bunnies.\n\n","date":"March 20, 2014 at 7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/20/from-gethsemane-to-the-tomb/","cat":"article","id":"comment-91328","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"From Gethsemane to the Tomb","post":"Fair enough.
