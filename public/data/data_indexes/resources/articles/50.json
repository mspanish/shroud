[{"title":"How Fast is Wikipedia? Shroud of Turin Article Updated Already","post":">Professor Paolo Di Lazzaro … indicated … ‘….it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier’, but their study does not mean the Shroud image could only have been created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection …\nProf. Di Lazzaro is trying to have it both ways. If, as his experiments found, the Shroud image is only “one fifth of a thousandth of a millimeter” thick, which is “the thickness of the primary cell wall of [a] single linen fiber,” and required the equivalent of “a battery of ten thousand laser excimer[s]” delivering a total energy of “34 thousand billion watts,” to reproduce the image on the Shroud (ignoring the advanced artistry, the anatomical precision of the image’s wounds and bloodflows, it being a photographic negative hundreds of years before photographic negatives were invented, in 3D, etc); then what actually is the alternative to “the flash of a miraculous resurrection”?\nAs Sherlock Holmes famously observed:\n“… when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth …” (Doyle, A.C., “The Sign of Four,” Penguin: London, 2001, pp.42-43.
