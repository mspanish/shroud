In a general “is-it-or-isn’t-it?” piece, then it is necessary to present as many arguments on both sides as you know, assess their value, and decide on balance one way or the other. But in a more specific case: “find a context for a 14th century shroud” or “could an earthquake have contributed to a 1st century shroud” then, apart from an acknowledgement that not everybody agrees with your premise, it is simply a waste of space to re-iterate all the arguments for or against it. Charles acknowledges: “There is enough uncertainty about the Shroud’s origins to convince some that it is the actual burial shroud of Christ,” and moves on. So should the reader, but Jones devotes another 12% of his article to his computer-hacker argument. Why bother?\nA further 13% is devoted to Charles’ credentials as an expert. This is a very weak form of criticism of an article, which ought to stand or fall by what it says, not on the reputation of its author.\nIn some of his criticism, Steve is on slightly surer ground. Thibault, on this blog, for example, has successfully challenged Charles suggestion that the image was never depicted with a loincloth before the Council of Trent. I think Charles is also a little unfair is supposing that no-one has considered the kind of loom upon which the cloth may have been woven. John Tyrer’s article at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi06part6.pdf considers this quite well, acknowledging that both the Z-twist and early 4-headle looms are typically European, casting doubt on a 1st century Middle Eastern origin, without, of course, positively disproving it. William Meacham, without giving sources, at http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm, says: “The thread was hand-spun and hand-loomed; after ca. 1200, most European thread was spun on the wheel.” Elsewhere we find: “Textile analysis suggests that the cloth originated in First Century Israel and that it was produced on a Syrian or Egyptian loom used during the time of the Roman occupation of Palestine. It appears to be identical to unique linen cloth found at the Masada fortress.” (Quoted, for example, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/porter1.pdf) As far as I know there is not a shred of truth in this entire statement, but if I’m wrong it suggests that some quality research into the textile has indeed been carried out. Sources, anybody?\n\n","date":"October 27, 2014 at 8:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-165904","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"Farey: “William Meacham, without giving sources, says: “The thread was hand-spun and hand-loomed; after ca. 1200, most European thread was spun on the wheel.”” During the period ca. 1200-1500 two spinning methods coexisted in Europe: the ancient method with the spindle and the new method with a primitive type of wheel. Some people think that the thread spun with the spindle was worse (less strong, less regular, coarser). The contrary is true. The wheel spinning was worse and was used only because it was quicker and saved time and money. Indeed in many places rules were emanated that prescribed that the warp threads, which had to be stronger, had to be spun with the spindle. Only the weft threads might be spun with the wheel. It so happens that in the Shroud (according to Flury-Lemberg) the weft threads are coarser and less regular than the warp threads. This by itself does not imply that in the Shroud the warp threads were spun with the spindle and the weft threads were spun with the wheel because at any rate it was usual to use better threads for the warp threads. But surely the fact that the threads of the Shroud were “hand-spun” does not indicate that they were produced before 1200.\n\n","date":"October 27, 2014 at 9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-165927","author":"Gian Marco Rinaldi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"John Tyrer does not seem to be aware of the extensive import of cotton into Europe  after 1200 and the fact that cotton and flax were often spun and woven in the same environment (as Gilbert Raes pointed out). If the Shroud was being produced specifically for the Quem Queritis  ceremony, as I argue, then it would have to be in linen to match the gospel accounts but,of course, fibres of cotton ( and no more than fibres have ever been found on the Shroud), may have drifted in, either when the yarn was being spun or when the weaving was being done. That fits well with the cotton evidence that has never been more than a tiny percentage of the Shroud..\nTyrer does not also seem to be aware that while three in one SILK  damasks are known from the third century ( and one expert has suggested to me that  there may have been some three in one WOOL tunics from the second century) the only linen three- in-one known to exist other than the Shroud is the fragments in the Victoria and Albert Museum dated to the fourteenth century from the pattern printed on them. ( The whole question of whether a pattern was printed on the Shroud as it is on the V and A samples with the ‘blood’ added separately for the Shroud  is another avenue that needs research. One of my V and A contacts has told me how I can get access to these fragments but it involves going through all kinds of security and, in any case, I would need a medieval textile/ medieval patterning on cloth specialist to come with me so as not to waste the visit.)\nBTW, I took time out from lecturing  in Istanbul to see what was happening in the Blachernae district. While the Church of St.Mary, where de Clari saw an imaged cloth, is now completely nineteenth century, the nearby palace is being restored as a conference centre and it  looks as it if it will be a great venue right up there on the fifth century walls. I think there is one Shroudie who mixes up the palace chapel with the church.  I can assure whoever it was that they are completely separate buildings.\nAs for our friend Stephen Jones, well they say all publicity is good publicity.

The most famous image from the cauldron is that depicting the celtic antlered God (one of the five rectangular long inner plates) that is mostly identified as Cernunnos, the G-od of fecundity and master of the animals. ” \nRemakably “He wears a zigzag/herring-bone weave patterned linen cloth (…)”.\nOn July 23, 2012 at 6:14 am, I wrote:  \n“Well before the Pray codex (1192-1195 CE), the liturgical embroidered silk cloth known as the Epitaphios (threnos) of Thessaloniki (ca 1300 CE), that of Venice (ca 1200 CE), or the Lirey Pilgrimage leaden badge (1370-1390 CE), I hold the cathedra of Saint Mark (6th century CE) to be the earliest iconographic testimonial of Yeshua’s zigzag weave patterned burial cloth.\nBesides “The “desacrated” throne is a 3D alabaster replica at reduced scale of the Hetoimassia (or relic-throne of the “Preparation” to the Second Coming of Christ). Hetoimassia, literally “preparation”, meaning “that which has been prepared” or “that which is made ready”, specifically refers to the “sign of the Son of Man” and his return at the Last Judgement. The (4th?)-6th c. St Mark’s cathedra was part and parcel of the booty from the 1204 CE sack of Constantinople by Franks & Venetians.” \n“The motif essentially consists of an empty throne with a prominent cushion and various Christic relics (among which his burial cloth covering or sitting on the throne and/or his pre-burial sudarium/ burial Byssus small face-cloth draped round a crux gemmata and/or the ring of twisted rushes, to which thorns were attached to form his crown around or over the cross).” \n“Here is the link to the Hetoimassia or relic-throne known as the cathedra or throne of Saint Mark:\nhttp://stephanhuller.blogspot.com/2009/11/my-article-on-throne-of-st-mark-has.html\nThe same herrring-bone pattern also appears in conjunction with a veil & a full length portrait of Christ in a last quarter of the 8th century CE missal miniature from the Echternach Abbey (founded in 698 CE as a Benedictine monastery by St. Willibrord, an English monk.”\n“All those representations of an herringbone weave pattern cloth are very rare as far as pre-13th c.

Any credibiility I have acquired in the scientific field comes from the research I have not only read, but quoted with references, and the reasonability of the inferences I make from them.  Your credibility depends on the same.\nYou begin by airily announcing that there is evidence of early herringbone weave on the basis of a 1st Century silver vessel showing a character wearing a striped costume with faint alternating diagonal hatching on the stripes, the embroidery on some epitaphioi, the base of carved alabaster throne and Christ’s robe in a miniature. Your expertise lies in knowing of these artifacts and being able to demonstrate them with references, for which we thank you, but we need not agree that they all illustrate herringbone cloth, or demonstrate that it was manufactured prior to the 14th century. I don’t, for one.\nHad you stuck to the Stavronitika epitaphios you could have been on stronger ground. After all, here is a picture of a Shroud with a herringbone pattern, and here is the actual Shroud which has a herringbone weave. There is a logical inference. It is not proof, or a true fact, that the one derives from the other, but it is a sensible infererence. There are counter-indications. The Stavronitika herringbone pattern is at rightangles with respect to the Shroud’s weave, and the Thessaloniki epitaphios shows herringbone embroidery as a general filler for any blank spaces, such as the sky, angels’ halos and so on. (The Stavronitika one leaves the sky unfilled)\nNext you wrote: “On 1988 radiocarbon dating, ‘sample 4′ was lift off the Cope of Saint Louis d’Anjou (1274-1297), a 13th c. CE ‘linen three-in-one’!” which you amended five hours later to “Reminder three: the Cope of Saint Louis d’Anjou (1274-1297), a 13th c. CE does combine linen herringbone and three in one and could be mistaken for the TS to the uninitiated eye.” This is only partially true, as Gian Marco later demonstrated: Linen – Yes, Herringbone – Yes, but ‘three in one’ – No. The herringbone is in embroidery stitching, not weaving, and looks nothing like 3/1 twill.\nNow we come to the Grandson antependium. Rather similarly to the Stavronitika epitaphios, large areas are left unembroidered, but over the embroidered area, herringbone is used as a convenient space-filler. The archangel Michael has collar, wings, halo, hem of tunic, sash and a thin central panel of his tunic in herringbone. None of them resembles a loros. He is carrying a cloth over one arm. It is not embroidered in herringbone. Not only the angels, but also a couple of insense burners are also embroidered in herringbone. Not, I think, to represent cloth.\nNow Max, everybody who reads this will be able to look up all these things on Google, and check that everything I have described is true. They will admire my dedication, agree that my inferences are valid, but come to their own conclusions about whether they agree with me. Some will, some won’t. That’s how ‘being an expert’ works. It does not rely on ‘the initiated eye,’ nor anouncements of ‘true facts,’ nor cheerful epithets of ‘none so blind as those who will not see, nor even ‘fields of expertise.’\nI think they’re just patterns.\n\n","date":"October 30, 2014 at 7:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-166862","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"Hugh, do you really know what Human Sciences are all about?\nYou wrote: “The archangel Michael has collar, wings, halo, hem of tunic, sash and a thin central panel of his tunic in herringbone.

I think a lesson is exactly what you need, so here goes.\n=====\nThe Wikipedia article on the Loros explains that it went through considerable modification. It began as a long stole looped over the neck or shoulders. The shorter end dropped down the front almost to the floor, and the longer end crossed around the back and ended up draped over the left arm. The Byzantine illustrations in the article do not show quite how the crossing round the back was accomplished. Over the course of the 11th to 13th centuries the design was modified so that the two hanging ends dropped from a wide collar. Again, the long end fell down the front, but got shorter, but the long end still came forward from behind and was draped over the left arm as before. By the 14th century the whole thing may have been sewn to the tunic beneath, but there was invariably a hanging over the left arm.\nThe Grandson archangel, dated about 1270, has nothing over his left arm. No loros. He does have the collar and dropping front strip, but there is no indication that his wide sash, the hem of his tunic, or the cloth over his right arm, are part of a loros. They could be stylistic elements derived from a loros, but not, as such, a loros itself.\nFor a full discussion of the development of the loros from the Roman (pre-Christian) toga and its later adoption of the symbolism of the shroud of Christ, see, for example, pages 153 – 156 in the Chapter on “Imperial Costume and Regalia” in the “Catalogue of the Byzantine Coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection” which is on Google Books.\n=====\nThere.\n\n","date":"October 30, 2014 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-166891","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"Dan,\nI won’t even put the shadow a farthering on your Business Executive’s contrary opinion as  far as the Western and Byzantine loros iconography and its evolution through time is concerned nor on the reliability and depth of your knowledge of the Byzantine emperor and empress’s, Archangels’ and twelve top dignitaries’ loros  costume!\n\n","date":"October 30, 2014 at 12:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-166920","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"Hugh,\nI cannot help thinking, you (and Dan incidentally)  just discover about the loros (via my comments on this blog this year, on 13 mai 2014,  and last year, on 11 juin 2013) and you NOW through Wikipedia. \nI am no Wiki scholar, YOU are as far as loros is concerned.

During a very long engineering career in a major NZ Corporate, I had frequent cause to resort to consulting a wide range of experts, all specialists in their various fields in all kinds of arcane disciplines.  I generally found that the expert was best at giving much-needed advice,  or at working only in his own field of specialist expertise, but that it was often necessary to set the parameters within which he would work and he should not go beyond them.  And they should not be relied on to give a useful decision.  The industry within which I worked was complex, drew on most of the engineering disciplines, and of course several other non-engineering disciplines as well.  \nMy first position as a young greenhorn was as an engineering cadet in a general civil engineering office.  The culture was such that they regarded with some tolerant bemusement the various experts from Head Office that often descended on them intruding on what they saw as higher priorities.  There was an unofficial Office Manual which was required reading by all office new-comers, so that experts might be given their proper regard.  It was a text written around 1929 by one Charles Sale, entitled “The Specialist”.

You cannot match a mechanical problem with a physical or a historical problem. In the first case the expertise is highly dependent of experience. Aristotle spoke of technical and scientific issues. The terminology is ancient but the concept is still valid. But this is my first condition: a wide experience. Our problem is a historical problem and in History this wide experience is checked by years of study and production in specialist literature. In mechanics the checking is not the same, obviously. Perhaps we can speak of experience in the garage and success in the manipulation of objects. I don’t know because I am not an expert in this matter.\n3.Of course, a non-expert can be right in a particular issue. Exceptions are possible. We have to examine all the particular circumstances and the reasoning involved. But the non-expert would claim his success not his expertise.

The only difference is the Emperor’s loros symbolic of Yeshua’s Shroudis, wound about the\nbody, ike a winding sheet, is yet studded with gems and\nembroidered with gold.while the two Archangels is a\nmuch simpler, more austere and realistic herringbone\npatterned cloth.\nWhether you like it or not YOU WERE WRONG: the herringbone patterned stole or long scarf BOTH Saint Michael and Saint Gabriel wear ARE EXACTLY DRAPED/WRAPPED AS LOROI. They are Western (most likely Templar) depictions of the Byzantine loros.

I think you’re right. In fact I said this several posts ago (except for the Templar bit). I do not believe a Byzantine artist could have embroidered the loros correctly over the the Angel Gabriel’s arm but not over the Angel Michael, even for the sake of symmetry, which implies that the artist was not familiar with, or not bothered about, the importance of the style of wearing it. Now what about the fact that the drape over the arm is in plain embroidery, not herringbone?\n\n","date":"October 31, 2014 at 7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-167396","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"Hugh,  FINALLY first quoting me: \n” “They are Western (most likely Templar) depictions of the Byzantine loros.” ”\n“You know what, Max? I think you’re right. In fact I said this several posts ago.”\nReminder for you: you FIRST asserted (on October 30, 2014 at 7:16 am) “The archangel Michael has collar, wings, halo, hem of tunic, sash and a thin central panel of his tunic in herringbone. NONE OF THEM RESEMBLES A LOROS (my upper cases). He (Saint Michael) is carrying a cloth over one arm.”\nYou ask me: “Now what about the fact that the drape over the arm is in plain embroidery, not herringbone?”\nJust take a (good) look at Andronikos II Palaiologos’s loros, see how part of the loros over his left arm is turned up and its plain pinky red lining actually showing. The Western (Templar) weaver tried to copy the same drape partly up-turned over both Saint Michael’s right arm and Saint Gabriel’s left arm and most likely find it difficult to incorporate the herringbone pattern here along with the lining.\n\n","date":"October 31, 2014 at 8:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-167406","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"Correction:\nHugh, \nif you take a good look too to the  Sant’Angelo in Formis fresco Archangel Saint Michael (a 10th century CE fresco), you shall see the drape over the arm is in plain (green) lining.

I think you’re right. In fact I said this several posts ago (except for the Templar bit).”\nIn the Grandson antependium, the body of the  two archangels’ loroi do appear  without any of the addition of Byzantino-Byzantine embellishments  (no embroidery or appliqued fabric/embroidery, no gemmed trim on the neckline, no pearled cuffs, no hems  with pearls and/or precious gems at all. The two Archangels’ Loroi show nothing at all to give the impression of expensive fabric, which is in keeping with Knight Templars’s philosophy of clothing.\nThe altar antependium was made in Cyprus workshop in the 1270s. Now the Knight Templars owned the entire island at that time.\nThe Archangels’ loroi are definitely mingling Western and Byzantine styles. We can even read Gothic inscriptions in Old French (SAINT GABIEL and SAINT MICHIEL). \nMETHINKS (whether Dan like it or not), the loroi her are most likely Templar depictions of the Byzantine loros. \nMETHINKS the knight Templars elite knew about the Shroud (now kept in Turin). \nIf the weaver did not try to represent what he thought was Yeshua’s double-length Shroud (now kept in Turin) can Hugh (anyone) account for the late 13th c. CE herringbone patterned loros STRONGLY evocative of the herringbone patterned TS? \nOr to put it in other words, can you (anyone) account for such an iconographic departure from the traditional depiction of the Byzantine Loros symbolic of Yeshua’s shroud in the 1270s CE?\n\n","date":"November 1, 2014 at 7:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","id":"comment-167594","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article","post":"Hugh, you wrote: “You have to demonstrate your expertise (in live).”\nI think (without much effort) I HAVE.\nRe ‘the cigar’, I prefer a jasmin or rose chisha (water pipe) with a couple of glasses of Ksarak (Libanesse arak), thank you.\nDan, you wrote: “Max.

According to Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, the loros and mappa symbolized Christ’s burial winding sheets (a long and a much shorter one). Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos also says that this type ceremonial scarfs should not be worn by any other country’s rulers, but that there were specifically meant as a gift to the Byzantines. As such, the loros along with the mappa were only worn on the holiest days of the year including Easter when the emperor represented the risen Christ.\nWith the passing of time i.e. in the late 13th c.CE, the loros and the mappa tended to merged into one ceremonial piece of lavishly adorned cloth (see Andronikos II Palaiologos, r. 1272 – 1328, artist unknown, Byzantine period art compare to 11th c.
