Attentive\n2. Calm\n3. Caring\n4. Focused\n5. Helpful\n6. Honest\n7.Humble\n8. Mature\n9. Patient\n10.Reserved/Restrained\n11 Unpretentious\n12. Wise/Intelligent\nAll the same character traits of Jesus of Nazareth.   As a result of getting “wrapped up in the Shroud”  he has become like the Man himself.   Taking on his good character.   Evidence that supports authenticity.   Success is about who you become as a person.   Barrie has become a successful person as a result of over 30 years of being involved with “The Man In The Shroud”   “You will know them by their fruits”  Barrie has “good fruits” to offer.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2015 at 11:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/06/audio-of-barrie-schwortz-on-coast-to-coast/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","id":"comment-196023","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"}]
