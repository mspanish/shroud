[{"title":"Updated: “Jesus, the Lost 40 Days” the History Channel April 20","post":"This program was written by John Marks, a self proclaimed atheist. There is nothing in any of the documents that the program claims to use which shed light on the 40 days in question. John, along with a college friend produced a obscure movie a few years ago called “Purple State of Mind”, in which John claims you cannot see the real world until you put the Bible down, and stop having your world view seen through it’s pages. In the film, John is shown going to a protestant church in NY, first time ever in his life, for he’s more likely to be found on a Sunday morning at the “church” of Vincent’s BBQ. John, claims he’s happy to go to hell, for there will sure be BBQ!\nThe film is sure to be a mind bender bolstering agnostics. We shall see.\n\n","date":"April 18, 2011 at 1:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/06/updated-jesus-the-lost-40-days-the-history-channel-april-20/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-2930","author":"Paul","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Updated: “Jesus, the Lost 40 Days” the History Channel April 20","post":"Yes, we will see.\n\n","date":"April 18, 2011 at 2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/06/updated-jesus-the-lost-40-days-the-history-channel-april-20/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-2932","author":"episcopalian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Updated: “Jesus, the Lost 40 Days” the History Channel April 20","post":"John Marks/Karl Marx…what’s the difference?\n\n","date":"April 18, 2011 at 4:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/06/updated-jesus-the-lost-40-days-the-history-channel-april-20/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-2937","author":"William Goodwin","site":"shroudstory"}]
