What an awesome scene!\n\nI have only two minor qualms with Zeffirelli’s masterpiece. Mary Magdalene was not a harlot. And Robert Powell was much too frail physically. Yes those eyes and cheekbones overcame much, but he simply didn’t project strength to me. I prefer the more robust Caviezel version of Jesus. I’d love to see what Jim might have done with Jesus beyond a few flashbacks during his passion narrative.\nWhat Zeffirelli did, which no one else has yet approached, is provide a rich context for the Truth of the gospel story to shine. As you mentioned, that Prodigal Son scene is pure genius.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2014 at 5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/son-of-god-in-theaters-february-28/","cat":"movie","id":"comment-80131","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Son of God in Theaters February 28","post":"Quote: “Mary Magdalene was not a harlot.”  Reply:  How do you know this for sure?

I agree that Caviezel was good also, but to me, Powell interpretation was a bit closer to the Jesus I imagine.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2014 at 9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/son-of-god-in-theaters-february-28/","cat":"movie","id":"comment-80331","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Son of God in Theaters February 28","post":"Modern scholars have suggested that Mary M’s background was embellished by later Church writers. She is not now thought to be the woman who poured the perfume on Jesus’ feet. She was more than likely a prominent woman in the Jewish community, possibly a widow, but also someone who had the means to help support Jesus ministry. I’m just sharing what I’ve read from other sources. This doesn’t impede my enjoyment of Zeffirelli’s work. He was working with the interpretation of the time and it still reveals beautiful truths.\nPowell was good, for sure. Perhaps a bit too European for me, but he did bring a level of inner intensity that I’ve never seen any actor who has played Jesus replicate. Zeffirelli’s casting for the project was impeccable.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2014 at 10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/son-of-god-in-theaters-february-28/","cat":"movie","id":"comment-80478","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Son of God in Theaters February 28","post":"I understand perfectly your point versus Mary Magdalene David and the most common opinion of modern scholars about her, but I just wanted to underlined the FACT that this is ONLY an hypothesis that should never be taken as solid proof of anything and that cannot exclude the other possibility, which is that she was truly a prostitute who became follower of Jesus.  It is totally impossible, in the present state of our knowledge to know the truth of her real condition for sure.  That’s why I wanted to underline the fact that Zeffirelli’s vision can be more accurate after all.  Who really knows?  I note that the Gospels say that Jesus cast out 7 demons out of her, which is surely a symbolical number that express how bad here condition was at the time she meet Jesus…  So, taking this into account and knowing how poor prostitutes were considered by the Jewish society of Jesus time, I don’t think we can reject the possibility that she had been, indeed, a real prostitute.  This is a true possibility that cannot be exclude by any credible scholar.\n\n","date":"February 20, 2014 at 11:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/son-of-god-in-theaters-february-28/","cat":"movie","id":"comment-80902","author":"Anonymous","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Son of God in Theaters February 28","post":"Anonymous & David, the prodigal son is my favourite scene too. It brings me to tears every single time. Probably because I can relate to being lost and found, but also the way he fitted the timeless, personal, parable with Matthew being a lost tax collector and Peter being the self righteous zealot was pure genius. Even if its not a situation that happened in the gospels but isn’t that what art is supposed to do. The artist is giving us a part of himself too, more like a visual sermon! I think Robert Powell was awesome, even though  Jesus was probably more muscular (being a carpenter by trade).\n\n","date":"February 17, 2014 at 7:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/son-of-god-in-theaters-february-28/","cat":"movie","id":"comment-80143","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Son of God in Theaters February 28","post":"Quote: “Anonymous & David, the prodigal son is my favourite scene too.
