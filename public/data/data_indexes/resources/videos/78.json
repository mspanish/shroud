You didn’t miss much, except that the speaker, one Artisantony, was talking about the neutron-enrichment-due-to-earthquakes hypothesis, showing that news about the shroud does get about, perhaps more widely than we think.\n\n","date":"February 13, 2014 at 4:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/13/does-it-really-matter-what-journalists-write-about-the-shroud/","cat":"video","id":"comment-79089","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Does it really matter what journalists write about the shroud?","post":"Dan would have to request that from the owner.
