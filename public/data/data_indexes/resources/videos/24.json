The big differences arise when it comes to the origin of monotheism.\nThere is no proof of the Exodus, the Josianic conquest, that the kingdom of David and Solomon was as big as described in the Bible. In fact, some scholars have described the two kings as “petty chieftains”. The Temple Solomon built actually used a North Syrian pagan temple as a model.

In his latest book he has Jesus uttering just four parables, nothing more. He will not address the Resurrection topic in his series. What is the reason for this? Other biblical scholars, who are also historians, have done this, and it will be the topic of my next review. If you are one to buy books my recommendation is “The Real Jesus”,by Professor Luke Timothy Johnson.\nFather Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ has more clout.

Because the final burial garment, seen by few eyes, and destined for rapid deterioration, would not have needed to be the “fine” linen as supplied by Joseph of Arimathea specifically to the cross (synoptic gospels). \nThere is, or should be, a self-evident reason for Joseph supplying costly fine linen to the cross. It was intended to signal to the Romans and spectators that the victim of that execution was still regarded, albeit in death, as a highly-esteemed individual in the eyes of his disciples and other followers. Whilst the subject of a humiliating drawn out ordeal, being made a public spectacle, there was nothing in law to prevent him being honoured just as soon as he had been pronounced dead. That’s especially so in view of the fact that  Pilate had been approached and given his personal authorisation for the body to be handed over to Joseph,  a noteworthy citizen, as distinct from being cast into a pit or similar. In short: Joseph’s linen was intended to be seen as first and foremost a mark of respect. To say it MIGHT have served subsequently as the final burial shroud as well is not incorrect, merely improbable, and some might think an attempt to extend the time scale for imprinting opportunities into the tomb, and indeed right through (in some minds) to the instant of resurrection, so as to suggest the body image was a byproduct of resurrection.\nThe short distance between cross and tomb is not a problem in the medieval narrative, at least my version thereof, which sees the TS as an attempt on the part of forgers to create a Mk2 version (post mortem) of the Veil of Veronica.  The Mk1 version, according to legend, was the result of brief contact between the face of Jesus, captured en route to the cross, by a sympathetic bystander with a head shawl. If that incident of legend was sufficient to capture the image of the face, then why not the considerably longer time required to transport the body from cross to tomb, even if nearby?\n\n","date":"November 29, 2015 at 2:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/29/new-very-short-video-from-national-geographic/","cat":"video","id":"comment-215309","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New, Very Short Video from National Geographic","post":"Actually Jews were buried wrapped in two shrouds till the time of Rabban Gamaliel II and he changed the custom in AD 50.
