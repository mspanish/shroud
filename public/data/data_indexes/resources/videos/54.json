The Muslims believe Jesus was crucified, but survived death and therefor was not resurrected.

I don’t believe that a loving God will “stop millions from being saved” because of what they believe if indeed they are “loving and caring people.”  In fact, I don’t think “this is a great deception by the enemy”  but that thinking it might be just might be.

There is one thing that unites all of them: the belief that Jesus was crucified and buried (dead) in Jerusalem.\nI am pasting here what was posted on another thread yesterday:\n 1.August 24, 2015 at 6:16 pm\nReply\nFurther to my previous comment, I want to reiterate that no one has been able to disprove the assertions refuting the claim about the burial of Jesus in a location outside Jerusalem made in:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7893085/The_Quest_for_Jesus_in_Shroud_research\nThe claims that Jesus survived the crucifxion is the result of an obsession with monotheism,when people thought that God would not allow any “prophet” to die crucified.\nWe must remember that the New Testament is in many ways a Jewish document, because\nexcept for Luke, the authors of the Gospels were Jews. It is for that reason that there is now an “Annotated Jewish New Testament”, a Jewish interpretation and a nice job, not drifting from the Jewish milieu.\nThe Jews never denied the crucifixion. Not long ago the Israeli writer Amoz Oz wrote that guilt was invented in his country 2000 years ago. Lest I be misunderstood, I hasten to say that there can be no accusation of “Christ killers”. The Gospels narratives leave no room for doubts that both Roman and Temple authorities were responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion and death. According the late Pinchas Lapide,who was a respected Jewish scholar and holocaust survivor, the Temple authorities handed Jesus over to the Romans.\nNo Jewish archaeologist or scholar has any doubt that Jesus was crucified and buried in Jerusalem. It is some unfounded claims that led to the controversy about the place of burial in Jerusalem, but no doubt was expressed about the crucifxion, death and burial in Jerusalem:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III\nThere are claims that some pathologists in Europe have stated that Jesus survived the crucifixion. The fact that they are not named, much less seem to have published any paper on the topic,makes them suspect.\nThere are pathologists/coroners who have identified themselves while dwelling on the bloodstains seen on the Sudarium, in connection with Turin Shroud studies:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/11804110/Is_the_Sudarium_of_Oviedo_the_key_to_unraveling_the_mystery_of_the_Shroud_of_Turin\n\n","date":"August 25, 2015 at 9:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/25/simon-brown-video-of-barrie-schwortz-at-jalsa-salana-uk/","cat":"video","id":"comment-208947","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Simon Brown Video of Barrie Schwortz at  Jalsa Salana UK","post":"Yes, I totely agree Louis with your comment. There are lots of validations confirming the gospels outside the Bible and well. \nHere is one of many I wrote about.\nIs this the earliest validation confirming the gospels outside the Bible, By Thallus the (historian)\nDid you know there are ancient writings believed to be traced back before any of the gospels were written and dated, 50 – 52 AD, and later told by Thallus, an early historian which some Christians believe to be non-Christian validation confirming what happened at the crucifixion of Jesus, and the darkness over the whole land and an earthquake, the rending of rocks, just as we are told happen in the gospels.\nAnd when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. Mark 15:34\nNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.\nMatthew 27:45\nAnd, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent. Matthew 27:51\nEarly Christian use of Thallus\nThe 9th-century Christian chronologer George Syncellus cites Sextus Julius Africanus as writing in reference to the darkness mentioned in the synoptic gospels as occurring at the death of Jesus: Ref: From Wikipedia,\n“Julius Africanus – Extant Writings, Fragment XVIII”. \n“On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his ‘History’, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.” \nAfricanus then goes on to point out that an eclipse cannot occur at Passover when the moon is full and therefore diametrically opposite the Sun.\nRef: From Wikipedia,\nVoorst, Robert E. Van (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament : An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Eerdmans. pp. 20-23. ISBN 0802843689.\nEusebius (fourth century) mentions a history of Thallus in three books that according to an Armenian translation of Eusebius ranged from the sack of Troy to the 167th Olympiad. Some have argued that the reason Africanus doubted the eclipse is because Easter happens near the full moon and a solar eclipse would have been impossible at that time, as was well-known. Compounding the matter is the Armenian translation of Eusebius has many corrupt numerals and so many apologists claim that 167th Olympiad (or 109 BCE) should really be 217th Olympiad.\nRef: From Wikipedia,\nhttp://rbedrosian.com/euseb14.htm\nJump up ^ Mosshammer, Alden E., The Chronicle of Eusebius and Greek Chronographic Tradition Bucknell University Press (Lewisburg, PA: 1979).\nDr Craig, in his article:\nThallus on the Darkness at Noon states:\nHere is the passage from Africanus reproduced by Syncellus:\nOn the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus in the third book of his History , calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the Passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the Passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun. And it cannot happen at any other time but in the interval between the first day of the new moon and the last of the old, that is, at their junction: how then should an eclipse be supposed to happen when the moon is almost diametrically opposite the sun? Let that opinion pass however; let it carry the majority with it; and let this portent of the world be deemed an eclipse of the sun, like others a portent only to the eye. Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth-manifestly that one of which we speak. But what has an eclipse in common with an earthquake, the rending of rocks, and the resurrection of the dead, and so great a perturbation throughout the universe? Surely no such event as this is recorded for a long period. But it was a darkness induced by God, because the Lord happened then to suffer. Ref: Reasonable Faith. Please see link below to the main article.\nThallus (historian)\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Thallus ( Greek : Θαλλός ) was an early historian who wrote in Koine Greek. He wrote a three-volume history of the Mediterranean world from before the Trojan War to the 167th Olympiad, c. 112-109 BC. Most of his work, like the vast majority of ancient literature, has been lost, although some of his writings were quoted by Sextus Julius Africanus in his History of the World .\nThe works are considered important by some Christians because they believe them to confirm the historicity of Jesus and provide non-Christian validation of the Gospel accounts: a reference to a historical eclipse, attributed to Thallus, has been taken as a mention of the worldwide darkness described in the Synoptic gospels account of the death of Jesus, although an eclipse could not have taken place during Passover when this took place.\nCould this be genuine?
