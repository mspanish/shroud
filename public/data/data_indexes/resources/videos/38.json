injury hastened the death of Jesus?\n-During crucifixion, the altered breathing pattern would cause a\nrespiratory acidosis to occur from the hypercarbia;\nthe kidneys would no longer compensate as effectively due to blood loss\n-The acidemia would cause tachycardia… etc …. etc.\nSource:\nhttp://www.aaroninkenya.com/2013/04/the-medical-aspects-of-the-crucifixion/\nHere an example of very short “preach of Chemistry”\ninterrupted (I think there are several examples of interruptions in my messages): \nUric acid is the most abundant organic component in human kidney stones.\nSix different crystalline phases of uric acid have been identified in kidney stones…\nand then … What was the probable quantity of water\nthat Jesus drunk before the death on the cross?\nDehydration and low urine volume are risk factors to uric acid stone formation\n(= they increase Uric Acid supersaturation)…\nDidn’t was possible the kidney stone formation in the case of Jesus?\nUrinary calculi formation is a complex process.\nCrystal retention is a key factor in urinary stone formation.\nThat crystal retention can be caused by adhesion of crystals with\nthe epithelial cells in the renal tubules.\nKidney stones are aggregates of micron-sized crystals\nthat are commonly held together by an organic matrix\n(The most common inorganic crystalline components are:\nCalcium Oxalate monohydrate, Calcium Oxalate dihydrate, apatite, etc.\nOrganic components include L-cystine, Uric Acid and Urate salts …).\nI have read that in the US and UK 8-12% of men and 4-6% of women\nwill develop kidney stones at some time in their lives.\nThree factors are responsible for uric acid nephrolithiasis:\nlow pH, hyperuricosuria and low urine volume.\nUric acid precipitation and stone formation has been correlate\nwith very acidic urine.\nSo… excuse me if I started to talk about one of the medical aspects\nof the death of Jesus …\nBut the fact of knowing the causes of the death of Jesus seems\nto be an important question in order to better understand the Shroud\nand also the alterations suffered by the blood of Jesus …\nI hope in your answer.\n\n","date":"February 5, 2015 at 8:39

secondary hyperuricemia this situation occurs for exemple when there is increased cell turnover breakdown as in lymphomas and leukemia or chemotherapy of malignant diseases.\nNormouricemic people seldom develop uric acid calculi and although extrreme dehydration would be a precipitating condition for uric acid crystals formation and aggregation and stone formation it would take time for that to occur and we cannot exactly know how long would it take.\nAnd why not calcium oxalate crystals?\nUric acid nephroitiasis no doubt could cause ureteral spasms with excruciating lumbar pain if it really happened during the hours preceding Jesus death on the cross, and it would be an addicional cause of suffering. nevertheless for acute renal failure to occur, urine flow had to be completely compromised by obstruction of both ureters.\nAcute failure can be a primary cause of death but it will not kill the patient in a few hours.\nIf this surmised renal failure was another cause contributive to the death of the Man of the Shroud in my modest opinion as a physician I think hypovolemic schock caused by scourging wounds, dehydration «per se» and neurogenic autonomic system disfunction by the extreme sufferings were the possible main causes, not obstructing renal calculi.\nBut even if renal function impairment occured it would be a serious adverse clinical condition but not a direct cause of death.\nThe death of the Man of the Shroud was caused mainly by asphixia hastened by muscle disfunction because of a state of impaired blood flow due to hypovolemic schock.\nI grant there are other possibilities as myocardial infarction or cardiac arithmia but this is my humble opinion.\n                                                                 regards\n

pero\npersonalmente estoy de pleno acuerdo con Antero de Frias en que la muerte\ndebió producirse por asfixia.\nEl abdomen del Hombre de la TS está abombado, lleno de aire, y el tórax\nestá en inspiración forzada.\nEn las situaciones de stress y ansiedad el aire se deglute, se traga, pasando\nal aparato digestivo por lo que el abdomen se “abomba” empujando hacia\narriba al músculo

system\ninclude:\nsupersaturation, complexation of ions, solution pH, crystal growth inhibitors, and\nthe structure and properties of the supporting matrix…\nI have read that:\n> the ionized form of uric acid, has a limited solubility under physiological conditions,\nand its saturation level in the plasma at pH 7.4 is 6.8 mg/dL\nSo …\nTo say something intelligent we must at least know which\nwas the meal of the Last Supper!\nBut we don’t know what was the exact ancient menu of Passover\nbecause the Passover Seder as we know it developed after 70 C. E.\nIf I am right when Jews today sit down to celebrate the Passover Seder, they use a book known as the Haggadah.\nThe Hebrew word haggadah literally means “telling”; the title refers to the book’s purpose: to provide the ordered framework through which the story of Passover is told at the Seder\n(one of the fundamental purposes of the celebration, as stated in Exodus 13:8: “And you shall tell your child on that day, ‘It is because of what the Lord did for me when I went forth from Egypt.’”)\nSee also: unleavened bread, bitter herbs and wine…\nSo Calcium Oxalate crystals seem to be more probable as stones composition.\nHere I am referring to the fact that Jesus was put in critical condition (little or perhaps no water) durations his imprisonment and the sad mock trial.\n… and regarding the timing of crystallization of stones I can only say : “I’m not a doctor” …\n(= Individuals with hyperoxaluria often have calcium oxalate kidney stones.  link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoxaluria ), but I think there is some probability. In each case, the kidney function may already have been compromised (before the crucifixion) by the lack of water and by flagellation.\nWhat do you think?\nB.T.W.:\nQuestion:\n>What genes are related to primary hyperoxaluria?\nAnswer:\n>Mutations in the AGXT and GRHPR genes cause primary hyperoxaluria.\nThe breakdown and processing of certain sugars and protein building blocks (amino acids) produces a substance called glyoxylate. Normally, glyoxylate is converted to the amino acid glycine or to a compound called glycolate through the action of two enzymes, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, respectively. Mutations in the AGXT or GRHPR gene cause a shortage of these enzymes, which prevents the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine or glycolate. As levels of glyoxylate build up, it is converted to oxalate. Oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate deposits, which can damage the kidneys and other organs.\nLink:\nhttp://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-hyperoxaluria\nSo we should investigate the genetic issue. But this is a very hard task…\n\n","date":"February 6, 2015 at 10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/05/set-your-dvr-an-unprecedented-cnn-event-on-march-1/","cat":"video","id":"comment-189720","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Set Your DVR:  An Unprecedented CNN Event on March 1","post":"Errata Corrige:\nduring his imprisonment and the sad mock trial.\nand not:\n>durations his imprisonment and the sad mock trial.  !!!\n— — —\nQ.:\n>How do people inherit primary hyperoxaluria?\nA.:\n>This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nhttp://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-hyperoxaluria\nNow I have only made a vague hypothesis.\nSo: do not take me to the letter!\n Furthermore, the idea that the body of the Son of God is free from diseases (ie: a perfect human body) makes us inclined to think that this assumption is wrong.\nBut the genetic question remains intriguing (although genetics and ancient DNA are very difficult problems to solve!) and then I think Kelly Kearse could give an adequate response.\nPrimary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is an autosomal recessive\ninherited metabolic disease, characterized by progressive kidney failure due to renal deposition of calcium oxalate. Mutations in the AGXT gene, encoding the liver-specific enzyme alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase, are responsible for the disease…\nSo, for now, (IMO) is a very risky and vague idea …\n\n","date":"February 6, 2015 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/05/set-your-dvr-an-unprecedented-cnn-event-on-march-1/","cat":"video","id":"comment-189724","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Set Your DVR:  An Unprecedented CNN Event on March 1","post":"“Finding Jesus: Faith, Fact, Forgery, which explores the many mysteries of the Bible while scientifically proving what we already know spiritually: that Jesus lived, was crucified, arose and ascended back to heaven.”\nI am very skeptical about this comment.
