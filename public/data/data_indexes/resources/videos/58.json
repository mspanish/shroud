[{"title":"The Real Face of Jesus to re-air on History Channel","post":"I have watched the video and noticed that some of the experts support the idea of a burst of energy. They follow the line of the discussions on the Shroud in which those supporting the energy/radiation field theory, tend to attribute the source of that energy to a supernatural effect (Fanti) or a byproduct of the resurrection (Jackson, Russ Breault). Another theory supports the authenticity of the Shroud also, but the image formation mechanism is attributed to a natural chemical reaction (Millard or other). It could be said that the supporters of radiation/energy hypothesis tend to think that the source of that energy is not “natural”(roughly speaking)\nHowever, an energy based mechanism could better account for the 3D effect, since in general, intensity values of radiation/energy fields tend to be lower the higher the distance to the source is.\n\n","date":"December 13, 2011 at 10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/13/the-real-face-of-jesus-to-re-air-on-history-channel/","cat":"video","id":"comment-5479","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Face of Jesus to re-air on History Channel","post":"Nevertheless, there could be a natural explanation for the source of that energy.

To believe that idea (of an earthquake producing an image like that on a cloth), someone must have more faith in miracle than to believe it is due to some form of energy coming from the resurrection itself…  \nAnd concerning this eternal debate about the image formation process, I think the best thing we can conclude is that, in the present state of our knowledge of the Shroud and keeping in mind that all the different natural hypothesis have NOT been fully tested yet, I think we can say that the image formation process is still unknown for the moment BUT that doesn’t necessarily mean that is was due to some unnatural or miraculous process.  I think it’s the very best conclusion that we can draw for the moment, until a new series of direct tests could be performed on the cloth and until new laboratory experiments could be done to test every possible image formation hypothesis.  More work need to be done to be able to conclude something different that what I just said.  Much more work…\nI think even Ron can agree with me on this conclusion ! ;-)\n\n","date":"December 13, 2011 at 11:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/13/the-real-face-of-jesus-to-re-air-on-history-channel/","cat":"video","id":"comment-5483","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Face of Jesus to re-air on History Channel","post":"Yannick, please have a look at the set of experiments carried out by Giovanna de Liso with images obtained in earthquakes and presented at the 2010 Conference hosted at ENEA\nhttp://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf\n\n","date":"December 13, 2011 at 3:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/13/the-real-face-of-jesus-to-re-air-on-history-channel/","cat":"video","id":"comment-5488","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Face of Jesus to re-air on History Channel","post":"You can see an alternative hypotheses for a natural explanation of a source of radiation in Dr. Silverman’s interview on http://www.shroud-enigma.com  (formerly shroudTV.con)\n\n","date":"December 13, 2011 at 2:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/13/the-real-face-of-jesus-to-re-air-on-history-channel/","cat":"video","id":"comment-5487","author":"David Rolfe","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Face of Jesus to re-air on History Channel","post":"Dear David,\nwhat kind of medicine is Dr. Silverman practicing? I have attended his presentation at the Frascati meeting in 2010 and I have listened to this interview. I am baffled by the connections (if any) he is making between the Shroud and the physic he is describing. He does mention many other researchers’ findings (Lavoie comes to mind), but I do not see what he is bringing new as precise physic descriptions related to the Shroud. As for his descriptions of time vs mind and space, I think they are simply plays on words and basic concepts of the Special Theory of Relativity. His description of Quantum Mechanics vs consciousness is quite unrelated to the Shroud and is more baffling than enlightening, not to mention that he is giving a typical discourse of extrapolating the meaning of Quantum Mechanics in domains that were never intended for it. I do not see how his descriptions on consciousness/mind/body/time is related to the Shroud besides perhaps as a pastoral methodology, but I very much doubt it.\nBest regards.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2011 at 6:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/13/the-real-face-of-jesus-to-re-air-on-history-channel/","cat":"video","id":"comment-5518","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Face of Jesus to re-air on History Channel","post":"I remain VERY skeptical about those images in the sense I always said before : making images on linen is very easy.  But making images on linen with the very same exact chemical and physical properties of the Shroud has never been acheived (as I know).  I’ve not read the article yet (don’t worry I’ll do it soon), but I don’t think they acheived the same exact image properties because this article didn’t get much attention (I wasn’t even aware of it).  If those images would really be like the Shroud, I think this article would have made more noise…  Personally, I don’t think those experiments are searching in the right direction, but of course, it’s just my own opinion and I can be wrong with my feeling.  Remember that I really believe that nature can be really surprising sometimes.  So, who really knows ?\n\n","date":"December 13, 2011 at 4:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/13/the-real-face-of-jesus-to-re-air-on-history-channel/","cat":"video","id":"comment-5489","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Real Face of Jesus to re-air on History Channel","post":"Oh, by the way, when you’ll read Rogers book, he talk longly about all those Corona Discharge hypothesis and show with very good arguments that all those hypothesis are VERY VERY unlikely (to stay polite).
