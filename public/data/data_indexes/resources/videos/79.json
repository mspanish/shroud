[{"title":"Two Articles on the Francesa Saracino Documentary","post":"The original idea conveyed by Proff. Conti in the Italian version I am afraid is not correctly captured in the English translation we see in the post. In fact, Prof. Conti is AGAINST the idea of the Shroud being medieval.\nA quick search indicates that PierLuigi Conti has got eight papers in JCR journals which at least, speaks in favour of his scientific profile. However, it would be great if those original raw figures from Tucson laboratory never made public before, could now be freely granted to anyone to corroborate his conclusions after an open discussion. I am afraid that as many other things in this world of the Shroud (photos, samples…) this will never happen….\nAt this point, I would have a question for the authors: In a recent peer-reviewed paper (1) the authors show that Arizona data belonged to different subsamples. Have the mathematicians consulted for this documentary taken this into account?\nNevertheless, the most interesting thing is that again, someone independently states that when you consider the entire Shroud – four yards of linen – “we could have a ripple hundreds or even several thousand years”. That is, after   the paper by Morgan where he analyzed the UV image of the test area, and after this recent peer-reviewed paper (1) once again  we have a trend. Fascinating.\n(1) Marco Riani, Anthony C. Atkinson, Giulio Fanti,Fabio Crosilla\n, 2012. Regression analysis with partially labelled regressors: carbon\n dating of the Shroud of Turin\n. Stat.
