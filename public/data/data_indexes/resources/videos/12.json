What I meant was that according to Heller and Adler there is nothing on the cloth which could make an image, no paint, ink, rust, sponge fragments, papyrus, starch, sugars, protein etc. etc. Any image of anything is made of degraded cellulose. If this is true, then no only did the recently dead warm-ish body produce whatever it was, but so did a wide variety of other chemicals, hair, sponge, iron, wood, brass, flowers, thorns. This is scarcely credible. Daveb’s cloud of alpha particles will also need a great deal more detailed explanation before they are really a valid explanation.

The following web-site shows that in Northern Italy or nearby during the last 40 years there were no fewer than 10 earthquakes ranging in magnitude from 4.9 to 6.0, most of them of shallow depth none more than 28 km, most of them around 10 km.  Many of them appear to have occurred in the general Piedmont area.  These would have been significant earthquakes and significant shocks would have been experienced over a wide area there.  Two of the ‘quakes are said to have occurred 3 years ago, and one 7 years ago.  Granted we get many more than this in NZ, but there is sufficient indication from this data for Piedmont to be classed as a moderately active seismic zone.  There would be very many more earthquakes of magnitude less than 5.0, which is still a significant level of magnitude.\nhttp://earthquaketrack.com/it-12-turin/biggest\n\n","date":"November 13, 2015 at 4:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/09/because-i-dont-see-it/","cat":"video","id":"comment-214561","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
