I’m a skeptic, and I’m objective (and courageous) and I consider everything. I don’t have preordained prejudices – indeed, until a couple of years ago I considered that the Shroud was on balance authentic. Even if I had prejudices, they would not forbid me to consider evidence. So pray tell, Leon, which bit of information do you think I haven’t considered?

Kazarian\nAbstract:\n>The potential of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) imaging for the characterisation of the chemical components of paint cross sections from old master paintings was investigated. Three cross sections were chosen to cover a variety of the analytical problems encountered in samples from paintings. The binding medium and degradation products in a green paint sample from a fifteenth-century Florentine painting were imaged, as well as a thin layer within a cross-section from a fifteenth-century German painting, and multiple thin surface coatings on a painting of the 1760s by Peter Romney. The application of chemometric methods for further analysis of the large data set generated for each sample was also explored. The study demonstrated the advantages of ATR-FTIR imaging, which allowed images to be obtained with high spatial resolution (ca. 3–4 μm) without the need to microtome the sample. The gain in sensitivity in detecting trace materials and the information derived from the location of these compounds in the sample was especially valuable, improving interpretation of the FTIR analysis and extending knowledge of the sample composition beyond that obtainable with other analytical techniques.\nLink:\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-008-2092-y\n— — —\nHere another study (not on linen, but about the paper!):\nAncient and modern paper characterization by FTIR and Micro-Raman spectroscopy\nVito Librando, Zelica Minniti, Salvatore Lorusso\nConservation Science in Cultural Heritage\n(Quaderni di Scienza della Conservazione) \nLink:\nhttp://conservation-science.unibo.it/article/view/2700\nhttp://link.springer\n— — —\nHere the other way:\n“AFM CFM chemometric methods”\n= CFM consists of measuring the interaction forces between a modified “functionalized” tip and a surface by using atomic force microscopy (AFM).\n— —\n>CFM has been primarily developed by Charles Lieber at Harvard University in 1994.\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_force_microscopy\n— —\n>CFM measures the chemical interactions between functionalized tips and sample to determine the chemical nature of surfaces and facilitate studies of chemical bonding enthalpy and surface energy.

However, bearing in mind the many blood cults of the fourteenth century and their popularity and the lucrative possibilities of having Christ’s blood (e.g the monastery at Hailes in England built their main building from the fruits of pilgrims visiting their relic of Christ’s blood), it is quite possible that real blood was added to the Shroud. In this I am not supported by the expert opinion I have consulted but in an age when consecrated hosts bled ( e.g. After transubstantiation  with what the Church insisted was  the ‘real’ blood of Christ), crucifixes spurted blood from the body of Christ when hit by heretics or Jews and there were many shrines claiming to have the blood of Christ, the Shroud could hardly be left out!
