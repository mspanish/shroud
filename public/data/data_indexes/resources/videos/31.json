More time given to a reenactment of Nicholas Allen making a medieval photograph than in trying to outdo Mel Gibson doing torturous reenactment. A lot of John Jackson snapping 35 mm photographs of a photograph and Mark Guscin explaining what might have happened, maybe. The Shroud is probably not real, we are told, but that doesn’t matter because if it was it would be proof of something, maybe.\n\n","date":"March 2, 2015 at 5:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/01/open-discussion-about-episode-one-examining-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"television","id":"comment-192162","author":"Paulette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Open Discussion About Finding Jesus, Episode One: Examining the Shroud of Turin","post":"Mostly agree. Typical show, nothing special. But I don’t think it was ‘sceptical’ -like most of the shows of the kind it was ‘neutral’ (this neutrality was forced of course, because sceptics really don’t have any serious arguments in this argue) for political correctness.\nFull episode available for watching here:\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/02/26/finding-jesus-season-1-episode-1.cnn\nThe ‘In search of the Holy Treasure’ was much better I think.

Steering completely AWAY from what the Shroud shows us, we are taken on a visual journey of Jesus carrying the complete cross which, by their own admission, would have weighed 300lbs.  It would have been impossible to carry.  Especially someone as brutalized as the Man in this cloth.  We KNOW the Shroud depicts the shoulder wounds to have been made by the patibulum (cross-beam).  This would have been tied upon the Man using ropes.  More surprising was when they contradicted this obvious (intentional?) error, by then inexplicably soliciting John Jackson’s obviously correct interpretation for the shoulder wounds.  How could this blatant Shroud falsehood have been included in the final cut for Finding Jesus?  During those scenes of Him carrying His cross on the Via Dolorosa, I almost expected to see Veronica coming out from among the crowd to wipe the face of Jesus.  Sincere, legitimate, objective efforts must used when giving the public Shroud information.  Every attempt should be made to ensure that misrepresentation (willful?) of what is already known to be fact is eliminated.  The mistreatment of the shoulder wounds was glaring!\n\n","date":"March 2, 2015 at 10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/01/open-discussion-about-episode-one-examining-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"television","id":"comment-192193","author":"David O.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Open Discussion About Finding Jesus, Episode One: Examining the Shroud of Turin","post":"Sadly this was just another media event to sensationalize a story, by omitting the scientific peer reviewed facts, in order to have a perpetual money making show.\nL.J.
