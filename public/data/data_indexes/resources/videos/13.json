[{"title":"Hawking to Appear on the Discovery Channel","post":"I get daily email devotionals from Joni, another person who is a quadrapalegic and is, therefore, severely handicapped. Not that the handicaps of Joni or Hawkins qualifies them as an authority on God, but I find the contrast between these two personalities to be stark and opposite to the extreme. Joni is just as convinced of God’s existance as Hawkins is convinced of the opposite. Her daily messages not only encourage faith in God but they also strongly encourage Discipleship, which is the discipline of making your actions line up with the example of Christ. Joni is a hard-core Believer, just as Hawkins is a hard-core Unbeliever. Both people are famous. Both are respected. So, which one is right? \nIMO, I think it’s very sad that Hawkins has had to endure all these years of suffering without God’s help and comfort. I wonder if there is some bitterness that feeds his denial of God? Is there some resentment, is this how he lashes out at a God who so confined him to such an awful disease?  \nI can’t help but wonder, because why does Hawkins need to bring it into the discussion at all? What does it MATTER, if God does not exist?  Keep God out of it, if THAT is what you believe. It’s interesting, to me, that athiests seem to enjoy talking about God and the Bible even more than Christians do. \nI really doubt Hawkins is as dedicated to athiesm as he thinks, or he would not feel compelled to convince himself so often and so vehemently.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2011 at 6:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/04/hawking-to-appear-on-the-discovery-channel/","cat":"science","id":"comment-3516","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"}]
