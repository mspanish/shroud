[{"title":"Promotion for The Holy Winding Sheet: Exploring the Shroud ofÂ Turin","post":"I recorded and watched the program.  I enjoyed it,  though because I have been following the Shroud research close for the last few years I did not see anything new.  I am one of those that is referred to as a believer.  I believe that the Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ from which he resurrected through.  Another way of thinking is that one moment, his dead physical human body was laying within the Shroud (laying on the bottom half with the top half placed and wrapped over the body and when his Divine soul re-entered his body, the body dissolved and was reconstituted outside of the wrapping.  His Divine body and soul  were free of the Shroud and was free to move about in the physical world as we know it.  His new God given combined Body and Soul were able to appear and disappear at his will. This was the remainder of his earthly life until his Ascension 40 days later.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2015 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/21/promotion-for-the-holy-winding-sheet-exploring-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"television","id":"comment-203048","author":"ekmcmahon","site":"shroudstory"}]
