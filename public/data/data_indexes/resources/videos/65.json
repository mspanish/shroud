[{"title":"Time Out Productions presents Russ Breault","post":"I would really like to see a good presentation given by Russ Breault, and I know there are several available.  Sadly I don’t think this is one of them.  We saw a lot of TV broadcast of the interviewer at the start, and heard a tantalising script from Russ, and a few out-of-sync stills.  Clearly the video and screen shots were not following the script.  Regrettably this particular broadcast will not I think persuade anyone.  After about ten minutes of miscued stills, which did nothing to illuminate the several excellent points that Russ was making, I had to give up.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2014 at 12:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/20/time-out-productions-presents-russ-breault/","cat":"video","id":"comment-152952","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Time Out Productions presents Russ Breault","post":"Dave, I agree with you.  Unfortunately I could not see the slides.  I told them which ones to use but they messed up the order so what I was describing was not what was being shown.  Too bad.  Very disappointing.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2014 at 7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/20/time-out-productions-presents-russ-breault/","cat":"video","id":"comment-153329","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"}]
