[{"title":"Video from Turin Appearing on YouTube. Expect More.","post":"I happened to see Randy’s post at the right time and was able to watch all but the first minute or two-I was pretty impressed at the clarity of the broadcast, even looking at the you tube clip here on the iPad, it seems exceptionally clear.  Ttranslations of certain spoken portions of the service will likely follow at some point-It will be especially interesting to hear Pope Francis’ remarks.\nThanks for making all of this available Dan.  Happy Easter.\n\n","date":"March 30, 2013 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/video-from-turin-appearing-on-youtube-expect-more/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-28889","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Video from Turin Appearing on YouTube.
