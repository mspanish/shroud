But I’m not keen on ‘leading’ either. Or ‘expert,’ for that matter…\nTo be an expert at all you have to have a fairly good, accurate and honest knowledge of all the evidence, and it is not obvious from the high school lecture linked to above that Dr Phillips is aware of any of the evidence contradicting the statements he presents as fact. (To save others the bother of ploughing through it, he is a member of the Shroud Science Group and adheres to the “body and shroud floating in space” hypothesis of image formation). He is also factually incorrect in one or two places – a photo he shows specifically to illustrate that the blood stains are undisturbed is actually of a blob of wax, for example, and he is hopelessly confused about the directionality of the radiation supposedly emanating from the resurrecting body. \nWhat is the Vatican Apostolorum College? Those words, in that order, appear on the internet exclusively in connection with Dr Phillips himself. If I wanted to accredit myself to something, I would at least name an institution that could be confirmed. There is a ‘Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum’ or in English the Pontifical College of the Queen of the Apostles which offers a Diploma in Shroud Studies and lists a very impressive team of Teachers/Lecturers, so perhaps he means that.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2014 at 8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/new-dvd-of-the-women-of-grace-programs-on-the-shroud-plus-some/","cat":"lectures","id":"comment-98083","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New DVD of the Women of Grace Programs on the Shroud Plus Some","post":"Hugh, Only because you’re a stickler for rigour, I’d comment that in English usage the word “The” in this context need not mean that Phillips is the primary leading expert on the Shroud, but might be understood as distinguishing him from any other person styled Dr Wayne Phillips not so qualified.

Also the theories of Jackson, Fanti, and Paczek include a need of a radiation released in a 360 degree fashion with some degree of simultaneous flattening of the cloth. Therefore the sides of the body show no image since the cloth no longer covered the sides. These are accurately portrayed theories.

The perpendicular radiation theory certainly comes from John Jackson and Gulio Fanti just form memory. The dominate talk and publications do favor the perpendicular radiation.

I also think the SSG does about a good a job as possible with the ego’s flying around as they do.The data is on the shroud. If you work backwards from the given characteristics of the image, the shroud in 2 positions with perpendicular radiation is presently the best explanation.

Search this blog on St. Louis for several postings.

With centuries of rolling, folding, displaying, etc. it is hard to justify. Let me see one picture that is clearly not possibly just a worn down bloodstain.\n1) Perpendicular radiation? What makes it perpendicular? How does this work? Radiation, by the way, is natural. Only the source of it is in question. Miraculous is it? Wouldn’t 100% miraculous nonenergetic information transfer and molecular chemical change work just as well? Why depend on an accidental byproduct of a miracle? If it is not accidental but purposeful why not just go for another miracle? Philosophically, Jackson, Fanti, et. al. don’t make sense? Theologically, they don’t make sense. Scientifically, they don;t make sense. I think the image is real but I don’t see sufficient evidence from anyone in SSG or anywhere else for any explanation of the image. Not yet.

As you will know from your own examination of Shroud 2.0, the “drop of blood” which appears between 1:50 and 2:15 in Part 5 of the YouTube video of your lecture to the Jesuit high School Tampa is indisputably a blob of red wax, and looks absolutely nothing like any of the reputed bloodstains. You accompany this photo with the words “…none of the clots are disturbed; they’re complete, perfectly shaped clots as they originally bled out into the cloth.” Actually, as you must know, every single bloodstain has been almost wholly erased, leaving minute particles of blood tucked into interstices of the fibres and threads, and a pinkish stain indicating their original extent.\nYou may well have taken the photo from a shroud book in good faith, but it’s wrong. Regular readers of this blog will know that I very rarely accuse people of fraud or fabrication, and this misidentification is almost certainly an honest mistake, but that doesn’t make it less wrong.\nFrom 3:59 of the same video, you say: “So, the atoms disintegrate into all the components of the atom … and radiate 360 degrees in all directions. … But where is the shroud? It’s only at 180 degrees; it’s on the bottom, and it’s the top, so all the radiation going this way [indicates horizontally] doesn’t do anything about an image. Therefore no ears, no cheeks.”\nIn this statement you cover two angles of radiation, not 360. If the tip of the nose, for example, emitted radiation in all directions (an expanding sphere of radiation, in fact), the radiation from that one point alone would contact the shroud as a disc of radius approximately 50cm, most intensely at 90 degrees (vertically above the nose) and diminishing towards the circumference of the disc. The trouble with this is, of course, that every other point on the body would do the same, producing an amorphous blur across the sheet.\n“These are accurately conveyed theories,” you say. Well, I’m sorry, but accurately conveyed non-sense is still non-sense, wouldn’t you agree?\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 5:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/new-dvd-of-the-women-of-grace-programs-on-the-shroud-plus-some/","cat":"lectures","id":"comment-98619","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New DVD of the Women of Grace Programs on the Shroud Plus Some","post":"Sorry Hugh,\nI still beg to continue a gentleman’s disagreement with you and find everything I said as presented on the “theories” of image formation proposed by the 3 authors to be correctly presented.\n Of course you can pick apart details because no theory yet fits the 100’s of characteristic proven to be part of the image and there are  “holes”. These theories are considered to be the best attempts so far at explaining the image. These researchers are members of the Shroud Science Group of which I am a member and represent the leading researchers in the world on the science of the shroud. I am not a researcher only a communicator. The membership consist of many the original STURP team of 1978 and whose peer revieved publications have in my belief debunked the C14 dating of 1988.\nAll this information I quote is available on the web site “shroud.com”.

Please read the work of Dr.Jackson (fall through hypothesis + perpendicular radiation), Fanti (corona radiation hypothesis) and Paczek (weightless perpendicular radiation hypothesis).

He seems to have picked up the idea from scientists at an Albuquerque pre-STURP conference, some of whom had been involved in the nearby atomic bomb tests. Many will recall Wilson’s illustration of a permanent shadow of a pipe-line hand valve left by the Hiroshima 1944 explosion. \nFor radiation to be the primary cause of the image, it would seem necessary to have recourse to a miraculist explanation, which seems to be the road that Giulio Fanti and his associates seem to be pursuing.  However a miraculist explanation ought only to be pursued when other explanations, particularly naturalistic explanations have been exhausted, and this is far from being the case.  Quite simply, the experimental studies have not been pursued.  No-one can say what happens to a linen cloth fabricated to the ancient processes, containing a dead body for say 36 hours given inhibition with aloes and other spices, under the right environmental conditions. \nRay Rogers succeeded in obtaining some coloration of Edgerton bleached linen treated with dextrin and saponaria on exposing it to ammonia. This is as far as experimental work has gone. It says nothing about image resolution of detail. Rogers believed that Maillard reaction was the primary cause, but also believed that it required something else.  He was dismissive of radiation being involved, because of the superficiality of the image which could not be attained by radiation. \nGiovanna de Liso’s 12 years of experiments in the moderately seismic area of Piedmont has produced to my mind some of the most promising images so far. She claims that images only formed under certain combinations of specific conditions: earthquake, release of radon gas (common in earthquakes), simultaneous variations in the geo-magnetic and electric fields, and in the presence of iron-bearing rock. It is conceivable that radon gas may have an important bearing, perhaps on collimating the molecules forming the image. Perhaps this is why the image is orthogonal apparently aligned parallel to the gravitational field. Perhaps the time-dependent instability of these molecules were a key factor in image intensity producing the 3-D effect. \nThere remains considerable scope for further research before nauralistic explanations can be excluded. Notions of a body floating in space between two parallel horizontal layers of linen being spontaneously radiated by body emanations tend to bring serious Shroud research into disrepute, and is properly labelled by skeptics as pseudo-science of the worst kind. \nThrow away the excimer lasers, and concentrate on some proper and credible scientific experimental research.  Exhaust the naturalistic explanations before prematurely copping out in claiming a miracle.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 7:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/new-dvd-of-the-women-of-grace-programs-on-the-shroud-plus-some/","cat":"lectures","id":"comment-98645","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New DVD of the Women of Grace Programs on the Shroud Plus Some","post":"Dan,\nSorry my mistake.

The radiation hypothesis is not one I ascribe to, but however it is expressed it must make sense. The radiation could all be vertical, in which case, perhaps, it might correlate to the image, but it cannot, as you describe, be “360 degrees” unless the radiation from any particular part of the body vastly overlaps the radiation from all the other parts. I am fully aware of all the ideas of the Shroud Science Group (of which I too am a member), and am familiar with all the STURP papers. I am also very aware of what has been, and what has not been, published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. That is precisely the reason why I am able to challenge them.

I presented the “hovering” 2 position theory. Dr Jackson’s “fall through theory” through a mechanically transparent body also requires some tautness in the cloth for a high resolution photograph affect -therefore 2 positions. You have not mentioned the 2 position theory so you must not accept it. It is necessary for both theories of radiation image formation-fall through or hovering. \nThis is all conjecture but working backward from the facts of the image in all its totality of characteristics, it is my opinion that the hovering is the most plausible of all theories and the “fall through” second. I am sure Dr Jackson would disagree with me. Obviously this has to be a supernatural controlled event as explained.\n2 positions theory:\n1) the cloth is wrapped tightly in the tomb and blood stains transfer to the cloth.\n2) at the moment of the resurrection the cloth unfolds and becomes incompletely taught. At that time a radiation of some type emits from the body in 360 degree fashion as the body dematerializes. Since the cloth is semi-taught, it has no sides–only top, bottom and head. The image transfers in columnar/perpendicular fashion only to the top, bottom, and head areas. The radiation provides a photograph like image in those 3 areas only. Any radiation emanating perpendicularly from the sides of the body goes off into the tomb walls or some where? Since the reach of the image transfer mechanism is believed to span only a distance of 4-6 inches this adds to the weakness or lack of image production from the sides of body.\nWhere is the contradiction now? Your prior explanation is faulty and your data is incorrect possibly because you did not know the details of my subjective/objective mix belief.  With the details above, your opinion would be appreciated even if it is still negative. I hope these details helps our discussion. It is what I call the “best guess” theory. \nIf you have a better explanation for image formation or want to discuss any thing above, I am willing to engage.\nDoc\n\n","date":"April 13, 2014 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/new-dvd-of-the-women-of-grace-programs-on-the-shroud-plus-some/","cat":"lectures","id":"comment-98936","author":"J.

I have done trials similar to Lavoie, with parallel sets applied directly to the cloth-there are multiple factors that can affect the extent of blood transfer, absorption to a cloth-\nThe 80% referenced here-is that in relation to the bloodstain volume or amount remaining or amount gone?  In my own opinion, there are so many unknowns even with the transport, let alone, what might or might not have happened in the tomb once the body arrived there.  Regarding transport, I am not a physician and have a healthy respect for Barbet, but who really knows?  What if someone firmly grasped or applied pressure to that area using cloths as a makeshift stretcher, or elevated the body in a certain position-could the same notion be applied?  It’s natural to try to fill in the gaps and speculate what may have or could have occurred, but I think one can only go so far-\n\n","date":"April 13, 2014 at 6:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/new-dvd-of-the-women-of-grace-programs-on-the-shroud-plus-some/","cat":"lectures","id":"comment-98921","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New DVD of the Women of Grace Programs on the Shroud Plus Some","post":"On the way back from mass this morning I picked up a dead pheasant off the road and have acquired some blood!

I presented the “hovering” 2 position theory. Dr Jackson’s “fall through theory” through a mechanically transparent body also requires some tautness in the cloth for a high resolution photograph affect -therefore 2 positions. You have not mentioned the 2 position theory so you must not accept it. It is necessary for both theories of radiation image formation-fall through or hovering. This is all conjecture but working backward from the facts of the image in all its totality of characteristics, it is my opinion that the hovering is the most plausible of all theories and the “fall through” second. [..]Where is the contradiction now?[..]It is what I call the “best guess” theory. ”\nWith all due respect to Dame Piczek, Dr. Lavoie, and Dr. Jackson: these theories are highly speculative for no reason whatsoever. Dame Piczek has never presented any measurements or well founded geometric argument to support her “tightly taut” theory. She uses her artistic intuition to support this theory. Is artistry the way to approach such a complex subject? Dr. Lavoie made many interesting observations about the bloodstains in relation to the image. But there are major contradictions as part of them based on simple geometric reasoning regarding the two-position cloth theories (in a few words, the two-position cloth theories imply that there would be incoherence between the bloodstains and the image due to the vertical shift, a point on which Dr. Lavoie has never addressed because he focused on the hotizontal shift.) . Dr. Jackson theory of the the cloth falling through a “mechanically transparent body” has no numerical foundation.\nYou have to look for the simplest explanation possible that explains the facts (Remember Einstein’s statement here, the modern statement of Ocam’s razor principle).  And the simplest one is that there is only one position. I invite you to read a paper I presented at the 2005 Dallas conference.
