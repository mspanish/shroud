If there are some that weren’t, please let me know, I’m not an expert on the entirety of Shroud copies.  But wholesale production of fake Shrouds is basically a fallacy.\n\n","date":"March 15, 2015 at 11:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/15/did-anyone-like-it/","cat":"television","id":"comment-193426","author":"Nabber","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Anyone Like It?","post":"I didn’t like it and sent an email to CNN expressing my disappointment.\nTo me the program was slanted to make a reasonable person believe that in 1988 science “proved” the Shroud to be a forgery….\nThey did not mention Ray Rogers and his efforts later in which it was shown that the sample used for the carbon-dating tests likely came from a patch sewn into the Shroud in 1532.\nThey did not mention that there is pollen on the Shroud from plants which grow only in and around Jerusalem.\nAnd then they conclude with some clown telling us that photography existed in the 14th century without explaining why photography remained dormant until the latter part of the 19th century and, also, why no one else in those intervening 500+ years made a photograph.\n\n","date":"March 15, 2015 at 8:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/15/did-anyone-like-it/","cat":"television","id":"comment-193411","author":"leon ward","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did Anyone Like It?","post":"Didn’t I say this would happen?

Well, without knowing it he was underlining what Jesus is recorded to have said in the NT.\nOne can understand that no documentary can be 100% objective, a bit of sensationalism is needed to draw attention, when there is more money to fill coffers the better it becomes and, of course, there is always some serious material. It is a tactic, it is common, that is the world we live in….\nWhat I object to is the title “finding Jesus”. It is the result of growing scepticism and many people watch these documentaries thinking that new evidence has surfaced! To find Jesus you have to go take an extremely narrow path. How many are willing to do this?
