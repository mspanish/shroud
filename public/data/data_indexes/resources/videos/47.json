When will people start to think, we are talking about the 2nd person of the Holy Trinity – The Son of God needs a wife??.

Jeremiah was also single. A close reading of the gospels reveals that Jesus believed that what he taught was above Torah. Paul took the point further. Benedict XVI and Rabbi Jacob Neusner have discussed this.\nThe fashion now is science by documentary and history through sensationalism. If one takes Simcha seriously then there will be nothing left to believe in the Bible:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III\nHe is not an archaeologist, his investigation is agenda-based and filled with distortions, and this applies to the so-called Jesus family tomb, debunked above, the nails in Caiphas(? – the reading is contested),bride of God and the rest.\nProfessor James Charlesworth fell into his trap, then made his way out, realising the mistake he had made. He has also laid other traps and one famous paleographer was caught in one of them and also made his way out.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2014 at 7:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/science-channels-new-biblical-conspiracies-series/","cat":"video","id":"comment-176782","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Science Channel’s new Biblical Conspiracies series","post":"What is this “Gathering dust at the British Library is a 1500-year-old manuscript, written by an anonymous monk.” called?

It is a sixth century AD pseudepigraphal document in Syriac entitled “Joseph and Aseneth” and all Jacobovici did was to read (twist) it allegorically to read “Jesus and Mary Magdalene”. There is an English translation by David Cook, however is it worth consulting it? It will add nothing, top scholars have dismissed everything in this book, which is a kind of follow up of the “Da Vinci Code”. To see how material has been unscrupulously twisted in this long story, read what top archaeologists (Amos Kloner) and biblical scholars (Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer and François Bovon) have said:\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Parts_I_and_II\nThe link to Part III is above,and Part IV should be written in the beginning of next year.\n\n","date":"December 16, 2014 at 6:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/science-channels-new-biblical-conspiracies-series/","cat":"video","id":"comment-177066","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Science Channel’s new Biblical Conspiracies series","post":"Delighted to see Simcha Jacobovici and the old crew on a TV series– been a long time—!!!
