Everything I said about them you apparently agree with, so why the high horse?\nI was invited to the Jalsa by the editor of the Review of Religions Journal, on Barrie Schwortz’s recommendation, because I an am unconventional ‘Shroudie’ being both a determined Catholic and a doubter regarding the Shroud’s authenticity, and also, I hope, because I am friendly and lighthearted, and prepared to listen to all and to treat their opinions seriously.\nAs it happens, the Ahmadiyya Community believe that Jesus survived the crucifixion. As such, the possibility that the Shroud does not confirm Jesus’s death, either because it shows he was buried alive, or because it is not authentic anyway, is welcome news, but really I think many of them simply wanted to know more about it. Gathered in the tent were representatives of Islam, Judaism, Christianity and Hinduism, for whom the Shroud was a common point of interest.

Do you believe that His Holiness will swallow that?\nDifferent religions can indeed meet in harmony, and they should do that. But why involve a relic that is still controversial, and which is being interpreted to challenge the belief I mentioned? Is that harmony? No, it isn’t. There are many places where people of different religions can meet in harmony, where there is respect for the differing beliefs.\nWhy do Hindus in India and other places accept Jesus as Avatar, incarnation of God, without ever having heard of the Turin Shroud? They have either read the Gospels or have been guided by the great Hindu sages, many of them saintly men. During my on-site research into non-Christian sects and religions I have met and spoken to their leaders, whether preachers, priests, witches, wizards, and so on. One of them even told me that he was afraid how God would judge him because he was also worshipping evil entities. I then asked  him why he did not stop worshipping them. He said that God was above all of them, and he was referring to the Christian God. I told him that I thought God would pardon him because he was doing a lot of charity and putting food on the tables of the needy and he had no obligation to do so.
