Fanti) are very useful, but we cannot obtain the same results that we can reach using SPMs !\n— — —\nFor instance,\nhere what I have found about AFM and SNOM:\n“Opto-mechanical probe for combining atomic force microscopy\nand optical near-field surface analysis”\nby\nCamiel Van Hoorn  (VU University Amsterdam) and other researchers\nOptics Letters 08/2014; 39(16):4800. DOI: 10.1364/OL.39.004800 \nHere an excerpt from the Abstract:\n>We have developed a new easy-to-use probe that can be used to combine atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). We show that, using this device, the evanescent field, obtained by total internal reflection conditions in a prism, can be visualized by approaching the surface with the scanning tip. Fur-thermore, we were able to obtain simultaneous AFM and SNOM images of a standard test grating in air and in liquid.\n>The lateral resolution in AFM and SNOM mode was estimated to be 45 and 160 nm, respectively.\n>This new probe overcomes a number of limitations that commercial probes have, while yielding the same resolution. © 2014 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (060.2310) \nFiber optics; (180.4243) Near-field microscopy; (180.5810) Scanning microscopy; (060.2370) Fiber optics sensors. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) instruments are widely recognized as valuable tools for characterizing physical, chemical, electrical, electrochemical, and optical properties of materials at the nanometer scale.\n>Atomic force microscopy (AFM), for example, is routinely used to map the surface topography with a resolu-tion well beyond the optical limit, both in gaseous and liquid environments\n>By replacing the standard AFM cantilever with a tipped glass fiber, one can then equip the instrument with scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) capabilities. The latter can provide information on the optical field emerging from the sur-face of the sample with a lateral resolution of a few tens of nanometers.\n>The combination of AFM and SNOM has found applications in many fields, including cell biology and single molecule experiments.\n>Unfortunately, current AFM – SNOM probes come with some limitations. In the most widely used setups, the scanning fiber is glued to one of the two prongs of a piezoelectric tuning fork that cannot be immersed in conductive liquids\n>To obtain an image of a solid sur-face in a liquid environment, one thus needs to ensure the tuning fork is kept out of the immersion bath\n> In this configuration, the meniscus of the liquid on the fiber may influence the performance of the probe. Furthermore, tuning forks cannot be used in contact with the sample, hampering any possibility to perform contact mode scan-ning. This restriction can be overcome by replacing the probe with a tipped fiber bent in the form of a cantilever.\n>The position of the cantilever can then be monitored via an optical triangulation readout\n>Alternatively, a standard silicon AFM cantilever can be modified for near-field imaging by making a small hole at the tip apex\n>These configurations also facilitate experiments in liquids, but add the nuisance of the alignment procedure of the readout, which becomes even more tedious when the probe is immersed in a fluid.\n>In an earlier attempt to solve these technical issues, in 2001, Minh et al. presented a probe that could detect the SNOM signal via a hollow micromachined cantilever glued on top of an optical fiber\n>In 2011, we proposed to skip the gluing step by directly carving the cantilever out of the cleaved end of the fiber, which also adds the possibility to measure the cantilever deflection using fiber interferometry. In that experiment we showed that fiber-top probes can collect the SNOM signal throughout an entire AFM indentation stroke.\n>In 2006, that approach, today known as fiber-top technology, had already been used successfully for AFM imaging.\n>However, the manufacturing procedure of both Ming’s and our fiber-coupled cantilevers is still rather complex.\n>In this Letter, we propose to approach this problem via a new probe based on ferrule-top technology. … … …\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 8:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/nine-selected-and-revised-papers-from-the-bari-conference/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-192281","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nine Selected and Revised Papers from the Bari Conference","post":"I want to clarify:\nObviously ATR-FTIR is not a scanning probe microscopy…\n— —\nIf you want to improve the knowledges there is the following link:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrational_analysis_with_scanning_probe_microscopy\n>… …In 2007, AFM was combined with infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) spectroscopy to study the dissolution process of urea in a cyclohexane/butanol solution with a high spatial resolution. \nand there is the following way:\n> AFM/FTIR setup\n>Spatial resolution\n>The spatial resolution of an AFM/FTIR instrument is related to the contact area between the probe and sample\nBut, typically, an AFM/FTIR has a resolution of “only” 50–400 nm, for example, 100 nm…\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/nine-selected-and-revised-papers-from-the-bari-conference/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-192282","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nine Selected and Revised Papers from the Bari Conference","post":"Sorry… Yesterday I was quite finished off topic because I had some thoughts on my mind focused elsewhere (= the burial of Boris Nemtsov, etc.).\n— — —\nToday I have found another vague link …\nHere you can read some intervention on AFM (atomic force microscopy) for advanced textiles development :\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/groups/Using-atomic-force-microscopy-advanced-2815697.S.5804198193587568640\nHowever, even this reference is too vague, only serves to be able to discuss something in very vague terms.\n— — —\nWhat mainly interested me were the measurements on the degree of polymerization of the cellulose by the use of AFM techniques.\n\n","date":"March 4, 2015 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/nine-selected-and-revised-papers-from-the-bari-conference/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-192364","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Nine Selected and Revised Papers from the Bari Conference","post":"Here a vague example of study with AFM and FTIR controls:\nEffects of enzymatic treatments on surface morphology and chemical structure of linen fabrics\nB.

The aim of this work was to examine the effect of pectinase treatments on surface structure and chemical properties of greige linen fabrics by using instrumental techniques.\n>After enzymatic treatment, adequate removal of noncellulosic impurities from the fiber surface has been proved by AFM images and O1/C1 ratio of the treated surface.\n>Water drop test measurement and absorbance spectrographs of FTIR analysis have supported the results.

Surface changes of plasma treated cotton were observed with scanning electron microscopy. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy results show the decrease of C—C bonds in favor of C—O, O—C—O, C=O, and O=C—O bonds and higher O/C atomic ratio in plasma treated fibers.
