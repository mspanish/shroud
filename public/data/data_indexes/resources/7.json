I think it was Jung who asserted that the symbolism of a true mandala can never be exhausted.  The poetic aspect is what David Day appears to be bringing to light in his ‘Lirey Toga’.  It is a legitimate avenue, and cannot be derided, merely because it does not accord with the interests of those with a more scientific bent.  The Grail aspects have often been mentioned in various Conference papers.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2014 at 4:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/19/new-paper-the-lirey-toga/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-163831","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper:  The Lirey Toga","post":"Fair enough.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2014 at 5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/19/new-paper-the-lirey-toga/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-163846","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper:  The Lirey Toga","post":"Ah, very true.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2014 at 5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/19/new-paper-the-lirey-toga/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-163840","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper:  The Lirey Toga","post":"Max is going to have a field day with this one, in three…two…\n\n","date":"October 20, 2014 at 9:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/19/new-paper-the-lirey-toga/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-164030","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper:  The Lirey Toga","post":"The word “graal” has been used in French Literature since around 1180 CE i.e. one century and a half before the very word “grail” first appeared as an English term (in 1330 CE ) and was applied to the mythical quest object. Now in the 14th c. CE, French was the international vehicular language of the Catholic world. \n“In 1328, the last of the Capetians (Charles IV) died without an heir. The King of England asserted his right to the throne, but the French princes preferred Philippe VI of Valois (1337). So it was that two French-speaking kings struggled for control of the kingdom of France until 1453—the period known as the 100 Years’ War. This lengthy conflict weakened the French monarchy, which lost a number of provinces to England until the intervention of Constable Du Guesclin (1320–1380) under Charles V and later Joan of Arc (1412–1431) under Charles VII finally swung the advantage back to the King of France, who gradually retook Paris (1436),\nNormandy (1450), Guienne (1453), and other regions.”\n“In reaction against France, English replaced French at the Parliament of London in 1363. After the defeat of Agincourt (1415), the Treaty of Troyes (1420) recognized Henry V of England as the heir to the kingdom of France. He was the first king of England to use English in official documents, and he drew up his will in English. However, French continued to be the spoken language of the English court since most of England’s monarchs came from France.”\n(See  http://www.slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=french_history)\nSo recurring to the English appellation “The Holy Grail” to code (in English) “Lirey Toga” doesn’t make sense here at all since the appellation known by the French and English elite was first and foremost that of “Li Saint Graal” of which anagram just cannot be “The Lirey Toga”!\n\n","date":"October 20, 2014 at 11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/19/new-paper-the-lirey-toga/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-164060","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Paper:  The Lirey Toga","post":"Reminder:  the old French word ‘grail’ translates “(diamond-shaped) metallic trellice”.
