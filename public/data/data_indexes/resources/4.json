[{"title":"More on the ISA Tile and the “Prince of Peace”","post":"I fail to see the point of using modern Facial Recognition software in attempting to match the Issa mosaic with the Shroud face. I might be more persuaded by positive correlation results of comparing artists’ portraits with true-life photographs of their particular subjects; Or for that matter correlations among a broad selection of the various depictions of alleged copies of the Mandylion.  \nThe mosaic is an artist’s representation of his subject, quite possibly the Mandylion face. However we cannot put ourselves in the place of the artist, we do not know his intention, nor his artistic views on realistic portrayals, nor how he viewed his subject, whether it was from memory or simultaneous observation. He was constrained by the materials he had to hand, randomly shaped pieces of coloured glass or pottery, which he had to fit together as best he could. The Issa is not a modern-day photograph, nor is it of divine or miraculous origin. It is a human hand-crafted work, using a particular medium! Its claim to to being remarkable would seem to rest solely on its amazing survival in Edessa, where everything else Christian was destroyed by Turkish invaders in 1146.\n\n","date":"April 22, 2014 at 6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/22/more-on-the-isa-tile-and-the-prince-of-peace/","cat":"heaven_is_for_real","id":"comment-102289","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the ISA Tile and the “Prince of Peace”","post":"It was I wrote that Phil was a “former FBI Special Agent who worked in the field of forensic science” on another thread, quoted above, but the reason was to defend him as a serious Shroud scholar,not someone playing with an artefact “of unknown provenance”. The non-Christian archaeologist identified the face as “Isa” (Jesus), Ian Wilson accepted the identification and so did Phil, who saw it before Wilson did.\nAs pointed out by me yesterday the mosaic depicting Jesus’ face is very similar to the icon of Saints Sergius and Bacchus at the Kiev Museum in Ukraine, which was formerly preserved at the Saint Catherine’s Monastery in the Sinai desert, and is dated to the 6th century. It is reproduced in IWs last Shroud book, plate 19c.\nThe doubts lie in hooking on Jesus’ face to NDEs, as experiments demonstrate that people see different things, some see a light at the end of a dark tunnel, others claim to have met dead relatives, someone else see strange beings in the form of bright light and so forth. The mind-matter problem is still a mystery and so far we seem to be stuck at the level of the unconscious when it comes to NDE.\n\n","date":"April 22, 2014 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/22/more-on-the-isa-tile-and-the-prince-of-peace/","cat":"heaven_is_for_real","id":"comment-102350","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More on the ISA Tile and the “Prince of Peace”","post":"There’s no evidence from what I can tell that connects the face on the tile to the shroud or mandylion.

It was unearthed in Edessa, the centre of the cult of the mandylion and its home from 540AD to 944AD. Syriac monks carried copies of the mandylion throughout the Christian Middle East. I would have to agree with Louis, that it has quite a striking resemblance to the icon now at Kiev formerly at St Cathenine’s, Sinai.  Both Wilson and Guscin are expert art critics and have extensive experience in surveying very many representations of the mandylion. They assign the mosaic to 550-650AD; as such it would have been among some of the earliest copies. In a previous posting, I commented on other 2nd-3rd cenury mosaics found in Edessa, particularly some family representations. The men there have bushy hair and beards, but the styles are quite different from the mosaic. The ISSA has very large owlish eyes, typical of many mandylion representations. It also needs to be remembered that mosaic work is a less compliant medium than painting, and exactitude cannot be expected.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2014 at 4:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/22/more-on-the-isa-tile-and-the-prince-of-peace/","cat":"heaven_is_for_real","id":"comment-102666","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
