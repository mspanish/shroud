TV has been taking liberties with Jane Austen. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Superstar had a battery of Israeli tanks.  Jesus is now right up there with Shakespeare and Austen!\n\n","date":"August 7, 2013 at 4:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/06/speaking-of-crowd-funding-shroud-of-turin-projects-should-we-laugh-or-cry/","cat":"art","id":"comment-40693","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
