Its sad many even so called christians still lack faith and unbelief when Jesus sends them back with their testimony.

I saw an advertisement in a Christian magazine with this picture, but knew nothing of the book or story.

One month later, I was given the book for Christmas and when I got to the story of Colton trying to find a picture of Jesus, and then saw the picture, I started to cry.

She was on a church bus full of people. When the bus stopped to let the associate pastor exit, he walked in front of the idling bus— and was hit and killed by a car on the other side that he couldn’t see, and that couldn’t see him until it was too late. Of course, all the people on the bus were really shook up. Suddenly, a small child piped up loudly “I see Jesus!”  His Mother asked, “Where? What is Jesus doing?”  The little boy said, “He’s praying for the people on the bus.”\nJesus wasn’t needed there because of the Pastor— the Pastor was already safely in Heaven. Jesus was there for the people who remained here on earth, who were upset and frightened at what they couldn’t understand.\nAnd isn’t it also interesting that here again, we have a case of a small child seeing Him.\n\n","date":"January 18, 2012 at 11:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-7150","author":"Leina","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Wow!

The ball is now in your court…Admitting our sinfulness, believing that Jesus died for our sins, inviting him into our lives as Lord and Savior, and accepting God’s forgiveness is what makes us real Christians.  Have you ever said the sinner’s prayer?  Here it is…  “Dear God, I confess that I am a sinner and am sorry for all the wrongs that I have done and the sins that I have committed. I believe that your Son, Jesus Christ, died on the cross for my sins. Please forgive me and I invite you, Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Savior. I commit and trust my life and way to you. Please forgive me, and give me the desire to be what you want me to be and to do what you want me to do. Thank for the greatest gift anyone could ever receive; that is for coming to earth and dying on the cross in my place to pay the just penalty for all my sins. Thank you, too, for your forgiveness and free pardon, for the gift of eternal life, and for hearing and answering my prayer.

When I asked her to tell me about them, she told me that they fly down to earth (earf at the time she was 3, lol) She would always talk about them to me and to to them in front of me. There are 2 that she talks about alot, a male and a female. I never took her to church or school or a babysitter. So one day I was brushing her hair and she was talking to her “friend”, I allowed her to talk to her freely as I had brought this up to her doctor and I was told not to discourage her so I didnt. So anyway, I asked her, If your friend can fly and she has wings then she must know  Jesus right? (by the way, both of her friends have names and when I researched the names they were of Hebrew decent). So my daughter whips her head around and tells me, Yeah! She know Jesus. So being that she was 3 and I never talked to her about him because I didnt think a 3 year old would be able to comprehend and at the time Jesus sadly wasnt the topic of our discussions. So I asked her who he was and she told me he was on wood. So I asked her why was he on wood and she told me because he saved the world. Long story short she could tell me everything in detail about he crucifixion from when he was beaten to when he “walked away” from his “cave”. She even describe how there was alot of blood. I cried for about a week after this. I felt like I was started to doubt in God and it makes me feel guilty that this had to happen for me to have faith. Now that she is a little older she can describe what happened. She still talks to her “friends” and tells me that she sometimes dreams of something and then it comes true. I asked her what she meant and she told me she had a dream about her friends and that they came true the next day. They took her to “Jesus’ world and thats where she met Jesus and was shown the story of Jesus’ crucifixion. One thing that stuck out about Jesus was that she says he has blue eyes. I would never try to exploit her in any way. I just know it has change my perception (and my families too) on everything. I dont doubt anyones story :)\n\n","date":"March 30, 2012 at 6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9803","author":"Blessed","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"That is a wonderful testimony Joe.

The latest book, of 2012, have even some staunch skeptics leaning to its authenticity.  This has been of core interest to me, since my grandmother’s repeated daily narrative of what happened to her in 1938, in a NDE, while delivering a baby at an advanced age.  She grew up in the depression, and never had modern day public book considerations.  Back then, the scope to which you could communicate your accounts were more limited.  However, simply to reveal the awestaking truth, she spoke of how she encountered an angel like figure on a hill that allowed her to look backwards to her earthly station or forward, and elect a choice.  The experience was as real as the reality of every day conditions. She recanted this experience almost daily for over 40 years, so we know that its impression was that of real occurence.  Also, I would recommend the book of Sr. Faustina’s life.  She, being one the most recent saints of our century (during WWI in Poland), accounts her encounter with Jesus, and thereby put forth the Divine Chaplet of Mercy\nto be prayed on the Feast of Mercy, the 1st Sunday after Easter, and for the sick and dying.  Reading this saint’s lifestory and detailed diary will sow the initial seeds of profound interest on this topic.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2013 at 2:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-21515","author":"katina","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Thank you for your story!

The seventh type can merge with ANY of the others. The idea of seven basic body types was one of the plot devices of a well known fairy tale, collected centuries ago by the Brothers Grimm. That story is Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. \nAdditionally, the names of these types, which correspond to the planets and heavenly bodies that name the days of the week are words that are already IN OUR LINGO. For example, there are Martial arts, a Mercurial disposition, a Jovial fellow, a Saturnine countenance, etc. etc. \nBilly Crudup, Timothy Dalton, John Cusack are Mercury-Saturn types. Whereas Clint Eastwood, Sam Elliot and Brett Cullen are pure Saturn types. \nInterestingly, Leonardo Da Vinci, based on his self portrait cartoon is clearly a Mars-Jovial type.

I saw Colton on numerous talk shows, and he repeatedly points proudly to where the “markers” were on Jesus’ palms and feet.  He points to the centers of his palms and feet.  Sorry to expose Colton’s lack of truthfulness, but Jesus was crucified in the WRISTS and HEELS of his feet to keep the body on the cross.  Also, Moses and Elijah appeared to Jesus in the presence of the disciples John, James and Peter, and I’m quite sure they would’ve thought they were angels if they’d had wings.  Jesus is now in His glorified state and looks nothing like He did on earth.  Isaiah 53: 2 says “He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him” in his prophecy of the coming Messiah.  Has anyone ever read John’s description of Jesus in the Book of Revelation?  He was so glorious that John fell at His feet “as though dead.”  Please read the Book of Revelation.  And Colton’s  great-grandfather had to ASK if he were Todd’s son–yet his unborn sister somehow KNEW she was his sister (?).  There are so many discrepancies in this book alone much less discrepancies from the Word.  And Colton’s pastor father says he’s convinced that God had to turn His face away from Jesus on the cross because he wouldn’t have been able to go through with it if He continued looking.  How could a PASTOR be so blind?  God turned His face away from Jesus on the cross because He had laid our sins on Jesus and poured out His wrath on Jesus.  Jesus took our punishment for us, and that included God turning His face away from Jesus in our place.  Also, Akiane admits she based that picture of Jesus on a carpenter who came to her house one day–she used a human model, but there’s Colton saying “Dad, that’s it.” And regarding Jesus supposedly refusing to give Colton a sword in heaven because it would be too dangerous; there IS no danger in heaven. The Burpos would do well to read what happened to Ananias and Sapphira in the Book of Acts when they lied to God.  Don’t these people have any fear of God?\nAnd all of us, myself included need to read more of the Bible; why is everyone so excited about what this child says and not what Jesus Himself said in the Gospels and people with firsthand knowledge like the disciples?\n\n","date":"October 29, 2012 at 12:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18484","author":"Karen Reid","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"@Karen Reid: I agree with you about Colton Burpo and the markings of Christ not being on his wrists or heels.

There are many things that are “almost” and it seems that God is not particularly concerned about providing concrete evidence. \nThey think they’ve found the site where Moses crossed the Red Sea, for example. But it’s been a heck of a time even documenting it much less proving it. (Upcoming Movie website is at: http://www.exodusconspiracy.com/ and the man who told me about it has his web page here: http://pinkoski.com/Articles/Red-Sea-Crossing.html)  \nOr, the continual frustration about almost finding Noah’s Ark but never quite. The only concrete “evidence” we are given is creation itself, the awesome evidence of Nature designed by a Creator. \nIn order to believe in God, we must have Faith. That’s always the bottom line. And for those who do have faith, God confirms it to each one individually so we know we’re not fools… but we can’t prove it. :D \nThank you again for a very nice blog article.

He greeted me with open arms,and without words, I had the choice of passing into Heaven, or returning to earhtly home, or maybe Christ was telling me it was not my time, but I was so very close to passing the threshold.A few months later, I was reading The National Enquirer, and in the back there was the ad section.

My son was born 1 month early and was born with a diaphragmatic hernia. He had a hole in his diaphragm and had organs in his chest and not much of a left lung. They did not know this before he was born for some reason because they almost always catch before the baby is born. After he was born we were told only 50% of these babies live and if he made it through the next so many hours it increased his chances of survival. Well we made it to 3 days later and he had surgery to repair it, which again they didn’t know if he would survive and we went hour by hour again. My son is 3 years old now and has talked about things that he shouldn’t know about in our family. One day he told me my uncle was on the play phone to talk to me and called my uncle by name.This uncle died 5 years ago and my son is only 3, it brought me to tears because right then and there I realized how close we actually came to losing my son. My son had another surgery around 18 months because his muscle didn’t grow over the opening. He is 3 now and has always been very verbal for his age. The thing that scares me the most is, he talks about people in our house that he can see. I don’t know what to do about this. I am hoping to somehow get in touch with Colton’s father also. My son is a very special 3 year old that is wise beyond his years and I am anxious to see what he grows up to be because he truly touches people that meet him. He is very strong willed too, had he not, he probably wouldn’t be with us today. Please pray for his body to stay strong as he does have a small left long, chances of this recurring, and his chest caves in pretty bad which makes his heart close to his chest wall and will need more surgery some day. His left kidney is also up too high on the left side, but they are leaving it there. The Children’s Hospital in Peoria, IL is amazing, but God is awesome! We had people praying for him all over the U.S. God Bless You and others who have had similar experiences.

It doesn’t seem to be quite the same caliber anymore altho it’s still a nice magazine. They told real-life stories of people who had seen or been helped by angels. \nThere were some stories about small children who could see and talk to their angels. This isn’t too unusual, apparently, especially if the child has been ill. I believe in one case the child was retarded. The stories were very sweet. \nAs your child gets older he will most likely outgrow the sensitivity that he has now. My nephew could see things when he was small, too, and he didn’t have any traumatic experiences. Well, yes he did come to think of it. They couldn’t get him to breathe when he was born. They very nearly lost mother AND child during delivery but everybody made it. I only found out about this recently. Apparently my brother, who was in the delivery room, was so traumatized he couldn’t tell us about it at the time.  \nAnyway… you probably don’t need to be concerned about your son, IMO. It’s because he is at such a tender age that he can see the things he does. Most likely he will grow out of it. I do think it indicates a very sensitive heart in your child, and I do pray that he continues to be sensitive to the Lord all his life.\n\n","date":"December 3, 2011 at 6:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5196","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Your story is quite an interesting one, and reminds me of my own experiences with one of my children, though not quite the same.

I would like to advice you to draw very near to God through the scriptures so as to saturate the atmosphere of your home with His presence.  Be careful not to allow the enemy to take advantage of your child’s unique gift.  The scripture does often teach of the medians and spiritists in a negative sense.

Susan, “Thank you so much.”  Yes, Jesus is Real & HE is coming back one day.  We need to be ready.  …When I was 20 years old, I was in a really bad car accident.  My car spun around 6 or 7 times on the interstate one night in 1991.  I wasn’t driving fast (going about 35 mph off the ramp), it was raining that night, no lights were lit up on the ramp to the interstate.  There was a car up ahead stalled, half on half off the merging lane, I didn’t see it.  Any way, I hit that car so hard.  An eyewitness said that my car was spinning in the opposite direction & that I was lucky that no other cars hit mine.  The whole time my car was spinning, “I felt like I was being cradled like a baby, being protected.”  “Wow.  I had my seat belt on.  My car was totaled.  I managed to walk away without a scratch.”  I knew at that very moment that I had been saved.  I always thought that it was my dad (who had past away at age 29 from cancer, when I was nearly 2 yrs old) that had saved me.  I know that he had a great deal to do with that.  Ultimately, looking back, it was definitely GOD himself that saved me that night.  Wow!  I definitely BELIEVE in GOD.  I know that HIS son Jesus Christ is coming back one day soon.

I highly recommend this book for nonbelievers and believers.  And the story of the pictures of Jesus that the little boy was shown and they never were just right, either the eyes or the hair wasn’t the Jesus he saw, but once he saw this picture painted by the little girl who also visited heaven, Prince of Peace, he said “yes, that is him”.

Only one Christian doctor believed what I told her about what I experienced, even though she had never heard of such a thing! I have not read any of the books about heaven before “Heaven is for Real” because I did not want to taint my memory. At the time, when I told what happened to me I was hospitalized and told I could never go back to live with my parents because I refused to change my story. I was told I must have been halucinating because my home was TOO religious!  \nHowever what Jesus told me came to pass. I never had an other another grandmal seisure after the one that put me into the hospital where my ministry started to survivors of sexual abuse. I have been ministering in that field every since. I also minister to very ill and dying people to ease their transition over to the after life.\nThe 1st thing I thought of when I was in heaven was: “heaven is really real” so all the things I had been taught in Sunday school are REAL! That is why I read this book.  What he said about the colors and how he described Jesus matched what I remember except the MARKS were not in the palms of his hands but in Jesus wrists. This was hard for my mind to comprehend as the only pictures I had seen had scars in the palms of the hands. So I did a study on crucifiction and found out that the nails were placed in the wrist in order to hold the weight of the body. \nI then went to the web sight to check out Akiane’s pictures. They are the closest I have ever seen to what I remember Jesus looked like when I saw Him. Our God is so faithful and loving to care for us the way He does. Praise Him for all the little glimpses into heaven that He gives people here on earth. They help to strengthen people’s faith.\n\n","date":"May 29, 2011 at 8:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3205","author":"Vivian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"you went to heaven? how! and you met jesus? then why didnt you make a book actaully i dont really know but you cud reply me by email my email is pantonfire123456@hotmail.co.uk\n\n","date":"August 18, 2011 at 10:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3625","author":"charlie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Thank you for sharing; I too had a near-death experience too long ago to be influenced by the media – 53 years ago. I was 2 1/2, and while most people may feel this is far too young to be really “aware” of anything, that’s not how it is when you’re experiencing it. I had the “tunnel” experience, and didn’t see Jesus, but could hear the whispers of many many people who had gone before me, though I couldn’t understand them; somehow I understood this. As I was about to go through I was told that I was free to do so, but if I did I could not come back. I responded, “I’m only 2 1/2, and have a lot of life to live.” Instantly I found myself suffocating; I had become tangled in the blankets at the foot of my bed, and I kicked and tore at them and finally freed myself. \nJust then my mother came into the room, but she didn’t understand what had happened. I finally told her about ten years ago, and she was shocked. I remember it as if it happened yesterday. \nIf anyone doubts the validity of these experiences, no matter how grand they may seem, don’t underestimate them. There is life after this one, and the Lord’s Book will guide you there.\n\n","date":"August 23, 2011 at 9:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3665","author":"Jeff","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Vivian, I think there are probably many people now that would listen and hear your story.

In all my life I have never before or since dreamt of Jesus, and the dream was so vivid and remarkable I can recall it in detail to this day. I wrote about the vision in my journal a few weeks after having it, and for several days following, added additional insights and implications of the dream. Jesus had asked me “Where is the work I asked you to do?” In my dream I knew exactly what he meant but knew I had barely started it, and so I stalled, searching for excuses.  But He went on, “You are the only one who can do this for me now. I’m counting on you.”  There was no condemnation nor threat in His remarks. After processing the dream for some time I came to realize that the “work” He asked me to do was the essence of John 13:44 –  “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another” NIV. Like others I had found it easy to love those who are lovable and likable, but to love the “unlovely” is different. This dream convinced me He expects us to love ALL OTHERS just as He does. LOVE – that’s the work I had not finished for Him. When I read earlier postings to this blog I was amazed there were several that confirmed the image of the Jesus in my dream. I had told others at the time  that Jesus in my dream did not look at all like the typical religious art we see of Him. Until I read “Heaven Is For Real” and saw Akiane’s Prince of Peace drawing, I had never seen a likeness of Jesus so close to my vision, and to the entries I had made about it in my journal. The vision of Christ and His message became for me an epiphany.\n\n","date":"May 30, 2011 at 8:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3207","author":"Lynne","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"wow!

Bruce is of Syrian and Italian descent, and his features are very similar to these images. The image of Jesus in the Matthew video was completely different from all other Jesus movies I have seen.  Jesus is seen as a fun-loving, caring, reach-out-to-people kind of guy.  The kind of guy I would want for a best friend to hang out with. \nConcerning the Shroud’s carbon dating, it appears that the sample taken was mixed cotton and linen used to repair the damaged Shroud.

People used to be much more superstitious and much more spiritual, in general. They believed in angels, gods and demons and often had these things all mixed up in their Christianity too. So people didn’t need much encouragement to imagine spiritual things. \nBut now, people have a difficult time believing that ANY of it is real. So I think the book helps to make heaven more relevant for a modern civilization. The book doesn’t say much beyond what we already know in the Bible. So scripturally the story seems to be very sound.

One of the recurring themes of that book is that God loves His children, and especially the non-adult variety.  Burpo speculated on why, and settled on the fearless honesty.  He noted that tact and guile are sort of brothers – one merciful, the other deceitful – and they come to accompany us at one point as we grow up.\nA four year old has neither.\nAnother speculation made by Burpo is that the testimony of a four year old cuts through the academic analysis we’ve made of modern Christianity.\n“Jesus had to die so that we could be with His Father.”\nThat was the boy’s summary of Christianity as he learned it in the three minutes he died and was in the presence of Christ.\nI believe it’s the position of Christ that he could come down and allow the hard of heart to put their hands in his wounds and still they would not believe.\nTo have a pair of children testify to the exact likeness of Christ isn’t going to move anyone who cannot be moved.  All it can do is comfort those who soldier on under the false apprehension that they are alone.\nWe’ve always had the Holy Spirit, who’s probably the Rodney Dangerfield of the Trinity.  That the Spirit is there for us when we believe we cannot take another step in the faith is part of a promise He made to us – This is the exact place that the Holy Spirit found Todd Burpo as his son lay dying on a surgical table.\nThat He chose to allow that to manifest itself in children makes utter sense to me.\nI believe that God, His Son, and the Holy Spirit is fully aware of the difficulty of what they have asked of us – to remain like a child, with all of a child’s naive credulity, while at the same time remain vigilant of those that would come proclaiming falsely that they are God.\nA child, however, knows its parents.\nThe Burpo child said that the angels in Heaven carry swords, for the purpose of defending Heaven from demons.  We walk in the world, where Satan is the prince of the air, unarmed, but for the Holy Spirit and the Will of God.\nIf you are moved by this child, and believe for yourself that what the child claims is scripturally consistent, then consider that the Word of God, in your case, has fallen on good soil.\nThe book was on the nightstand of my cousin’s cabin, where we met for a family reunion this last weekend.  I picked it up and finished it four hours or so later.  Just because Satan rules earth for now doesn’t mean that God has His hands tied behind his back.\nGod loves us, and wants us to love Him back.

The book is amazing and Akiane appears to be a “wunderkind” prodigy.  However, I have not yet had time to think through their messages.  I, too, wondered if anyone had compared their portrait of Jesus with the Shroud of Turin.\nOne thing that disturbed me in Colton’s account of Jesus’ “markers” (wounds) was that he specified they were in the palms of His hands and not in his wrists (as in the Shroud).  It is said that if they were in the palms the weight of His body would have ripped His hands loose from the cross (unless He were also tied with ropes, as you see in some pictures – but why would the Romans nail a victim AND tie him?  I’ve got to do some research).  On the other hand, if the nails were in the wrists (and the Greek language allows for the wrists to be considered part of the hands), the bones there would have held the weight of the body.  Then again, maybe Colton wasn’t being as specific as the book seems to indicate?\nAnother thing that I would like more information on is that Colton said everyone in Heaven except Jesus had wings.  I have always considered pictures of angels with wings as just the earth-bound artists’ symbolic attempt to convey to us that angels could fly. Also, the “It’s a Wonderful LIfe” thing about angels earning their wings is just a Hollywood plot device for “feel-good” shows.  Colton, however, indicated that not only angels but also humans there have wings (and halos, too).  On earth birds and airplanes need wings to provide lift from the wind, but why would they be needed in Heaven?  I’m sure the Burpo family is getting a gazillion emails and letters, so I don’t have much hope of finding out from them at this point If they know.  Of course, I’ll need to ask the Lord about all of this.\nAs for Akiane, her paintings are absolutely beautiful.  I don’t know what to think about her message and I have no comment at this point.  As a Christian, I did find it disturbing when I visited the gallery on her website  that she is also painting other religious figures such as HIndus and talking about respecting our “religious crossroads” and everyone coming together in unity.  While to most people that sounds very nice, I did have some reservations about it and I will not comment until I’ve had the oppoturinity to see what she is really saying.\nI just wanted to share these thougts while I was here because they are things that need to be considered. Best wishes to all!\n\n","date":"June 22, 2011 at 4:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3257","author":"Randwulf","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Yes, I was concerned about the universalism that seems to be creeping into her work. Although people think that a unified religion is a good idea, it doesn’t work out in practicality because the gods themselves don’t allow it. Each religion is somewhat exclusive, and some of them are extremely exclusive. You can’t be faithful to ANY religion if you embrace ALL of them. \nWhich is perhaps a good illustration of what Jesus said, “I would that you were hot or cold, but because you are lukewarm I will spit you out of my mouth.” \nAnd Jesus also said, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father except by Me.”  So Jesus himself made it clear that he doesn’t go for this unified religion stuff. \nAlso in I Timothy 2:5, “There is but one mediator between God and man: the man Christ Jesus.”  \nYes, I’m concerned about Akiane. The humanist tendencies of athiesm seem to be creeping into what she believes.\n\n","date":"July 4, 2011 at 10:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3310","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Read Lynn (May30)  Jesus really does love everyone–not only Christians and He expects us to do the same…that is hard…sometimes I feel a little self-righteous in the face of non-Christian religions but I know that is now how Jesus would have it..as he does love everyone…God has no favorites.\n\n","date":"October 16, 2011 at 9:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4205","author":"Jan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Do we believe God comprises all of these things?\nhttp://christianity.about.com/od/biblefactsandlists/qt/biblefactsgod.htm\nHow can we accept God as Love, Light, Peace, alive, omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient AND exclusive, distant, divisive, judgmental, spiteful, and downright cruel?  \nGod is Love.

There is no separation from God  —- Sin separates us from God. Anyone who has raised children can believe in the concept of original sin. Original sin needs to be acknowledged more than it is. People want to believe in the theoretical goodness of all mankind, but the world scene damns that theory within seconds. \n2. Truth lives within us and can only be revealed through experience. —- TRUTH as you describe it means that truth can be anything we want it to be and truth can be individually customized to each experience. By this definition, there is no central truth. \nI do think you’re right, that there’s no book that contains the entire Truth, not even the Bible. People who read the Bible for the words alone are possibly not going to end up with much, especially if they read it for the wrong reasons. The Bible is the inspired Word of God, but it’s not the complete Word. Even the Bible says that if everything about Jesus had been written, the world would not be able to contain the books. So there’s alot more Truth about Jesus than only what’s recorded in the Bible. But the Holy Bible is what God gave us, and apparently it’s enough Truth to get started with.  \nBut if we REALLY want to know what TRUTH is, then we must know Jesus Christ personally. Jesus said that HE is the TRUTH. In other words, truth is not a moral concept… **** TRUTH is a PERSON.****  You must read the Bible with the goal of getting to know Jesus. PLUS, the Bible is only the launching pad because Jesus also sent the Holy Spirit to “guide us into all truth.”  \nIf we leave Jesus out of our lives, we will never know Truth. It’s Jesus or nothing. \nNo man-made god ever did for us what Jesus did. That’s what the Shroud of Turin is about: the crucifixion AND the resurrection of Christ. He died, He was not a Victim, He did it by Choice, and He raised HIMSELF from the dead without anybody’s assistance.  The Grave is empty, because Jesus LIVES. This is the basic Gospel. If we don’t believe in THIS Jesus, then we don’t believe in Him at all. \nJesus said that He is the ONLY way to the Father. Jesus said that HE is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Jesus is not tolerant of all religions, in fact Jesus is not tolerant of ANY religions. Jesus despised “religion” when He walked this earth and He insulted the Jewish religious leaders on many occasions. Jesus does not represent a religion formed by man AFTER he died. Jesus represents HIMSELF, the living GOD.\nWe must accept Jesus under HIS terms, or we have not accepted Him at all.  In fact, we insult Him by lumping the Christ in with other gods who have never done anything for our salvation as Christ did. \nThe universal “god” is a lesser god… far, far, far less. Although on the surface the universal “god” appears to be more tolerant and gracious, this humanistic interpretation of a universal god has nothing whatsoever to offer us. The universal god has no basic form, no basic code of behavior… the universal god is just vapor.  I think universalists might as well admit they are agnostics: it would be more honest than trying to portray that they believe something when actually, they don’t believe in anything. \nI’m not trying to be harsh, just trying to cut out the nonsense because the vague, vaporous interpretation of a universal god is basically a copout. The gods do not allow it, and most importantly: Jesus Christ does not allow that interpretation of God.\n\n","date":"November 4, 2011 at 3:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4550","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Dear AnnieCee, please see post #187 below in reply to your Nov 4 post on this thread as my response did not associate here.

I also had the same reaction at first to that painting titled “The First.” It bothered me as well and turned me off. Then I thought about it some more with a different perspective. For one, yes, they look like a young couple, perhaps teenagers, or they could also be in their young 20’s – either way, I questioned “perhaps they are just married and it was their first union?” God does condone and encourage sex after marriage and it is a beautiful union. Whether she meant the painting to portray that or not, I do not know. She left it up for all of us to create our own story – as adults and humans, sadly our thoughts will wander first to the worst…but maybe that is not how this painting is. Or maybe it points out to us how negative we can be in general and maybe we should think good, heavenly thoughts first instead. Again, I don’t know how she meant it. It is just a different perspective to consider – and it is the one I am choosing to accept :)\nWIth that said, I have only just started looking at her gallery on her site. Someone on here mentioned how she seems to be too universal in her thoughts on other religions and wanting them all to come together. That would bother me too, since I believe that Christ is the only way. However, I have not thoroughly gone through her gallery to come to my own conclusions on her beliefs. Regardless, I do believe that God has given this child a wonderful gift and He is using her for His purpose in some of her paintings. We are all human however and therefore not perfect. I believe this child should be prayed for that she does understand that Christ is the only way – and that she will be protected from once atheist beliefs, etc.\n\n","date":"August 31, 2011 at 1:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3741","author":"ashlee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I have to say that the minute I laid eyes on ‘The First’ painting, the immediate thought that came to mind was “Adam and Eve”.

No one comes to the Father BUT BY ME”. If you look closely at all religions you will see how they contradict each other. For example, Christianity says you have to accept the free gift of salvation through Jesus by trusting and walking with Him rather than trying in vain to earn your way to Heaven by somehow being “good enough” (which is impossible because we have all fallen short multiple times). Nearly every other religion says that you have to do A B and C to hopefully earn your way in. Chip Ingram (pastor of Venture Christian Church in Los Gatos, CA ) wonderfully putts it this way: all other religions are about having to “do” something, whereas the truth of Jesus is that it has already been “done” for you… you just have to choose to receive it from Him.  So in conclusion, all religions don’t lead to God. Only Jesus does. The rest of them are tools of Satan to lead you astray and straight to Hell.\n\n","date":"November 17, 2012 at 5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-19163","author":"Cass","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"middle eastern the man named jesus was, but blue eyes???????\n\n","date":"June 24, 2011 at 11:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3259","author":"Peter Clarke","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Well, before he was middle-eastern he was God, the Son of God, and the Word who created this planet and this universe.

So many things could have influenced the clarity of the vision by that time.  \nThe gist of it is: apparently he really did have a near death experience and there are some things that are particularly impressed on him that he was very strong about. First of all, Jesus really really loves children. And second, we must know Jesus when we die.

My fear originated about 55 years ago when I realized that I would die some day. I have found life so beautiful and awe some that not feeling it would be the ultimate dread. No, I do not come from a priviledged background, in fact I would consider our family as a poor working class, but over the years we worked hard and had our share of trials and tribulations. Today, I consider ourselves blessed with healthy and independent children and their families.  \nMy struggle against my fear has led me to reading many books, medications, and counselling and ultimately to baptism into the Catholic faith. Being retired for the last 9 years, I have a lot of time thinking about God, death, etc.  My conclusion is that if there is no God, then life is meaningless. God has 100% of my heart and about 80% of my mind. I desparately seek closure on this fear, so I can fully appreciate life and let it go gracefully. \nI pray very often these days that God would send  some “agent” or event that would put my mind to rest. This is the reason that read posts such as these – to find new ways of reaching God or better still, have God reaching me. \nI would appreciate any suggestion that would remove my residual doubt.

I often have to ask God to not take offense at my requests to live a long (100+yr) life just so I can see it all and love as many people as I can.  BUT death, where is thy sting?  There isn't any, as long as you are right with God that is.  I would never lie to anyone about this, passing on to the next dimension is a wonderful amazing experience and no wonder those who have did NOT wish to come back, even when they had a good life or loved ones still here, it's THAT good!

Tuve hace uno años, una experiencia mientras dormia. Pude ver q estaba parada en una entrada como de unas murallas de piedra blanca, ( lo q conocemos por la Biblia como “A la puerta de la ciudad”), Senti el impulso de entrar, asi q lo hice, cuando camine unos pasos dentro de la ciudad me di cuenta q el piso era en ladrillos blancos en una pequeña bajada, y al levantar la vista, toda la ciudad era blanca y era de dia aunque no vi el sol. Pude ver muchas personas que caminaban en esa calle como deprisa teniendo cosas que hacer , pero se veian contentos. Mientras admiraba toda la blancura del lugar, vi como las personas se dispersaban a cada lado de la calle hasta desaparecer de manera inexplicable, pero antes, pude ver una figura de hombre parado sin moverse en medio de la multitud, me llamo tanto la atención que me no me di cuenta cuando todos desaparecieron, quedando solo la figura de ese hombre frente a mi, como a un tiro de piedra de distancia, aunque luego parecia mas cerca cada vez. El tenia el pelo corto algo despeinado y castaño, sus ojos eran una mezcla de azules intenso, rostro perfilado y una sonrisa tenue q le llegaba a los ojos,(sentia q me daba la bienvenida, pero no podia soportar esa mirada sin llorar, pues era como fuego en mi alma, tuve esa sensación de fuego durante dias y lo único que hacia al recordar era llorar, pues solo le preguntaba, porque me miraba así), vestia una túnica blanca y me hizo q observara el detalle de esta túnica, pues era de una sola pieza sin costuras por ninguna parte y le cubrian los pies y las manos apenas se veian. No sabia que era Jesús, pues siempre lo presentan con pelo largo, realmente muy diferente. Pero dejenme decirles que al ver esta foto echa por una niña de ocho años, si es el hombre que vi recibiendome en la cuidad, no hay duda, ese era él. Que bueno es mi Jesús!!! He tenido mas experiencias, no lo he visto mas en esas experiencias pero si lo he escuchado y dejenme decirle algo, SIEMPRE habla por su PALABRA, para que no dudemos que es él.Gloria a Dios!!!\n\n","date":"August 4, 2011 at 11:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3515","author":"Militza","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Can you write that in English?

That’s why you are so convinced God is real, and He cares about you. \nOne of my friends has a similar history, her life is a long series of tragedies and traumas and injuries. Her longing for love got her into several bad relationships, some of which she was lucky to survive. Two years ago she married a man who is very sweet and kind, a good Christian guy with a reputation for being steady and reliable. . I figured God would do this for her eventually because she really needs to know what it’s like to be in a decent family. And by the time she found this man, a lot of the ginger had been knocked out of her so she wasn’t looking for excitement anymore, she just wanted peace. \nI noticed that she didn’t know how to be “normal” because of the bizarre life she’d had. Now she’s very grateful for the peace of being in a quiet, normal relationship. \nWhen Adam & Eve ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the serpent was right about some things. He said they would become like God, knowing good and evil. I believe this is possibly our Quest in Life, the purpose for our existance. You have encountered evil and you know what it is. There is some wisdom in knowing this, especially if God helps to process those horrible experiences so they turn into wisdom. \nYou also need to understand what it means to be Good… and the word “good” is so much more rich than we realize it is. The Bible says that only God is good. The little bit we know about “goodness” is only the tip of the iceberg you might say: it’s only a teeny glimpse into the immense goodness of God. \nI found this website just now, because I love the book of Hebrews where it talks about how God does everything “Better.”  A better Way, a better Covenant etc.\nhttp://www.messianic-literary.com/hebrews.htm\nThat’s a messianic Jewish site which is kinda cool. I thought the outline he provided was a good start on reading Hebrews in light of knowing something BETTER.

It was very difficult for me and my siblings (7 of us) to comprehend what had happened.  Many questions came up, “Did he believe in God?”, “Do you think he’s in heaven?”  I believe, after much prayer that he is, indeed in heaven.  He was raised Catholic but didn’t attend any organized religion as an adult.  Supposedly, he considered himself agnostic.  He was severely depressed when he took his life.  In my attempt to understand what he went through God sent me a vision and a very real feeling of “anguish” that was so powerful, I then believed he was not to blame for his “choice” and is now in God’s loving hands.  Another brother of mine, related a dream he had around the time we lost my brother.  My brother was trying to understand why.  My brother saw a vision of my dead brother pointing to a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary (a statue that my father made of the Virgin praying) and he told him that this is what we are here on Earth for – to pray for each other, to love each other.  FAITH.\nOne other story, I was a lonely child even though I grew up in a large family.  When I was at my loneliest, I would pray to Mary and I would ask her for a husband some day.  I believe that she went to God, Our Father and brought my petitions to him.  I did marry an incredible man and have one lovely child.  We believe we are soulmates and were chosen to be together.  When I found out I was pregnant, the words just flowed out of me without even thinking.  I said to my husband, “If it’s a girl, can we name her Mary?”  It hadn’t been a name I even considered in my dreams.  It was because of the outpouring of her love for me that it was only right to name my daughter, Mary. \nWe need to pray for those who are being lead by the devil.  The devil is real and wants as many follows as possible.  I know that sounds crazy but it’s true.  Pray for one another that we will be stronger and do God’s will.  God bless all of you reading this.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2011 at 1:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3568","author":"Rosanne","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"That’s a sweet story, Rosanne.

Another little boy ALSO confirmed that the picture looked like the Jesus he saw. All these “babies” think this painting is like Jesus. \nIf a cult following was being developed, I would have a problem with it. But the only thing that’s happened is little children have confirmed that’s what the Jesus they saw in their vision looks like.  Which is really cool.  And, it’s from 2 or 3 witnesses so that’s an interesting point too. \nMight as well enjoy it, because Colton’s book is all about Jesus and it glorifies the Lord. I thought the family did a good job of writing the book in such a way that it was merely a narrative of what Colton told them. They didn’t jump to conclusions, they just told Colton’s story and they didn’t do it in such a way that it would glorify themselves. That’s a very difficult balance, I think there was a lot of wisdom in the way they wrote the book. \n I highly recommend it. And I tend to be more skeptical and jaded than most, IMO.

Ezekiel, thank you as well for your words of warning which are very biblical.  I think that we all do need to be very careful and to recognize his voice.  I do think, though, that this book had very interesting points.  While at church a  few years ago, I had heard a sermon where the preacher brought up an interesting survey of emergency room doctors, where there had been many life after death experiences.  It was interesting to hear how many patients would talk about heaven/hell.  Colton did bring up some things in discussions that I believe were biblically related and matched in with the word very well.  What we all need to watch for, though, are times where people seem to be talking about the word of God, but when you do biblical reading yourself and look into what they say, it doesn’t line up with the Bible.  Example, Jehovah’s Witnesses.  Upon looking at the bible, it looks like what they believe lines up with the bible…but when you study the bible, then you realize that it really doesn’t line up.  Looking and studying, I think, are 2 completely different things.  If you search for God and really delve into His word…then you will find the truth in God and in God alone.  \nPeace be with you all, may God bless you richly, may grace that only comes from Him be with you and may all that read these words know that Jesus is the Only Way!\n\n","date":"August 13, 2011 at 5:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3600","author":"KAC","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Yes, and also the Mormons.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2012 at 3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9918","author":"gknapp","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Yes, I agree: I didn’t see anything in Colton’s book that contradicted the Bible.

I’m very wary of false teaching — I thought this book was a pure blessing to read and I couldn’t find anything to complain about.\n\n","date":"August 13, 2011 at 9:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3601","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"God reveals Himself to many in different way.

I was agnostic/atheist prior to the accident, yet have since known without doubt the Divine realm exists and it launched me on a spiritual path. While I have not read Colton’s book, I have seen his interviews and scanned the book at the store, and fully believe all that he experienced and described as true. \nI purchased both of Akiane’s paintings of Jesus for my home. It does not concern me if they represent *exactly* how Jesus looked when he walked the Earth 2000 years ago. I believe the Bible even says that when Jesus re-appeared following his “death” that he looked different each time, such that His disciples and Mary Magdalene did not recognize him?  Since God lives, breathes, and assumes all forms of life in the Universe, what I see when I look at these images is simply the amazingly kind, patient, sweet, inspirational, and beautiful face of God. \nLove! ♥\n\n","date":"August 18, 2011 at 8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3624","author":"Michele","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"All of the foregoing comments about Jesus leave me with positive reinforcement, renewed faith in humanity.

I believe that, if you watch ‘Matthew’, you get a very accurate idea of Jesus’ personality and what He looked like.  Every scene in that movie was prayed over by the directors before it was shot and watching the movie and reading the book gives one the most beautiful insight into who Jesus was then and is today.  The first thing that struck me when I saw Akiane’s painting of Jesus was how much it looked like Bruce in ‘Matthew’.   I also see a strong resemblance to the Shroud of Turin, although there are differences.  \nI loved Colton’s story and believe it is accurate.  It doesn’t bother me that there are differences and variations between people’s accounts of heaven.  As human beings on earth we are all unique and also imperfect vessels and probably do not ‘filter’ everything the same way or perfectly.  What is important is that Jesus is REAL and we need to put our faith in Him if we ever want to get to heaven to find out for ourselves what it is really like.  \nAs to why Jesus may be revealing Himself to us in this way, maybe it is because time is running out and He is using more and more methods of drawing people to Him.  If the sharing of experiences and pictures like this bring people to Him, WONDERFUL!  No, we must not then hang on to these books and pictures and base our faith on them.  They are just tools to bring us to the Truth which is in the Bible and we must mature and move on to greater and greater Truth and we read His Word.  It struck me while reading ‘Heaven is for Real’ that so much of what Colton shared was already in the Bible for us to know, but we require hearing it from a small child to make us take it in and believe it.  \nAt any rate, thank you Colton for sharing your story and all the others who have shared on this site.  Thank you Akiane for your painting – don’t be drawn away from Jesus and His Truth or allow the world to dilute the truth you have already had revealed to you.  God bless you both and your families and continue to use your ‘works’ to draw people to Him.\nTo God be the Glory!\n\n","date":"September 2, 2011 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3769","author":"Wendi B","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I have to say that Heaven is for Real is a tremendous testimony.

I started to cry bad because I had seen him and I knew that this was the real thing. As he looked at me I knew it was him but a younger 25-30 year old.

So he walked off and I woke up crying and a friend that was next to me asked that same day if I was ok and I told him what had happen.

I have been SO ENCOURAGED, and provoked to examine my own heart/faith in a deeper way, by reading all the comments left here. It feels like a beautiful, loving little community of ppl who are here strengthening each others’ faith! Have enjoyed everyone’s stories SO MUCH! I ALMOST bought the book (Heaven Is For Real) two days ago, but instead purchased a Prayer & Praise Organizer journal in the hopes that having it in front of me will motivate me to make daily entries in it. I skimmed through the Burpo’s book, saw Akiane’s Jesus picture, jotted down her name, and a later search for her art led me to this blog! Now I want to buy Colton’s book!\nIt occurred to me that Pops, in Heaven, could have greeted Colton with “You’re Todd’s son, aren’t you?” (a statement), which later could have been re-phrased by the mind of a small child as, “Are you Todd’s son?” We must remember that 4-year olds are not English majors. Even adults sharing a spoken testimony will rarely share it the same way twice, sometimes adding more details, other times omitting them. Time also blurs memories, which is why it is so important to capture something as soon as possible after it occurs.\nI watched a special on The Shroud of Turin years ago, around Easter. They had scientifically taken samples of all the pollens found on the Shroud. Some of the pollens were exclusively indigenous to plants found only in one country, and the pollens confirmed the route the Shroud had taken over the centuries as it was hidden & moved in an attempt to  keep it safe. It was a riveting program, which gave me goosebumps and a sense of awe. Since God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all, it makes perfect sense that the Resurrection power which raised Christ from the grave was a flash of light so immense and blinding that it  could imprint Jesus’ image on the cloth. Our cameras and floodlights are puny by comparison.\nAnnie Cee, you and others here may want to keep an eye out for a Lionsgate film premiering sometime the end of this month, “Machine Gun Preacher”. It is a true story about a former biker & drug dealer who is now rescuing children in Sudan. Based on the book “Another Man’s War: The True Story of One Man’s Battle to Save Children in Sudan” by Sam Childers, published by Thomas Nelson. I previewed some of the book on Barnes & Noble, and it is amazing the way that God protected this man in his work. God is going “all out”, using children (Colton & Akiane) and reformed violent drug dealers, and anything He can to convert the lost and to edify believers, in times like these.\nAkiane’s Jesus has the kindest eyes I’ve ever seen!  :)\n\n","date":"September 11, 2011 at 11:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3829","author":"Leina","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"A  “P.S.” to the above, RE: my quote that God is light, and previous post(s) questioning why Akiane’s Jesus has a dark side to His face—  On Akiane’s site, she describes her Prince of Peace painting in her own words:  “Love and truth are represented on the light side of Jesus’ face; the other (side) is of darkness and suffering — Yet there’s light in His eye. This light is a reminder that He is ALWAYS with us.” — Akiane\nYes, He IS always with us, even in our own times of darkness and suffering. What a poignant observation to come from the mind of a then 8-yr.-old child.\nAnnie Cee had mentioned how modern society has become less sensitive to spiritual things. I see this in America. But I believe that Europeans in general still fit the description Annie gave of being more superstitious and open to spiritual beliefs. When I asked my Eastern European friends how they met/became engaged, my girl friend said, ” I saw a comet or a shooting star, and I made a wish that I would have a boyfriend, and here he is!”  It is interesting to note that Akiane’s Mother is Lithuanian.  So it was in Akiane’s European heritage to be perceptive of things beyond the material world. At the time her visions started, Akiane’s father was an American “lapsed” Catholic.

I was on my way to\nConnecticut to visit friends, when I stopped\noff in an airport bookstore to search for a\nbook to read on my flight. I was interested in\nreading a book called “Heaven Is For real”\nabout a little boy who had a near death\nexperience and went to Heaven and met Jesus.\nI could not find this book, either the airport\nbookstore was out or they never had it in\nstock. I ended up not getting anything to\nread and nap on the way to Connecticut\ninstead. After my visit to Connecticut\nI was a bit upset because I had a big\nfight with one of my good friends.\nI got a flight out of Hartford, CT\nand had to change planes in Baltimore, MD.\nI had to wait at least an hour an a half\nto change planes in Baltimore, so as I sat\nthere bored and a little down about the\nargument I had with my friend. I felt a\nsense of relief that I was in a strange\ncity and knew no one. I was one who never\nliked being alone but at this point my\nmind was at ease, until this woman I’d\nguess about 60 years old made a beeline\nover to me.  She told me that God spoke to\nher heart for her to come over and speak to\nme. She showed me a before photo of how\nmuch she used to weigh and I can tell she had\nlost a lot of weight because her photo looked\nas thought she must have weighed about 400lbs\nand standing before me I’d guess she weighed\nabout 150lbs. She looked good and she introduced\nme to this product called Nuvia3… it was a weight\nlose supplement/drink. She told me that you drink\none before each meal. She went on to tell me a little\nmore info on it and gave me her business card\nbecause she sells it. She also pulled out a book,\nthe book that I was looking for called “Heaven Is for\nReal” She wanted to know if I ever heard of it.\nI told her I searched for it to read as I traveled.\nHowever, I could not find it.  she told me that\nI could have it and she also gave me a sample of\nthe nuvia3 drink. I was grateful to her and I\nreached into my purse and pulled out my\npublished book called “In Due Season: We Will Hear God’s Voice” I gave\nher a copy and she was thrilled and asked me\nto autograph it for her. She as well as I knew\nthat God led her over to me. She called me the next\nday and told me she read the book and loved it and that it was a\nblessing to her, she also told several other people\nabout my book. Not Many know about my book. However, when\nsomeone does read it they are moved.

Being of a scientific mind and one who says if I can’t see it with my own eyes or experience it, I have a very difficult time believing anything.  Also, one who has Catholic parents and a Jewish Grandmother, and raised on the “guilt factor”, I turned away from religion.  I also don’t believe there is a higher being, because prior to truly not believing he existed, I did turn to him for help.  My pleas and prayers were not answered or as I liked to say, not even acknowledged.  Nevertheless, long story short, after reading this book in one sitting today, it brings out curiousity and possible renewed faith about this topic…God.  I guess this might be meant to be, as on a recent vacation, for some strange reason I was overwhelmingly fasicinated with all the churches in the city I visited and insisted on photographing them.

Jesus had a big problem with religion, too. In fact, it was the religious leaders who were determined to kill Him. I would like to suggest that you read the New Testament to find out more about Jesus. Sometimes when we go back to the Gospels as an adult, it opens up in a whole new way. Jesus was fascinating, his miracles were amazing, his teaching was mind-boggling. \nEvery time I read the gospels I see more that I hadn’t noticed before. For example, Jesus sent his 12 disciples out in teams of 2 to do ministry. He told them, “Don’t take any money, don’t take any food, don’t take an extra cloak.” Maybe they were allowed to take a change of clothes, but they carried very little if they did. That’s an incredible contrast with modern churches who need a million dollars before they can even begin the work that God has called them to do.  Who teaches this kind of faith anymore?  But Jesus wanted his original 12 to depend entirely on God. If we really want to cut to the chase and find out what Christianity is about, it helps to go back to the source:  Jesus.\n\n","date":"November 8, 2011 at 8:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4665","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Annie Cee, AMEN!

I just discovered this blog this morning and came back to it this afternoon. I wondered where you may have “arrived” since writing this post that you wrote. I am  believer but I had an eye-opening experience with “Christians” that broke my heart so badly that I stopped reading my Bible and attending church services. I thought I was mad at God but came to realize that I was mad at myself because I “bought in” to this thought that “Christians” were different from people who don’t know Jesus. The truth is people are people no matter what. I am still having a hard time with some things. I surprised myself when I picked up the copy of “Heaven is For Real”. I, too, was intriqued by this 4 year old’s story. I had read a lot about Akiane (the child painter) years ago and was fasinated to see how the two children’s stories connected. Even though I got a little annoyed at Colton’s dad trying to make points that may or may not be there, it brought hope back to my heart as well. I guess today Colton’s dad’s thoughts actually make me giggle because we so much want to prove stuff and make sense out of things that really don’t make any sense. I am soooo very happy to say that because of comments on this blog –  especially AnnieCee’s, I am going to pick up my Bible again. I am also happy to say that no matter what, I know Jesus lived and died and lives now and that life is eternal and Christ in me IS the hope of glory. I never, ever denied those truths. I hope you have come to faith again.\nAnother very important lesson that I am learning (but don’t yet know what to do with it) is that Jesus did get angry at people who thought they knew stuff that they really had no idea about. I learned that it is not ok to let people carry on “in the Name of Jesus” and presume that they “hear” God. Some people do and some just think they do to satisfy their own selfish desires. I have a feeling that God is so much more than we could ever hope or imagine and that He is reaching out to a world that needs Him so desperately. He wants to supply every need. I don’t know . . . I just hope you are finding He is incredibly real and that He loves you more that you could ever dream. Because of Who He is and because of what He did, we are good and we are loved deeper than the ocean and higher than the stars in the sky. God bless you.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2011 at 6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5087","author":"Fauna","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Unfortunately Christians are not always the best representatives of Christianity we always need to look to God for HIs example.

I’m so sorry that you feel that your prayer wasn’t answered or even acknowledged.  I’ve found in life that my prayers aren’t always answered  the way I think they should be answered.  You are a spiritual person and the fact that you aren’t shutting him out even though you’ve felt betrayed says a lot about your faith.  In fact, that is the word you used yourself, “possible renewed faith in this topic – God.”  Faith is what is ultimately important, not where you go to church.  My grandfather wasn’t “religious” but he was a very good man and lived a “faithful” life.  \nAs far as science is concerned, I love it too.  I wish everything was black and white.  I think understanding the world would be so much easier but that isn’t what life is like.  We are called to be “believers”.  I love the story of doubting Thomas because we have Jesus’ own words, “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”  How incredibly powerful.\nI love the story of your travels and the desire to photograph the churches.  I’m drawn toward the beautiful images and architecture of God’s glory.  When I was growing up, I felt lonely a lot and would find myself running often to a grotto that was tucked under some stairs at my parish church.  It was very secluded and so peaceful.  There was a statue of Mary.  I’d cry my heart out to her, asking her to bring my petitions to our Lord.  It gave me so much comfort.  It felt like I’d never have my prayers answered.  I’m guessing that it took about twenty years for things to fall into place.  Give God, our Father, his Son, Jesus and the Holy Spirit a chance.  If I can bestow some advice, study the lives of some of the saints (perhaps Thomas is a place to start) and then pray to them.  Ask them to take your prayers to our Lord and be very patient.\nGod bless you in this journey.\nRosanne\n\n","date":"October 13, 2011 at 11:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4187","author":"Rosanne","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I’m a recent Survivor of Domestic Violence and was feeling down.

I was so moved by this little boy’s story. \nWhen I was a young teenager, my life was a mess (divorced parents, abusive father who I lived with) and I just wanted out of life. My dad used the old fashioned razors, the kind that you had to replace old, dull blades with new, sharp ones. I took one of the new ones and got into the tub. While crying and shaking, fed up with life and what I had to go through and just wanting to be done with it all, I drew the blade over my left wrist. Suddenly felt a hand close over my right hand stopping me. In that one touch I felt such love and compassion and understanding! I knew instantly who it was – JESUS! I didn’t see Him clearly but I definitely heard Him clearly. He said “Don’t. I love you too much! Call your mother. She is the answer.” Then my right hand was lifted up and made to drop the blade on the floor. I immediately started to cry harder and looked to see Him. Again, I didn’t see Him clearly but I knew, I KNEW it was Him and that He loved me and wanted me to live. I felt such love and peace! Needless to say that I got out of the tub, called my mother (who lived about 4 states away) and the wheels were put into motion to save me, in so many ways. Thank YOU Jesus!!!\nWhen I look at Akiane’s painting of Jesus, I feel like I’ve seen that face before, but I’m not certain where. I believe her painting is of the face that I couldn’t see clearly enough that night. I can’t be certain, but it just feels right, you know? I get such a calm and peaceful and loving feeling when I look at the painting.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2011 at 10:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4344","author":"Beth","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"This is a very moving testimony, thank you for sharing your amazing experience.

I was blessed with the chance to see him while he was in the hospital before he died (we don’t live in their state).  He wasn’t saved… His son, my guardian always would tell him that he needed Jesus (not sure what he would tell him or how). The grandfather always refused saying that he was learned man and relied on himself, that he always has. I never witnessed to him myself until that day, in the hospital.\nIt was a rare visit when my husband, myself, and our son were all able to make it “home” for a visit. Grandfather was in the hospital again. My guardian finally told me that we could go take a very quick visit to see grandfather in the hospital. I was told that he was having nightmares and was afraid to sleep, that monsters were in his dreams. He was on strong antibiotics to fight sepsis because his body had started shutting down. When I went in, I felt sick to my stomach because I knew what his dreams were. He was very jovial, like his old self, even joked a little. But that was little consolation. I found a good spot to tell him that he could ask Jesus to take away the monsters and He would. This was what I felt led to say to him, the only thing I could say to witness to him of Jesus love. He gave me the reply above, I knew that he would say this, as he always seemed to say so in various ways. There’s not much you can say to witness to a man like that. I fully believe that if grandad had asked Jesus to take away the monsters, He also would have healed him. I fully believed even at that moment, that was Jesus, offering him one last chance. I left the room after giving him a hug, my love, and final farewell, hiding and choking back tears. As soon as I got out of the room, it all came out and I broke down in great sorrow and sobbing. I’m crying right now as I always do when I think about him, and where he is, and what could have been. This sorrow is worse than if he had died and gone to heaven. I will forever rejoice from now on when a saved loved one dies, because I know this sorrow. It cannot compare to a death of a brother and sister in Messiah, it just cannot. The death of brothers and sisters in Messiah are time of rejoicing, we will see them Again.\n\n","date":"December 3, 2011 at 3:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5191","author":"A.

I can believe this book and these pictures painted as the bible comments that “in the last days, young men will dream dreams and old men will have visions and he will pour out his spirit.”\nSo then I came to look for the picture of Jesus, after the book. I think the picture could be right, but if it isn’t, does it really matter in the grand scheme of things? It is nice to picture the person you are praying about and to, whether the person be dead or alive. (and some people need that). If we picture this Jesus when we pray, I am sure it won’t really matter if when we get to heaven, he doesn’t look like that. Remember our parents and grandparents will not look like they did on earth, if they died in their old age. So we will have alot to adapt to. Although I believe it will all be completely natural for us.\nAfter reading negative comments about the picture of “The First” I was expecting something sordid and expected to be shocked. After seeing it, all I saw was pure total innocence, Stunning!! Remember your first innocent love? or maybe it wasn’t innocent for you, or perhaps you feel guilty about something? Not sure why people think as they do, perhaps this world has also distorted our image of pureness too much!\nAbout the pictures of Hindus in this work, I think someone mentioned. God needs to reach all people. Perhaps that picture will peek someones interest from another religion and Christ will reach them that way, We don’t know. “God makes a way where there seems to be no way.” ” All things work to the good of those who love the Lord,” even when it doesn’t look like it.\nAbout the shroud, it is immaterial!! (pun intended.) If people think it is real maybe it is, if they don’t maybe it isn’t. Only God knows some things, for sure!\n\n","date":"November 4, 2011 at 5:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4551","author":"Janette","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I just watched Heaven is 4 real and thought it awesome and Akiane’s picture is amazing, Last year I built a 8′ cross with a 2′ crown of thorns over it and one night about 11PM I was reading my Bible and asxked the Lord for the words to testify and three hours later woke up at 3AM and could not sleep and went to the kitchen and looked outside to see a full moon and I was moved to take photos of the cross with the moon and ran out to the barn, it was Oct 23rd and clear and cold outside and took it out and snapped 6 photos 10 to 15 seconds apart the first being clear the second a fog dropped into the picture, the third and forth a thickening fog started to swirl around the cross and in the fifth photo it formed into a pillar of cloud coming up from the ground behind the cross perfectly over the cross heading towards heaven “Beautiful” and the sixth photo it dissapeared, I use the photos to testify now and people are amazed as so am I still, if anyone would like a set write me and I will send you a set, just put “the cross” for the headliner for me to open it and you can use them for testifying too as I have given hundreds of copies for people to use in many churches, the chances of this happening at that moment over a cross no less is astranomical so it is very powerful. my address is    all one word…..  fortheking2010@aol.com    God bless!\n\n","date":"November 4, 2011 at 11:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4590","author":"John Watkins Jr.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I only wish I could put the pictures of the cross here. fortheking\n\n","date":"November 4, 2011 at 11:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4591","author":"John Watkins Jr.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"But Colton Burpo described Jesus as having red “markers” on the palms of his hands, whereas the image on the Shroud shows blood from wrist wounds.

After Jesus had risen, He appeared to the disciples. But Thomas was not with them at the time. When the other disciples told Thomas “We have seen the Lord”, Thomas replied (verse 25):\n“Unless I see IN HIS HANDS the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails… I will not believe.” In Verse 27, Jesus tells Thomas, “Reach hither thy finger, and behold MY HANDS…”\nI would never want to argue with the Word of God. Colton’s account lines up with scripture. And most traditional churches teach that the nails went into the palms of Jesus’ hands. Blood would also have run down from the hands onto the wrists. With all the physical brutality that Jesus suffered, I don’t doubt that his wrists were injured, as well.There was nary a part of His body that wasn’t scourged.\nThere is so much that we won’t know & understand until we get to Heaven. That is why childlike faith is required. We are to trust & believe, and not attempt to argue our way out of all He has done for us.

James, the Lord’s brother, might have been a cousin instead. \nAnother thing to consider: the reason why the nails were put through the wrists is because the nails won’t hold if they’re put through the palms of the hands. Think of a skeleton with the long long fingers: there’s nothing but soft tissue that holds our hands and finger bones together. So if nails were put through the palms, they ripped out as the body sagged on the nails. The Romans did put the nails through the wrist, for that reason… so the nails would hold the body up on the cross. \nIf we knew more about the original languages, we might learn that hands and wrists were the same word or close enough that it didn’t matter. Or somebody translating Hebrew to Greek got confused and it’s been that way ever since… etc.  \nUltimately, I don’t think it matters much. It would be nice if we could solve some of these discrepancies but how is anyone going to actually prove anything? Jesus Himself would have to appear among us to settle the question.\n\n","date":"November 10, 2011 at 1:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4695","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Annie, I had that very same thought as I was writing last night— that hands and wrists might have been considered part of the same thing.\nThe important thing for all of us to bear in mind, is not to get into dissension over trifles.\nI think that most of us are on here because we enjoyed the Burpo’s book.\nThere always be those who will try to argue their way out of believing  ANYTHING, but those of us who have faith must maintain unity & agreement in the basics, and not allow anything to derail our faith.

Such an amazing story.  I’ve always been intrigued by NDE but even more so now.   I’m finding myself wanting to pass on from this physical world just to experience the joy of Heaven the way Coltron Burpo did.   If God wants me to “come back”, then He is not ready for me.   May His will be done. \nHowever, what bothers me about all the questions about “is God for real?”, “is His son for real?”, etc, etc, etc….  We all know what Jesus said to Thomas,,, so why not be blessed for  believing even though one has not seen”.   It’s certainly a better alternative.  When you do believe (and I do) all thoughts about God,Jesus, Heaven become real in your heart and soul.\nThe physical life you lead, when you believe, makes you a better person and one who is trying to do God’s work.  The blessings are abundant.  \nAlthough I’m a practicing Catholic, being a Christian and believer comes first. Let’s all love God and our neighbors as we are asked to do by the one who has given us eternal life, just for the asking.\n\n","date":"November 16, 2011 at 3:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4850","author":"Richard A.

I am someone who found this site as I have the two paintings of Jesus by Akiane Kramarik and I also had a near-death experience. Somehow I think we are closer in our love of God than you think. And I truly admire your choice to be a passionate advocate for God :)  \nThis forum is obviously not optimal for a conversation like this, but just to briefly respond to your latest note in this thread ..  \nPersonally experiencing God does not result in “interpretation” of Truth as that is not the way of God. God IS faithful, gracious, and unchanging, not misleading or capricious. Although interpreting the words of God in the Bible, or any other text or thought, without direct conversation with God does result in infinite interpretations! \nAlso, God is neither passive nor distant as many believe, and spans all of the religions, philosophies, and sciences of this world. The amazing beauty of God is everywhere, yet historically, most of us have been unable to see this. Jesus happened to be one of the few human beings who walked this world as God without any veils. \nWhile we are “in” this world, we are advised in the Bible to not be “of” this world. Who knows what this really means? I personally had no idea until God began revealing its meaning. And believe me, the reality of God is beyond our wildest dreams. Nothing of this world is what we ‘think’.\nAnyway, you, and others here, may be interested in an infomentary called “The Star of Bethlehem” as well as the accounts documented in this film: http://bit.ly/oz8L1o . They provide further expansions to our notions of God, from the Christian perspective, and I hope they bring further enlightenment, or at minimum, greatly add to the mystery ;) \nMy deepest prayer is for all to experience who they really are. Until then, Mark 12:28-34. \nIn love and gratitude ♥\n\n","date":"November 24, 2011 at 5:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4998","author":"Michele","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Yes, that link is interesting.

I love that part. \nIf we try to figure out ahead of time how God will handle Judgment Day, our frail brains come up with all kinds of strange theories. I think we should leave it alone before we say something silly. We know God will be fair about it. \nGod spans all religions… I can agree with this to a degree. Not that God represents or is part of all religions, but rather: that God is ABOVE all religions. And I say that in it’s most ironic sense. He is above it all, beyond it all… so far above and beyond that God has nothing to do with any of them. What God looks at is His Only Son and those who follow Him. Jesus didn’t come to start a Religion: Jesus said over and over that He wanted us to have a relationship with His Father. \nEven Christianity can become a mere “religion” if it’s followers engage in legalism instead of relationship.\n\n","date":"November 25, 2011 at 2:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5011","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I have read “Heaven is For Real”, and was very moved by this testimony.

I wasnt feeling well so i layed down on the sofa. I remember my head spinning, then things went dark, then slowly there was a dim light and it started to grow brighter and brighter. Then i was walking in what seemed like clouds, i looked up and in front of me were these huge gates with scrolled designs all over it. Up in the left corner i saw what looked like a neon sign and it would fade from saying Heaven to fading out, then fade back and saying exit. I still dont understand that. I walked thru the gates and walked in these clouds, as i was walking i noticed more peoplle around me. Then suddenly i was pulled into what i still call a worm hole, i remember going realy fast in all sorts of directions, i could feel the wind on me and even the mist from clouds, and i remember lights flashing as i went thru. It was so awesome!! Then i was let down and standing in a street and there were hundreds of people walking along with me to a town just in front of us. I remember i saw my Grandmothers and Grandfathers and other family members. I remember my mom saying “I saw Judy Goodall, and she is so beautiful now” . (Judy was a friend that had passed away 12 years ago). I remember seeing my dad. And i remember seeing a man in a white robe walking along with us, somehow i knew who he was (Jesus). People were talking but i couldnt realy make out what they were saying. Then we were in a small town. I walked around it looking for my friend Rich, i went into stores, resturants, houses but couldnt find him. I remember sitting in this HUGE library and a big book was open on the table in front of me and i remember seeing names and dates. Then i got up went outside and thats when i realized how quiet it was, no car motors no horns no humming fans, you could hear birds chirping and dogs barking lightly. I walked up a small hill thru a beautiful park, then walked up to an old man operating a jackhammer, but it didnt make any noise. I asked him where i am and he said “Your neither here nor there, your in the land in between” (some how it made sense). I walked a little more just amazed at the unsual quiet and looking at how beautiful it was there. Then i woke up. I was covered in what looked like a light mist and gasping for breath. and i remember i wanted to go back to that place soooo badly.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2011 at 9:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5050","author":"Michael Wilks","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Wow, that’s quite an experience, Michael.

Becoming like little children without presumptions and prideful thoughts that make folks think they “know” God and have something up on others seems so foreign to many people who call themselves Christians.

It makes me want to scream! I just don’t want to be clumped into that sect of people. I have a feeling that some may respond to me that this is the way of the world and the pharisees and hypocrits but somehow (and I don’t know how that is) but somehow, God wants to set the world right on Who He really is and what Love is and that there is a Voice rising up to speak the Truth. The world is just not getting it! God’s love and grace is so profound, so extreme, so magnificent. A child has a humble heart. A child doesn’t think they know it all.

Be it because of people who are judgmental, controlling, prideful, jealous, cliquish, cruel, selfish, gossipy, or whatever.

What is great about his messages is how easily they are applied to real life.\nYou spoke of ppl being alienated from church now. The Bible speaks about a falling away in the last days. And, it IS hard to find a good Bible-based church that teaches truth. I have heard that Internet Church is the next big wave that is starting.

I figured God would do this for her eventually because she really needs to know what it’s like to be in a decent family. And by the time she found this man, a lot of the ginger had been knocked out of her so she wasn’t looking for excitement anymore, she just wanted peace.\nI noticed that she didn’t know how to be “normal” because of the bizarre life she’d had. Now she’s very grateful for the peace of being in a quiet, normal relationship.\nWhen Adam & Eve ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the serpent was right about some things. He said they would become like God, knowing good and evil. I believe this is possibly our Quest in Life, the purpose for our existance. You have encountered evil and you know what it is. There is some wisdom in knowing this, especially if God helps to process those horrible experiences so they turn into wisdom.\nYou also need to understand what Goodness is… and the word “good” is so much more rich than we realize it is. The Bible says that only God is good. The little bit we know about “goodness” is only the tip of the iceberg you might say: it’s only a teeny glimpse into the immense goodness of God.\nI found this website just now, because I love the book of Hebrews where it talks about how God does everything “Better.” A better Way, a better Covenant etc.\nhttp://www.messianic-literary.com/hebrews.htm\nThat’s a messianic Jewish site which is kinda cool. I thought the outline he provided was a good start on reading Hebrews in light of knowing something BETTER. YES, God has a BETTER plan for your life!\n\n","date":"November 30, 2011 at 8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5118","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Thank you.

He can weep with those who weep. The cross we bear is possibly preparing us, training us to provide “first aid” for wounded souls too. \nPain and loss are truly the fires God uses to refine the soul to greater luster.

My experiences included disfigurement and impairments from childhood injuries, uninvolved parents, dysfunctional relationships and abusive marriage, and a near-fatal accident resulting in amnesia, brain injury, and long-term cognitive, nervous system, and structural damage. I did have “near-death experiences” with the last injury, yet seeing beyond the physical impairments was very difficult. At 40, I too felt 100 — alone, successful career terminated overnight, extremely frail and weak with little understanding about why I returned and what this (seemingly) crazy life here was even about. \nAfter seeking healing from nearly every traditional, alternative, and spiritual treatment possible, God graciously began revealing to me what true healing, and life, is about. And suffice to say, what is being revealed is far and away beyond anything I could have ever imagined. \nThe best advice I could offer is to continue trusting your truth, and go deeper within yourself for all the answers you seek. Massive shifts in our world and human consciousness have been happening for the past few decades and God is revealing to EVERY one right now. And while many share similarities in experiences and resonate with similar messages, each of our paths to Truth are unique. As you are already sensing, if/when you experience Truth, you will definitely know it beyond any doubt. Love ..

I looked at the picture and felt the man was maybe  a little “too handsome” for Jesus. The Bible describes him as being common looking, not someone that would attract people due to his looks, but because of his message. Yet, who am I to say what Colton saw?  Two people can see the same thing and describe it differently. To me, it doesn’t matter if there is a picture of Jesus…..or Noah’s Ark is found.  We are blessed, because we “believe without seeing.”  I really think that if we have faith, we don’t need justification by our five senses…..and for some who do not believe, no amount of physical “proof” will convince them otherwise.  About a week before my husband passed away, I felt he was sort of “in-between” this world and heaven. He appeared to be talking to people at times.  He said the word “baby” a few times.  I was a little confused about that. All of the sudden I felt in my heart, that he was speaking of the “baby” that I miscarried in 1998.  When I told my stepdaughter, she also felt he was seeing heaven and that baby ( I was about 3 months pregnant when it happened…like Colton’s mom). He forms us in the womb, right?

This generation is very good at asking doubts, but they don’t know how to find answers. They can dig a hole, but don’t know what to fill it with. So all they’ve got is a hole. That’s what doubts do for us. \nJesus got annoyed with people who doubted Him. He said many times, “Where is your faith?”  He thought it was so easy, all we have to do is believe in Him so why is it so difficult?  Jesus did a zillion miracles, but the Bible says that he couldn’t do many miracles when He was in Galilee because the people there didn’t have faith. I think that’s amazing: our faith is sooo important?  Apparently it is. \nIn the Bible book of Hebrews 11: 6 it says, “And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.”\nIf you want to help your mind be more peaceful, I recommend reading the Bible books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These tell the story of Jesus. He was such an awesome person, it’s peaceful just reading about Jesus.  And John 3:16 tells us how to be Saved of course. So does Hebrews 11:6 (above).\n\n","date":"December 16, 2011 at 4:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5601","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I want to add that Jesus said He came to give us LIFE and to give it more abundantly.

If you have a bible, take a look at Jeremiah 29:11.\nand… I promise (more importantly God promises) that there is HOPE for your future. Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of and lots of hope for YOUR future.\nI think that depression and low-spirit comes from pushed down anger. Anger can stem from fear, guilt or feelings of lack of self worth or not realizing how you are truly valuable and valued by God.  Fear, anger, guilt and condemnation (self contempt??) may come from lying thoughts about how God sees you and thus how you respond to Him. \nGod is not angry or disappointed. He is pleased with you and would like you to talk to Him – no matter what condition you are in. Ronnie, He wants a one on one relationship with you.  He wants to hang with you, to kick-it with You.  the bible says he can’t stop thinking about YOU.  \nRegarding the painting:  I can see that the expression in the eyes could come across intimidating. Perhaps it is to show you that the root of the depression is from false fear: that is: insecurity (not feeling safe) and inferiority (not feeling valued or valuable).  The only “right” fear -is that of respect for God and proper respect for ourselves and rightful authority.  Any other kind of fear is to keep us from trusting God’s amazing grace, love and mercy.  \nThe Bible says perfect love drives out fear and that he who fears is not made perfect in love. It says fear has torment. I think this is related to the fear of punishment.\nPunishment is related to guilt for wrong-doing – but when we place our trust in the fact that Jesus took the punishment for our wrong-doing — we have peace with God. \nJesus took all of the punishment for us – so that God could lavish upon us ALL of is love. This is love, not that we love God, but that he loved us and gave Jesus (his son) to be the atoning sacrifice for all our wrong-doing.  \nFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosever believes on Him should not perish, but have eternal life. John 3:16\nGod did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. John 3:17\nPlease ask Him to help you trust Him – and he will.  kindest regards.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2011 at 4:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5668","author":"Joy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I will pray for you, that you will understand that God loves you ,and that he is with you and always will be.\n\n","date":"December 24, 2011 at 4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6089","author":"Ariel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Amazing peace to finally meet an image of my Father and Best Friend.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2011 at 2:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-5638","author":"Debbie Jenkins","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"If Jesus Christ really existed then why is there so little written about him.

Being a Christian tends to separate to sheep from the goats, especially if a person is committed to walking a selfless life then I think they encounter even more opposition from surprisingly disappointing persons.

I read about a child recently who killed his grandmother because she wouldn’t let him play his video game. Or a son who killed his parents because his cell phone was confiscated for punishment. These things are happening, it is good vs. evil. The same conflict that began in the Garden of Eden. \nYour claim that there is no proof Jesus Christ existed is baffling. He was not a world leader and yet one of the ancient historians mentioned him. Jesus, a mere carpenter from a small village in a small country of slaves, a man who died as a common criminal among other nameless criminals… this man Jesus Christ attracted the attention of Josephus. It is quite remarkable that he is mentioned at all.

It compelled me to share a story about my father.  He was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 53.  One week before he died, he was on constant oxygen and could barely speak without taking a few seconds in between words.  He could speak one word and then had to have a deep breath to speak another word.  Also during the last week of his life, he was in and out of reality.  Sometimes he was lucid and sometimes he was not.  Some days he recognized us and, in his labored speech, talked competely rational.  On the last day of his life, all of our family was in the hospital room with him.  His brother and sister were there too.  He and his brother were very very close.   Most of that day, he was not “with us”. EXCEPT when he looked at his brother.  Although it was difficult for him to say, he kept telling him that Jesus was coming at 6 o’clock.  Throughout the entire day, he would tell his brother, and only him, that Jesus was coming.  We didn’t know if he was in his right mind or not.  Just minutes before 6 o’clock on that Saturday afternoon, he got a “look” in his eyes.  He sat himself up in the bed, with strength he hadn’t had in weeks, and said the 23rd Psalm from start to finish without taking a breath in between.  He spoke as easily as you or I can.  After he said the 23rd Psalm, he began to sing.  Again, with no effort and his words flowed a beautiful tune.  In the middle of the hymn, he died.  Although I was devistated at losing him and still to this day cry over losing him so young, what a wonder thing to leave us with.  Jesus did come, at 6:o’clock and carried him to heaven.  After reading this book, I am even more excited to see him again.  To see him well, without pain and sickness.

I have always been afraid of death but recently more so than ever before.  I suppose I have come to realize how precious life is and how it can be lost in the blink of an eye and its frightening to think about.  And although I was raised Roman Catholic I am sorry to admit that at times I have questioned if this is all for real.  I don’t remember how I came to hear about this book but I’m glad that I did.  I downloaded it on my Kindle and am so glad that I did because this book has changed my life in a positive way.  It has deepened my faith in God and has encouraged me to build a better relationship with Him.  I have always wanted to read the Bible but never could get past Genesis.  My first step in building my relationship with God is to read the Bible all the way through.  After reading this book I downloaded the Bible and am currently on Second Kings (Farther than I have ever gotten!).  I feel my relationship with God grow stronger as I get through each book and I can’t wait to finally get into the New Testament to learn more about Jesus.  I talk to Jesus all the time now and share my feelings about anything that comes to mind.  Even though he doesn’t “talk back” I know that He is listening.  I have recommended this book to friends and family because I believe every word.  I know that there’s is nothing to be afraid of when you die because there is a paradise where we will be forever young and beautiful surrounded by God and all of our loved ones who we cherish so much on Earth.\n\n","date":"January 5, 2012 at 6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6581","author":"Michelle","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Something for the atheists to ponder: If you were to die tomorrow, are you sure about the end of your story?

The fishermen in John 21 were most likely about to give up, it was their livelyhood to fish , a very tough but rewarding life. They were most likely up before dawn, set the sails and went out to the sea to catch fish so that they could sell them and feed their families. Jesus had already been crucified and the disciples were back out fishing for fish……On this fine morning they were not catching anything and most likely at the point of giving up….\nHave you ever been in the position that you were about to give up, feeling that you were on the wrong side….or most likely on the good side and not seeing the fruits of your labor? Either at work or in your personal life? Giving up may be the easy route to go, but remember that Jesus is always there for you, listen to Him and he will guide you through…\nWell, Jesus instructed the Disciples, they listened.\nHe instructs you, He is always there for you,you just have to listen…\nJesus was there for the Disciples, instructed them because He know’s best, He knows where the Fish are…He is the best Fishfinder….\nHe knows what is right for you, He knows you, so listen to Him so that you end up on the Right Side Of A Good Thing.\nYour Brother in Christ,\nFisherman Al\n\n","date":"January 8, 2012 at 12:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6669","author":"Fisherman Al","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I believe, Just read it, The Holy Spirit is real.\n\n","date":"January 8, 2012 at 3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6682","author":"Randy Mcarthur","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"In August of 2010, I lost my job of 20 years.  I trust in God, and always pray that His will be done, no matter the cost, so when this catastrophe happened, I took a deep breath, walked out of the conference room, and out my good Wall St. job.  Trusting God while in a storm can still be frightful so one night soon after, while in pining over what happened, and how would I financially take care of my family, I decided to meditate on the goodness of God and to praise Him in this storm, of which I went into a dreamlike state and Jesus appeared.  He walked down a graduating black Onyx staircase where a thrown sat upon.  He was dressed in a radiant white robe type of loose clothing, and reached out His hand to me.  We then began to dance a dance I do not know of, like when a couple dancing their first dance at their wedding.  He lead the dance, and I followed.  The floor was made of crystal like glass.  What was different this time when I saw Jesus, then other visions I’ve had of Him, was this time I saw His face.  His face, skin color, hair type and body type appear like they do in this picture. He’s so beautiful and He is such a graceful dancer; words cannot describe… When I look at this picture the only thing I can think of is how much I love Him, my true husband, and the husband of us all.  I can’t wait to be with Him again and dance that dance.\n\n","date":"January 10, 2012 at 4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6785","author":"Maria","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"That’s very beautiful, thank you.

In the dream I woke up, got up from bed, got dressed, drove to my church I used to attend when I was a kid and noticed several cars parked around the main entrance. The entire dream was in real time, including the drive to the church. I remember feeling the cold of the aluminum metal on the door, the spring breeze on my skin, the smell of the old carpeting in the lobby. I walked down the front stairs to the basement of the old building where my sunday school classes had been. There were new double doors with a small vertical window above each handle. I can’t explain why I did everyting I did in the dream- I just did it. But I leaned over to look through the little window in the door. I saw all my extended family at folding tables arranged like a big “T” with the top of the T furthest from the door- my eyes were instantly drawn to the center of the top of the T where I saw Jesus sitting and looking straight at me with a smile. I never stopped to wonder who He was= I knew the split second I saw Him that He was Jesus, no doubt whatsover.\n I yanked my head back and gasped and grabbed my face and was touching my eyes to feel that they were open, almost in shock, and saying to myself outloud\n” oh my word, it’s REALLY HIM, I’M REALLY HERE, I’M AWAKE, AND THIS ISN’T A DREAM!!!” I was SURE I was NOT dreaming.\n I moved into the room and looked up and he was still looking right at me, as if no one else were in the room. I kept touching my face and even feeling my eyes to know that I was awake and not dreaming, and every time I looked up at Him I gasped and started to hyperventilate- I could not keep staring at Him because I felt as if I was really going to faint with joy and being overwhelmed. I could feel His love as if it were a tangible thing going right into me- and touching every part of me from the inside- I felt amazing, but at the same time like I could fall to pieces from so much joy that I have never experienced on earth, and it was the same each time I looked slowly up at Him “OH MY WORD! IT’S REALLY HIM, I’M REALLY HERE, THIS IS NOT A DREAM.”\n I had to get close to Him. I just wanted to be near Him- He saw through me but loved me so profoundly that I didn’t care about anything ever except being close to Him. I remember my aunt’s gossip, and my big uncle pushed back from the table- hearing all their conversations, but I only wanted to and absolutely HAD TO be close to Him. When I got to Him I collapsed at His feet- looking down at His feet I wept such tears that as I tried to open my eyes it was like looking down from the top of running fawcettes- I never wept like that before- I was just so indescribably glad to finally see Him in person, who my heart had longed for all my life- to finally see Him for real there.\n I wanted to ask Him the only thing that mattered to me at the moment but couldn’t speak because of my sobbing, so I naturally just thought to Him, “am I gonna be with You forever?” knowing He heard my thoughts. And He leaned down, took my chin in His hand and gently brought my face up to His and said ” Ooooh  yeaaaaaah” in the most loving and heart felt way. Then I woke up and it was morning for real, and I realized it was a dream, but my pillow was soaked with tears. I have shared this dream/ vision with a lot of people and always said there is not a picture that exists that comes close to portraying the immense love and joy in the face that I saw. But when I saw the painting by Akiane, it really stunned me how it looked like Jesus . In my dream there was so much radiance in His face and eyes that it was as if sunlight was coming from Him instead of to Him, and His eyes looked like they were full of sunlight- dazzlingly gorgeous, like flecks of gold sparkling in them- even though we were in a dull room with flourescent lighting. I’m 44 and I still remember all the details as if it happened this morning. But my faith is in Jesus, not a dream. I do believe I saw Him in person that night though. I believe that we will all recognize Him the instant we see Him, even if it’s across a vast room full of people. I believe that everyone who longs for Him will have the most immeasurable joy to see face to face for the first time the lover of their soul. For now we see dimly, but then we will see Him face to face.\n\n","date":"January 12, 2012 at 2:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6838","author":"Alan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I just read Heaven Is for real and looked at the Prince of peace: the resurection and I am Just 11 and Jesus’s eyes are SO BEAUTIFUL And THE COLOR IS NOT FROM EARTH THAT I CAN CLEARLY SAY!\n\n","date":"January 12, 2012 at 1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6855","author":"Zachary","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I had a near death experience also. I was in a car accident at 75 mph. I knew the Lord was with me..”but nothing happened until I said JESUS.” A light came into my car and it was so bright I couldn’t see out of the windshield. I was at total peace. I didn’t here the CD playing and I wasn’t scared. HE spoke to me. He told me ” I allowed you to think you were driving, but I was driving all along. Be yea anxious for nothing.” The car spun out of control across 3 lanes, went up an enbankment and hit a cement block that held up an exit sign causing the windows to blow out and the two front tires to blow. The car stood “90 degrees” up in the air spinning,then landed on the guard rail, sliding about 25 yards on top of it. Then it rolled off and landed on its side. When the car landed, I came back to my body. It was like a video going backwards or something (hard to explain it). Then I heard the cd playing, car running, and people yelling call 911. I climbed out the driver window(which had been blown out) raised my hands in the air and said, “Don’t worry the Lord was with me.” Their jaws dropped. I didn’t have a bump, bruise, or even a headache! I KNOW HE’s REAL!  I SAW death looking at me. It was sitting on the hood of my car as a shadow silhouette, waiting for a response of fear, but God had put a partition between us.  PRAISE THE LORD!!! Hallelujah!!! He saved me!

My mother always told me, if you can’t think of what to pray when you are in a situation, just say His Name, “Jesus”.  When I was a girl, I was visited and harassed by demons.  Probably because when I was ten years old my friends and I for a short time played with a wigi board, and I made friends with a new girl in the neighborhood whose mother was a witch. At that time, no one knew what to do about the situation.  At last, when I was about 14 my other was going to talk to the priest in my parish.  However, one night while having one of these visits, I was able to get the Lord’s name out of my mouth, and at the speed of thought the demon vanished. That’s when I learned about the power in His Name… that beautiful Name. Last week a believer friend and I got together for an after Holiday get together.  We talked about all the things God is doing, and has done in our lives.  She told me that recently, her brother who is a Psychiatrist (non-believer) and his wife; a lawyer (and believer) were in a would be mortal car accident in their Lexis car.  After they left my friend’s home that night something came over my friend to pray for them for their long car ride back home from New Jersey to Philadelphia. Their car was struck, and flipped onto its top, completely flattening and crushing it.  While they were still inside, they heard the police, paramedics and fire company talking among themselves about cutting the car open with the jaws of life, and preparing themselves for what would be inside.  Once they cut the car apart, they were completely shocked to find the two of the alive and untouched.  My friend’s brother gave the credit to the Lexis, but his wife and my friend knew it was God.  Sad for him, grand for his wife and my friend.\n\n","date":"January 13, 2012 at 3:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-6937","author":"Maria","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I really enjoy the personal stories on this blog; of miraculous intervention and divine encouragement.

I’m Maria, who wrote on this blog for the first time on January 13.  This is new for me, as I don’t usually blog with strangers.  However, even though I’m tired, I believe God wants me to share my story with you.  Only a few people know it, because it is hard for me sometimes to share this particular story.\nThirty years ago when I was 21, I had an audible encounter with Father God that forever changed me.  About a year later, I had a vision-dream where I went to Heaven.  There is much to this vision, but there is one part of the vision I think will continue to help you on your faith journey.\nAt one point in my vision, angels were asked to take me and all of the hundreds, maybe thousands of people at my banquet table on a trip around Heaven.  The angels came by in wagons, pulled by horses, and driven by angels. They took us around, and I saw the three Heavens, mansions, mountains, and a pond type grotto surrounded by snow (of which was not cold, just beautiful).  As we were driven around, we asked the angels questions and were just enjoying the trip.  During the ride I saw a building compound which looks like an Ivy League campus. The sound of young children’s voices singing was coming out of this building, so I asked one of the angels what that building was and what was going on inside.  The angel said to me, “It’s where the boys live who died, but never lived, they sing before the Throne of God both day and night”.\nWhen I came out of this dream vision, I didn’t know what the angel meant, so I prayed about it and asked God.  He told me it was where the boys who died went, and that there were babies there being raised who were sent to earth, but for one reason or another had died before they had a chance to live.  At the time, I enjoyed the vision, received insight to many things that happened on that trip, but the part about the boys and where they lived didn’t make personal sense to me, because I was young and didn’t know of any babies that died.\nI got married at 30, and had my first child at 31 after a troublesome pregnancy.  My husband and I tried to add to our little family for six years after my daughter was born, and then finally became pregnant. This pregnancy was far worse than the first.  I was hospitalized, bed ridden, had in-home nurse care, had an in-home feeding IV and catheters dispensing medicine into my thigh 24 hours a day.  I lost 48 pounds in 4 months and was close to death. The doctors decided to artificially make an opening so they could insert a feeding tube. The tube was to go in on a Tuesday, the day after Martin Luther King Day, but in morning of the Sunday before the procedure, my water broke.  I was only 21 weeks along.\nDaniel was born that morning, and lived only four minutes.\nAbout 10:30 pm one night, about eight months after before going to sleep I decided to read a Psalm.   After reading the Psalm, I closed the Bible, and asked God, what exactly was that whole event about and what possible could be the reason He allowed it to happen.  Well, I didn’t get an answer, and so I shut the light and was drifting off to sleep when my daughter who had been asleep from about 8:30 pm was calling me to come in her room.  She was calling mommy, mommmyyyy, mommmyyyy.  Her voice was soft, and not frightened, or urgent.  I got up and went inside to ask her what was the matter.  She said that Jesus was standing in front of her with two angels, of which she said, my angel was there and his name was John, and He wants to tell you something.  I ran and got my Bible because I was scared.  I decided to test her so I asked her to ask Jesus what He wanted.  She said Jesus said to her, “Let your mother know that Daniel is where the boys are, who died, but never lived…and that he sings before the Throne of God both day and night”. I stood there in the most reverent fear and trembling, because I knew that my daughter did not know my story of the vision I had so many years ago, and I knew that she really was seeing Jesus and talking with Him.  In my mind, I was saying who takes care of these boys…silly thoughts that only an earthly mom would think.  But Jesus knew what I was thinking and also added the following, he said, “tell your mother that Daniel is being raised by an angel named Marla.\nI must admit, even though Jesus comforted me in such a huge dramatic way, humanly, the loss of Daniel still hurts when we think about it, and I’d rather have been the one to raise him, and not Marla.  However, God’s plans are perfect, and one day I will meet my son, and understand the things that I do not understand now.  I’m also glad that I can at least say that I definitely know of one person who is in Heaven, my boy Daniel…and now your son.\n\n","date":"January 24, 2012 at 8:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-7468","author":"Maria","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Maria that is truely AMAZING….

Anything I had planned to pray and meditate on just vanished, and all I could do was praise Him.  I’ve also smelled the scent of Frankincense, even once as I was waited on a train platform in New York City, and everyone knows what that smells like.  At the time, I belonged to a  non-denominational weekly mid-day prayer meeting at St. Patrick’s Cathedral.  I met with one of the priests to ask him what this meant.  He said that the scent of Frankincense is associated with deliverance… either for yourself, or for someone you were praying for.  So, whenever I smell Frankincense, it’s like an Angel gets its wings on “It’s a Wonderful Life”.  When I smell the flowery scent, I just stop whatever I’m doing and take a lot of long deep breaths to enjoy the Lord’s presence.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2012 at 1:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-7711","author":"Maria","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I Have jsut smelled it once, the night I described above.

The Book of Revelation tells of Jesus’ return while riding on a horse to the battle of Armageddon.  If God doesn’t love animals, then why would He have created them in the Garden of Eden in the first place…He even created them before creating Eve!  And why would it be so important for Him to instruct Noah to build an enormous arc to save so many of them?  Why not just have Noah save himself and his family?  Animals are very important to Him.\nWhile in Heaven, I came upon a compound like building that hosted and housed boys being raised by Angels, who were learning music and they were singing.  My blog entry on 1/24/12 tells more about the boys in Heaven.  Now, I am sure that many many people would say that this is just a story, or a hallucination or something like that, well all I have to say is that I had the vision in or around 1982 at the age of 22, and everyone knows that it is not cool for a 22 years old to be telling a story of a vision of Heaven, it was not something at the time I was desiring for myself.  I’m an everyday Italian girl from Brooklyn, now a wife and mother, living in a bedroom community in New Jersey, who loves God and loves His beautiful Son, and is humbly grateful for His Holy Spirit.  I hope to have blessed you more about animals and children being in Heaven.  Bless you and thank you for sharing your story.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 11:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-7881","author":"Maria","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"It says in the bible about animals: don´t take the egs out of a nest, dont cook an animal in the mothers milk (that would be cruel), and it says claerly somewhere that God cares ablout both humans and animals…\n\n","date":"February 3, 2012 at 4:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-7884","author":"rebecca","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Young Colton Burpo and Akiane Kramarik have been blessed by G-d with their visions thus making it possible for us to see special insights into the realm beyond the curtain of death.

He could have been just about any skincolor shade. There are dark jews and light ones, as Rebecca explained. And because he was outside a lot he was probably dark anyway. Just about anything is POSSIBLE, because the Bible doesn’t provide a description of him. Not even his haircolor, whether he was tall or short: NOTHING.  And I think that’s deliberate, so no matter who we are, we can identify with WHO Jesus is rather than what he looked like. God doesn’t want it to be a hangup, so He skipped that part when He wrote the 4 Gospels. That’s my opinion. :) \n Michael the great archangel is bronze: what a skincolor that must be!  In heaven we won’t be married, it won’t matter if we’re male or female, it won’t matter what color we are and we won’t care. \nI love Colton’s book but I’m careful to avoid accepting it completely because the story was told by a very young child. Perhaps heaven was presented to Colton in ways that his baby-mind could accept and remember. So everything is most likely over-simplified. I believe most or all of what Colton reported is true, it doesn’t conflict with the Bible at any rate. But it’s coming from a baby, none the less. \nAnd the Bible warns against adding to scripture, in fact there’s a curse for those who try to do that. So Colton’s book cannot and does not carry the same authority as the Bible does.  But it sure is fun to read!! And very encouraging, for many reasons.\n\n","date":"February 6, 2012 at 7:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-7975","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"King David, tribe of Judah, was blond, lighteyed and had a fair complexion.

Some people can’t identify with blonde and blue-eyes… for very difficult reasons and it’s very understandable. \nAnd since the Bible does not SAY what Jesus looked like, we REALLY do not know. Jesus was only half Levite at the very most; the other half could have been any color that God picked out of a hat. The archangel Michael is bronze in color, God could have picked that if He’d wanted to. \nPeople make a mistake when they try to fit something into the Bible that isn’t there. Most of the time it’s not there for a reason.  \nPeople all around the world need to identify with Christ, and if his appearance makes it harder for some people to identify with Him: then God simply didn’t tell us. He left it out. Akiane’s painting is not a photograph of God. \nEven Christ said, “The flesh is meaningless, it is the Spirit that gives life.”  We need to seek Christ in Spirit and in Truth most of all.

On January 10th I wrote my first blog about the time I had a vision where Jesus let me see His face.  I just wanted to add that the time I saw Jesus when we danced, He did look like the man in the Shroud, which also looks like the picture of Akiane.  What was different about His appearance though is when I saw Him, His hair was all dark, I would say black, and very shiny, without highlights, but the room we were dancing in was also dark… we were surrounded by a smooth shiny Onyx type of stone with some type slight sparkle to it, and His skin was definitely olive, and the arm He reached out to me had some noticeable black hair on it, not too woolly though, just enough to notice that it was not without hair.  His eyes did look like those in the picture… they were dark brown with very little hazel color to them, the color is indescribable though because when He looks at you, you aren’t looking at the color, instead you are pierced to the core of yourself and it’s as though they are telling you of things about yourself, the world you came from, the world you are in  now, eternity… love… everything all at once, at the speed of sight… it is too hard to explain. The only word that comes to mind is rapture, and the closest thing is like when two people are in love where it takes their breath away, and when they are together they feel as though everything is right with the world and themselves, without concern or fear.  All I can say is that His eyes spiritually pierce you to the core of all you are, were, and ever will be.  In the first vision of Jesus I ever had, I did not see His face, but I did see His body and hair from the back and side, and it did look like it does in the picture. What was different that time was that the room was brighter and lighter, perhaps the reason why the picture Jesus with highlights is maybe the boy saw Him in a lighter atmosphere.\n\n","date":"February 6, 2012 at 3:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-7996","author":"Maria","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Shalom ,Maria, and thank you for sharing…your wnderful story\nI have “almost” seen him…several times, I couldn´t tell the colour of either hair nor eyes…but he looked very much like Akianes picture, but I agree…the eyes are the most important…and of course a llive person is different.\nI know somebody who saw him, and thought she had seen Jeshua/Jesus..but he looked different shich made her unsure.

I love most of the comments written here.  I had polio when I was almost 10 yrs. old and saw an angel when I was alone in a hospital school and felt abandoned.  Just after I came strongly to the Lord, I was reading my Bible and closed my eyes to pray when I got a vision of Jesus carrying a little girl.  I realized it was Jesus saying He had never abandoned me.  Later my youngest daughter sent me a picture via email of Jesus carrying a 10 yr. old little girl.  I saved it as it was what I had seen in my vision.  God has given me songs to write and over 1400 poems at 3 AM which are now being published on Amazon.com in books of 100 poems with the profits going to different charitable organizations.  I have also written a children’s book entitled “A to Z Animal Stories” with sketches, Bible verses and morals.  The author of the poems are God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit.  God asked that my name not be put on them as He is the author…I was only the vessel He used.  I have seen healings of my friends through prayer and know that God exists.  I can’t wait to see Him and family, friends and lives I hope God has touched through my actions.  I am grateful that I had polio as it made me appreciate all that I do have.  I am blessed by God and I wish blessings on all who believe that Jesus is the only way.  I pray for those who don’t know Him yet.  God loves them too and so do I.  Thank you Jesus that You came and found this little lost sheep!  I too liked the picture Akiane drew of Jesus.

I had miscarried at just over three months.  Grief is an awful feeling and it can lead to a kind of delerium when the pain of sorrow is really bad.  \nI was parking my car at the local shops and was just wracked with grief. I was sobbing so hard I was lost in it really – it was hile I was in this starte I had a sense of blood falling on my hands.  I looked up to see where it was coming from and Jesus was hanging on his cross dripping his blood on me and smiling at me.\nI asked him how come he was smiling.  He said – when I first came up here I hoped you would come.  I then asked him what it was like for him and he invited me to come up and see.  I went inside his body on the cross and streatched myself into his shape so I was hanging on the cross inside him looking out his eyes so I could see what he saw.\nMy whole sense of it was this most flowing love that could see all of eternity in view – there was no anger inside him just gratitude that we had helped him do the work he came to do.  I felt I could hang there as long as possible the pain was so much less than the love flowing though him and out his eyes I forgot about it.  I had such a good time there.\nI looked at the man who nailed Jesus to the cross and I could feel how grateful Jesus was for what the man had done for him.  Jesus could not nail himself to his cross – he needed our help to be crucified.  He needs our help to heal us too – he needs us to give him our pain so he can tranform it with his love.  Thats how he heals us all.\nFor more than six months after this I could see what Jesus saw every time I blinked and it was such a comfort.\nI now believe God gives us all gifts that heal our souls and helps us to work with him to heal the heartache of the whole world.  He does the heling but needs us to help him by sharing the light he gives us with others.  He wants to cover us all with his radiance because he loves us so much he can’t help it.\nThis vision was transforming for me and has been a comfort for more that 30 years.  I never fell pregnant again so I only have one live child – I lost 6 altogether.\nI now believe Jesus meets us all at a time and place that makes sense to each of us – even the non believers.  When I encounter disbelief I know they havn’t met Jesus yet and leave it at that.  Then I pray and ask God to make straight to way of the Lord.  Thats what I do now – I watch wait an pray knowing God reveles Jesus to each of us at the right time.  Its a nice way to live in peace.\nThankyou everyone here for being as honest as you can be no matter what you shared.  I have been blessed by you all.\n\n","date":"February 14, 2012 at 12:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8221","author":"Dianne Porter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Diane, that’s an amazing vision. Quite a revelation… a comfort for people who have experienced extreme loss. \nThe disciples expected Jesus to set up a Kingdom, which he certainly could have done with the power that he had. Instead, Christ deliberately challenged his disciples with words they couldn’t understand until only 12 were left. And then he deliberately gave himself over to the religious authorities who wanted to kill him.  Why was “loss” and “failure” the path he chose? Why was the Cross such a gift for the Father?  Why was blood necessary? And, where was the Love in such a hideous death? \nYour vision touches on a mystery that we can barely understand. Most of us just take it on faith because we don’t get it.

I did not know when entering into that relationship that he was a dangerous criminal with a long record. I found out in a rather scary and traumatic way, when we were actually engaged to be married. (I wont go into that part.) I will tell you that “ending it” provoked stalking in him. He followed me wherever I moved. He would leave a rose at the door step, a voice recording telling me how he couldn’t live without me-many other things over a two year period of time. After about two years of dealing with frequent moves and the terrifying stalking I finally thought I had gotten him to leave me alone and things were pretty good for me. I had a new boyfriend who I really liked,  a new place to live, and a great job..\nOne evening as my new boyfriend and I were watching a movie I heard a tapping at the window behind me. When I turned to look I saw my ex (the stalkers) face in the darkness practically pressed up into the glass. He was so angry and had a weird grin on his face and he just kept tapping the window. Apparently my room mate came home and he walked around to the front of the house, he explained to her that he was an old friend of mine and asked if she could let him in. She did. Not a good thing. He was a forth degree black belt and he had my new boyfriend by the neck in two seconds flat. He asked him if we had “been romantic” to put it nicely. He said if we had been romantic he was going to kill him right then. I ran, he chased me..you get the idea it wasn’t pretty. And sadly, the stalking didn’t end on this day….but something miraculous DID happen on this day after he left.\nI was very tired, and traumatized and went into my room to cry and lay down. I fell asleep….., apparently into a very deep sleep because a couple people had been trying to call me and I didn’t even hear the phone ring. Weird considering the phone was right next to my head on the bed side table. i found myself in a place (all white light) I was initially confused…and I thought to myself “Wait a minute where am I?” Just as I thought where am I-, my thought was answered telepathically. I felt warmth, love, (so much love all around me) I felt souls around me in back of me but didn’t see them (or myself actually.) I was sort of just floating there in the light “talking” telepathically with someone. I remember feeling like maybe it isn’t my time, but enjoyed the feeling so much I didn’t want to leave.(It really feels so joyful and peaceful nothing can compare here on earth, not even the birth of a child, a marriage or other precious blessings.) I think I was shown my life how it “would be” and how a husband and kids would be part of it. I believe I felt my love for them before I even knew them in a physical sense. I remember choosing to leave so I could meet them and go on with my life, I heard telepathically (But clearer and sharper than words on earth) It isn’t your time…you were brought here because you needed to know everything will be okay, it will turn out Okay.”\nI woke with such peace…peace beyond what a dream could bring. I “knew” everything would be okay…someone told me in heaven. And guess what? The stalking stopped (I should be dead.) And I have been happily very happily married for 16 years February 18th, to a true sweetheart of a man, with four great kids together. Everything turned out better than okay. I will never forget that experience…I don’t know what happened that day, but I believe the trauma triggered an NDE. I would be interested to know what others opinions are on that…\n\n","date":"February 14, 2012 at 10:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8254","author":"Kristin","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"If that’s what happened to you, to reassure you… I really wondered what happened to the stalker that night to make him stop completely.

I was asleep one night and I was awoken by gentle waves of bright light that was so full of intense love I could hardly bear it.  The waves of love started on the left side of my head and eventually filled my whole body till only my right foot was out of it.  I asked God to leave my foot in this world because there would be no way I would want to come back if I was totally immersed in it.  \nI call them waves of the living light of God that were conscious so I could relate to your post.\nI don’t believe you had an NDE so much as God blessed you by filling you with his love to combat the harm done to you.  He filled you with his hope for the new life he promised you personally when Jesus died on the cross.  Gods will is to heal our world and our lives by giving us his own incorruptible life.  He was just making a deposit of it in you so you started to get a sense of it and a chance get used to it.\nGod is pretty scary up close and in person – I know if he asked me to die for him I would do it because HE asked me.  I know in my whole being he restrains himself to letting us know him as gently as he can because his love is so intense when he reveals his presence we never want to leave it.\nI am sure you have found this experience in your life has guided your decisions since that time.

Everybody was ok, there was no accident. I’ve always been convinced that an angel grabbed the wheel.

So when Christians die we are immediately in the presence of God. That doesn’t sound like a far-off place, to me! \nAnd we know that angels pop in and out all the time. Seen and unseen. The Bible says that we see through a glass darkly, but then we will see face to face… sometimes we can almost see what’s on the other side of that veil or darkened glass. \nWhen Jesus returns, the sky will be peeled back like a scroll… or you might say: like a piece of paper it will be ripped and thrown aside. \nWow, we when think of ALL the Bible verses and ALL the spiritual experiences people have had the things we’ve seen… eternity is only a breath away.

I ran across it many times but never picked it up. I have a 3 yr old son who was diagnosed with leukemia Dec. 2 2009. I am always busy and stay in the hospital for periods at a time. I dont know if it seemed to hit too close to home or what the case was but i didnt run to buy the book. I decided to buy the book recently. I sat to read it while my 3 children ran around playing and being loud. I was able to finish the book and had different thoughts about it. I was wanting to believe it and love it , but I also thought this boy seems to share all his fathers literal thoughts in his visions. My son, Evan , who had turned 3 yrs old only 2 weeks before ran by just then. I laughed at my own thought , thinking haha, yeah i should show him the picture of the Prince of Peace. Evan ran by again , his sisters chasing him , he laughed. I grabbed his hand and said, hey baby come here. He slowed down , I held the book out opened to the picture. He looked at the page of the picture of PRince of Peace and then at the other that had a few pictures of family members of Colton. I looked at him , looked at his eyes to see a reaction. His eyes gazed back at the picture and said thats GOD AND MARY. I felt numb. I said , what baby …what did you say… He said, dats God … Mary … dats God mom. And just like that he ran offf. Now , i do happen to be Catholic and I pray often to our Blessed Mother. For my son to associate God and Mary seems to be for my benefit or my comfort, but i know i did not coach him or bait him. Matter of fact i asked thinking…. what the h… why not ask, and even laughed. My 3 yr old son could have said anything , anyone…or just ran off but he said GOD and Mary.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2012 at 11:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8356","author":"kristin","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Hi Kristin, welcome to this very special blog.  Back in January, I wrote for the first time on this blog, telling of a time when I had a dream like vision of Heaven and of the boys that were there among other things.  Your above story is so full of the Love of God, and is just beautiful.  I to are from a Catholic background, and was baptized in the fire of the Holy Spirit during a Mass, while on a retreat.  As the Priest was getting ready to serve the Eucharist, Father God started to audibly speak to me and after that, I remained in the Church for roughly 45 minutes after the Mass had ended, but neither the people, priest or I realized what had happened.  It was as if I was there with Father God alone.  Over the past 30 years, I’ve noticed the Church constantly directing focus on Jesus as the only One who should be worshiped because He alone is Savior, and that Mary’s place is to be admired, appreciated and adored, just as Jesus admired, appreciated and adored her. But, from one Catholic to another, and from one Jewish Son to His Jewish mother, I am sure Jesus has a very high and honorable place in heaven for Mary, and I’m sure He will want us to know her.  Blessings to you and your children.  Peace.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2012 at 12:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8379","author":"Maria","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"In Colton’s story, the little boy did see Mary in heaven.

Jesus’s book…”the Bible”…tells us there are other throwns around his thrown for those who he puts there according to his own pleasure. But remember Jesus is not a mere human, he is God as well (as the son), the bible says that God is a jealous God and all worship must only go to him that he will not share his glory with another. We can admire anyone from the bible such as Moses, Abraham, David, Mary, John, Paul, Elijah, etc, but adoration of them is not in line with Jesus’s (God’s) will. There are many other heaven encounters which Jesus has given to many believers, which he reveals some awesome things. One of them showed Mary was there and she was crying because so many people focus on her, and even pray to her, she said to look toward Jesus only. Mary has been blessed by God by being the human conduit for him to be birthed naturally to earth to fulfill what he wanted to fulfill. We all should pray and believe the way she did, that is to submit ourselves wholly to Jesus and only focus, adore, and pray to him. We should not pray or “adore” no one except God himself through Jesus who is the only way to God the Father. Don’t worry about Mary, you can always have a conversation with her when you get to heaven and she will be the first one to tell you all this!\n\n","date":"February 17, 2012 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8406","author":"George D Reyes","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Yes, that is maybe part of her heart being stung through by a sword?\nThat goes for all thrue saint also, they themselves knew exactly allt theris faults, since the had so mych of Holy Spirit (and if not, they weren´t saints, because it Gods holyness…that makes us holy)…they would have screamde knowing anybodys would worship them and cried, because they knew that only Elohim and his son Yeshua are worthy…that is what the angesl in heaven sing in revelation to Elohim and his lamb: Holy, holy, holy…you alone are worthy etc…no Mary, no saints..\n\n","date":"February 17, 2012 at 11:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8408","author":"rebecca","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Quando eu tinha 18 anos. Eu engravidei de um namorado, e minha mae disse: “voce so continuara morando comigo, se abortar essa crianca!”.\nTentei de tudo para que isso nao acontecesse, mas era impossivel, pois minha familia me maltratava. chegando a inclusive me agredir fisicamente por causa da gravidez.\n Minha mae entao me levou a uma mulher que fazia abortos. e ela ja havia me preparado para o procedimento, quando eu me levantei da cama e disse que nao faria.\nChegando em casa, fui agredida fisicamente e verbalmente novamente.\n Eu pensava que quanto mais tempo eu permanecesse gravida, mais facil seria para que ela desistisse da ideia, ja que eu correria risco de vida, se abortasse com mais meses de gravidez.\n No entanto nada a fazia mudar de ideia.  Para minha surpresa, ja tinha 4 meses de gravidez, quando ela voltou a me levar a um medico que fazia aborto. Esse medico nos falou, que nao praticava abortos com mais de 4 meses de gestacao, e que nesse caso eu precisaria de uma micro cesariana. e isso so poderia ser feito nas cidades maiores.\nMinha mae levou-me entao para uma grande cidade. Foram horas e horas de viagem.\nMeu coracao estava conturbado. Eu nao queria de maneira alguma fazer o aborto, mas estava fraca, muito fraca. Nao tinha ninguem para me ajudar. Sequer o pai da crianca, que havia sido transferido para outra cidade a trabalho, e nao tinha mais contato com ele.\nMinha irma , junto a minha mae, praticavam atrocidades comigo, com a intencao que eu abortasse. Me batiam, me xingavam, e me proibiam de comer.\nEu nao tinha saida, e nem forcas.\n Chegando na capital, nos hospedamos, e minha mae foi a clinica que nos enviaram, conversar sobre o procedimento. La ela pagou a metade do servico, e a outra metade seria paga no dia seguinte, dia em que faria o aborto.\nA clinica era muito longe de onde nos hospedamos, por isso teriamos que acordar muito cedo. Pela madrugada. e as 7 da manha ja teriamos que estar la.\n Naquela noite entao, eu nao dormi. Deitada em minha cama, apenas chorava, com o espirito muito conturbado.\n Eu chorava e chorava, e quando fechei meus olhos para enxugar as lagrimas e os abri novamente, vi um homem em pe perto de minha cama. Era um homem alto, que vestia branco, na cintura um grande cinturao preto, e a sua voz tinha extrema autoridade.\nEm nenhum momento ele me “pediu”. Ele mandava. e jamais esquecerei-me de suas palavras.\n Ao levantar os meus olhos, ele levantou o seu braco  esquerdo, apontou o dedo em minha direcao e ordenou: ” VOCE NAO VAI FAZER ISSO!ESSA CRIANCA NAO TE PERTENCE! PERTENCE A MIM!  FUI EU QUEM ENVIEI ESSA CRIANCA NA TERRA! E EU PRECISO DELA AQUI!”.\n Junto a essa visao, me veio tambem uma forca excomunal. Um poder de decisao que ate entao eu nao tinha.\nJunto a visao, senti um poder de ir e vir, ciente que Deus estava comigo.\nEntao, era por volta de 5 da manha. Quando logo ja iriamos partir em direcao a clinica. quando me levantei dizendo com firmeza na voz: ” Mae, levante-se, nos vamos voltar para casa!”.\nMinha mae, reagiu. xingou, contestou, mas eu estava firme.\nEu sabia que nada iria fazer eu mudar de ideia. e ela percebeu isso.\nReclamando muito, ela me seguia, porque decidamente eu estava voltando para casa e nada me faria mudar de ideia. O Espirito Santo tomou conta de mim naquela decisao de maneira tao grande, que uma muralha nao impediria que eu voltasse atras.\n Voltamos para nossa cidade, e la fui tocada de casa. Passei a dormir dos 4 aos 9 meses de gravidez, na casa de ferramentas do quintal. NO chao, mas eu sabia que Deus estava comigo.\n Nao podia entrar dentro da casa para comer. e se o fizesse era espancada. Tenho uma cicatriz grande em minha testa, porque com fome, aos 7 meses de gravidez, entrei na casa para pedir comida.\n Minha irma quebrou um prato de vidro em meu rosto, a mando de minha mae.\nPrecisei de 13 pontos para fechar o ferimento.\nNa volta do hospital, voltei para casa de ferramentas.\nMe alimentava das plantas que tinha por la. ate mato comi.\nPassava a noite acordada, com medo da escuridao. dos ratos, das aranhas e largatixas.\nTinha apenas um lencol para me deitar. Nao havia travesseiros, ou um colchao sequer…mas eu sabia que Deus estava comigo. Ele havia me dito isso pessoalmente.\nQuando senti as dores de parto. nao havia ninguem para me ajudar.\nNo hospital nao recebi nenhuma visita de minha familia, e quando recebi alta nao havia ninguem me esperando.\nRecebi alta as 7 da manha, e 11 horas da noite, ninguem havia ido me buscar. Ja nao tinha leito para mim. O leito em que eu estava foi ocupado por outra mae. e eu aguardei por longas horas, com meu filho no colo, sentada num banco no corredor do hospital.\n11 horas da noite, um vizinho foi me buscar. Ao chegar a casa de minha mae, verifiquei que todos haviam viajado. a casa estava trancada. a energia desligada, e nao haviam trancado a agua, mas eu so tinha ali para ficar.\nConsegui abrir a porta, e la eu fiquei no escuro, e com fome…muita fome…\n Meu filho foi crescendo e crescendo. Consegui, com o tempo e depois de muito choro, conquistar minha independencia.\nMeu filho hoje, tem 25 anos de idade. E e a pessoa com a alma mais pura que conheco. Um excelente filho, honesto, estudioso e trabalhador. alem de que e o meu maior e melhor amigo terreno.\n Minha mae, que ja tem 80 anos, a muitos anos mora conosco, em minha casa.

It is a blessing to read your words.\n————————————————————————————\nHERE is a translation (using Google translator, and I clarified some of the phrases that Google didn’t do very well with.)\n————————————————————————————\nWhen I was 18. I got pregnant from a boyfriend, and my mother said, “so you will continue living with me, to abort this child.” I tried everything to make this not happen, but it was impossible, because my family mistreated me. reaching even physically attack me because of pregnancy. My mom then took me to a woman who did abortions. and she had already prepared me for the procedure, when I stood up and said she would not do. Arriving home, I was physically and verbally assaulted again. I thought the longer I stay pregnant, it would be easier for her to give up the idea, since I risking my life, if I aborted with more months of pregnancy. However did nothing to change his mind. To my surprise, since he was 4 months pregnant when she came to take me to a doctor who did abortions. This doctor told us, who performed abortions with no more than 4 months of gestation, and in that case I would need a micro cesarean. and this could only be done in larger cities. \nMy mom then took me to a big city. There were hours and hours of travel. My heart was troubled. I do not want in any way to have an abortion, but was weak, very weak. There was nobody to help me. Even the father of the child, who had been transferred to another city to work, and had no further contact with him. My sister, with my mother, atrocities practiced with me, with the intention that I would miscarry. Beat me, called me names, and forbade me to eat. I had no outlet, and not forces. \nArriving in the capital, we stayed, and my mother was the clinic that sent us, talk about the procedure. She paid her half of the service, and the other half would be paid the next day, the day he would do the abortion. The clinic was too far from where we stayed, so we would have to wake up very early. By dawn. and 7 am would have to already be there. That night then, I do not sleep. Lying in my bed, just crying, with the very troubled spirit. \nI cried and cried, and when I closed my eyes to wipe away the tears and opened them again, I saw a man standing near my bed. He was a tall man, dressed in white, a large waist belt black, and his voice had extreme authority. At no time did he “borrowed”. He ordered. and I will never forget his words. While raising my eyes, he raised his left arm, pointed his finger in my direction and ordered: “YOU WILL NOT DO IT! CHILD THAT YOU DO NOT BELONG! BELONG TO ME! I WENT ABOUT THIS CHILD ON EARTH sent! AND I NEED HER HERE. ” \nAlong with this vision, I also came to a gallows excomunal. A power of decision that I had not until then. Along with vision, I felt a power come and go, knowing that God was with me. So, it was around 5 am. When we would go in right direction already the clinic. when I stood firmly in his voice saying: “Mother, get up, we go back home.” My mother reacted. swore, challenged, but I was firm. I knew that nothing would make me change my mind. and she knew it. Complaining a lot, she followed me, because I was decidedly back home and nothing would make me change my mind. \nThe Holy Spirit came over me in that decision so so great that a wall does not prevent me back ago. We returned to our city, and it was played at home. I sleep from 4 to 9 months of pregnancy, in toolshed in the backyard. NO ground, but I knew God was with me. Could not get inside the house to eat and was beaten if I did. I have a large scar on my forehead, because hungry at 7 months pregnant, walked into the house to ask for food. My sister broke a plate of glass in my face, at the behest of my mother. It took 13 stitches to close the wound. Back from the hospital, returned home toolshed. I fed the plants that had for her. I spent the night awake, afraid of darkness, rats, spiders and lizards. There was only a blanket to lie. There was no pillow or a mattress … but even I knew God was with me. He had told me this personally. \nWhen I felt the pain of childbirth. there was not anyone to help me. At the hospital did not receive any visits from my family, and when I got high was not anyone waiting for me. Was discharged at 7 AM and 11 o’clock at night, no one had gone to fetch me. Ja had no bed for me. The bed where I was was occupied by another mother. and I waited for long hours with my son on my lap, sitting on a bench in the hospital corridor. 11 hours of the night, a neighbor picked me up. When you get home from my mother, I found that all had traveled. The house was locked. The power was off, and had not locked the water, but I just had to stay there. I managed to open the door, and I got it in the dark, and hungry … very hungry … \nMy son was growing and growing. Could, with time and after much crying, I did gain my independence. My son now has 25 years of age. He is a person with the purest soul I know. A great son, honest, and hardworking student. Beyond that, and my biggest and best earthly friend. My mother, who already has 80 years, lives with us for many years in my house. And it is this child, who takes care of it, who buys their medications, their canes. And this son takes care of everything.\n\n","date":"February 20, 2012 at 6:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8513","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"God has used you to give many gifts to the world.

IMHO it is WAY to small.\nIn addition, I became aware of an apparently surreptitious C14 test that caused a bit of a stir. The institute in question had their lawyers write up a letter explaining the individual in question was not a C-14 specialist, and the institution never owned the mass spectrometer mentioned.\nSo I researched the institution and the model of the mass spectrometer. I am convinced the C-14 test was done, as the individual confirms, but he will not discuss it. The institution has long standing experience with mass spectrometers, and even donated one from about 1968 to a local museum or some such.\nThe model listed was available on the market at about the time in question, and had at least one update. Lawyer talk. Perhaps. If they didn’t own it, perhaps it was leased. Perhaps the model had received the update and was no longer referred to by its original designation.\nSo when I read Heaven Is Real I decided to see if Kiane’s Jesus resembled the image on the Shroud. \nbingo\n\n","date":"February 27, 2012 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-8780","author":"David Rapalyea","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I think it’s amazing that God apparently took a “photograph” of Jesus in the tomb, as if it was forensic “proof”, and left it laying around for 2000 years until photography was invented and the true worth of the Shroud was discovered.

I am a Mama’s girl… But then we grew big and we left our parents house and have our own lives!!!! Though I talked to her a lot and say I love you, i still have lots of unexpress love for her!!! Our last conversation was about raising kids and about the Holy Spirit the Divine Mercy! i told her that I do believe and pray to the Holy Spirit everyday, and she said that she is very happy that I do so…. And gave me her motherly advise on how to raise my kids!!!\nAfter reading the book, it makes my faith more stronger…. I know where my mother now!!! and I know that i’ll see her again… Before i was scared of dying!!! But now, death doesn’t scare me anymore!!! I know i’ll be with Jesus and i’ll see my mother, my baby brother, and my grandmothers!:)\nPraying hard helps me go through this!!! I still have my ups and downs, and a bit of meltdowns, but i can feel the Holy Spirit right there….\nlove and peace to everyone!!!!\n\n","date":"March 6, 2012 at 4:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9006","author":"charet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"on the morning of july 31 1997 3:am  I was driveing a gas tanker,n.of denver colo.                 a car was driving on the wrong side,of I-25 I never seen the car. until we hit head on.             the accident happen so fast.

There is a show on FIOS TV here on the east cost called “Beyond and Back” where people tell their life after death stories.  This day we are living in is so amazing, and I feel that a lot is going on in the heavens that we are not aware of… like the anticipation of a wedding!

It tells of how she photographed Jeshua in the clouds, how both our lives were changed…. I don’t intend for this to be a self-promotion type of thing – we just want to share our story with others to spread hope and faith.\nYou can find it as an ebook at http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Seven-Angels-ebook/dp/B004VWLE9O#_  It’s titled ‘Jesus and the Seven Angels’ it’s at Barnes & Noble as well, just search by title if you’re interested.\nThere’s another piece that Alia and I collaborated on – we each had a photograph that we liked but didn’t feel was complete. We brought them into one piece. It’s at http://studiowestwind.com/artwork/1518758_Ascent_Collaboration_with_Alia_Pinedo.html. Similar to Alia’s photograph of Jeshua in the clouds, this was piece turned out to be more than we originally thought. Seen from up close it is one thing, but viewed from a short distance it shows the profile of Jeshua standing, with the dove ascending above his head, its wings touching together behind its body, tail fanned out.\nBefore an accident I was in about 5 1/2 years ago, I was basically an atheist. I had justified that belief from terrible past experiences, but I can see now that it was fear that held me back. The accident changed pretty much everything in my life. I’m a photographer, and about 3 years ago I was able to photograph some rediscovered and restored Tiffany stained glass windows of the Angels of Revelation. It was an experience that changed me forever, and I am so thankful for it.\nMany people struggle, as I did, with the doctrines of religion and how they relate to the Creator and to Jeshua. While the Bible is the book of passages and mysteries, it by no means tells the whole story. There is Truth in the words, and people who read it will find help with the answers they are searching for. The downside is the Bible as it is today doesn’t even contain all of the books that were written – countless have been lost or simply edited out by the church to suit their needs. While I have total belief in the Creator, Jeshua and the Angels, I do not support the idea of religion, per se. Religion is a man-made thing – which is why it is rife with the sins of man – greed, hate, manipulation in addition to the positive aspects. My ‘religion’ if you will, is love. Ask yourself this – what religion was Jeshua? Do you really believe that the Creator separated us by Muslim or Christian or Buddhist, etc? Those differences were defined by man and enforced by man under the auspices of divine or other authority. It is the same as how man defines borders of countries for their own gain and power. Jeshua is of pure love, for all – beings, creatures, fowl and foliage. All that is of life.That love is not limited by anything – borders, titles, buildings or man. Jeshua told us to look at your neighbor and see yourself – to have compassion and forgiveness. \nEven his name, Jeshua ben Joseph, was changed by the church and authorities to Jesus. How do I know this? Because Jeshua told me so in a dream, and how he wishes it were not so. The book title uses Jesus because that is what he is popularly known as, but it not his true name.\nWe all have guidance given to us all the time, though you must learn how to listen with your heart and trust what it is telling you. I’m not saying it’s easy, but it is possible.\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 3:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9699","author":"Sue Bonar","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Thanks for your story… I feel that you are an “enlightened” Christian which what  I am trying to be.

All my life up until age 53 I questioned whether there was a God, I tried to make sense of Adam and Eve and Noah and Moses and miracles and even prayed at 15 if God existed, to make a ripple in a bowl of water I set before me one day..Nothing Happened. Most of my life was filled with sex and drugs, anger and a huge void that I thought the sex and drugs would fill. I would cuss the very God that I doubted. We never cuss Satan do we?\nAt 53, my life in shambles, one night I went to my computer and typed in…Does God exist?\nFunny,it brought up about Jesus. Then it hit me. IF Jesus was the answer, I did not need to figure out the stories of the Old Testament that had once made God seem like Santa Claus, I needed to figure out if there was a Jesus, because I did know through family and people talking that Christ said he was the only way. First I had to see if there was historical evidence and was excited when I read there was, then I turned to the bible and read articles about Jesus and his diciples and it hit me in the face…The actions of his followers. Why did they go from cowards to bold after the man had died. What would do that, and what would cause them to live out thier lives for him long after he was gone. It could only be The Ressurection!!! Thats all that made sense. I was over joyed, I went to my bed, got on my knees and poured out my heart to God and begged for his forgiveness. I promised I woud go anywhere and do anything for him. I just wanted peace in my life. Minutes later I felt what surely was the Holy Spirit enter my life, I felt the biggest high I ever felt, I felt my feet were barely touching the ground. It gets better!! I was smoking Black N Mild cigars to the tune of what would have been about 3-4 packs of cigarettes a day,my addiction wasa out of control. Before I went to bed on the fourth night after being saved, I asked God to help me,  that I was going to try as hard as I could to quit because I felt they were killing me. I swear what I am about to say here is the honest truth, I awoke the next day and was up for about 4 hours when I realized that I was holding strong and had not wanted yet for nicotine, hours went by and I waited for the urge, that urge to begin my battle, and it never came. I never had a withdrawel symptom, even after eating when the urge is so strong as smokers well know. I was afraid to tell anyone until midnight because I just knew it would break the magic spell if I did, but it was really gone. I never, not for one split second wanted for a smoke again.\nSo funny, it hit me the next day…..The water rippled in the bowl!!!!!!! When I came to God unconditionally, he did more more for me than make a ripple in a bowl of water, a ripple that could have been explained away as something that fell from the ceiling, he took away a habit that I could not control with no effort of my own, I lay no claim to do anything, but trusting him. I never thought it would just go away, I thought I would at least have to prove I would try and fight, but what I did was believed that he loved me and knew it was bad for me and he showed me that all those times that I doubted him, that he was always there waiting for me. I got even more than living by faith alone, he took away an addiction that I know in my heart I could not have quit without at least withdraw symptoms. When the devil comes to test my faith, I have even more ammunition to believe. God was so good to me. I will never doubt his existence, and I asked in the name of Jesus, if Jesus was not the answer, God would have misled me by allowing the addiction to just go away. That is why I know that Christ is the answer and the only way to Heaven.\n\n","date":"March 24, 2012 at 11:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9581","author":"Michael Kincaid","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Dear Michael, welcome to the family of God!

God has really touched you. My mother was miraculously delivered from cigarettes when she got saved, too. Not everyone who gets saved is blessed with such a sign. \nAnd I agree, the lives of the disciples speak volumes. I’ve only recently learned what happened to Thomas and it’s very exciting. The “doubting apostle” was actually known for amazing signs and miracles. He traveled more than Paul did, and went further. There’s an article on the National Geographic website (of all places) that tells about him. Here is a paragraph from that article: \n“Thomas is said to have raised the first cross in India and performed one of his earliest miracles: When he encountered a group of Brahmans throwing water into the air as part of a ritual, he asked why the water fell back to Earth if it was pleasing to their deity. My God, Thomas said, would accept such an offering. He then flung a great spray into the air, and the droplets hung there in the form of glistening white blossoms. Most onlookers converted on the spot; the rest fled.”\nHere’s the link to the entire article, but I loved that particular paragraph.\nhttp://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/03/apostles/todhunter-text\nI also learned, just today, that when a Catholic monk/missionary arrived in India in the 1600’s he found a well established Christian community that claimed to have been founded by Thomas. That’s 1600 years later!! I think that certainly speaks of the power of God, because only the Holy Spirit could have kept them on track for 1600 years. If it was only a man-made religion, those remote Christians would have evolved into something entirely different and unique by that time and it would not have resembled the rest of Christianity at all. \nGod bless you! It’s wonderful to hear of how Jesus has touched your life. :)\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 7:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9687","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I read Heaven is for Real last week and was compelled to follow it with Akiane’s two books after googling her painting of Jesus and there is no doubt in my mind that God has given this girl a gift.  I have not stopped thinking about Jesus since I read her book and Colton’s story, so my googling led me to this page.  I read over 150 comments here and I”m so moved by them all.  It is so nice to know that there are others in this world who feel the same, since for me it’s been so long I’ve felt that anyone in my life is connected with God.  It seems to me that my faith was so strong when I was a child, so much so that after my mother stopped taking me to church, I continued to do so on my own and even attended a religious camp as a pioneer girl.  I’m 40 now and although I never doubted my faith in God or Jesus, I stopped thinking about Him, even hardly prayed out of guilt for becoming a sinner.  A few days after reading Heaven is for Real, I watched my 2 1/2 year old son skip through a swarm of flying bugs, waving his arms up and down while laughing.  It amazed me how this was so new to him and I realized how innocent he was at that moment when I thought to myself, wow, I was about to yell to him to stop because I didn’t want him to get bit or to swallow one.  He was having so much fun, nothing mattered to him.  He did not get bit and if he swallowed one, he never complained, so I just sat and watched him play through the bugs recalling a time in my life where I used to let ants crawl over me, catch lady bugs, chase butterflys, jump in rain puddles, roll down hills and these memories made me smile.  In response to Ariel’s comment #39 where she said, “I belive God has put these children on Earth to remind us to have faith as a little child, as Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.’ Mark 10:13-16,” ….this is what I think he also may have had in mind.  For us to be at peace with others, but especially ourselves, like our children.  I, at the age of 40 with some painful parts of my past, have become, I guess you could say a little “worn and worried,” where my 2 year old has the world ahead of him and is full of happiness and eager to learn and explore.  It’s no wonder why Jesus LOVES all children, because they are pure and honest and happy. I must admit that after reading about Colton and Akiane’s experiences, my eyes have been re-opened and I’m feeling more peaceful and reconnected with God. I BELIEVE!!!\n\n","date":"March 27, 2012 at 2:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9680","author":"Karen","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I believe that when God gets hold of a child, He does not let go but watches until He can bring that person back to Himself again later in life.

The Bible does say that in the end times there would be an increase in dreams and visions, so I think it’s OK. \nThe reason for these things is to encourage unbelievers. Usually they are a sign for the unbeliever. Such as Paul: that vision knocked some sense into him on the Damascus road. \nI don’t think of Akiane’s painting as a photograph of Jesus. It’s more of an “appetizer” for what’s to come. I collect hundreds of images of Jesus and actually, I see a similarity in all of them. But what’s amusing is, each image is painted with the hairstyle of that age and sometimes the clothing too. This is a very modernized image of Jesus and perhaps THIS generation needs a more relevant image to relate to.  We don’t worship the image of course. \nHere is a painting done by Harry Anderson around 1950, and I think it looks a lot like Akiane’s painting. This is one of my favorites:\n\nThat’s my collection on Flickr.

His memory might have been affected by being in Sunday School AFTER he had a visit in heaven. In other words, the things he learned SINCE his near-death experience may have tainted his memory of it. But one thing that did impress on him strongly was the fact that Jesus DID have “markers” and he saw them and he knew it was really important, which it certainly is. Those scars are wounds of honor and proof of Jesus’ love for us. \nAnyway, I love the book so much and I think it’s doing a lot of good in the midst of a very unbelieving generation, so I figure whatever faults are there can probably be explained by Colton’s young age in some way. Children who have these experiences gradually lose the sharp memory of it as they get older. He didn’t even mention ANY of it until a year after it happened. Maybe he was too traumatized to want to talk about his time in the hospital – so he shut it all out until he felt secure enough to talk about any of it. And then he only talked about it as bits and pieces came back to him.  \nAnd, I wonder how much he remembers now that he’s a young teenager.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2012 at 8:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9736","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I agree with everything you say.

Some people would set up a statue of Colton and begin to worship it, you know what I mean?  \nAnd, all Bible prophecies or visions leave stuff out or put something in that doesn’t make sense. The book of Revelation is so frustrating to read. So you just have to read it  and take it for what it is. The Bible says we get a blessing just for reading the book of Revelation, and maybe God had to say that so we wouldn’t give up on it. \nDreams and visions are like that: we want MORE, we want the ENTIRE picture! But it’s only a taste, not the entire meal. \nThis book is so nearly perfect, maybe God had to throw in one thing just to remind us not to go overboard, but to enjoy it for what it is. And I do think the book, Colton’s story, is a gift from God. We live in a generation where it’s more difficult than ever to believe in what’s supernatural, and we are mocked for doing it.

When I was in my 20s I was attending drafting school and was absolutely broke.  One day, before class began, I was going into a coffee shop across the street from the school for a small coffee and do-nut because all I had was one dollar and 55 cents for something to eat that night.  This man stood outside to the left of the door opening of the shop and asked for money.  My mind had one of those angel devil debates saying, give him money, and the devil side saying, no, he’s probably going to buy liquor with it.  I continued to enter the shop and the Lord spoke to me saying, “he is my child too, and what happens to him and what he does is my business… what if he did buy alcohol with the money, but this was his last day alive, you would have made him happy and that is what I ask of my children, to love and make each other happy, their lives are up to me”.  So, reluctantly I obeyed the Spirit and just bought a small coffee and gave the man one dollar on my way out.  This time when I looked at his face, it was young, his skin was bright, smooth and glowing as did his bright childlike brilliant baby blue eyes… his hair under his old hooded coat was bright white.  I kind of was baffled somewhat by what just happened, but had to get to class so I crossed the street and went on my way.  Two weeks later I received a check in the mail from the tax department for $1,000+ and didn’t know why, so I called them to find out and they said that a mistake was made, that too much money had been taken all year, and I was to be issued this refund.  I was sitting on my bed when the man’s face came to me and the Lord told me that he had been an angel.  The Lord also told me that we are to treat people with love and kindness always, because we never know when we are entertaining angels unaware.  So to this day, when I hear stories like your, or mine, I tell the person that it probably was an angel… unaware :)  Blessings to you, stay passionate!

I read heaven is for real in the spring of 2011. I must confess, although I am a Christian, I typically choose not to read these type of books, but felt drawn this this one.  I honestly believe that Jesus drew me to this book to prepare for what was about to come.  Not long after reading, my oldest started complaining of headaches and vomiting.  We spent the summer going to numerous doctors who diagnosed him with sinus problems, server allergies, etc.  Still his symptoms continued.  Long story short, he was found to have a brain tumor and had surgery to remove it.  The entire experience was and continues to be very traumatic.  We were so blessed that the tumor was benign. One night while he was in the intensive care unit I was sitting at his bedside and physically felt Jesus presence with his hands on my shoulders and whispering to me that he loved me and to trust him. He is still teaching me to trust Him on a daily basis.  My son has always been very reserved and a child of few words, but he had such a reassurance before his surgery that everything would be okay.  About two months ago we decided to talk about this experience as a family because we realized that we had really not even begun to process.  My younger son began to cry stating how scared he was.  My husband asked our oldest son how he knew that everything was going to be okay.  He replied that a week before his surgery, he had a “vision” and that the vision told him that he was going to have surgery, but he was going to live and that he would be better than before.  Again, he is a child of few words and would not say much more. I plan on asking him more, but don’t want to push him or put ideas in his head.  I am going to wait for the right opportunity.\n\n","date":"April 7, 2012 at 12:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-10041","author":"Jlindsey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I was raised by my Grandmother whose greatest gift to me is the faith in a loving and merciful God, who is perfect. I have never seen Jesus and rarely felt His presence, but I know He is here all the time. My aunt died at 91 in 2006. She raised me with my grandmother. I know she believed in God and I know she was also afraid to die. She also knew that I have the same faith in God that her mother, my grandmother had. When her body was ready to stop and her soul was ready to go to heaven she opened her eyes and looked at me. I said “Don’t be afraid, hold my hand and close your eyes. I am going to put your hand in the hand of Jesus. He will take you to His Father in heaven.” I did not not make this up, the words came out of my mouth completely unrehearsed. While I said them their was a hand on each of my shoulders. This is real. I never saw Jesus, but He stood behind me and took her hand as she passed from this life to the next. This is the holiest place I have ever been: in the Hospice room, with my Aunt Betty, Jesus, and my faith. I haven’t heard from Him since in this way, but I know there is a God and there is definitely a risen Christ. I am not crazy either.\n\n","date":"April 7, 2012 at 2:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-10084","author":"Julie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"It’s Easter Eve and I’m reading everyone entries, and crying … crying not sad tears, but happy tears — tears for Christ.

I will forever be grateful to Colton and his dad for sharing this with us. It is as if someone opened a curtain to allow us a glimpse of heaven.   I also appreciate their sharing Akiane’s “Prince of Peace”.  This painting is priceless.  We are the first generation in 2000 years to know what Christ looked like!  \nI found this site about 4 hours ago and am still reading.  However, I needed to skip to the bottom to address something that is disturbing a number of writers:  Akiane’s apparent drifting from the Christian faith.  We need to remember that she was only 8 years old when she painted this picture, and God was allowing this innocent child to see visions of heaven that most of us will not see until we die.  She is now a teenager, and has been subjected to all the notoriety of the rich and famous.  Being famous changes most people, as does growing up.  She may no longer be having visions of heaven; she is probably having visions of huge bank accounts, noting how much her original art and the prints are selling for.  In this realm, she will probably paint what she thinks the public at large wants and will buy.  The general public will no doubt be willing to pay far more for her non- religious art than most Christians will pay for her religious art.  At this time in her life it appears that worldly things have over powered spiritual things.  We need to pray for her.\nRegarding The Shroud of Turin”:  the one thing that bothers me is where the front top of the head meets the top back of the head.  There is no evidence showing where the TOP of the head should be.  It shows a round front LINE touching a round back LINE.  If this piece of cloth wrapped over the top of anyone’s head, there should be an area about 5″ long by 3″ – 4″ wide between the front of the head and the back.  The  ‘picture’ should flow smoothly from front to back.  There would not be a distinct line outlining the face and another outlining  the back of the head.  It  would have a faded, irregular edge as the cloth over the face and head would have laid in folds over the rounded head.  (Lay a cloth over a ball to see what I am referring to.)  Until someone can explain why there is no top of Jesus’ head on this cloth, I will not believe this cloth ever touched Jesus’ body. Also, the ‘picture’ of the face should not appear to have been drawn on a flat surface as it appears on this shroud.  It should have irregularities as it would have laid in folds (as over a ball).  The whole ‘picture ‘ appears to have been drawn on a flat surface rather than on a 3 dimensional surface.  I am not a scientist, but I am an artist, and this picture has no 3rd dimension to it that I can see.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2012 at 1:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-10658","author":"Ginger","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Hi Ginger, actually the front and back heads do not meet. There is an empty gap between them. I can’t remember how many inches exactly but it is somewhere around 5 to 6 inches. Any lines you see in that area are water stains basically in the shape of a diamond. You can see similar stains on other parts of the Shroud aswell, as the Shroud was folded when these stains occurred. Also according to a couple of the scientists the image formation seemed to have happened in a vertical or 90% angle to the sheet, that is why no side images appear. Also according to several scientists there are 3d aspects to the image and distortions (slight however) most likely caused by the draping of the cloth. What you see on the Shroud is not a picture it is actually an encoding so it may appear at first to be drawn on a flat surface but with further examination it definately was not. Hope that helps, I’m not that good at putting my thoughts in writing. If you really would like to learn more; a good book I’d suggest you read would be- ‘The Resurrection of the Shroud’ by Mark Antonacci, it covers quite well the scientific, medical and archeological aspects of the Shroud plus many other things.\nR\n\n","date":"April 21, 2012 at 4:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-10661","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"It seem dis akians picture of jesus is real\n\n","date":"April 23, 2012 at 3:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-10735","author":"Kemi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"God have mercy on “non-believers” and people who need a sign to believe in you.

I know, at 19 I was thrown through a windshield in a horrific automobile crash that left my best friend temporarily paralyzed. When the first trucker on highway I-95 got to me first, he found me in a praying position unconscious…the minute he touched my back to tell me not to move, I awoken and will always remember at the instant my head hit the glass, which knocked me out cold…I saw what I thought was a tunnel of light beaming down upon me…but it was though I was sitting by my self in a movie theater, and someone had just rewound my life on the movie screen…I was shown my mother giving birth to me and then my entire life story played in front of me, from birth, right up to that moment at the crash! Then as the trucker was trying to calm me, not to move…there was no one else at the seen of the accident…my best friend and college mate; Andy Ryan, was still down in the mangled van that had rolled end over end 5 or 6 times down a 75′ embankment, and he was trapped and couldn’t move from the waist down! Andy later told me on the gurney, being loaded into the ambulance, as I tried to tell Andy how sorry I was, for falling asleep at the wheel, he said; “George, it was the strangest thing, I couldn’t move and I was just waiting for the van to explode in the leaking fuel, that was running everywhere, and it was like God all the sudden opened the two side cargo doors and just lifted me outside where I was safe! The truck driver that had stopped was the only one at the scene of the accident for the first 10 minutes, and when he left me to run down to check on my friend after I told him my best friend, Andy was down there inside the van…he found Andy already laying outside the van! When I went to the police impound area to see the van after I was released from the hospital, to try and collect any of our remaining belongings, inside the van, we noticed the van was rolled into a ball of metal…there was no way any human could have opened the side doors, they were crushed inward and wouldn’t open unless you had a jaws of life! We were too young at the time to realize what had really happened that night on August 16, 1977…either Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior was physically present in Spiritual body at that crash, or our Guardian Angels were quickly pressed into action, to perform His calling. They saved our lives and God planted an image of my entire life before me, in order to show me, that I was not ready for His Paradise…He had more important tasks for me to perform on His Earth. I finally found God at the age of 51 in prison and received my Salvation and baptism by the Holy Spirit in person on 27 Feb, 2010…Jesus spent 10 minutes with me! I could not physically see him, but he came to me in the middle of the night and beamed His Love down upon me. What transpired is completely undescribable for human words to try to properly explain…but as I was floating in His intense beam of Love, He talked to me and purified my soul with the Comforter, it felt like the Sun was literally setting on the roof of the building I was in, it was that intense! The very next day, early that morning, when I got out of my rack, I was completely healed and forgiven, all my regret-fulness and sorrow was gone…and I just Loved everyone around me and lost all desires to even swear or talk down to any fellow prisoners…all I could radiate was His Love to others. Then it all came together for me..the purpose of my life..the meaning of life…why we should love our enemy…and give forgiveness to heal…for those of us that are literally touched by Jesus “Joshua” Christ, and healed, have an incredible fulfillment to become His Ambassador on Earth, until He returns…your father like myself, were chosen for a good reason! We have so many souls to show His righteousness to. So we honor your Dad and give many great thanks to our Heavenly Father for saving us, to continue to do His good work on the earth…and we are our Lord’s watchman….we are ready to spring into action and help those in need and sow His seed of Faith…and for that, I am deeply honored to serve my Christ Jesus…Amen, and Thank You Father, Thank You, Jesus for your Holy Spirit! Bless all of you that get His message and understand it…help and pray for those that are lost on this Earth, like me, Satan and greed stole my heart…but Jesus returned it to the rightful owner and poured His Love into me to share with others…Amen!\n\n","date":"May 31, 2012 at 1:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-11740","author":"George W.

We were surrounded by corn fields and the only neighbors we could hear were the Ligers and Tigons that a man bred a few miles down the road.  They would roar and we could hear them faintly. \n One night my parents let me stay up late to play ,Mario on nintendo, because my brother had the game all day and I didn’t get a turn. It must have been a weekend because there was no school the next day.\n Well I was on the couch in the living room, to my right was the front door and beside it a window, behind me was a large window and to my left a bed sheet my mom had hung to keep the cool air in one room.The house was drafty and there was a big archway in between our living and dining area.\n As I was playing this fear came over me as I saw something out of the corner of my eye to my right. I slowly turned my head to see what was there and in the window was a face. I cannot describe it because just as I saw it it moved.\n I froze and thought about screaming out for my mom or dad but I was locked in such fear. I was sure that whoever was outside must be behind me now looking at me through the window. I pretended to keep playing thinking that if whoever was out there didn’t think I’d seen them they’d go away.\n  I thought that if I made any movement they would come bursting in after me. I began to cry I was so petrified. \n Suddenly, I saw a bright light to my left. It got brighter and filled the room. I looked over to my left and on the other side of the sheet that hung in the archway, was what appeared to be a man. He was dressed in a long robe that came to the floor, I could only see his feet when he stepped forward. His feet were, at the time I could only describe as “very tan”. His hair was shoulder length and bright blond and seemingly glowing. As he stepped forward his arms stretched out to either side and the robe went front his wrists to the ground and I thought to myself “This must be an angel and I bet when others see him they think that his robe is wings, because the way they flowed and draped it resembled wings. There was a golden sash that formed a v on his chest and the whiteness of the robe was unlike any white I’d ever seen. Any other white, be it snow or any other is dull in comparison. Not only did this bright light fill the room, this absolute joy radiated around and I was so happy. I stood and once the man hit the sheet he faded out of my sight. I could still feel the joy and there was still brightness about the room. I said “Where are you, I want to see you again.” and I heard in an almost audible voice, “Go to bed.” I turned off the tv and game, went straight up stairs and to my room and got into bed without turning on any lights, without running (as I usually did, to my older sister’s room). I told my parents the very next morning when I came down stairs. \n I said “Guess what I saw last night!? I saw an angel!” They smiled, gave eachother a smirk and told me I was ‘probably just tired’. \n Well years and years later, as I was in my apartment as my husband was at work, I remember an old youth pastor said, “Do not read Revelation alone, because it may scare you.” I was recently thinking back to that night in the old farm house. I always questioned weather or not I really did see this “angel” or was I just dreaming or did I make it up and just start believing it on down the line. I couldn’t, however, get past that I didn’t just see this, I felt it. That joy was undeniable! I went from being scared to tears, to calmly and joyfully going up to bed. Well I decided to crack open the Bible and  something told me to go to Revelation. I went to the beginning and started to read. Then I got to this part… \n“And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands; and in the middle of the lampstands one like the Son of Man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His breast with a golden girdle. And His head and His hair were white like wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and His feet were like burnished bronze, when it had been caused to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. And in His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as a dead man. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying, ‘Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.” (Revelation 1:12-18). \n‘clothed in a robe reaching to the feet and girded across His breast with a golden girdle. And His head and His hair were white like wool, like snow; and His feet were like burnished bronze’\n Very tan those feet!\n As I read this, what I saw that night all came flooding back to memory in detail! I had no doubt that I did see this! Only now, I don’t think it was an angel.\n  I didn’t see his face though, I saw everything from the other side of a bed sheet that hung between me and Him. While the light penetrated and enveloped the rooms I could not make out His facial features.\n\n","date":"June 1, 2012 at 10:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-11771","author":"Gwynneth Smith","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Hello.   Over the last 10 years I have been in the field of healing arts.  I have experienced the healing power of Christ working in and through people’s lives, not to mention the feelings and experiences I have with Yeshua.  I feel that he is real and very authentic.\n As you can see from the postings, a lot happens to people.  You can grow bitter and full of grief, shame, guilt, etc. and this feels like a seperation from God.  God doesn’t ever throw us out, we choose to walk out.  Many times I have questioned why things happen to people.  I feel most of it is getting us to feel so uncomfortable in what ever we are in that we will eventually choose a different way.  We move from those obstacles that are keeping us trapped.  We grow out of the muck and mire.   We uncover ourselves and may not acknowledge that God is right there helping us shovel off the composte pile of traumas, pain and societal conditioning.  It is a continual process of allowing love to reighn over fear.   After the storms clear and you can see forever…you can see the true self within, knowing that was an experience of growth.  It’s over…these dark things too pass away.  Christ’s light then shines into and through your vessel.  This human body that allows our spirit to have a physical experience.  Thank you for your sharing of these heart-felt reinactments of your past moments in time.  It is wonderful to hear the faith and truth in each one.  \nI show the youtube video Akaine made when she was 10 to clients.  Her innocent and loving ways always brighten their spirit and they know that God is very real.  Sometimes we need reminders.  She truly has been given many talent gifts to express God’s everlasting and unconditional love.\nThere has been so much contraversy over the Shoud of Turin and no one has come to any conclusions that we all can agree on at this time.   It is often dilluted into something less by people’s belief systems.  Confusion has been a social engineering staple in spinning things until no one really knows what to believe.  Christ’s dedicated shroud is etched into everyone’s heart through his sacrifice of love.  We can integrate that love into our daily lives or we can leave it there untapped as if it is fraudulant.  Either way I feel it is there for each of us.    I like your comment earlier poster:  “It’s an appetizer for what is to come.”  \nHave a beautiful life in love and light.\n\n","date":"June 1, 2012 at 11:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-11772","author":"Julie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Awesome post Julie…how eloquently spoken…Keep the Faith, somehow I know and fell that I will be seeing you in Heaven…God Blesses you for that post!\n\n","date":"June 1, 2012 at 8:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-11788","author":"George W.

I was with a group of friends but I was the first to jump in. The others didn’t really notice what I was doing as they were building a camp fire. Soon I found myself in trouble. My right foot was jammed tight between two rocks. The force of the water knocked me off balance and I found myself trapped under the water, unable to reach  the surface. Panic set in. I struggled with all my might to reach the surface but it was no good. Then I thought of the hurt it would cause my family if I died. I felt sad for them and not for myself. Suddenly an image of Jesus appeared in my minds eye or the in the water. I can’t be sure after so many years. Suddenly I found myself free from the underwater trap and standing in shallow water near the bank. It happened in a flash. To this day I believe that the Lord Jesus intervened to save my life.\nI often wondered why my life was saved.

Adam Schicht was 33 when he died suddenly in 2009, I know he will be with the first ones to greet me when I pass to the other side, & I better have eggnog,a running joke with Adam & myself.  We are but a heart beat away from the loved ones who await us on the other side, God Bless you!\n\n","date":"July 26, 2012 at 5:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-14254","author":"Mimi","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Hi Everyone, I been reading this posts and are absolutely wonderful, what a beautiful hope  we have in heaven , to be forever with our heavenly father and loved ones, I am looking to make friends so If you would like so, you can add me to your email account : ricky_gtz@hotmail.com\n\n","date":"July 29, 2012 at 5:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-14312","author":"Rick","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I have just read Heaven is for real.

Please believe me when I tell you, dying, for your consciousness which is in your SOUL is nothing but a breath… I can’t speak to what physical condition you may be in at the hour of your passing, but as for your “heart”, your “mind”, your soul, it is SO easy! You will surely laugh to yourself and say, “Are you kidding me? This is what dying is?” Seriously, it is easier than opening your eyes or taking a breath! DO NOT fear your physical death because LIFE is all about your spirit! That lovely vessel your soul resides in is just a body of flesh and is nothing more than a glove or sock you’ve worn all your physical life, that’s all. TRUST me, I have left my body and come back. It is NOTHING, and so easy, it’s the coming back into your body (if that is the plan) that is slightly uncomfortable.\nGod loves you dear one, trust in God, PRAY PRAY PRAY, you will have a whole crowd of loved ones waiting at your passing just to welcome you HOME and into the arms of Jesus. Heaven will no doubt be all we have been told and thousands and ten thousands fold more<3 I will see you there one day too! Look for me and tell me how right I was and then we will both laugh together! God Bless and have no fear dear friend in Christ.\nI also had feared death, but not for the pain or scariness of it, because I had already left my body before, but I had been worried I may not have enough time on earth because I too LOVE this BEAUTIFUL and amazing creation of Earth that our heavenly Father has given us, and I also LOVE my family and friends with a passion that could only come from God Himself.  I often have to ask God to not take offense at my requests to live a long (100+yr) life just so I can see it all and love as many people as I can.  BUT death, where is thy sting?  There isn’t any, as long as you are right with God that is.  I would never lie to anyone about this, passing on to the next dimension is a wonderful amazing experience and no wonder those who have did NOT wish to come back, even when they had a good life or loved ones still here, it’s THAT good!

God can make barren women pregnant – Abrahams wife Sarah.  Part the Sea – Moses crossing the sea to flee Egypt. Raise the dead – Lazarus.  Jesus decended into hell – what was he able to accomplish there?  This means there is adequate provision in the ways God does things for those who have not had the opportunity to accept Jesus Christ.  How God does that is not for us to know.  Rather we are asked to trust God knows how to deal mercifully with his creation he loves so dearly.\nJesus teaches us how God does things and it is definatley not the way we usually do things.  In the Godly order our responsibility is to do what Jesus teaches us to do and become his desciple regardless of what happens to others – including those we love here.  Our obedience and salvation is exclusive to ourselves – we are personally accountable for how we respond to the message Jesus teaches us. \nAs Jesus says – I set before you life and death – choose life.  This means we can choose death if we want to.  The hard yards of this truth is that God has given us our life and it is in our hands what we do with it.   \nAs we apply the lessons Jesus teaches in our own lives the Kingdom of God that is within us is revealed to us.  As we get more used to Gods ways we learn how we hate God and how we love God.  These are tough lessons.  We also learn how much God loves us personally and the hard part – how much God loves our enemies and asks us to learn how to do that too.  This last lesson is our expericne of crucifixion and no one is exempt.  So the better question is this – How do I manage my own crucifixion and learn how to die to myself and come alive to Christ?\nI know this is not the answer you were hoping for because I have asked the same question you have asked.  This is the answer I was given and it covers about 20 years of my journey as a desciple of Jesus.  Choose life and take up your cross.

The revelation of Jesus to Saul on the road the Damascus is the biblical evidence for me that the answer is yes.  \nI have slept on my answer because the following explanation is not that easy to share.  \nWhen Jesus died his blood consecrated the whole earth and everything on it.  He restored us to holiness by his action so we have been made fit to serve him.  To serve him he has to communicate with us so it figures he appears to us as needed.  His death established the Kingdom of God here on earth and he rose from the dead as the great high priest in the new living temple.  \nJesus completed his work of establishing it on earth when he died.  He was a servant of God and showed us how we can be Gods servants by the way we live.  \nMy understanding comes from the way utensils used in the Tent of Meeting are treated when the Isrealites wandered round the dessert for 40 years.  The Tent of Meeting housed the Tabernackle that was built according to Gods instructions in the dessert.  This treatment is duplicated in the Temple built by King Solomon.  \nThe utensils were made holy through ritual cleansing and the blood of the sacrifices to God.  Only the ritually clean utensils could be used.  If any of the people serving in the temple were ritually unclean when they come into the temple area they died – this was well described in instances of service around the Tent of Meeting when they Isrealites wandered around Sinai for 40 years.\nToday Jesus is called the cornerstone of the new temple – and those who follow him are the living stones of this new temple.  God himself teaches us and it is God who completes the work begun in us as we follow Jesus. \nIn this mystical temple Jesus is the great high priest and when he is working he calls on his utensils to help him with it.  We are those living utensils.  His life and death made us fit for use in this way.\nIf you hang round Christians long enough some will tell you Jesus told me to do this or he appeared to me.  Not all Christians have this experience but those who do reveal by their life and actions how compelling the experience is for them.   This is also evidence that Jesus has returned to those he has chosen.  Many are called but only some are chosen.\nI have often wondered why the bible leaves out some answers.  For me the answer is that Jesus said he would send the Holy Spirit to teach us all things.  The walk of faith we take as we follow Jesus prepares us to understand and accept Gods ways and enables us to learn something of Gods point of view.\nThe tricky bit – God is the same yesterday today and tomorrow and yet he is new every morning and he is always doing a new thing : )  I hope my answer helps you find your own answer to your question.  Thankyou for asking it I have enjoyed exploring it for myself.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2012 at 7:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18068","author":"Dianne Porter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Your first question has perplexed me too. In the beginning of my Christian journey, age 15, I had the standard answer you hear so often. Basicly, you’ll end up in hell if you don’t accept Christ and personal Lord and savior. But that answer seems a little too simple to me now, age 56.\n I have no doubt about the truth of what the New Testament claims for Christ, but I’ve seen subtle things in the scripture that the churches don’t talk much about, things that place such an emphasis on proper lifestyle and not so much emphasis on proper theology. I’d say theological statements are outnumbered about 3 to 1 by lifestyle statementsin the scripture, especially in the New Testament. They are esspecially outnumbered in the teachings of Christ in the Gospels. \nI think there are many who think they are saved but aren’t saved. They make  their claim because they did accept Christ and believe all the right things, but many cannot prove Christ actually is their Lord by the way they live; while others, who didn’t even know who Christ is, live much as he taught. If I had to choose, I’d rather be in the second camp. \nIn general, I’ve decided  that we will be judged according to the light we had. Proper theology is required from those who, in God’s opinion, had every opportunity to know it. To be willfully ignorant is nothing to brag about, and we don’t have the right to twist the clear teaching of scripture on the nature and character of God to fit into whatever theological agenda we might have. But not to live as Christ taught is inexcusable for people like me who knew what do but often didn’t do it. All we can do is repent, and ask God to help us do better. For those who knew nothing of Christ, and yet acted in accordance with his teaching, my hat is off to them. Moral truth is indeed written large over the earth. God bless them.\n I still have a responsiblity to get Christ’s message out to the world. He told us to “make diciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded of you.” But notice his emphasis on dicipling, not merely making converts. And notice his emphasis on his commands, which deals with lifestyle issues. Would that the churches would make better diciples and not merely converts.\n\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 12:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18256","author":"Ray Matthew","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Hi Ray ~ I am not a Christian just because I say I am…I have  to have some evidence of a changed life.  If you say you are a Christian, you’ve got to have more than an “I prayed a prayer” story…You have to have a changed life.  That’s why Jesus said in John 8, “You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.”\n      The two characteristics of a genuine believer are that you have a growing love of God’s Word, and the result of that is that you have a growing pattern of freedom in your life.  You are no longer controlled by a sin nature.\n     People who don’t know Christ are slaves to sin…there are certain sins in those people’s lives that every time it calls their name, they come running…and they can’t change it.  They try not to be angry, they try not to be selfish, they try not to be prideful, they try not to be lustful…but they are.  And they always come back to it like a dog to its vomit…so a fool returns to his folly. (Proverbs 26:11)\n     By the way, what I wrote above is from a sermon  a Pastor named James MacDonald gave in May of 2010.  Our Pastor’s name is Carl Broggi. If you want to hear the Word of God preached as you have never heard it before…listen to Pastor Carl on Search the Scriptures, or go to http://www.wagp.net .  You will be able to get archives of his past sermons and they will blow your mind!  He has written on his lectern Sola Scriptura.  That means ONLY THE WORD OF GOD.\n     May God help you in your walk, Ray, and if you are ever in Beaufort, SC, come to Community Bible Church, where we worship the Living God every day of the week.\nBlessings ~ MIchele\n\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 8:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18311","author":"Michele Mohrmann","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Thanks Ray for your thoughtful answer.

I am very sad for the loss you are feeling over the suicide whose funeral you attended.  \nWhen I was that age I made my third attempt to end my life having made my first attempt at 9 years of age.  I knew when my effort to crash the car at over 100 mph failed it was God who intervened to prevent me from dying and I was not too happy about it.  I felt condemned to a life I hated and I did not try again till oct 1989.  It was the last line of my suicide note that said “Be still and know that I am here.” I knew were not my words.  God was with me in that awful moment and used my own hand to prove to me he never abandons anyone – we abandon God long before that.  God was the only one with me at that awful hour and his presence led me to question my resolve that my life wasn’t worth living.\nIt was those words that led me to seek God and he found me while I was looking for him.  It took me years to be still and know God and I am not able to repeat how still I was by my own self will as much as I try too.  God himself completes the good work he begins in each of us so we can boast in what He has done rather than what we have done.  \nDo I still feel suicidal? – yes from time to time and I am now 58.  When the desire to end my life gets bad I turn to God and I read my bible to help contradict the desire to do so that can become almost unbearable at times.  At those times I choose the resist my desires to do evil and choose Gods desires for me to have life and have it abundantly.  That is my cross and it is no fun bearing it.  I learn from Jesus how to bear the pain I feel and he shows me what he gained for me by the cross he carried and it makes the next breath easier to take.\nIt is not for us to know who is saved and who is lost but rather to live out the faith we have been given by following Jesus as best we can.  He shows us how to bear our suffering here when our hour comes to face our own cross and die to ourselves.  In baptism we enter his death and come up alive in his new life.  That truth has to be worked out in us by faith and that takes time.\nGods ways are not our ways so I am confident the young man who suicided was dealt with by God mercifully because that is Gods nature.   I trust God.    I know some of what God did for me when I wanted to end my life.  From that I know that when I really do die he will provide for me then too.  I am now confident God provides for everyone when we die  regardless of the cause so I leave those things in his hands where I am sure they are safe.  That gives me the peace that passes all understanding and its nice to have.\nDianne\n\n","date":"October 27, 2012 at 3:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18405","author":"Dianne Porter","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Diane, and everyone.

I ran out of reading material during our long travels. I really enjoyed the book and had intended to return with home with it to share with my daughter who just turned 21. As I left our room Jesus revealed to me he wanted me to leave the book behind. I may never know if the book will change the direction of someone’s life in Africa, just as I may never know what the guy in church thought when Jesus prompted me to give him a devotional that I cherished. I do hope someday to thank my savior in person for all he has done. I look forward to being with Jesus and know suffering will no longer exist, or the tempation to sin and fall short. I am afraid to die. I fear when I get to heaven I may regret the life I have lived. I think it is wonderful Jesus has revealed himself to so many of you.

They were excited to spend the next day visiting my best friend from college on thier small farm in Stanwood Washington. As I settled into get some rest the holy spirit came to me in a voice that is unexplainable. The voice was crystal clear. The voice told me when you go tomorrow, keep Sarah away from the dog. The voice echoed throughout the night. It awoke with me in the morning. It prompted me on the drive to share with my husband. I sat in silence, perplexed. As I contemplated the notion knowing full well the dog had never been agressive toward anyone we arrived. It was a cold Seattle day. I layered the kids up in boots and sweaters. As my girlfriend and I were preparing things in the kitchen I asked her where the dog was. She said he is in the garage, why? I knowing her faith, told her with out going into detail that I hoped we could keep him in there while the kids played outside. What I did not know was that her husband let him out. Moments later I heard the shriek of my Sarah. As my heart dropped to the floor I ran out the door to see what I knew to be my worst horror. The dog on top of my tiny little girl shaking his head viciously from side to side. He had the meat of her tiny arm in his mouth. We got her in the house and peeled away all 3 layers of clothing. Her tiny arm was purple and you could see indentations of his teeth but her skin was not penetrated due to the thick wool sweater that swallowed her tiny frame. \nWhat I have to share with you is why this happened to us. I vowed that if I ever heard this voice again, and it told me to scream the world is ending, I would do just that. A year and a half later Sarah was in first grade but the size of a 4 year old. I was working managing my clothing business that allowed me to work while the kids were in school. Usually I would take them to and fro but being it was conference week the kids had made plans with friends to walk to the boys and girls club from the bus until I picked them up. As I worked that day, the voice came to me again. I began to tremble. It was Sarah again. The voice clearly said, be at the bus to pick Sarah up. I picked up the phone and called my part time employee. I asked her to come as soon as possible and I would explain later. The voice never ceased. As I drove to the bus stop a half an hour early I decided to walk to the boys and girls club to see if anything there was peculiar. The club director was chatty and I found myself growing more and more nervous. I explained I had to go and he followed me out the door talking. I just kept walking faster and faster. What I saw next changed my life forever. The bus stopped. The driver was a substitue I had never seen before. None of Sarah’s friends were with her. 3 children got off the bus. The first boy ran ahead leaving her behind and all alone, the second girl walked to her house. Sarah was alone, head down kicking the rocks as she walked with her tiny Dr. Marten’s. The bus driver pulled away leaving my little girl all alone. As I walked toward her a car came around the corner. It was a cream colored Jaguar. It slowly drove until it was going the same speed she was walking but when it got passed her it did a u turn in the middle of the road. My jaw dropped as I began to run screaming her name. The car crossed over to the wrond side of the road. As it turned I saw a man in the car about 50. The car was heading towards her. If I would not have been there screaming and waving my arms to this day I believe I would never have seen my little girl again. I wrote the liscence plate down and went to the police. The told me since no attempt was made they had no reason to run the plate. Devastated I left. I wish today I would have called the media. What I did to was have a friend at the DMV to run the plate. It was a dealer plate so to this day the name I got back is questionable. Over the years I have tried to check the name on searches that I got back. Sarah is in her first year of college and is on a full ride scholarship for volleyball, she is all of 4’10. I never tell this story. It is just emotional for me to share. A few of my really close friends and family know. Thank you Jesus for saving me and my daughter from a life of torment.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2012 at 4:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18381","author":"Diane Bowden","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I apologize for all the typos I was pressed for time but wanted to share my story :) my life is so much brighter and peaceful with God and Jesus.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2013 at 8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-46372","author":"Alicia","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"On the 22nd of March 2011 I had surgery, which went very well.  It wasn’t until I got home three days later that I got really really sick.  I got major infection in my glands.  I had tremendous pain in my neck at first and then I had a black out.  My husband got such a fright and went to get the doctor.  The next thing I remember was our gp examining me in my bedroom.  In South Africa doctors don’t do housecalls at all.  The doctor said he wouldn’t send me back to hospital as there are too many germs and Iexposure to it could mean the end of me.  Later that night I was sitting up on the couch as it was too painfull to lie down on a pillow.  My hubby opted to sleep on the other couch that night, which he didn’t do as he stayed up to keep an eye on me.  Just before midnight I went to the bathroom and I remember looking in the mirror and I saw death in my own eyes.  I was very sick and to the Lord:  “So this is the way I’m going to leave here to go to you!”  I went out and sat on the couch.  I heard my husband pray for me in the kitchen  at that moment.  The next second I was standing in the middle of a green field with bright blue sky.  The first thing I noticed was the extraordinary, beautiful beautiful colours.  It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen on earth, too fantastic to describe.  I turned my head and saw a big wooden cross and Jesus embracing it with both arms, looking at me with indescribable sympathy and love as if to say:  “Just embrace Me and remember My cross, I’ve carried this sickness and pain when they nailed Me to it!”  It was absolutely amazing.  Immediately after that a lot of teenage boys emerged from behind Him and formed a circle around me and they prayed for me there in my living room.  Hubby saw nothing at all.  These boys were wearing striped shirts, each stripe an extraordinary beautiful colour, like nothing on earth.  I fell asleep after that.  I was very weak for the next three weeks, but came through and I now tell this story wherever I go.  Colton also describes the colours in heaven in his book, and that to me was just wonderful!  I love Jesus with all that I am!  I thank Him for all I am!\n\n","date":"October 27, 2012 at 1:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18399","author":"Corlia","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I would like to buy a copy of Akiane’s picture of Jesus.

Everybody loved him as he was concerned for all. I loved him with all my heart. When he was sick in hospital for over 6 weeks, I fasted, prayed and read the Bible with all my heart. Our church prayed for him. I even requested Philip Yancey to pray for him and he did. But God wanted Junior back. He died 31st July 2012 at 18:30.\nMy world went upside down. I had had a very happy and fulfilling life. Life was good. I was well off financially. I had a happy marriage and basically everything good. Life w so good that I was wary about it. I consider myself a good Christian and pray together with the family every morning and before going to sleep. I read the Bible daily. But after Junior passed away, my world changed. I never know so much pain before. Till today, everything reminds me of my loving son. My good life was completely shattered. We went everywhere together. We did everything together – watching movies, eating out, going on vacations. He was my best friend.\nAfter he passed away, a friend at the church gave me Heaven Is For Real. I was somewhat comforted after reading it. I have had a lot of direct experience with God since I was 9 years old. I have no doubt in my faith. \nAfter Junior passed away, I was upset with God for a while (like Todd, Colton’s father). But now I thank God for letting me borrow his angel for 19 years. Junior was truly an angel. He prayed regularly. He loved God and Jesus. He had the innocence of an angel. He cared for everybody – people on the street, people he read about etc. I cry everyday. I do not know when the pain will stop. I miss my son terribly. Even now tears are falling down my cheeks. \nI am now not afraid of dying. In fact, I desire to depart and be with Christ which is better by far. I just wish I could hold his hands and hug him one more time. \nI love you, Junior.\n\n","date":"November 5, 2012 at 9:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-18830","author":"Paul Sarab","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"What a sweet and loving testimony of your son’s beautiful life. Perhaps he was too good for us… sometimes I think that is very true. A friend of mine lost her dear son a year ago; another 19 year old child who was dedicated and devoted to God. But she misses him with all her heart. \nWhen Corrie Ten Boom was in the concentration camp during WWII with her sister Betsy; she miraculously was spared but Betsy died there because she was frail. And from what Corrie says of her sister, Betsy was a very gentle soul with an angelic spirit. Like Enoch in the Old Testament, who was so GOOD that he just walked right into heaven without dying… maybe that is why the sweetest and the most precious go to God a little earlier than the rest of us. And that is why we miss them all the more, because such a gift is hard to find on this earth. \nBut the LOVE never stops and never fails! That is what is encouraging about Colton’s book: the Love goes on. Love is the only thing we can take with us beyond this life. Your son is praying for you, and loving you, even now.\n\n","date":"November 13, 2012 at 9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-19024","author":"Annie","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I feel your sorrow.

It has been of core interest to me.  And, the my recently written book, of 2012, has some previously staunch academic skeptics, altering previous positions.  My grandmother from Poland, who had a NDE, while giving child birth, had no abilities for widescope communication at that time, due to limitations in such areas during that era.  She grew up during the depression, and was of sound mind and strong work ethic. She said that she guided up a hill, and led by an angelic type figure who allowed her to look back to her station in life, or forward.  The experience was as real as her every day living experience.  She recanted this experience for 40 years, in such a real way and repetitious way.\nEvery time we saw her she brought it up, solely for the purpose of sharing this awestaking truth.  For anyone, interested in the account of\none of the most recently living saints,\nI recommend reading the Diaries of Sr. Faustina, a Polish saint who encountered Jesus in 1931.  It is profoundly moving as a witness narrative, of the impetus for the Divine Chaplet of Mercy, which is to be said  on the Feast of Mercy, the first Sunday after Easter, and for the sick and dying.  It will sow growing seeds of interest and truth, which speak to this very topic.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2013 at 3:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-21518","author":"katina","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"What a great stories i read here. So happy to found this site. I also had a amazing experience. I was always a athiest but when i was 19 years old (I am now 26) I started to believe that there is a God but I was not sure if it is a personal god. The bible i didn’t believe in and also Jesus was for me a fake figure that people have made up. Just could not believe how that can be true.\nThen a few weeks ago I had a dream. I saw a man walking on the street with a few other men around him. I reconised him into what people would call: Jesus. He was all in white and over his left shoulder was a red piece of cloth hanging (sorry for the bad english its not my mother language and so its not easy to explain). He turned around and saw me and he was so intens happy to see me. (never saw anyone so happy to see me) I stand still and look at him and are very surpriced that he is so happy to see me. Because why me?  Nothing special about me but his face made me feel like i am the most imporant person in the world.\nHe had so much love in his eyes and he opened his arms for me to give me a hug and I asked him in my thoughts: But if i see you where is God then? God has to be then here also or not? And he spoke to me also telepathic and said: But I am also God! And i said: no way! you are Jesus i know stories about you You are Jesus and not God. And he said: But God Is through me! I am THE WAY. If you see me, you see God. And at the same time i feel that all things i ever did wrong in my life didnt mather anymore. All was forgiven. I was not busy with that in my daily life but in my dream it was very important for me to know that he forgave me all my mistakes. \nThere was no need to even mention my mistakes anymore it was all good. And he keep looking at me with so much love. I wanted to walk to him but I was thinking that i might then not more wake up and I didnt know what to do. I looked at my feed and they were heavy standing on the ground. When I wanted to look up again I woke up.\nWhen i woke up i was so happy and this dream has changed my life forgood. I started to search on google pictures about Jesus that would come close with how i have seen him  because did not wanted to forget how he looked. I wanted to have something so I can remember his face. Then i saw the painting of Akiane and I was in shock. That was the man i saw! Only his hair was a little bit differend but that was the man! a few weeks later I also saw the pictures of the shroud of turin (i did before not even knew that there was anything like the shroud of turin) and all felt on its place. \nNow my life and me as a person is totaly changed. I devoted my life to Jesus. I have alot emptahy for other people (before that I could not feel empathy for people) and are every day busy with doing the right thing.

I was not wearing my seatbelt and she was driving at speeds over 100mph in an SUV. As we approached a toll, I realized she was in the wrong lane and when I told her to get over she jerked the wheel. We began to spin out of control and the past thing I remember is a jersey barrier smashing into my door. I was thrown over 100ft. away from the vehicle and was life flighted. I suffered broken skin on the right side of my head where you could see my skull, skin torn from my trapezius muscle down to mid bicep on my right arm and the right side of my face was torn off. The doctors said it was a miracle that I survived let alone walk away with no brain damage nor any broken bones. My face healed tremendously with no scarring, the only remnants that was left was some scars on my hands, shoulder and where the side of my head was gauged. What could possibly explain that other than an act of God? The real kicker is that I shared a room with a guy who was shot point blank in the face with a bad round from a .44 revolver, the bullet went into his cheek and left through his eyebrow, missing his eye and brain. He only had to get reconstructive surgery to repair his eye socket. God is great. I’m thankful everyday for the second chance I have received.

I can tell you that when you are in his presence, suddenly your mortality shows and it is not joy that immediately surfaces as one would think it does. Let me relate my own experience.\nSometime back in 1985 I was feeling very despondent due to an incident and on one particular night it took me quite a while to come to terms and then having fallen asleep a had a very special “dream”. Although I was not a staunch and regular church-going Christian, to my surprise in my dream I was evangelising for Jesus to a non-believer and was in the process of explaining to him who Jesus was when suddenly the scenerio was changed to be in my bedroom (I lived at an apartment on the 7th floor at that time) and looking out of my window suddenly the vision of Jesus appeared, at first floating outside my 7th floor bedroom window and then floating towards my window. Immediately I cried out to the non-believer “Look our Lord Jesus is right there!”, upon which Jesus flew into my bedroom. Immediately I woke up literally finding myself sitting on my bed with cold sweat dripping all over the body. I realised I was trembling in fear and in awe as I never ever expected to have such a dream.\nThe next few minutes my head was spinning with so many wild thoughts over this surprise “visit” to the stage that I was even wondering whether it was a dream or not and why I had arisen from my sleeping position to a sitting one immediately at the point of Jesus’ entry from the bedroom window. It took me quite a while to take control over my visibly shaken emotional self.\nAfter that experience I asked a lot of my friends and colleagues as to whether anyone of them had ever experience having a dream about Jesus and the answer was none. I then realised that very few people actually ever dreamed of Jesus or having a vision of him as the case may be. I was one of the few who had the privilege of having the experience of his presence and I am very thankful for that. I have had several other experiences involving what people would term as intercession of a “guardian angel” which I would not want to relate here because I am not proud of the actions of mine which required the saving grace of my “guardian angel”. What I can say is that most people who term the spiritual being as “guardian angel” is grossly mistaken.  I think that it is actually Jesus who is that very “guardian angel” that people speak of.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2013 at 5:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-37364","author":"C.C.

Here are some of my other conclusions.\nFirst, the artifact is almost certainly of the appropriate age and from the appropriate locality Specifically; 1) The C14 data on midieval origin is entirely discredited on its own terms; see French Reweaving. Further, multiple separate evidentiary facts point to an early date. These include at least two surreptitious C-14 dating efforts on residual threads left over from other tests, as well as the near impossibility that a three two one herringbone weave would have been ‘hank bleached’ in the Midieval era. 2) The other tests included tape samples for polen spores that also accumulated thread fibers. The polen spores locate specifically to Jerusalem.\nI do not claim the shroud is that of Jesus. Only that it is consistent with that possiblility.  Further, my mustard seed level of faith is supported by the actual image, which clerly looks like the shroud image. And it was, apparently, identified as the appropriate depiction by a young boy who had a near death experience. I forget the name of the book, but it is where I got the reference to the young female artist.\n\n","date":"September 22, 2013 at 3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-45100","author":"ejdavid","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"No Edit Button – EDIT\nParagraph 1 line 3 “arcane” not achain.\nParagraph 2 line “three to one” not three two one.\nParagraph 3 line 2 “Further, my mustard-seed level of faith is supported by both the young artist’s depiction, and through its identification by another child as accurate.

I guess my father was awake and was coherent enough to meet this man when he was drugged because of the pain he was in. \nwhen this man arrived there was something about him he stood out to me because he wasn’t dressed like any other staff didn’t have a hospital badge or coat on. when we talked to him my questions got to him like they bothered him so much-like it broke his heart…..I asked him will my father die and at that point when he said most likely its just a matter of time..it seemed his heart broke for me. the other doctors and nurses were sterile but this man was not…he said when we had decided he would return…we never saw him again and when we asked the nurses about him no one knew who he was….they gave me a weird look and my mom because we both talked to this guy….then when I saw this picture of Jesus I about lost it because this man looked exactly like Jesus…I don’t know if this man was an angel unaware, Jesus or just a concerned person working in the hospital admin office…but still leaves room to wonder…\n\n","date":"September 30, 2013 at 12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-45929","author":"teresa","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"Let me start off by saying my life up until 6 years ago was full of anger and hate towards anyone who wasnt my oldest daughter and for the most part self pitty. Until my youngest was born 9 years after my first.\nEven tho I prayed at night and i was close to God after finding him almost 6 years ago I never really said much about any of it to Gracie my youngest . One day she was around age 3 and as I tucked her in and picked up her bedroom she said Mom, god and Jesus are my best friends. I stopped looked up and said lol Huh? She said yeah they’re here! I said who is here? She said God and Jesus! I look around and with chills I said, God and Jesus are here now!?\nShe shook her head yes so curious, I ask her What does Jesus look like (knowing she had never seen a pic that I can remember)\nI said “what does he look like? what color is his hair? and she said brown and went on to tell me about his eyes all the way down to his shoes she said he was wearing a green shirt and I think green shoes… So I said really curious, ” and God? She said he had white eyes and had on a white shirt ….. I sat down on her bed and brought up pictures from google and sure enough she pointed out Jesus and said one picture kinda looked like God….\nAs days went by she continued to talk about God and Jesus and one night I was putting her to bed and she was talking about them I said well where do they live? She said, ” together!” I laughed and I said really she said yes they live together in heaven. My heart stopped and I just stood there I knew I had never talked about heaven because I wasn’t quite sure how with her being so young. I asked her, ” what is heaven like baby?” She said its so pretty there’s lots of trees and pretty colors its very pretty! She said it so excited and with a huge smile on her face like she could really see it. So I sat down and showed her pics of paintings and people’s ideas of heaven and came across a painting this same artist did of Jesus but only what she says heaven is. She says she seen heaven and painted it. The same little girl who painted Jesus. After seeing the painting and reading all about this I discovered my daughter who was at the time the same age as the two children some how said she seen and talked to God and Jesus. It strengthens my faith. She is 5 and a half now and she doesn’t seen them much anymore she says… Last time was in May getting ready to head home from our vacation as I’m loading the car she stands there beside me and we prayed before we left the hotel for a safe trip home. My daughter standing beside the car half hour layers says “Jesus and God are here mommy” we all just stopped and looked at one another. I said, ” they are here? Now?”\nShe said, ” yes mom they’re right here”and put her hand out to show me where but I didn’t see anything none of us did. I said ” ok well that’s great” she replied, ” yeah, and they’re going to go with us.” My heart felt so warm tears filled my eyes and I said” ok god and Jesus hop in its kinda cramped but we can get you in. She laughed and ran and got in and said yeah come guys. \nSince then she said she hasn’t really seen them and when I ask why I think she said something like because they don’t want to scare me or im growing up and she said they are in heaven. \nKeep in mind my daughter even tho we love God and pray and give thanks we do not attend any church or practice a religion We just try to be good people, do right and give thanks. There’s no way she could make this up. I love my beautiful daughters and life we have all been giving. Thank you God and his beautiful children.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2013 at 8:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-46371","author":"Alicia","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud","post":"I was in 5th grade.    There were pylons in a huge circle that we had to run around.    You had to run around several times and someone was going to be a winner.    No way could I keep up but I was trying so hard.    I said to myself, ‘O Dear God, help me.”   Immediately I began to run like the wind.
