It is sub-titled “Mosaic Face of Jesus, Fragment from an unidentified location in Sanliurfa (=Edessa)”. As early as pp 1-2 of his book, Wilson explains how he and Mark Guscin were advised by archaeologist Dr Mehmet Onal of the presence of the mosaic in the Sanliurfa museum. The museum director Erman Bediz explained that it was an 8in x 6in fragment discovered by a local citizen making structural alterations to his house. He “hacked” it out and sold it to the museum on a “no questions asked” basis.  The museum did not have it on display but only in storage, but it was viewed by Wilson & Guscin. Requests to photograph it were met by the response that Ankara would need to be consulted, but they never heard back from the museum before publication. The plate they used was copied from a photo in a Turkish journal, cited in his picture credits list. \nFrom their extensive survey of Mandylion representations, Wilson & Guscin identified it as 6th-7th century.  It is probably the sole surviving representation of what must have been innumerable copies of the image within Edessa itself before the Turks destroyed everything Christian after taking Edessa in 1146.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2014 at 8:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-101930","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Ah, yes.

Markwardt in his 2008 paper, “Ancient Edessa and the Shroud” gives three such examples Fig 14 “The Family Portrait Mosaic”, Fig 15 “The Tripod Mosaic”, Fig 16 “Funerary Couch Mosaic”, pp 21-23, all from ‘Vanished Civilizations’ edited by Edward Bacon, 1963, and cites the primary authority on Edessa, J B Segal. They are said to date from the 2nd-3rd centuries. The men of that time are all depicted with beards, and bushy hair, one or two wear turbans, the women are “golden robed and golden sandaled”. \nIt is tempting to identify the ISSA mosaic as a copy of the Mandylion, particularly as Louis makes the point concerning similarity in the detail of the Saints Sergius & Bacchus in Kiev museum. Also archaeologist Dr Onal identified it as an “Issa” (= Jesus) icon. In view of the tradition of mosaic work among notable families, I suppose it is just possible it may represent someone else, perhaps in much the same way as modern families display family photographs. Not knowing the specific location of where the mosaic was found might perhaps be considered a problem in confirming it as a Jesus icon. The fact that it survived aftr everything else Christian was destroyed might raise the suspicion that it was not recognised by the invaders as specifically Christian.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2014 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-102063","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin","post":"It is always possible, Daveb, so we will have to wait and see what more Phil can produce that will convince sceptics.

This question must be asked since the mere having of an experience is no guarantee of the reality of its object.  The second question is whether the experiences, veridical or not, occurred wholly independently of brain functioning.  The two questions are connected.  If it could be shown that the experiences were generated by a minimally (mal)functioning brain, then then this would be  a reason to doubt the veridicality of the experiences.  (Analogy: if I know that my unusual experiences are the result of the ingesting of LSD-25, then I have reason to doubt the veridicality of the experiences.)  \nAnother concern of mine is this.  How does Colton Burpo’s father know that son’s wonderful experiences didn’t suddenly arise just as the cortex was coming back into action  just before his eyes popped open?  So even if his cortex was for a long time completely nonfunctional, the experience he remembers could have been simply a dream that arose while the cortex was coming back ‘on line.’\nMy point is not that the book has not given us evidence that mental functioning occurs in the absence of brain activity; I believe he has.

The Akiane painting is a resemblance-any painting or image made by a person will never truly be a perfect and completely accurate rendition of Christ. However, there are many images of Christ that are very much alike to one another as well as the image on the Turin shroud. As God said, it is faith and only faith that will lead you to him. Physical proof will not be the purpose of God, he spread the word through Christ, he founded the new covenant, belief and faith is based on one’s own prayers and willingness to open one’s heart to Christ. We must find him, he already has found us. God sent his only begotten son to us in human form so we could relate to him. He also sent him, knowing that he would be the most mistreated and tortured man in the world by human hands, for the potential forgiveness of sin. I have had many strange and eye opening experiences myself, near death in the womb, forced early birth so I wouldn’t die, sick for a month in an incubator. I have experienced God’s grace through many near death moments. I have seen angels, God has chosen for me to go on, I have seen my grandfather after he died, my father communicated with me for years after he died, I have seen myself from above my body and looked down on the worried people around the bed, it is not for us to question God’s will, it is for us to find our way to him and love him without expectations. Read the bible and meditate over the words and messages, pray for guidance and understanding. God will show you the truth if you seek it unselfishly.\nPerhaps there were some issues in the book Heaven can wait, but that shouldn’t matter, what matters is the message the book has as a whole conveyed;. GOD exists, Jesus exists, Angels Exist, HEAVEN exists as well as HELL.Your salvation is within yourself by choosing Christ. The formula for life is the same in every element of this planets and Universe.God created the formula for all life, how it evolved and progressed was also his doing.\nFind a moment to sit and be still, mediate or pray in silence without interruptions-think back and reflect. There may be an answer hidden in your own buried memories or subconscious mind, a memory of an unexpected fulfillment to a need, a recovery, an accident that could have led to paralysis or death that didn’t. You may be surprised. There is not such a thing as “coincidental”. We use that word because we are lacking in deep knowledge and wisdom as humans, despite our education. “GOD works in mysterious ways”, how true, so many coincidences are not coincidences. God works to help us, he sends us help when we need it, we think we do everything on our own. We don’t, anything we have, is because God has chosen to give it to us.Give God credit, Christ came to us with a message, and we are to listen to that message and accept him as our Savior. Those who need proof, unfortunately will never find it in physical proof, the proof is in his word and his promise of eternal life in Heaven for those who have found him. God also warned us that there will be many who will attempt to lead us astray, there will be many who will use his name in vain. The 4 year old Colton did none of this, most children of that age do not embellish nor lie. He spoke the truth, and it is a message. “Wake up people, God exists, Christ exists, Heaven and Hell exists. It is your choice to decide which one of these two eternal places you wish to spend your eternal life in. Life after our physical death is real. Our physical bodies are needed for our soul so that we may learn to grow spiritually for the sake of our souls. Anger and negativity will never help us to grow in our soul. Without the chance for our souls to learn and grow in goodness, we would never have a change to enter Heaven.\nInstead of criticism find reflection!!!\nBy the way, have any of you thought about the idea that during the time of the Crucifixion they tied all men by rope around the feet and hands to the cross? With that in mind, the weight of Christ body would not be held up by the nails alone. In so doing, it is doubtless that the nails were through his hands and feet, not to break bones and not bearing his whole weight alone on the cross. Think about that.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2014 at 12:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-160298","author":"Lady C","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Thank you, your comment is much appreciated.

That one case is interesting and promising, but hardly the “boom” that a “proven” OBE could have been and all of it is thanks to flawed design. If they are going to continue (which seems likely, they just go another grant from Templeton) they should shrink the sample size to include only the patients attended in the retrofitted rooms or as I said above, reconsider the placement of the “signs”.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2014 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-160441","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin","post":"Extraordinary methodology.

But a sign on the chest would be in the way of resuscitation efforts. I believe, from what I’ve read, that out of body experiencers speak of being near the ceiling of a room and having 360 by 360 vision (hard to imagine). Often they speak of leaving the room and seeing things in other rooms, etc. Interesting stuff, maybe, but pretty much limited to personal testimonials in lieu of evidence.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2014 at 2:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-160455","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin","post":"The entire lower body does not interfere, I could think of a few methods to place something “unusual” there. The most simplistic would involve a psychedelic-colored sheet which would be placed on the legs of the patient by one of the nurses and quickly removed once a pulse is found.\nAlternatively, something could be worn by a member of the staff. Would wearing a clown wig while trying to revive someone be considered inappropriate?\n\n","date":"October 8, 2014 at 2:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-160464","author":"Eric","site":"shroudstory"}]
