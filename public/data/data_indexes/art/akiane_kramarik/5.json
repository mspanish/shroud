It wasn’t until recently that I realized that other people didn’t pray this way too.  Alex Malarkey, another boy who has seen heaven, told his dad that his lips were for talking to people but there was a different part of his brain that was for talking to God.   There is nothing great or particularly special about my life…but I know without the peace and strength I get through this kind of prayer and relationship with God, I would never have survived the death of my husband (& best friend) to cancer at age 41.  The Bible says “Pray without ceasing…” and I believe that this is how you do just that.  It just starts by pouring out your heart and talking time to listen to the voice within that answers.  It feels almost imagined because society says it is…but the answers are seldom ones that I would have chosen.  If I listen, I find peace (note:  God did never promised us happiness or an easy life).\n\n","date":"August 12, 2011 at 1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3584","author":"Camie Rabon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud","post":"I know and believe,  everytime I see these paintings my heart and spirit is overwhelmed with exsightment and love for our savior the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2011 at 3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-3727","author":"Mevelyn","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud","post":"I loved the book “Heaven IS For Real.”  It reminded me how when my son was only 21 months old, he told me that Jesus was in the van, and he was sitting in the passenger seat and he had brown hair and white clothes on.  I also was blessed to see 3 visions on my wall continue to flash in sepia coloring with a gold shimmery glowing frame like a slide show.  One was Jesus’ profile, one was Mother Mary holding her baby and the other was of a few people kneeling looking up to the glowing cross.\n\n","date":"September 24, 2011 at 11:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4041","author":"Christian","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud","post":"I believe these people, children all to be what I call God sensitive, we all have it to to  some degree but children are much more sensitive to it, praise the Lord in the highest, may He show you and us all grace and peace!\n\n","date":"October 5, 2011 at 9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4124","author":"robert","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud","post":"Akiane is God’s gift to our world , her painting is\nindescribably beautiful\n\n","date":"October 16, 2011 at 10:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4206","author":"mangopage","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud","post":"As a Christian and artist myself, I can relate to Akiane’s passion and determination to capture what God has given her to share with and help others. That is what gifts are for. It’s what gives them meaning. Her paintings are inspiring and beautiful. They touch the heart profoundly. I see a story in each one. Some are warnings, some are hope reaching out and some are examples of love, beauty and grace. I pray God will keep her on the straight path and continue to bless her with more gifts to share through his Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\n","date":"October 20, 2011 at 7:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-4228","author":"Daniel James","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud","post":"I believe the same ,we are His hands ,without us  He can’t  reach people and help them .I myself have seen Jesus three times.
