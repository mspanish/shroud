I had read the book “Heaven is for Real” but I had already known about Akiane’s pictures, I had no idea they were in the book until I read to that point and thought oh wow how great is this! Since I know my son has seen the angels, because of over the past three years he has indicated they are there, by a glance and me asking are they here, and he will smile and look at them in the room. I showed him the picture of the Prince Of Peace, I told him to look hard at the picture, his head came up off his pillow and he just stated at the picture with such focus. I asked him, “Zach if this is the Jesus you saw raise your right arm” he did not even think about it, he raised his right arm right away. I told him yes baby that is him. to this day, when I tell that story around other people and show them the picture, he lights up as well as the people seeing the picture for the first time.\n\n","date":"March 25, 2012 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/12/real-face-of-christ-perspective/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","id":"comment-9638","author":"Dana Johnston","site":"shroudstory"}]
