Text of Markwardt’s ‘Modern Scholarship’ paper is published by Barrie Schwortz at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf .  It comprises some 276 pages, double-spaced, with 251 footnotes, and 20 illustrations taken from his 136 slide-presentation.   It includes a detailed review of various other hypotheses, including the Wilson Mandylion theory, which Markwardt no longer holds.  \nTwo of his earlier papers, place the Shroud in the city of Antioch, taken there by the apostles consequential to the Jewish persecution after the martyrdom of Stephen.  During the depredations and confiscation of church treasures by Julian the Apostate, it was hidden away until the 6th century when a series of earthquakes hit Antioch, and its location was then revealed.  Soon after Antioch was attacked by the Persian King Chosroes who destroyed the city.  Meantime the warrior patriarch bishop of Antioch, Ephraemius took the Shroud into Cappadocia, where it became known as the Image of Camuliana.  Soon afterwards it was taken to the capital Constantinople, where it became known as the Image of God Incarnate, quite distinct from the Mandylion,  \nThis very brief summary does little justice to Markwardt’s excellent case, and one needs to read the paper to see his strong arguments for his theory.  I consider the paper to be a major landmark in the quest for an early history.  However there is a lot of scholarly investment in the Mandylion hypothesis, and I expect it will be some time before the significance of Markardt’s paper becomes fully appreciated. \nThe truth is often more fascinating and intriguing than any fictional account, however imaginative such speculations might be.\n\n","date":"February 4, 2015 at 2:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-189131","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"“It comprises some 276 pages, double-spaced, with 251 footnotes, and 20 illustrations taken from his 136 slide-presentation.”\nYes,  but what one seeks is just one teeny weeny hint in the historical record that there was a life-size imprint on linen of a TS-like double-image  prior to 1355 .Nope, not “excuses” (“it was folded up to look like a face-only portrait, no double image”) but real evidence for the existence of what we see now.\nHow could an iconic image have remained secret for 13 centuries, only to have suddenly re-appeared from the mists of time with no ‘history’, on relatively pristine, newish-looking linen (don’t mention the radiocarbon dating)?\n276 pages, or 2760 pages, or 27600 pages do not compensate for a 1300 year old vacuum in the historical record.\n\n","date":"February 4, 2015 at 2:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-189134","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"It’s a fair question Colin.

You have no precedent in art history for the Shroud so you can’t ipso factso call it man-made. You have only a theory – no proof. ”\nThere’s a simple reason why the TS has not precedent in art history, DavidG.\nIt was not intended to appeal to artistic sensibilities. How could it, being a faint negative monochrome imprint?\nIt should be seen essentially as a medieval puzzle – more mathematical than artistic. The viewer on first acquaintance had first to recognize the image as a bodily imprint, not a painting. He was then expected to make the connection between the strategically separated frontal and dorsal images and the use of an up-and-over sheet of linen, not canvas, to realize that it corresponded with the biblical account of Joseph of Arimathea’s intervention,. The viewer was then invited to invest further mental effort in matching up the bloodstains to the biblical account of the scourging, crowning with thorns and crucifixion, but with no flagrum, no thorns, no nails or lance in the ‘picture’. Two puzzles for the price of one – bodily  imprint AND blood. Is it any wonder it was an instant hit? But it had to be unique!\nFinally, when the medieval viewer has put all those together he was then amenable to the suggestion that what he was viewing was NOT merely a contrived counterfeit, but the real linen that enveloped Jesus. However, for that conclusion to be drawn it was imperative that there were no prototypes still in in circulation. No doubt they had existed – if only from the one originating workshop – but they had to be promptly destroyed.\nLet’s stop thinking about the TS as art. It leads one down a totally false trail. It only became art once Secondo Pia had shown the stunning effect of reversing the tonal values.The first cohorts of medieval viewers would not, and could not have foreseen that transformation, or have done that in their own heads.\n\n","date":"February 5, 2015 at 11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-189394","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"It has no precedent in art or otherwise.

Whatever the case, it is just pathetic for an alleged “Christian”. Whether you want to admit or not The Shroud of Christ is Rosicrucian in se and their aspiration to “learn all that G-d (=Yeshu’/Jesus) hath suffered Man to know is related to his most famous relic aka his LINEN CLOTH ( > anagram LINCOLN) showning the capital letter-like shaped four series of burn marks spelling L I L E.\nBesides, The Mysterious Island that is L’ILLE LINCOLN (the latter as embedded anagram in the phrase LINEN CLOTH) is the hide-out of an Indian Prince, which makes Capitain Nemo a/the hidden Indian Prince. Now “The Hidden (Prince)” in Hebrew as a name is… Ha-Nostry, currently transcripted “The Nazarene” and Indian (I’ve already told you) can refer to the Sindon as a piece of cloth from the Sindh (India) or Shindu (> Hebrew Sadin).

Your evidence for its derivation from Phersu is a quotation from Wikipedia?”\nThe true fact IS I FIRST referred you to no less than THREE distinguished Latinists and etymologists (among whom Broxton Onians, Pauly-Wissova, and Poulsen). THEN I added up Wiki ESPECALLY FOR YOU given you were in denial and your very low level of knowledge on the Persona issue. How long shall I repeat it? According to several etymologists/Latinists/Etruscanists (Altheims, Baldi, Croon Vernant etc) Persona is derived from the Etruscan word Phersu, a Death G-od whose effigy was found in Etruscan tombs (Er ring any bell?). See e.g. Jean-Pierre VERNant (BTW Jules Vernes was born in Nantes ;-)), “Mortals and Immortal: collected Essays”, pp. 122-123. \nThe CROIX (Cross) within LA COURONNE DE ROSE “the crown of roses) carved by DOMINI(que) ROZE on Jules Verne’s tomb is quite telling to the initiated eye Jules Verne was R+C = Rosicrucian. Methinks I am just preaching in the wilderness when it comes to YOU who have ears but do not hear, have eyes but do not see. You definitely have not the initiated/appropriate sight-hearing-and-brain coordination system to understand what I mean. Nope. Stop wasting my time, PLEASE.\nFinal note: When Jules Verne coded the onomastic background story of his novel, he was not acquainted with Oswald Szemerényi (1913-1996 CE). Just in case you hadn’t noticed it yet, Jules Verne was born in Nantes in 1828 and died in 1902. Besides the main etymological current is Persona is derived from Phersu (whether you like it or not!). Verne took it as such to implicitly coded Nemo BOTH as Persona, “PERSONNE”, i.e. as MASK and DEATH G-OD i.e. Phersu (= Hadès) to embed a secret reference to THE TURIN SHROUD DEATH MASK OF (the Son of) G-D when he was in HADES.\nStop distorting my words and putting words in my mouth, FRAUDO MALFOY!\n\n","date":"February 7, 2015 at 3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190057","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"Typo: Jules verne died in 1905\n\n","date":"February 7, 2015 at 4:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190075","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"Hugh, you wrote: “Evidence is a letter to Jules Verne saying “Dear Sir, welcome to the Rosicrucians,” or a diary entry “Today I became a Rosicrucian”, or a list of members from 1880.” Are you kidding?

YOU do have a tunnel vision and many a blind spot as far as image analysis and cryptanalysis is concerned.\nTo Hugh: Re Cyrus Smith as the PERFECT anagram of M(aran) Y(e)ShU’ CHRIST or M(aran) Y(e)SHU’ CRIST. This is a cryptographic FACT you just cannot deny, whether you like it or not. In the French original version, Cyrus Smith IS the name Jukes Verne gave to the Engineer NOT “Cyrus Harding” that appears ONLY in a few faulty English translations. \nBecause I mechanically copied and pasted a FLAWED Enligsh translation of a passage of L’ILE MYSTERIEUSE, Cyrus Smith, which the TRUE name of the engineer in the French original version,  MISLEADINGLING appears mistranslated as “Cyrus Harding”.  The WRONG NAME is not my doing. This is the translator’s. In other words  is NOT in my list of comments stricto sensu, it is a quote from a FLAWED English translation. Had the blog language been French, such a mistranlation could not have occurred. \nI said it again: CYRUS SMITH (which IS the TRUE name Jules Verne gave to his hero) is the PERFECT ANAGRAM of M(aran) Y(e)ShU’ CHRIST or M(aran) Y(e)SHU’ CRIST, “Our Lord Jesus Christ”. THis is a cryptographic fact. This cryptographic system known as LE LANGAGE DES OISEAUX (the language of the birds) dates back to KING SALOMON. Shall I repeat they are many an example Jules Verne did use the Rosicrucian cryptographic system known as The Language of the Birds. Reminder re Rosicrucianism: Solomon’s proverbial wisdom was due to his being granted understanding of the language of the birds and practice of secrecy. Reminder of the Rosicrucian manifesto incipit: \n“Wisdom (saith Solomon) is to a man an infinite Treasure, for she is the\nBreath of the Power of God, and a pure Influence that floweth from the\nGlory of the Almighty; she is the Brightness of Eternal Light, and an undefiled\nMirror of the Majesty of God, and an Image of his Goodness; she teacheth\nus Soberness and Prudence, Righteousness and Strength; she\nunderstands the Subtilty of words, and Solution of dark sentences; she foreknoweth\nSigns and Wonders, and what shall happen in time to come; with\nthis Treasure was our first Father Adam fully endued: Hence it doth appear,\nthat after God had brought before him all the Creatures of the Field, and\nthe Fowls under Heaven, he gave to every one of them their proper names,\naccording to their nature.”\nIt then proceeds: “Although now through the sorrowful fall into sin this excellent Jewel\nWisdom hath been lost, and meer Darkness and Ignorance is come into the\nWorld, yet notwithstanding hath the Lord God sometimes hitherto\nbestowed, and made manifest the same, to some of his Friends: For the wise\nKing Solomon doth testifie of himself, that he upon earnest prayer and\ndesire did get and obtain such Wisdom of God, that thereby he knew how\nthe World was created, thereby he understood the Nature of the Elements,\nalso the time, beginning, middle and end, the increase and decrease, the\nchange of times through the whole Year, the Revolution of the Year, and\nOrdinance of the Stars; he understood also the properties of tame and wilde\nBeasts, the cause of the raigning of the Winds, and minds and intents of\nmen, all sorts and natures of Plants, vertues of Roots, and others, was not\nunknown to him. Now I do not think that there can be found any one\nwho would not wish and desire with all his heart to be a Partaker of this\nnoble Treasure; but seeing the same Felicity can happen to none, except\nGod himself give Wisdom, and send his holy Spirit from above, we have\ntherefore set forth in print this little Treatise, to wit, Famam & Confessionem,\nof the Laudable Fraternity of the Rosie Cross, to be read by every\none, because in them is clearly shewn and discovered, what concerning it\nthe World hath to expect (…).”\nThe influence of Rosicrucianism can be felt all through JV’s work for the one who has ears to hear, eyes to see and brain to think. It not just for the blind and deaf common readers but first and foremost for the wide and understanding reader or the “uncommon one”. Rosicrucians are promoting a “Universal Reformation of Mankind”, (the “Rosicrucian Enlightenment”). The fact is it can be felt in every and all JV’s novel(s) (just think of the famous the Vernian “Reformed Club” (R+ C)). Besides the true fact IS many an esoteric society have claimed to derive their doctrines, in whole or in part, from the original Rosicrucians. According to Tarade, most likely the Rosicrucian Pierrre Piquelin co-opted Jules Verne.\nReminder for Hugh: my “deliberations” are rooted in a work of fiction, Rosicrucian literature, Christian refrential texts, a cryptographic system (or phonetic & etymological Qabbalah) dating back to the Time of King Salomon, a Secret Order known as the Rose Cross and an archaeological document know as the Turin Shroud.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2015 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190343","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"…The Turin Shroud, as an archaeological document, still shows “the Dew of the Cross” (or Ros Crucis as MysteriumCrucis); the Mystery of the Cross.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2015 at 5:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190348","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"Typo: It not just for the blind and deaf common readers but first and foremost for the WISE and understanding reader not to mention the “uncommon one”.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2015 at 5:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190344","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"Re King Solomon’s WISDOM (SOPHIA in Greek): in Atbash Cipher (which is part and parcel of the Language of the Birds): Let’s read Schoenfield:\n“(Atbash Cipher) is a Hebrew code which substitutes the first letter of the alphabet for the last and the second letter for the second last and so on.

BTW Thibault do you recommend probiotics or antibiotics to your patient?\nHere is the article from which the quote is taken: \n“It is ironic that this humbled fungus, hailed as a benefactor of mankind, may by its very success prove to be a deciding factor in the decline of the present civilization.”\n~Dr. John I. Pitt, The Genus Penicillum, Academic Press, 1979\nAntibiotics are indiscriminate killers of bacteria. Not only do they kill “bad” bacteria but the beneficial bacteria that live in the intestines as well. This imbalance of organisms can cause a disruption of digestion, decreasing our ability to properly absorb nutrients from foods, and makes us more vulnerable to pathogens, especially yeast. These unfriendly organisms rapidly repopulate the gastrointestinal tract and wreak havoc, causing additional infections that can occur in almost any region or organ of the body.\nOur good bacteria makes up 75% of our immune system and is our first line of defense against illness. Think of it as our home land security. Each time we take an antibiotic, we are “taking out” a good portion of this security and leaving ourselves open to further assaults. Doing this over and over again results is declining health.\nWe’ve all run to the doctors from time to time when we’ve not felt well. Often times we end up leaving the doctor’s office with a prescription for an antibiotic even if that wasn’t what was needed to resolve our current health problem.\nAntibiotics given for viral infections such as the common cold, upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis are pointless because antibiotics do not kill viral infections. However, doctors may resort to giving antibiotics so the patient won’t leave empty handed or because the patient is adamant that this is what is needed. Either way, this is a prescription for disaster.\nAntibiotic resistance is becoming a major concern and is increasing worldwide. Here in the US we take an estimated 133 million antibiotic prescriptions per year, according to the government accounting office. A full ½ of these prescriptions are not needed according to current estimates. Many of these are given to fight viral infections.\nAlthough there use in humans is the biggest contributor of antibiotic resistance, it has been reported that 70% of the antibiotics produced in the USA each year are fed to our livestock (pigs, chickens, and cattle). This information is cause for further concern.\nIs the excessive use of antibiotics connected to escalating rates of illness (esp. autoimmune diseases) in the US and throughout the world? There are some experts that think there is indeed a connection.\nAntibiotics in Livestock\nAntibiotics have been used extensively in agriculture since the 1960s. Most are not given for disease prevention, but as growth promoters. Healthy farm animals are estimated to receive an astounding 50% to 70% of all antibiotics produced in the US.\nThe practice of giving livestock antibiotics has also come under scrutiny from those who believe that it does increase the likelihood of antibiotic resistance in humans.\nCould eating meat and poultry from animals that have been given antibiotics ultimately affect our good bacteria and lead to yeast overgrowth? The jury is still out on that one, but there are experts who believe this trend could be a threat to our health! Lets not forget that animals today are often given growth hormones as well.\nBreast cancer and other cancers are on the rise. Could antibiotics and growth hormones given to fatten cattle and other livestock be partially responsible for the increased cancer statistics? Again, some think so!\nFor more on antibiotics, fungus and their effects on our health, we recommend checking out this link:\nKnow-the-Cause.com You can also view recorded shows by the host, Doug Kaufmann!”\n\n","date":"February 10, 2015 at 8:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190619","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"See too “Antibiotics Kill Your Body’s Good Bacteria, Too, Leading to Serious Health Risks”\nBy Doug Kaufmann\nhttp://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2003/06/18/antibiotics-bacteria.aspx\n\n","date":"February 10, 2015 at 8:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190623","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"\n\n","date":"February 11, 2015 at 2:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190650","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"\n\n","date":"February 11, 2015 at 2:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","id":"comment-190655","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud","post":"Colin, Matching your ‘scientific’ research and studies and words with actions should mean you’re  eating two BIO green bananas a day.

As such they lead to serious health risks.\nMax Planck who won the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics, once weighed in as to why science is slow to change even in the presence of overwhelming evidence that it should do so.\n“A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light,” Planck said, “but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new\ngeneration grows up that is familiar with the ideas from the beginning.”\nOn February 16, 2013 at 2:00 pm, Colinsberry replied:\n“As I say: you win some, you lose some. But it’s a minority of antibiotic-recipients who get overgrowth of Campylobacter etc.due to suppression of commensals or “friendly bacteria”.

If you experience bloating, belching, gas, constipation, diarrhea, GERD, or other intestinal problems, probiotics can play an important role in restoring your intestinal terrain.\nSelling antibiotics to sell probiotics…that’s the whole “science” behind it.

Most obviously, Colin, Hugh and Thibault have eyes, but don’t see, ears but don’t hear, brain but don’t think as far as cryptology, cryptanalysis and cryptography are concerned. When was it, last time, Thilbault et al read L’ILE MYSTERIEUSE (if he/they ever read it !)?\nReminder for amateur cryptologists: « In a rush to bring [Jules Verne’s] most popular (and profitable) stories to market, British and American translators repeatedly watered them down and abridged them by chopping out most of the science and the longer descriptive passages (often from 20 to 40% of the original); they committed thousands of basic translating errors, mistakes that an average high-school student of French would have managed correctly; they censored Verne’s texts by either removing or diluting references that might be construed as anti-British or anti-American; and, in several instances, they totally rewrote Verne’s narratives to suit their own tastes (changing the names of the characters, adding new scenes, deleting others, relabeling the chapters, and so on). »\n                        —Arthur B. Evans, Jules Verne’s English Translations in SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, XXXII:1 #95 (March 2005): 80.\nBy short instalments, I do hope Dan will allow me to demonstrate in his blog Jules Verne’s L’ILE MYSTERIEUSE is cryptographically Shroud-related.

Actually, during early Christian time the cross was made a part of a diachronic ‘shadow play’ between the Old and New Testaments (“Those things which of old the prophet sang in dark figure the new generation of the Maker made clear”) while the Shroud bearing the image of the Messiah was the secret of secrets whence the hard time to fill the TS historical gap.\nIt is also rooted in the intercultural implantation of the Queen of Sheba in conjunction with the wood of the cross of Christ as lignum vitae. For the fanciful and widespread medieval legend of the origins of the wood of the cross has led to a specific tradition of the Queen of Sheba.  \nActually in the 12th c. CE,  the Queen of Sheba was also known as the one who “by gifts secretly signifies the faith of Solomon”, Latin REGINA.SABA. MISTICAT.INDONIS REGINA DIDEM SALEMONIS  (see e.g. the Verdun Altar). The sentence in Laitn plays with the word SINDONIS (the Lord’s Sindon). Now in Hebrew, the biblical name Solomon has the same root (ShLMH) as Salmana, “shelter”, “protective shadow (of the crypt)” and Salmon, “protective Image”, “protective Idol”.\n“(…) In the legend of the True Cross, the Queen is actually the first person who worships the wood with supernatural knowledge of the crucifixion. )…) In the so-called Historia, a manuscript dating before 1150, from Regensburg and kept in Munich, it is told how, in the time of David, a Jew finds a piece of wood with three  branches which he brings to the king. By divine inspiration, David recognizes the Messianic function of the wood and has it gilded (alike Christian Black Virgins, comment mine). Solomon also worships it. The Queen of Sheba predicts that one day a man will hang from that particular piece of wood and that this will spell the end of the Jews.” (see The Wood, The Water, and the Foot, or how the Queen of Sheba met up with the True Cross. With emphasis on the Northern European Iconography, in “Mitteilungen für Anthropologie und Religiongeschichte (MARG), 16, Münster , 2004, p. 221, 225 sqq) \n“One constant is that from the 12th century onward, in the Legend of the True Cross, the Queen of Sheba is privileged with the insight of Christ‟s coming (see מרן אתא: maran ‘athâ’, “The Lord has come”, the two-word Aramaic formula used in the Book of Revelation, comment mine), and also acts accordingly. Sheba is privileged with the insight of Christ‟s coming, and also acts accordingly. It is she who recognizes the mystery of the wood of the cross and in all conscience leads the wood to its destination. Against what background has the Queen of Sheba taken over this function within the Legend of the Cross? Which literary clues have led her to the foreground precisely in the 12th century? A primary answer lies couched in the typological interpretations which found access during the 12th century. Isaiah 60.6 says that a flood of camels and dromedaries, as well as gold and incense will cover the citizens of Sheba and that they will “proclaim the praise of the Lord.” This prediction stands in the context of the glory of the New Jerusalem and thus must be understood eschatologically.
