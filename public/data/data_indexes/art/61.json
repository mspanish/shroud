Or perhaps earlier. I am just giving a plausible range. Also, notice that the Manoppello veil appears to be shifted left and right vertically across the face depending on which photograph you are using. That is, the veil is certainly not “solid” so that its trellis can be partially shifted at one vertical location. But since the veil is between glasses I cannot explain why this is happening. Perhaps the veil was removed from its glass for some of these photographs. In any case, we have to be careful about slight curves (e..g, along the nose) since that might be the sustaining medium (i.e., the byssus trellis) that has these curves. I would need to include many photographs here to show this sifting and I am not sure this is the right place. But that can be looked up on the Web by anybody interested on this subject.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 2:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18210","author":"latendre","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose","post":"Reminder:\nThe Veil of Manoppello has NEVER been removed from his glass since the 17th century CE.\nForensically  speaking (and WELL EVEN BEFORE the Manopello Veil face was scientifically examined), the slight derivation of the fleshy tip of the TS man’s nose was detected (in the1970s). \nIconographically speaking, the same feature happens to be ALSO detectable on the MV face. \nIn the mortuary/morgue, corpses with “a skewed nose” are a well known fact.
