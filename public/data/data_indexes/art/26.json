[{"title":"Relishing Relics or Bring Me the Head of John the Baptist","post":"This women have a very good judgement !  I totally agree with her point of view.  She say : “it (the Shroud) can be taken as an image of the Crucified Body of Christ, just like all those crucifixes in churches and paintings and hanging around people’s necks, which we use as a symbol and as a focus for prayer.”  Exactly right !  The Shroud to me is THE GREATEST ICON OF JESUS PASSION AND DEATH.  That’s the main purpose of this cloth !  And for what she said before : “we believe in the Resurrection beforehand.”, I just hope this is true for everybody, but I’m not so sure…  I have some fear that some people based their faith in Christ on the Shroud.  To me, this is a mistake… And that’s why my Catholic church never say that the Shroud is authentic and, more than that, never say that it’s some kind of “proof” of the resurrection.  That’s also why the Catholic church don’t use this relic as a banner to convert people…  And that’s the way it should be !!!\n\n","date":"September 2, 2011 at 6:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/02/relishing-relics-or-bring-me-the-head-of-john-the-baptist/","cat":"art","id":"comment-3771","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
