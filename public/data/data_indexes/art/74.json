He had been challenged by Dr. Abraham Kovoor, of Sri Lanka. Some time after that my professor of paraspsychology also challenged him to perform a miracle in his front, but under scientific control.\nAll he had to was to fill a cavity, and there could be nothing more than a gesture, or he could just utter a word, to make it more Jesus-like. The material could be obtained beforehand with a dentist.\nThe challenge was of course ignored. Well, so we have the “miracle man” and his computer-produced Jesus image:\nhttps://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view;_ylt=AwrTcXyXW3pTf1QAi42JzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTIzM24xZWJsBHNlYwNzcgRzbGsDaW1nBG9pZAMzMmU0N2YxMjIwZWQyOThhNTgwZjBiMzRkYzcyMWM4ZgRncG9zAzI3BGl0A2Jpbmc-?back=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dsai%2Bbaba%2527s%2Bjesus%26ei%3Dutf-8%26y%3DSearch%26fr%3Dsfp-img%26tab%3Dorganic%26ri%3D27&w=398&h=600&imgurl=www.flixya.com%2Ffiles-photo%2Fg%2Ff%2Fb%2Fgfbhawalpore-2254904.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flixya.com%2Fphoto%2F2254904%2FJESUS-FACE-MIRACLE-PICTURE-SATHYA-SAI-BABA-REAL-JESUS-PHOTO-gfb&size=77.6KB&name=%3Cb%3EJESUS+%3C%2Fb%3EFACE+MIRACLE+PICTURE-SATHYA+%3Cb%3ESAI+BABA%3C%2Fb%3E-REAL+%3Cb%3EJESUS%3C%2Fb%3E-PHOTO-gfb.&p=sai+baba%27s+jesus&oid=32e47f1220ed298a580f0b34dc721c8f&fr2=&fr=sfp-img&tt=%3Cb%3EJESUS+%3C%2Fb%3EFACE+MIRACLE+PICTURE-SATHYA+%3Cb%3ESAI+BABA%3C%2Fb%3E-REAL+%3Cb%3EJESUS%3C%2Fb%3E-PHOTO-gfb.&b=0&ni=128&no=27&ts=&tab=organic&sigr=133mteqgg&sigb=13h1svpsd&sigi=11p734dqn&sigt=12ld5dc60&sign=12ld5dc60&.crumb=cW/uZ1wtYMm&fr=sfp-img\n\n","date":"May 19, 2014 at 3:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/19/name-that-picture/","cat":"art","id":"comment-121538","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Name that picture","post":"Here is a link to the website of Annig Raley-Agemian, the daughter of Ariel Agemian, that honors her father’s work:  http://www.agemianpaintings.com/\n\n","date":"May 19, 2014 at 3:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/19/name-that-picture/","cat":"art","id":"comment-121532","author":"Barrie Schwortz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Name that picture","post":"I emailed Annig Raley, who simply sent me a Google images search page of “agemian paintings” saying “This is the portrait of Christ which my father painted.
