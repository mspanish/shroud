[{"title":"Michael O’Brien’s portraits of Christ often a likeness to the Shroud of Turin","post":"That portrait certainly does resemble ancient icons, but it’s an improvement because the face is more gentle. Some of the ancient icons are really fascinating, but many of them are very intimidating. Or even angry and scary. In fact, I wonder why the Catholic Church used some of them at all, it’s shameful to portray Christ in such a bad mood, IMO.  \nBut this portrait is nice, I like it. The artist has a kind face, too. Looks like a sweet guy. He also wrote several books, including one on the dangers of Harry Potter.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2012 at 5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/09/michael-obriens-portraits-of-christ-often-a-likeness-to-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"art","id":"comment-8083","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Michael O’Brien’s portraits of Christ often a likeness to the Shroud of Turin","post":"The artists of old who painted icons usually fasted forty days before they began to paint…I wonder if this is the case anymore with modern iconography.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2012 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/09/michael-obriens-portraits-of-christ-often-a-likeness-to-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"art","id":"comment-8092","author":"john macgillivray","site":"shroudstory"}]
