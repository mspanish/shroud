Then there is this nice but far too short biography from the Miner Messenger, a publication of the alumni, friends, and parents of Bishop Manogue Catholic High School in Reno, Nevada. I wish I knew more. \nChapel Stained Glass Artists Have International Reputation\nBishop Manogue has been graced with the works of remarkable and\ninternationally famous artists, the sisters Isabel and Edith Piczek. Both sisters were born in Hungary. They were friends of Sister Ida, Foundress of the Sacred Heart Sisters who provided years of ministry in the Diocese of Reno. Isabel, our principal contact, won a national competition for painting at a very early age, and at thirteen she decorated her first church with stained\nglass. Young Isabel, a Catholic, got herself into religious conflict with the communist government of Hungary and had to flee her country, accompanied by Edith, her sister and colleague.\nAlmost immediately after her arrival in Rome, she won the International Grand Award for Painting and another competition to paint a 400 square foot fresco mural at the Vatican’s famous\nPontifical Biblical Institute. She spent three years in Rome. During this time she completed another 42 murals at the Precious Blood Monastery of Rome and elsewhere.\nShe also pursued her other interest, particle physics.\nLeaving Rome, Isabel came with her sister to the United Stated and with her she established her art studio, the Construction Art Center in Los Angeles. To date she has completed huge murals, mosaics, ceramic tile murals and stained glass windows for 493 churches and public buildings in seven countries on three continents.\nIn addition to her outstanding work in the Bishop Manogue chapel, some of Isabel’s major works can be found at the St. Thomas Aquinas Cathedral and Our Lady of Snows parishes in Reno;\nthe Guardian Angel Cathedral in Las Vegas; the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.; Holy Cross Mausoleum in Culver City, California; Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, California; and numerous other buildings in California, Rome, Canada, Illinois, New Mexico and elsewhere.\nMs. Piczek is also an internationally known expert on the Shroud of Turin. She has appeared many times on national television.\n\n","date":"October 12, 2013 at 11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-case-you-missed-isabel-piczeks-wonderful-paper/","cat":"art","id":"comment-47232","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In case you missed Isabel Piczek’s wonderful paper","post":"Something here:","date":"October 12, 2013 at 11:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-case-you-missed-isabel-piczeks-wonderful-paper/","cat":"art","id":"comment-47234","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In case you missed Isabel Piczek’s wonderful paper","post":"No, no, you misunderstand me.

Have you ever studied general relativity?\nI may disagree with some Piczeks claims in the article, but contrary to you, I don’t dispute her qualifications as a physicist (however I truly don’t know when and where she studied physics), based on layman’s misunderstanding of the term ‘event horizon’.\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 5:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-case-you-missed-isabel-piczeks-wonderful-paper/","cat":"art","id":"comment-47351","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In case you missed Isabel Piczek’s wonderful paper","post":"There is a philosophical sense in which the term “event horizon” could make sense without gravity being an essential part of it, but there is no scientific or mathematical model of one which could apply to a limited horizontal plane through a body suspended in midair. This is not physics, not even speculative physics. It requires nothing more than a vague idea that “nothing can go through an event horizon.” I studied general relativity as part of my degree and am certainly not a specialist, but I am sufficiently familiar with the concepts to be able to reject Piczek’s ideas unreservedly. I am also sufficiently familiar with the concepts to understand anything you may be able to say to explain how such an event horizon is possible.

The event horizon is the place beyond which observation can not be made but at the horizon there is very much to observe. Observation of the horizon is one way we know the black hole exists,\nFor example, let’s take either dawn or sunset. Before the sun rises we know its coming because the horizon lights up. At dusk, the sun disappears but the horizon remains visible and we know the sun was there.\nIt’s not a perfect analogy by far, but its observation of the effects of a black hole that tells us it’s there. That observation disappears at a point. It’s where it’s the point where the visual effects can no longer be observed that we reach an event horizon. It is not that there is no light in the black hole, it is that light can not escape the gravity of the black hole.\nAs I wrote on my blog concerning the death of my son Michael that death is the ultimate event horizon. See my original comment: http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2007_10_01_archive.html\nwhere I used “event horizon” as a metaphor for death and a second comment where I expand the thought  because of the work  of Stuart Hammeroff. http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2012_08_01_archive.html\nI have an disagreement with some who do not believe that the Resurrection is discoverable.\nIf a physical body processed to something else then it should not be surprising that there are artifacts of the body or the process that were left behind, \nThe image on the Shroud may be an  artifact  of the Resurrection. It is not the glorified body of St. Paul but rather it is the body as the last moment it could be seen. Because we can not see beyond that artifact, it is in at least in  metaphorical or symbolical sense an “event horizon.”\nThen again, as we used to sing in the heady days of Vatican II, “love makes symbols real.”\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-case-you-missed-isabel-piczeks-wonderful-paper/","cat":"art","id":"comment-47370","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"In case you missed Isabel Piczek’s wonderful paper","post":"I agree wholeheartedly with your re-write of my definition.
