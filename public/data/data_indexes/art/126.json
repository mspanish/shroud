[{"title":"The Film – I’m Not Jesus Mommy","post":"Dan;\nYour blog is cool. We researched the Shroud a lot before deciding to make this film. Of course it’s not likely (with current technology) to extract good DNA samples from the Shroud, but the potential is there, of course, to find DNA from any number of sources on the material itself… who knows what the future will bring.\nThe conflict of faith and religion have always been good “movie material” and this is no exception.\nThank you for noticing our labor of love.\nVaughn Juares\nDirector\n“I’m Not Jesus Mommy”\n\n","date":"May 2, 2011 at 11:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/27/the-film-im-not-jesus-mommy/","cat":"art","id":"comment-3068","author":"Vaughn Juares","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Film – I’m Not Jesus Mommy","post":"Comcast decided to remove I’m Not Jesus Mommy from their advertising lineup.

It was ok.  I think the concept is interesting, but it could have explained things a little better.  I would have enjoyed it more if the film delved deeper into what was going on in the world after the birth of the cloned boy.  It was an ok film, and I didn’t feel like I wasted my time watching it.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2012 at 4:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/27/the-film-im-not-jesus-mommy/","cat":"art","id":"comment-12941","author":"Cher","site":"shroudstory"}]
