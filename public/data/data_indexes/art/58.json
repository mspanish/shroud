[{"title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory","post":"There are a lot of people who claim they see coins, letters, flowers,…now hidden writings. When they explain it to you, it gives the impression that the coin/flower/writing is truly there……….\nHonestly, I don’t know what to think either in this case or in the others because we are far from having enough scientific evidences, but, as I have written in previous comments in this blog, in my opinion, this general issue could be one of the easiest to deal with. Perhaps, someone has already done it, ruled it out, and it is simply that I am not fully aware of all the scientific literature about the Shroud. However, using high resolution images, pixel values can feed rather simple mathematical tests of randomness and using Montecarlo/bootstrap techniques, 95% confidence levels decision intervals could be quite easily assessed. 95% confidence levels are widely accepted in scientific literature as enough to reach conclusions and could help in determining if what some claim they see is just noise or there really exists a discernible pattern.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 7:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","id":"comment-7851","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory","post":"I also see a lot of claims for things like flowers and writing that I personally don’t see when I look at the shroud or it’s photographic negative. I do see a lot of the details that some people point out, for example, teeth in the mouth. However, I am not quite sure if those teeth are actually teeth that are partially revealed in some way through what I perceive to be closed lips or just noise from the shroud itself. I have a hunch they’re noise but am open minded. I also do clearly see the hand bones but I am not sure why – did Jesus have very little body fat and his bones shown through his hands like I’ve seen with some older folks? That seems plausible to a degree even without knowing the probable mechanism of image creation. The abnormally long fingers on the right hand seems to be a distortion caused be the tenting effect of the left leg being raised. But as for flowers, words and secret symbols I am of the mind that if they are not as plain, visible and discernable as the image of the man himself they are probably just noise.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","id":"comment-7855","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory","post":"After reading previous comments on this matter I can’t help saying that I disagree with Gabriel when he asserted that «we are far from having scientific evidences».\nWhen it comes to the Shroud being a painting or not scientific evidences indeed point to it’s image not being a paintig as Dr. John Heller and Dr. Alan Adler concluded in several peer reviewd papers.\nThe question of the presence of flower images on the Shroud is still a matter of controversy even between sindonologists but their true existence remains a strong possibility.\nIf someone wants to get real scientific information about the Shroud one of the easiest ways to do it is searching the wonderful website of Dr. Barrie Schwortz http://www.shroud.com  scientific articles and papers or «google» Ohio Shroud Conference, http://www.shroudstory.com http://www.sindonology.org and so on.\nDon’t forget the Shroud of Turin is the most studied relic in the history of mankind\n                                  regards\n                              Maria da Glória\n                        Centro Português de Sindonologia\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 1:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","id":"comment-7864","author":"Maria da Glória Gonçalves Barroso","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory","post":"Maria, just to make clear my point, when I say that “we are far from having scientific evidences”, I refer exclusively to the coins/flowers/writings issue and not the Shroud itself.  In this matter -coins/flowers/writings-, to the best of my knowledege, all the claims are far from being widely accepted and remain controversial. In this aspect, apart from Danin, one of the few papers which have undergone a peer-review process and been published in a JCR journal is the one by Marion which I commented in this blog. Even so, his conclusions on the letters he found on the Shroud,  are widely dismissed and/or remain highly controversial.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 1:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","id":"comment-7865","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"}]
