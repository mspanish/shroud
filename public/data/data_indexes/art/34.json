[{"title":"Do Nobody Knows Nothing?","post":"Dan,  Not sure if this is the best place to write this but I am interested in developing a secondary presentation to be called “Secrets of the Shroud”.  In this presentation I want to cover many of the unique data points that are often left out of a general overview for time sake.

I would love to hear from your knowledgeable readers some of their thoughts on what to include.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2012 at 1:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/28/do-nobody-knows-nothing/","cat":"art","id":"comment-19619","author":"Russ Breault","site":"shroudstory"}]
