Our favourite pictures of him probably say more about us than about him. Sister Melannie’s comment that the average 1st century Semite was about 5ft-1in is I suspect a piece of questionable anthropogical folklore. I’m not sure that I know what your average New Zealander looks like – they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and nowadays in all sorts of colours. Maybe this was also true in Palestine of that time. \nYou can find a picture of the “Maori Jesus” in the stained glass window of St Faith’s Anglican church in Rotorua, a very old colonial era church. Jesus wears a feathered cloak, an emblem of particular honour:\nhttp://www.davidwallphoto.com/detail/22760-Maori-Jesus-on-Window,-St.-Faiths-Church,-Ohinemutu,-Rotorua,-North-Island,-New-Zealand.-Please-note-_-there-may-be-restrictions-on-the-use-of-this-image.html \nThe poet James K Baxter had his own version of the Maori Jesus:\n“I saw the Maori Jesus, Walking on Wellington Harbour He wore blue dungarees His beard and hair were long His breath smelt of mussels and paraoa When he smiled it looked like the dawn.” James K. Baxter\nI seem to recall the pictures of the “Sacred Heart” of my childhood had a Jesus with blue eyes.  The Japanese also have their own images of Jesus. Some comments in Sister Mellanie’s blog suggest that the actual appearance of what Jesus really looked like, doesn’t matter so much as do other more important aspects. Maybe some of us are too focused on appearances – part of the celebrity culture, I wonder?\n\n","date":"September 24, 2013 at 7:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/24/what-did-jesus-look-like-2/","cat":"art","id":"comment-45254","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"What did Jesus look like?","post":"I for 1  have only cared about the origins of JESUS. Simply because, most religions do. The image of Christ, is displayed prominently. I have no degree. I simply ask, could the shroud of Turin possibly just be that of an other unfortunate soul..  The date of the cloth seems to be the what everyone wants to know.  Was not JESUS for Nazareth crucified young?  Those stains look like an old man.\n\n","date":"December 31, 2013 at 6:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/24/what-did-jesus-look-like-2/","cat":"art","id":"comment-70452","author":"julie reid","site":"shroudstory"}]
