Possible reservations about extent that the blow-up may have been massaged by photo-editing.  Also agree with reservation that you see what you want to see.  Obvious craft limitations on making the original die for the coins.  However it has several of the Vignon markings. Two strands of hair have been stylized to inverted V.  Also V on bridge of nose, swollen cheeks, forked beard, three-sided “square” between brows, double-line on throat stylized as a collar (but also some other embellishment around throat area); Shiner on right eye, yes, but was this a coin or other metal object on eye after death? If modelled on Christ Pantocrator, or copy of Mandylion, persuasive evidence that Mandylion was indeed Shroud.\n\n","date":"February 6, 2012 at 5:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/06/another-justinian-this-one-circa-652/","cat":"art","id":"comment-8003","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Another Justinian, this one circa 652","post":"For a Byzantine coin representing Christ with a swelling cheek, an impressive example is from the reign of Constantine VII.

The letters fade in and out, which was either a problem with the original mold or the mold is getting old (over-used) or the person minting it was very sloppy.  So to make any attempt to derive such DETAILS or SIGNIFICANCE from such a sloppy coin is not a good idea in my opinion. \nI’m very very glad there are Shroud experts on this planet.
