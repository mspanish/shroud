How about a mug with a picture of the Shroud that turns into the “Real Face of Jesus” when you filled it with coffee and then as you drank it down, the face would revert to the Shroud. Now that would be kitsch. I’d love to send one to Richard Dawkins. (Along with a needle point or screen printed Shroud. Anyone tried that yet.)\n(By the way, Mugs that change pictures or illustrations when filled with hot coffee are not miraculous, they are here now.)\n\n","date":"July 13, 2012 at 7:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/13/mug-on-a-mug-arizona-artist-jephyr-selling-shroud-of-turin-mugs/","cat":"art","id":"comment-13808","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mug on a Mug: Arizona Artist Jephyr selling Shroud Of Turin Mugs","post":"That would be a cool effect.
