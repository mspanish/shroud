Everybody knows that Mary Magdalene after the crucifixion fled to France with her son who founded the Mergovian dynasty of French Kings. It’s all right there in “Holy Blood, Holy Grail.”\nSeriously though, we have an another “art historian” swallowing whole the carbon dating results. There are three different academic disciplines that must be integrated into any study of the Shroud: Science, History and Religion (Theology). Once you accept that fact that the Shroud is not a painting which as been scientifically demonstrated, art historians have a limited contribution to make to the discussion. The influence (or non-influence if you will) of the Shroud on art is one. See Thomas de Wesselow, “The Sign.”\nFor a skeptical analysis of the claims involved see http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/world/middleeast/findings-reignite-debate-on-claim-of-jesus-bones.html?_r=0  Holy DNA?!\nI am reminded of Watergate: Follow the money.

The NYT news item just serves to demonstrate that the geologist is clutching at straws, the money is not his, it came from those who are behind the agendas,who it seems also have funds to squander. The same also can be said about the Swiss millionaire whose identity was not revealed, for obvious reasons, and who was behind the “Jesus’ wife” fragment that Karen King, with her own agenda, was actively promoting. Good for Harvard, they were about to leap by publishing a report, then decided to look before leaping, and gave up the idea. It is now clear that the fragment of the papyrus was manufactured, is fraudulent, as maintained by me on this very blog right from the beginning, though it was defended by another commenter.\nProfessor Wolfgang Krumbein has contradicted himself. In the beginning he said the James ossuary was exposed to sunlight and environmental conditions for centuries. Later, he alleged that robbers had opened a hole in the Talpiot tomb and stolen  it, another one clutching at straws. Not even the owner, O.Golan,believes him, because he had already said, years ago,that it came from Silwan.\nThe claims about the patina came from Charles Pellegrino, however he did not publish a scientific paper because he is not an archaeologist and, I think, he does know that it will simply not sell. Patina can be manufactured, and the IAA returned the James ossuary to its owner, also making the statement that the second part of the inscription was a forgery, as I had always maintained, in fact published an article about it three months before the IAA statement. \nWe have to be very careful while reading news items about “findings” in the fields of biblical archaeology and biblical studies.\nTalpiot IV will be written shortly, meanwhile the rest of the story, for those who are interested:\n  https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III\n\n","date":"April 9, 2015 at 7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/09/art-scholars-on-scientific-evidence/","cat":"art","id":"comment-195835","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Art Scholars on Scientific Evidence","post":"It must also be noted that nothing is being said about the fact that geologist Aryeh Shimron is not an expert in limestone ossuaries,he knows about plaster. He says that an earthquake in the fourth century filled the tomb with soil, but how is it that it did not happen to another tomb, just twenty metres away? Not even O.Golan, the owner of the James ossuary, believes his story. He wants at least 300 tombs to be examined.\nAndrey Feuerverger, who worked on the statistics, was misled by the proponents of the so-called Jesus family tomb to interpret the inscription on one ossuary as identifying Mary Magdalene. He admitted that later and wisely wrote in his report that “any tampering with the tombsite and other possibilities for fraud” would have to be “weighed and taken into account.” He abandoned the topic completely after the sensationalism. The University of Chicago professor mentioned in the article (link) above is even wiser,\nPatina is also not considered to be a reliable indication, it can be manufactured. In an official report written years ago Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem District Archaeologist, wrote that the patina “inside the relatively deep letters is not the same as on the ossuary’s four sides and the decoration lines.”\nWhy?\nThere is more:\nShimron ignores a telltale incision, known by the best scholars. About this, Professor Kloner wrote:\n“each of the letters of the two words “brother of Jesus” are carved less deeply than those on the right side of the inscription.”\nNote: “brother of Jesus” is “Akhui d’Yeshua” in Aramaic, therefore Kloner says “two words”. the right side says “Yaakov bar Yehosef”, “James son of Joseph” in Aramaic.\nWhat does this mean? Two hands and two chisels — and two different periods.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2015 at 6:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/09/art-scholars-on-scientific-evidence/","cat":"art","id":"comment-195987","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Art Scholars on Scientific Evidence","post":"Further to the above,there is an interesting article entitled “The Master’s Tomb in Jerusalem: Apostolic Memory from the First Century” on the website of the Beth Immanuel Sabbath Fellowship, an Orthodox Messianic Jewish congregation in Hudson, Wisconsin.\nThe article mentions the inscription “In dumum Domini ibimus”, meaning “Let us go the house of the Lord”.

Are you saying that ISIS demands “global reconversion” to Islam or is it that reconversion to Christianity is necessary. I might ask “Which Christianity?” Christianity comes in many different flavors. To claim that there was once a global Christianity ignores much of Asia including of course China as well as sub-Saharan Africa.\nOn the other hand, the truly reformist and ecumenical spirit of Pope Francis embracing all who love whatever their particular religious flavor may very well be a wave of the future of the Church and Christianity. Christ may appear in many different guises for He is,  after all, “only” Love.\nThis is of particular relevance to me right now because last week my wife and I saw a revival of the “King and I.” I’ll spare you all my critique but one the most impressive parts of revival was a complex ballet based upon Uncle Tom’s Cabin. What struck me is how the authors transposed a Christian concept of Jesus to Buddha. \nI am not culturally attuned enough to judge whether this was a western affectation of the play or a justifiable insight.\nNonetheless, I believe that all who love are Christians becasue faith in love is all that counts.\n\n","date":"April 9, 2015 at 5:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/09/art-scholars-on-scientific-evidence/","cat":"art","id":"comment-195823","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Art Scholars on Scientific Evidence","post":"John K, my remarks were deliberately cryptic, and were a response to yet another example of comments made by a person who apparently earns his living from the achievements of a culture which has its origins in a Christian heritage, and yet turns his back on that heritage, showing no respect for it.  I see extremes of fanaticism, including ISIS as a form of Antichrist and I have noticed that whenever Christ is abandoned as we see in western culture today, it seems to make a place for Antichrist to step in.

Our tesseract was two cubes connected at each corner and it expressed to me the motion of the cube through time. Each cube was square but the 4th dimension connection was of course angled.
