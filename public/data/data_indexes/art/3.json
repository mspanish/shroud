Later, Saint Joanna, who was married to Herod’s steward,[4] secretly took his head and buried it on the Mount of Olives, where it remained hidden for centuries.\n    The First Finding occurred in the fourth century. \nThe property on the Mount of Olives where the head was buried eventually passed into the possession of a government official who became a monk with the name of Innocent. He built a church and a monastic cell there. When he started to dig the foundation, the vessel with the head of John the Baptist was uncovered, but fearful that the relic might be abused by unbelievers, he hid it again in the same place it had been found. Upon his death, the church fell into ruin and was destroyed.\n    The Second Finding occurred in the year 452. \nDuring the days of Constantine the Great, two monks on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem reportedly saw visions of John the Baptist, who revealed to them the location of his head. They uncovered the relic, placed it in a sack and proceeded home. Along the way, they encountered an unnamed potter and gave him the bag to carry, not telling him what it was. John the Baptist appeared to him and ordered him to flee from the careless and lazy monks, with what he held in his hands. He did so and took the head home with him. Before his death, he placed it in a container and gave it to his sister. After some time, a hieromonk by the name of Eustathius, an Arian, came into possession of it, using it to attract followers to his teaching. He buried the head in a cave, near Emesa. Eventually, a monastery was built at that place. In the year 452, St. John the Baptist appeared to Archimandrite Marcellus of this monastery and indicated where his head was hidden in a water jar buried in the earth. The relic was brought into the city of Emesa and was later transferred to Constantinople.\n    Third Finding of the Head of St. John the Baptist (May 25). \nThe head was transferred to Comana of Cappadocia during a period of Muslim raids (about 820), and it was hidden in the ground during a period of iconoclastic persecution. When the veneration of icons was restored in 850, Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople (847-857) saw in a vision the place where the head of St. John had been hidden. The patriarch communicated this to the emperor Michael III, who sent a delegation to Comana, where the head was found. Afterwards, the head was again transferred to Constantinople, and here on May 25, it was placed in a church at the court.\nJust a thought…\n\n","date":"July 8, 2014 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/08/a-long-cloth-mandylion/","cat":"art","id":"comment-136179","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Long Cloth Mandylion?","post":"A very intriguing counter theory, Colin.

So this time, wiki supports the Image of Edessa interpretation:\n“The first record of the existence of a physical image in the ancient city of  Edessa (now Urfa ) was in Evagrius Scholasticus writing about 593, who reports a portrait of Christ, of divine origin (θεότευκτος), which effected the miraculous aid in the defence of Edessa against the Persians in 544.”  \nThat would not prevent the Edessa image having been assumed in this artwork to have been one and the same as the still in vivo Veil of Veronica (as distinct from the Shroud). The image would certainly seem to be that of someone still living, though apparently lacking some Veil features we see elsewhere (crown thorns etc).\nConfusing, innit?\nForget what I said about it being John the Baptist. Influenced partly by Charles’s comment, my money’s on it being an Image of Edessa/Veil of Veronica hybrid.\n\n","date":"July 8, 2014 at 8:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/08/a-long-cloth-mandylion/","cat":"art","id":"comment-136226","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Long Cloth Mandylion?","post":"for some time I’ve been searching in vain for the “Venetian epitaphios”, apparently the oldest extant epitaphios, circa 1200 AD.\nI think I’ve found it.

If you look, for instance, at the side of Siena cathedral, completed 1261 you will see a similar patterning of dark and light stone. Note also the Gothic rose window in the illustration.
