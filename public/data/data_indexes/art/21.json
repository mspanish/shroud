It is a very interesting find. The skewed nose on that coin is, I believe, a representation of one interpretation of what can be perceived, on the Shroud, as a broken nose. And as pointed out by another comment from another commentator, It might also relate to the actual emperor who ordered this particular coin to be minted. It might also point to the presence of the Manoppello veil in Constantinople as has been hinted by Max Patrick Hamon. The idea that the nose is curved on the Shroud is not exactly correct. It appears curved since one side of the face is more prominent than the other. Drawing a straight line from the top of the nose to its tip shows a very slight curve, but so small that we could not describe this as curved. Also, it is important to remember that each time the Shroud was laid down to be photographed, the face was slightly shifted left and right, creating slight deviations across the face. You can see these deviations on the Enrie’s photo vs the Durante’s photo.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 12:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18203","author":"latendre","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"If the Shroud would have been known of the emperor at that time (during his first reign), it’s evident that he would never have allowed a different representation like the one he allowed during the second reign !

The solidus of Justinian II doesn’t show anything more than the Pantocrator image of Christ that look very Shroud-like simply because the Pantocrator images (which dates from at least 500 A.D. onwards) were most probably influenced in some way (direct or not) by the image on the Shroud.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 1:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18205","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"One last important comment to those who are tempted to defend at all cost the present hypothesis that makes a direct link between the nose from this very ancient Byzantine coin and the nose on the Shroud :  Be certain that this speculative assumption would NEVER stand for more than 2 seconds in a court room, simply because the characteristic of the nose of this ancient coin could well be due to a bunch of different things that have nothing to do with the image on the Shroud. Anyone is free to believe in this direct connection hypothesis, but at least, you should admit that this will never represent a winning case in a court room, just like Jackson’s supposed finding versus the co-called series of ancient folds on the cloth, because these kinds of hypotheses mainly rest on pretty wild assumptions that could be attacked by “cons-assumptions” and in a court room, that is never good.  No doubt that a good advocate can crush such wild assumptions very easily.  One thing’s for sure:  personally, that’s the way I judge if an hypothesis have good chances to be valid or not and I call this “the court room test”. Along with the honest use of the Occam’s razor principle, I think this is a very good test to separate what is good and what is bad.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 2:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18211","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"It should be here reminded  by both Matthias and Mario:\n1/- The true medical forensic fact IS the TS man’s nose  shows slight deviation of the tip of the nose.\n2- The true archaeological fact IS, in Late Antiquity and Byzantine time,  sculptors and engravers  did have the ability to turn 2D image into 3D model.\n\n","date":"October 23, 2012 at 6:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18088","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"Matthias’ negative speculation is here contradicted by numismatic, forensic and archeological facts.\n\n","date":"October 23, 2012 at 6:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18090","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"Max\nre: no.1 – perhaps a very slight deviation is observable on modern day photos, but to the naked eye in antiquity?

Then two broad lines continue outward from the neck.\nOne of the broad lines is an elongated upside down “Y” and the other broad line is straight.\nBoth broad lines continue to the shoulder and are obviously the artist’s rendition of Jesus’ hair.  \nOn the left side of the head (right looking at the image), the hair is wavy to the neck, and then there is a double broad line that falls to the shoulder.  All the broad lines on both sides of the head project outward from the shoulder, clearly indicating the broad lines are hair.  Therefore, on both sides of the head the hair is symmetrcal and falls to the shoulder.\nThe artist failed to include the Trinity (3) blood spot above the left eyebrow, evidenced on the negative of the Shroud image, just to the right of the nose.  The artist, as well, failed to include the blood intermingled with Jesus’ hair.  The blood “3” was obvious on the Shroud and  certainly would have been included on the coin, if the Shroud image was used as the model. I don’t believe it was.\nThe nose on the Edessa cloth (King Abgar) does not look as straight as the nose on the Shroud image, and the hair on the Edessa cloth is shorter on the left side of the head.\nOne thing amazes me though.  If Jesus rubbed his face on the Edessa cloth and gave it to King Abgar for healing, then why would the Edessa cloth have the blood “3” at the forehead and also the blood spots intermingled through Jesus’ hair?  This blood should not have been on the Edessa cloth, as Jesus was alive when he sent the cloth to King Abgar for healing.\nWith that in mind, the “Edessa Cloth,” (King Abgar) had to be pressed to Jesus’ face, either after his death or on the road to the cross; otherwise there would be no visible blood on the  Edessa cloth image.  And there does appear to be the blood “3” above the left eyebrow on the Edessa cloth and a few blood spots in the hair.\nThere must be another cloth, still not found, that would have been used for King Abgar’s healing and this must be the cloth used as a model for the coin.  When Jesus pressed his face to the cloth, the nose would have been distorted on the cloth as pushed to the side or not straight, and there is no blood on this image, as well.\nJust my opinion!\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 12:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18164","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"Angel, your interpretation of the coin lines may be incorrect, both sides do not run down passed the shoulders.

Several ancient interpretations have mentioned the image seemed as though created from the secretion of bodily fluid or sweat, so put two and two together and it is not hard to understand the writers intentions. But seriously which Edessa image has ever shown blood? Can you please link us to this image?…thanks.\nR\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18179","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"Ron, I saw two images of the Edessa cloth on google images yesterday.

It is a very interesting find. The skewed nose on that coin is, I believe, a representation of one interpretation of what can be perceived, on the Shroud, as a broken nose. And as pointed out by another comment from another commentator, It might also relate to the actual emperor who ordered this particular coin to be minted. It might also point to the presence of the Manoppello veil in Constantinople as has been hinted by Max Patrick Hamon. The idea that the nose is curved on the Shroud is not exactly correct. It appears curved since one side of the face is more prominent than the other. Drawing a straight line from the top of the nose to its tip shows a very slight curve, but so small that we could not describe this as curved. Also, it is important to remember that each time the Shroud was laid down to be photographed, the face was slightly shifted left and right, creating slight deviations across the face. You can see these deviations on the Enrie’s photo vs the Durante’s photo.\nThe skewed nose may also simply be impact damage delivered to the coin at some point!\nR\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 2:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","id":"comment-18215","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?","post":"Wow Ron !

The coin curvature is extreme, comparitively. The overlay shown in your post with the Shroud and veil is not clear at all really. If you would look closely at the coin above, there are signs of impact, or ‘possible’ impact. For instance a slight ridge on the right side of the curve and look close at the very tip of the nose, …possible damage in the form of impact flaking? These were not flat coins, they were pseudo-3 dimensional and would have raised areas, the noise dominating most likely. So not completely out of the question that this exaggerated bend in the nose could be due to damage.\nI also don’t see three strands of hair on the coin.

The clothes line runs horizontally and is a squiggly line that extends across the front to the left shoulder.  Where the horizontal line meets the left shoulder there is an arched broad line and adjacent to the broad line is a smaller arched line.  This, to my mind, would be the clothing and this would be the case if there was no veil over the head of Jesus.\nYet, if Jesus was wearing a veil over his hair, then this may account for what Ron sees as clothing, and this may be correct, as well.
