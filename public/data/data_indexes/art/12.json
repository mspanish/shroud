[{"title":"Is Giovanni Battista della Rovere Depiction Accurate?","post":"Dan, thanks again for the free plugs. The quote from Wilson is:\n“Exactly as in the case of the seventeenth-century G. B. della Rovere aquatint depicting how the Shroud’s image was formed, we can see how the Byzantine artist-embroiderer had depicted the lance-wound correctly on the mirror- reverse side to that in which it appears on the Shroud proper, but has forgotten that the same rule must also apply to the crossing of the hands.” (Wilson, I., “The Blood and the Shroud,” Simon & Schuster: New York NY, 1998, p.137) \nYou can verify it for yourself. Click on the image of della Rovere’s aquatint above to enlarge it. Note that in the copy of the Shroud held by angels, the spear wound bloodstain is on the opposite side of the uppermost hand. \nBut on the Shroud itself the spear wound is in Jesus’ right side. You and your readers can verify this for yourselves by printing out a copy of the positive image of the Shroud, e.g. from ShroudScope‘s Durante 2002 Vertical (not the Enrie black and white negative photograph). Hold the printed out Shroud copy in front of you and imagine it is laid over your body, as it would have been laid over Jesus’ body. You will note that the spear in the side bloodstain is on your right side. And it is your left hand which is over your right hand.\nStephen E.
