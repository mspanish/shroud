[{"title":"Ariel Agemian’s Christ Painting based on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Yes, I love that blog page. There are some very beautiful religious works there. The little girl with her prayer book is precious: it looks like a photo. \nI don’t think I’ve seen Ariel Agemian’s Christ from the Shroud, before. Or if I did, the JPG wasn’t very good quality. I do think he nailed it… I’m somewhat artistic myself so I can almost visualize the face of Christ by looking at photos of the shroud. Not that I could paint it, I don’t think I could. But I can “see” it, and his painting is very remarkable, IMO. \nThank you for posting that. Whenever I googled for Ariel Agemian’s painting, all I ever got was images of the Shroud itself. So I’m very glad to see some of Agemian’s work.\n\n","date":"December 11, 2011 at 6:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/11/ariel-agemians-christ-painting-based-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"art","id":"comment-5433","author":"AnnieCee","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ariel Agemian’s Christ Painting based on the Shroud of Turin","post":"From my perspective, this depiction of Jesus is the more awesome ever made.  This artist was surely a great spiritual person because he has been able to capture the mix of devine and human nature of Jesus-Christ.  The eyes are particularly striking !  I have this portrait in my room and, like the Shroud, I can say that it is a fine help for my meditation…  And because this portrait come directly from the Shroud, for me, it is even more precious !  A  real spiritual masterpiece, no less.\n\n","date":"December 11, 2011 at 5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/11/ariel-agemians-christ-painting-based-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"art","id":"comment-5443","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Ariel Agemian’s Christ Painting based on the Shroud of Turin","post":"I am so pleased to read your posts!
