[{"title":"Stephen Jones is on a roll knocking down Charles Freeman on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Dan\nSorry, but I was wrong about Freeman not getting the title right. A commenter said he had a copy of Wilson’s book with that title, “The Shroud, Fresh Light on the 2000-year-old Mystery,” even though Google, Amazon.com, ABE and Bookfinder did not list it. \nSo I had deleted all references in my post to Freeman not getting the title right, several hours ago. \nCould you please change your post to reflect what my post now says? Thanks. \nStephen.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2012 at 4:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/08/stephen-jones-is-on-a-roll-knocking-down-charles-freeman-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"art","id":"comment-14606","author":"Stephen E.
