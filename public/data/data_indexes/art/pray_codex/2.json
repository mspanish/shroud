I will certainly consider that. But I will do my Wikipedia update first and see what reaction there is to it. >Seems there is alot of misinformation on Wiki and alot of young folk seem to use Wiki as their prime source of info nowadays. Agreed. But Wikipedia is usually OK for most things. As I said in my post above, Wikipedia's strength is its weakness: anyone can edit it. That means that an anonymous someone who has read little or no books in the Shroud but who relies on what he/she reads on the Internet, can edit a Wikipedia article on the Shroud, and it sounds authoritative to members of the public, including young people, who don't know any better.>Anyways a couple of points to the Pray Manuscript drawing at the top of this page; 1. I tend to believe there is actually a second cloth represented in the bottom image, which extends beyond the Shroud slightly towards the Alpha symbol.Yes there undoubtedly is a cloth arising out of the midst of the Shroud. But it is difficult to interpret. The upper Shroud border is visible through it, and the Xs on the Shroud continue across it, so presumably it is not intended to be a physical cloth but a symbol of the grave clothes that the angel is pointing to as evidence that Jesus was not there and had risen. This is supported by the face of the Shroud in profile, in a line with it and the letter, which could be an alpha. I must remember that the artist was not probably not an expert on the Shroud, nor in 1st century Jewish burial practices, but simply drew what he saw on the Shroud before him and added information to better tell the Gospels' story of Jesus' burial and resurrection. As I mentioned in a previous comment, there is no Biblical reason for the artist not to depict other cloths, because in four places (Lk 24:12; Jn 19:40; 20:5,6,7) the Gospels mention that \"linen cloths\" were left behind in the empty tomb after Jesus' resurrection, without stating what they were.>I have not come to a conclusion of whether it is depicting the face cloth or 'more likely' the strips which would have been used to bind the Shroud around the body.Thanks for the insight! The `bar' across the head opening, which I had been puzzling over (and had just said a quick prayer to the One whose image is on the Shroud to help me understand what it is!) was probably meant to symbolise the chin-band, which was used in 1st century Jewish to keep the jaw from opening. And which many sindonologists thought was meant by the \"napkin\" [Gk. soudarion] in John 20:7 (KJV):\"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\"But since the discovery of the Sudarium of Oviedo, most now think that the soudarion was that, and the chin-band was among the \"linen strips\" [Gk. keira] used in 1st century Jewish burials to bind the hands, feet and jaw in place, and mentioned in the account of Lazarus' raising from the dead in John 11:44 (ESV):\"The man [Lazarus] who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips [Gk. keira], and his face wrapped with a cloth [Gk. soudarion]. Jesus said to them, `Unbind him, and let him go.'\"[continued]\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"May 29, 2012 at 8:25 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/05/my-critique-of-pray-codex-wikipedia-1.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nMy critique of \"The Pray Codex,\" Wikipedia, 1 May 2011\n","post":"\n\n[continued]>I also think the face image cloth hanging from the ladies arm is depicting more likely the Sudarium...your thoughts? No. For one simple reason an artist in 12th century Hungary (and indeed anyone in Constantinople at the time) would be unlikely to know what the \"Sudarium\" (later called \"of Oviedo\") was. It was in Spain since at least the 9th century and took an entirely different route from the Shroud via Africa getting to Spain:\"According to this history, the sudarium was in Palestine until shortly before the year 614, when Jerusalem was attacked and conquered by Chosroes II, who was king of Persia from 590 to 628. It was taken away to avoid destruction in the invasion, first to Alexandria by the presbyter Philip, then across the north of Africa when Chosroes conquered Alexandria in 616. The sudarium entered Spain at Cartagena, along with people who were fleeing from the Persians. The bishop of Ecija, Fulgentius, welcomed the refugees and the relics, and surrendered the chest, or ark, to Leandro, bishop of Seville. He took it to Seville, where it spent some years. \" (Guscin, M., \"The Sudarium of Oviedo: Its History and Relationship to the Shroud of Turin,\" 1997)So I interpret the face in profile behind Mary Magdalene's right arm as the artist's way of depicting Jesus having risen. His depiction of Jesus' image on the Shroud is the upper Entombment scene.Remember that Byzantine and medieval artists did not depict Jesus as dead, but living and reigning. So they used the Shroud as a basis for their Christ Pantocrator (\"Christ All-ruling\" icons), and converted bloodstains on the Shroud into locks of hair, and red crosses (as you say below) etc, on their icons.>Secondly; I believe the image which many mistake for the sephulchre is actually the Shroud, with all the red x's as it also depicts the holes of the burn marks and I think the red is to imply blood on the inside of the cloth....Anyways, just a couple of thoughts.Agreed. I have just received de Wesselow's book, and, as an art historian, he has useful things to say about the Pray Manuscript. He also agrees that the red crosses and `poker holes' are meant to be on the Shroud. He maintains the Hungarian artist saw the Shroud in Constantinople, and says there were close connections between Hungary and Constantinople in the 12th century. De Wesselow also suggests that the reason the artist did not depict the Shroud itself was because at the time artists were not permitted to do that (presumably because that then would be a second Shroud). While I regard de Wesselow's theory that Jesus' resurrection was the image on the Shroud as absurd, and against all the New Testament evidence, nevertheless, his agnostic art historian support for the Shroud being authentic will be immensely valuable to the Shroud pro-authenticity cause. I will use what de Wesselow's says about the Pray Manuscript in my Wikipedia update.The Joe Nickell's of this world will find it more difficult to peddle their lies that those who believe the Shroud is authentic are all crazy Christian religious fanatics (I actually heard Nickell say words to this effect in a Coast-to-Coast radio debate with Barrie Schwortz).Stephen E.

Agreed. Some of the limitations of the Pray Manuscript's depictions of the Shroud are: 1) the PM it is not a photograph, but a work of medieval Christian art; 2) the codex itself is only 235 x 150 mm (Berkovits, 1969, p.103), so the artist had to fit a lot in a small space; 3) the artist worked only in ink and used only three colours-red, blue and black; 4) he may not have understood much about the Shroud itself, and 1st century Jewish burials, as we understand them today; 5) he may have not been a great artist (de Wesselow thinks he \"was not particularly skilful\") and may have made mistakes (e.g. did not exactly  depict the `poker holes'-assuming he even intended to do that-he may have intended to symbolically depict them all by two compound patters); and 6) he may have been under what de Wesselow calls \"a code of secrecy\" which restricted what he could depict, e.g. he could not copy the Shroud itself, presumably because that would become a `second Shroud' and an object of veneration in itself-as later Shroud copies became.Although surprisingly, and thankfully, the artist was allowed to depict Jesus nude, albeit modestly by placing both His arms and hands over His pelvic area. In plate II which depicts Jesus being taken down from the Cross, He is also nude but because His hands could not reasonably cover His genitals, the artist has Jesus wearing a girdle. Personally I think the PM's artist was very skilfull and managed to fit in a lot of meaning, within the limits he faced.>But the two most compelling factors remain:1. The position of the nude Jesus in the artwork, strikingly similar to the image of Christ on the shroudYes. And art historian de Wesselow confirms that only the Pray Manuscript and the Shroud (and of course later post-1350 copies of the Shroud) show Jesus totally nude, his frontal modesty only being preserved by His hands crossed over His pelvic area.While not shown on the PM, the dorsal side of the Shroud, showing Jesus' totally nude, with nothing to preserve His modesty, is even more inexplicable, unless the Shroud image really is a \"snapshot of the resurrection\":\"Even from the limited available information, a hypothetical glimpse of the power operating at the moment of creation of the Shroud's image may be ventured. In the darkness of the Jerusalem tomb the dead body of Jesus lay, unwashed, covered in blood, on a stone slab. Suddenly, there is a burst of mysterious power from it. In that instant the blood dematerializes, dissolved perhaps by the flash, while its image and that of the body becomes indelibly fused onto the cloth, preserving for posterity a literal `snapshot' of the Resurrection.\" (Wilson, I., \"The Shroud of Turin,\" 1979, p.251).De Wesselow also confirms my point in my previous comment that the artist has depicted the Shroud symbolically (being not permitted to depict it literally).>2. The herringbone bone weave-like pattern at the bottom of the image, with the 4 poker holes in the L shape.I have just realised that on the Pray Manuscript there are 5 L-shaped circles, not 4 as I had been writing. So I am going to call them the 5 L-shaped and 5 P-shaped circles/`poker holes'.>Any notion that these holes are some kind of pattern or motif without any connection to the poker holes on the shroud is illogical. A decorative pattern comprising the circles would surely have been in a symmetrical pattern, rather than the asymmetrical pattern of the 4 L shaped poker hole alignment.Agreed. If the sets of L-shaped and P-shaped circles were a decorative pattern, they would have been repeated together across the whole Shroud depiction. They clearly are meant to represent the `poker holes' on certain parts only on the herringbone weave of the Shroud.Stephen E.

But the artist could have depicted both it and a heavier beard if he had wanted to. He was able to depict the beard and moustaches of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus.

De Wesselow points out that on Jesus' left hand, in the upper \"The Entombment\" (which he calls \"The Anointing\") scene, the thumb should be clearly visible (because we are looking directly at the thumb side of Jesus crossed left hand).This is inexplicable unless the PM artist was faithfully depicting Jesus' hands on the Shroud, which also have no thumbs visible (due to the thumb being retracted into the palm when the median nerve is damaged by a crucifixion nail).This was one of the items of anatomical accuracy on the Shroud image which made surgeon Pierre Barbet ask, \"Could a forger have imagined this?\":\"But these experiments had yet another surprise in store for me. I have stressed the point that I was operating on hands which still had life in them immediately after the amputation of the arm. Now, I observed on the first occasion, and regularly from then onwards, that at the moment when the nail went through the soft anterior parts, the palm being upwards, the thumb would bend sharply and would be exactly facing the palm by the contraction of the thenar muscles, while the four fingers bent very slightly; this was probably caused by the reflex mechanical stimulation of the long flexor tendons. Now, dissections have revealed to me that the trunk of the median nerve is always seriously injured by the nail; it is divided into sections, being broken sometimes halfway and sometimes two-thirds of the way across, according to the case. And the motor nerves of the oponens muscles and of the short flexor muscle of the thumb branches at this level off the median nerve. The contraction of these thenar muscles, which were still living like their motor nerve, could be easily explained by the mechanical stimulation of the median nerve. Christ must then have agonised and died and have become fixed in the cadaverous rigidity, with the thumbs bent inwards into His palms. And that is why, on the shroud, the two hands when seen from behind only show four fingers, and why the two thumbs are hidden in the palms. Could a forger have imagined this? Would he have dared to portray it? Indeed, so true is this that many ancient copyists of the shroud have added the thumbs; in the same way they have separated the feet and shown their forward faces with two nail holes; but none of this is to be seen on the shroud. (Barbet, P., \"A Doctor at Calvary,\" 1963, pp.118-119. Emphasis original).And even in the unlikely event that a medieval forger could have imagined it, he wouldn't have depicted it because his contemporaries would not understand why he did it, and so would consider it a flaw.Which is the another reason why the Pray Manuscript's \"The Entombment\" (Plate III) scene is based on the Shroud. Significantly in the same artist's \"The Deposition\" (Plate II) and \"Christ Enthroned\" (Plate IV), where he is not depicting the Shroud, he shows Jesus with thumbs!Stephen E.

This actually is a Vignon Marking, the only one found on the PM, which is evidence that the Shroud was not copied from the PM. There also appear to be crown of thorns bloodstains in the PM Jesus' hair, corresponding with some on the Shroud. It is these positive unique similarities between the PM and the Shroud which are of far greater significance than negative minor differences like the PM having no moustache, which can simply be accounted for by human error.\"Stephen E.

As I say in my policies statement, \"Internet debates were [are] largely a waste of time\":-----------------------------------Debates After over a decade (1994-2005) debating Creation/Evolution/Design on Internet discussion groups, I concluded that Internet debates were largely a waste of time, so I ceased debating and started blogging.-----------------------------------One of the major problems of Internet debates is the `empty vessels which make the most noise' syndrome of those who have done the least study of a topic, are the most frequent and confident posters on that topic.Personally I think you give too much `oxygen' to those `empty vessels which make the most noise' on your blog. They tend to drive away all but the most hardcore debaters on it. That's why I have a limit of usually one or two comments on my blog, to deter them, and it works. They don't want to comment unless they can effectively take over my blog's comments with their noise.You might want to ask those commenters on your blog who deny that the Pray Manuscript was copied from the Shroud, to state:1) \"What evidence would convince you that the Pray Manuscript was copied from the Shroud?\"; and 2) \"What evidence would convince you that the Shroud of Turin is authentic?\"If they answer by setting such a high bar that it would be effectively impossible to provide that evidence, then their position really is:1) \"Nothing would convince me that the Pray Manuscript was copied from the Shroud\"; and2) \"Nothing would convince me that the Shroud of Turin is authentic.\"In which case why bother debating them? One might as well debate a brick wall.[continued]\n\n","author":"Stephen E Jones","date":"June 3, 2012 at 10:49 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/05/my-critique-of-pray-codex-wikipedia-1.html","site":"moore"},{"title":"\nMy critique of \"The Pray Codex,\" Wikipedia, 1 May 2011\n","post":"\n\n[continued]In most things it would not matter if they disobeyed this principle of \"follow the evidence wherever it leads.\" But because Christianity is true, and the Shroud is authentic, those who know the evidence for the Shroud's authenticity but refuse to accept will (if they don't repent before it is too late) have to give an account to Him whose image is on the Shroud, who will be their \"judge on the Last Day\":\"For ... that face ... bespeaks the very same questions as those that wracked the pilgrims to the Veronica: `Were those the lips that spoke the Sermon on the Mount and the Parable of the Rich Fool?'; `Is this the Face that is to be my judge on the Last Day?'\" (Wilson, I., \"Holy Faces, Secret Places,\" 1991, p.189).And Jesus made it clear that the severest punishment was reserved for those who had received the most light, but chose to deny it:Mt 11:20-24. 20Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. 21\"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. 23And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 24But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.\"The choice is theirs!Stephen E.

This morning I reposted my comment in response to your post \"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process? What if it was not?\" which mentioned me by name, to your Shroud of Turin blog and again it did not appear.I then posted a short test message, with no hyperlinks in it (in case that was the problem), and again it did not appear.So unless you advise me to the contrary, I assume that you have blocked me from making comments to your blog. If so, I would be surprised and disappointed, because, as can be seen in my copy of it above, there was nothing objectionable about it, except that I respectfully disagreed with you on some (not all) things in your post.But if you have blocked me from making comments to your blog, then that is your privilege, and I will confine my comments to this my own The Shroud of Turin blog.Regards.Stephen E.

I acknowledge that this my comment appeared on Dan's blog shows that I am no longer blocked from posting to it.   -----------------------------------DanI am surprised and disappointed you made a separate blog post out of an exchange of comments we had on my blog, under my post, \"My critique of \"The Pray Codex,\" Wikipedia, 1 May 2011\". You did not ask my permission, and your post amounts to an attack on me. I find that unethical, and I have never, and would never, write a separate blog post attacking you, or any of my fellow Shroud pro-authenticists. You also imply falsely that my \"empty vessels [who] make the most noise refers to \"my [your] readers\" generally, when in the context it clearly did not. I made it clear I was only referring to \"those who have done the least study of a topic\" (the Shroud) but \"are the most frequent and confident posters on that topic,\" and who \"tend to drive away all but the most hardcore debaters on it\" [your blog]. You claim you did not block me from posting to your blog, but the facts are:1. On 8 February this year my comments to your blog ceased to appear, immediately after I respectfully disagreed with you. I tried reposting my comments and even sent a plain text test message but they did not appear.2. I mentioned under a comment you had made on my blog the same day, 8 February, that my comments were not appearing on your blog. I repeated my comment to this effect late that same day and again the next day, but there never was a response from you.3. I find it strange that you never checked to see what my response to your comment on my blog was, in which case you would have seen my comments to you that my comments to your blog were not appearing. Were you not interested to read what my response to your comment was? And did you not notice that I had stopped commenting on your blog? 4. I also find strange your comment today that: \"If something went wrong I apologize. If I made a mistake, perhaps, I apologize. There is no intent to block your comments, ever.\" But as I commented back, \"Your `If I made a mistake, perhaps, I apologize' seems strange. If you did not block my comments to your blog, then there would be no reason for you to apologize.\"Quite frankly Dan, for the above reasons, I find it hard to believe that you did not block me, especially now after your hostile post against me.But as I said in my last comment today to you on my blog, \"it was a blessing in disguise that I was unable to comment on your blog, because I have saved a lot of time from not having to respond to those commenters on your blog who seem to take no notice of what I, or anyone else writes, anyway. So I still do not intend to resume commenting on your blog ...\"And now after what I can only regard as your above unprovoked hostile post against me, Dan, I certainly will not resume commenting on your blog!Stephen E.
