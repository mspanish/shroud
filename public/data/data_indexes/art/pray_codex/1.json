OK has demonstrated, quite succesfully, that the Pray manuscript is probably unique in many ways; he has not in any way demonstrated that it is derived from the Shroud. Speculations such as the probability of finding wavy lines, or zigzag patterns, or even patterns of dots, mean absolutely nothing unless he can demonstrate that these must indicate some sort of relationship with the Shroud, which, as the previous blog and comments have shown, is far from accepted. Even the nudity, crossed hands and four fingers, which really are present on the Shroud, are not necessarily derived from it.\nAs usual, he does not see the importance of a control. Let’s take the Giovanni Battista della Rovere painting as a comparison. Below the section of the angels holding the Shroud, we have a section showing the Shroud actually being laid on Jesus.\n1) The Shroud shows a naked man, the Rovere shows a man with a loin cloth.\n2) The Shroud shows a man with feet crossed, the Rovere shows them straight.\n3) The Shroud shows each hand with four fingers, the Rovere shows five.\n4) The Shroud legs are covered in scourge marks, the Rovere has none.\n5) The Shroud arms are covered in rivulets of blood, the Rovere arms are not.\nWhat are the chances that a painting of the dead Jesus which is “wrong” in all these respects owes anything to the Shroud? Astromomically unlikely, I think anyone would agree. And yet there is a painting of the Shroud on the very same canvas!\nAn attempt to list the similarities between the Pray manuscript man and the Shroud is not worthwhile unless a similar attempt is made to list the differences.\n1) The Shroud man lay on one end of the cloth, the Pray manuscript has the man in the centre.\n2) The Shroud man has a big beard, the Pray manuscript man does not.\n3) The Shroud clearly shows wounds, the Pray manuscript man none.\nAnd the similarities the Pray manuscript picture has to similar “Three Marys” scenes.\n1) What proportion of Three Mary’s scenes show a box-like tomb?\n2) What proportion of Three Mary’s scenes show an angel sitting on an angular slab?\n3) What proportion of Three Mary’s scenes show a crumpled Shroud?\nIf you see a Three Mary’s scene containing all these elements, what is the chance that in fact none of them correspond to their conventional significance – that the box is not a box but the bottom of a sheet, that the slab is not a slab but the top of the same sheet, and that the crumpled shroud is a repetition of that same sheet, with wavy lines to represent blood?\nChesterbelloc says something interesting: “I don’t know how anyone couldn’t at least wonder about these things, instead of dismissing them out of hand.” Well neither do I. I have wondered, tracked down endless versions of the Three Marys, and attempted to explain the anomalies without trying to hide them or explain them away. I have considered the possible significance of the zigzag pattern, the polystaurion pattern, the line of diagonal crosses and the little holes on the top surface. I have wondered about the design of the shroud crumpled on top, the sharp horizontal line that apears to slice it in two, the little Xs that appear all over it and the wiggly lines at the bottom. I have wondered why the figure of Christ is so unconventionally stubble-bearded and why the shroud he is lying on has a little pleat under his buttocks. Most of these wonders I have commented upon on this very website.\nMay I rephrase Chesterbelloc’s comment: “I don’t know how anyone couldn’t at least wonder about these things, instead of instantly accepting them without reserve.”\n\n","date":"June 21, 2014 at 11:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-132097","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Hugh, at last.\nLong post, showing that you still don’t understands the reasoning.

Earlier versions’ tombs are always depicted as buildings of some kind, and the angel is usually sitting on a stone outside.

There are a few paintings which show both the vertical building and the horizontal sarcophagus, but not many. The angel is usually sitting or standing on or posed by a very oddly angled slab, which I think is artistically and culturally derived from the stone he sat on in the earlier versions. Very rarely, but occasionally, there are angels actually sitting or standing in the sarcophagus.\nPossibly the key to the odd stone is in the word “revolvere” which is now almost universally translated as “roll.” In fact, any kind of stone that could be rolled is extremely rare in these medieval representations. The big mill-wheel thing that we have become used to is virtually unknown. It would perhaps be better to think of it as meaning “turn away” (there is certainly a turning element to it), which might account for stones swivelled horizontally across the tomb, which occurs quite often, or hinged upwards on end, which also occurs, or just twisted into any weird angle, which is common too.\n\n","date":"June 22, 2014 at 5:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-132265","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Wondering if Russ Breault could respond – one of his slides from his Shroud Encounter very clearly shows this herringbone pattern.

Matthew, despite his reliance on Mark, only has two women, but also has one angel.  Luke is indefinite about the number of women, but has two angels, one at the head and one at the feet, and which de Wesselow wants to interpret as the Shroud image.  John only has Mary of Magdala who arrives before dawn, but then summons two apostles Peter and another, probably John.   Problem is that none of the synoptics mentions the burial cloths, only John, who has the linen cloths lying on the ground and the head cloth rolled up separately.  \nNevertheless, despite Mark’s silence on cloths, the angel in the illustration is definitely pointing towards some cloths.  So it might be an amalgam of both Mark and John, or just a free interpretation of scripture.  Note that the top edge of the oblique rectangle is still visible underneath these cloths, so that they look more like bandages than a full shroud, although the underlying zigzag pattern does not appear here.  Also, for some reason, possibly a slip-up by the artist or not, the top edge of this rectangle is out of line with its left-most extension.  Might we construe that a fold is implied. Just to the left of the bandages the area is marked by + marks, and then the zigzag pattern is resumed but reversed. Also note that along the rectangle, the zigzag pattern is reversed at least twice.  The area marked by + marks would seem to indicate more cloth. \nIf the ‘imageshack’ original is checked (see O.K. comment 5.22pm) then the underlying slab is fully visible.  Its bottom edge is quite straight as can be checked with a ruler.  The oblique rectangle does not pass this test, both long edges clearly have a wave, and as I’ve noted, the top edge is discontinuous.  It may indicate a certain cloth with a reversing zigzag pattern.   \nThere are several patterns of small circles on the lower drawing only: a) on the underlying slab; b) on the angel’s belt and on his wings c) on the centre woman’s collar; d) and of course those arranged as an L shape on the oblique rectangle.  Nearly all of the hands show a thumb. It is only on the Christ figure where both thumbs are not visible.  \nI find O.K’s calculation of probabilities far too arbitrary, and it’s not Bayesian statistics.  It is in the accumulation of shroud-like features that must persuade that the artist knows something of the Shroud.  Any suggestion of Egyptian pyramids is utterly out of context of the Codex Pray, essentially an orthodox christian psalter and pyramids are irrelevant. \nRegardless of agreement on this detail or that, the evidence mounts up that as early as 1195, even some unknown Hungarian monk knew something of the Shroud and the features unique to it.  The Shroud is not the subject of his picture, and it would be a distraction to figure it in what is after all a simple representation of his subject, a Lamentation at the Christ laid out in death, and the wonder of the Holy women at his implied resurrection.  He was not setting out to convince any 21st century skeptic of the authenticity of a relic, but to provide a simple meditation icon for his contemporary monks.  Nevertheless he was able to draw on certain resources that he and his brethren evidently knew about, which was enough to provide robust discussion some 800 years after he had inscribed it.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2014 at 10:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-132212","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Daveb as previously outlined I believe the crosses represent the shroud image.

Reflections of an arrogant and aloof English historian.\n   The idea that the Shroud can be seen in the Pray Codex has always seemed to me absurd as the Shroud is not highlighted, there no sign of the distinctive two images and Christ is shown without bleeding wounds as he is laid out making it impossible for him to transfer blood to the shroud in which he was wrapped.  The pose of Jesus reflected ordinary burials and was increasingly common in art at this time so no surprises here. Again a decorated tomb lid is hardly unique (see below). Perhaps if I stood far off and took my glasses off I could see a similarity between the stepped pyramid  and a herringbone pattern, but close up, as the illustrator would have been working, this link is clearly impossible to make.\nSe we need to explain a stone or marble coffin lid with circular holes in it. The answer comes from Jerusalem. The tomb of the Holy Sepulchre was originally left as a rock tomb  and in Byzantine representations of the entombment or Resurrection it was always shown like this.  However in the first half of the tenth century, the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII covered the tomb with a marble slab but in order for pilgrims to see into it to the original rock he drilled three circular holes, or oculi. From the tenth century in the west , and only in the west, we find artists copying the marble lid and representing the scenes of the Resurrection with a sarcophagus with a lid. In 1099 the Crusaders captured Jerusalem and between then and 1187 it was open to western pilgrims as well as the original crusaders. In the twelfth century the marble lid was increasingly shown with the oculi, two, three or four. William Forsyth gives four  examples from the twelfth century e.g. before or at the same time as the Pray Codex. They are on a capital in the cathedral of Modena, on a relief  at Monte San Angelo (in Foggio, Italy), on a lintel on the south portal of the west façade of Saint Gilles at Arles and on a capital on a portal in Chartres Cathedral. (He goes on to give later ones as well.)\nAs he puts it ( P. 9 of his book on Entombment Sculptures):  ‘ These oculi were known and copied in the west. The association with Christ’s tomb lead to their being placed on the front face of the sarcophagus, the western equivalent of the tomb bench. In some French fourteenth century ivories there holes become elaborately decorated motifs resembling rose windows.’ So when we see a coffin lid with circular holes in it, I think the inspiration for these is clear.\nBut these are French and Italian examples. What do we know of a Hungarian connection with Jerusalem in the second half of the twelfth century? We have a very strong one. In 1169 or 70, King Bella III sent a large sum of gold to Jerusalem for the Knights Hospitallers in Jerusalem to buy land from which to have an income to support the sick. In the document Bella said that he and his wife would be making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and some of the money should be retained to entertain him and his retinue. The Wikipedia entry says that they did make the pilgrimage but there is no reference providedand an earlier study (James Sweeney, Hungary in the Crusades, 1169-1218, International History Review III, October, 198) suggests that they never made it., so I shall leave the question open. However we do know that there was a high-level Hungarian mission sent to Jerusalem with the money. One can assume that they visited the Sepulchre and saw the lid with the oculi in it.\nJerusalem was lost in 1187 but Hungarians took part in the ill-fated Third Crusade to reconquer it. (All this is in the Sweeney article.) In 1192 King Ladislaw of Hungary  who had died a hundred years before, was canonised and he was presented as the idea of a warrior crusader knight. The excitement was such that in 1195 or 1196, the ageing Bella vowed he would join the next Crusade to the Holy Land.  He died  in 1196 before he could fulfil this vow but Jerusalem was right at the forefront of everybody’s minds in these years, the years of the Pray Codex.\nThis is from two hours library research in the midst of a busy day doing other things but a stone coffin lid in itself confirms Jerusalem is the model as it appears in art just about the same time Constantine placed one over the tomb and the oculi goes with them. No need to look further, I think.\nThe lesson is if you consider yourself a Shroud researcher, think for yourself and don’t follow Ian Wilson, who seems to have been behind this. The Pray Codex hypothesis.  which never had much going for it, is  surely redundant. Let’s move on.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2014 at 2:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-132547","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Enter ‘google Images’ and search for ‘ Crusader Cross’ and you will find the red crosses that are on the sarcophagus. 1195 was the year when obsession with regaining Jerusalem swept Hungary and Bella made his vow to go on crusade ( see ref to Sweeney article above) So it is hardly surprising that one finds red crusader crosses on the Sepulchre that ,as the coffin lid and the oculi on the Codex, show was modelled on what could actually be seen in Jerusalem.\nWhether any other features on the Codex relate to Jerusalem or the Crusaders I don’t know but clearly that is its primary focus.\nI am sure that there will be people who insist on seeing the Shroud and perhaps even turtles in the Codex but it seems clear to me that the illustrator is linking Jerusalem and crusading within the traditional iconography of the burial and Resurrection scenes.\n\n","date":"June 25, 2014 at 2:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-132825","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"I notice the angel has six fingers, assuming it has a hidden thumb.

I think Max has a valid point that there is much more to the HPM drawing than the two leading contenders are prepared to concede.  \nThe idea that the Shroud might be authentic, that it actually existed before 1195, is too much of a challenge for Charles’ innate skepticism, and instead of allowing his artistic vision to perceive what might in fact be represented there, he gives the impression that his interpretation is driven from an agenda of stubborn refusal to acknowledge that the TS might even have existed at that date. \nOn the other hand, O.K. seems uncompromising in being prepared to concede that there may be significance in the elements present relating to the Jerusalem tomb, as propounded by Charles.  He seems concerned that any such concession risks diluting his claim that the artist knew of and intended to represent elements of the Shroud. \nI found the gallery of David Montero intriguing and inspected the dates there carefully.  The impression I was left with was that the HPM had to be one of the very earliest attempts at representing a Lamentation or burial scene.  There seemed to be few there that predated the 12th century, although I’m given to understand that there are indeed a few extant.  So we might presume that the artist would not feel too constrained by precedent.   \nI continue to feel personally persuaded that the artist did know something of the Shroud and this influenced his depiction.  However this was not the subject he chose to represent,  The picture is I should think intended as a meditation object for his fellow monks,  He had no agenda of establishing the Shroud’s existence.  He wanted the focus to be on the laying out and burial of the dead Christ, and the sense of wonder of the Holy women that he was no longer there in the tomb on the Sunday morning and their puzzlement at the message of the angel. \nNevertheless the elements of the Shroud are clearly present.  The virtually naked Christ is as far as I can recall unprecedented.  The crossed arms with only four fingers showing, the omission of the feet, and other features, have to be significant.  The underlying base seems to me to be more of a stone slab than an intention to represent the casket that is shown in later depictions.  I am not convinced that the oblique rectangle is intended to represent a casket lid as asserted by Ian Wilson, Charles or Hugh, even though this is clearly the intention in other depictions of similar scenes.  Its edges are clearly neither straight nor symmetrical, but curved, suggesting to me more of a fabric than a box lid.  The zigzag pattern on this rectangle is sufficiently indicative of the herring-bone twill to at least give pause and ought not to be set aside so lightly. \nThe array of solid crosses and the indications of holes on the stone slab may be an echo of what returning crusaders had seen in Jerusalem.  Reference has been made to King Bella and his resolution to embark on a crusade.  There are several reports of important western personages being admitted to view the imperial relics in Constantinople, even with coherent reports of some viewing the Shroud.  Is it not conceivable that Bella himself knew of it? \nThe slab circles may be intended to represent oculi that the crusaders had seen.  But the fact that the four holes arranged in an ‘L’ shape are in the middle of what might be represented as a herring bone twill, are just a little too persuasive for me.  \nThere remain other enigmas in the picture; the suggestion of a not-too-well concealed head in the woman’s drapery, and the peculiar alpha like symbol, might be interpreted in various ways, as discussed.  \nMy personal conclusion is that O.K. has made his point, that the accumulation of features is just too persuasive to deny that the artist had some knowledge of the Shroud cloth, and judging from the prostrate Christ figure, even the image that it held.  That is not to say that there may well be other factors that might also have influenced him.\n\n","date":"June 26, 2014 at 6:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-133000","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"The issue is not whether the Shroud existed before 1355 or not, it is whether, existing or not, it is specifically shown in the Pray Codex.

Even so if it does not exist in the Pray Codex then there may be some other evidence elsewhere for its existence.\nSo I would simply take it out of the argument – as the Shroud might or might not have been in existence by 1195. Perhaps it was made in 1100, perhaps made in 700 as carbon dating suggests the sudarium of Oviedo was made, perhaps even earlier. Perhaps it is 1330s after all. The Pray Codex does not help at all and the fascinating thing to me is that why it was ever picked out when one could surely find other illuminations with similar imaginative parallels.

The real concern in all this is that, judging from the St.Louis programme, no one seems to have found any new historical evidence for thirty years. Everyone is still arguing over unsatisfactory sources such as the Pray Codex and no one seems to be doing any systematic work outside this. So no one has brought up any research on the early direct contacts between Constantinople and Jerusalem ( before the Arab Conquests) , no one has done anything on the relics trade between Jerusalem and Northern France that is actually documented and includes relics from the ‘Lord’s Tomb’. And we are still arguing over the Pray Codex . ( Yes, I am to blame for wasting my time on it too.)\nAgain no one is doing any work on the actual weave of the Shroud. It will probably be a chance event , like someone working in a conservation lab on medieval linens, who finds some key evidence that can be linked back into what we know of the chemistry of the Shroud and provide a date for it independently of the radiocarbon date. This is what happened with the Horses of St. Mark’s in Venice. No one could date them and the last big study said fourth century BC. Then the conservation lab in the British Museum working on gilded copies found  conclusive evidence that the same technique of gilding on the horses was only developed in the second century AD and the issue was solved overnight. Watch out for the  conservation labs, folks!

I have wondered why so many artists, seeking to preserve Jesus’s modesty, have done so with cloth which is clearly transparent, and I have sought books on the iconography of gestures (without any useful success). Anything I found which I thought was relevant I have brought to the table for inspection.\nI am firmly of the conviction that sooner or later someone will find a smoking gun, maybe a Byzantine image of an angel holding up a sheet with a pair of full length bodies on it, or a sketch by Durer with ‘must complete by Tuesday’ scribbled in the corner.

It aroused a great deal of ridicule including the following from a website called Faith and Theology:\n“A conversation yesterday reminded me of Richard Swinburne’s 2003 book, The Resurrection of God Incarnate. Using Bayesian probability and lashings of highfalutin mathematical jargon, Swinburne argues that “it [is] very probable indeed that God became incarnate in Jesus Christ who rose from the dead” (p. 214). His mathematical apologetics for the resurrection boils down to the following argument:\nThe probably of God’s existence is one in two (since God either exists or doesn’t exist).\nThe probability that God became incarnate is also one in two (since it either happened or it didn’t).\nThe evidence for God’s existence is an argument for the resurrection.\nThe chance of Christ’s resurrection not being reported by the gospels has a probability of one in 10.\nConsidering all these factors together, there is a one in 1,000 chance that the resurrection is not true.\nIt’s almost impossible to parody this argument (since in order to parody it, you would have to imagine something sillier – a daunting task!). But let me try:\nThe probably that the moon is made of cheese is one in two (since it is either made of cheese or it isn’t); the probability that this cheese is camembert is also one in two (since it’s either camembert or it isn’t); and so on..”\nOxford University Press was assailed for its philosophical naivity in publishing Swinburne’s book and someone wrote in to say that within five hundred yards of where Swinburne was writing  in Oxford there were probably a hundred mathematicians qualified to tell him he was talking nonsense.

The other pictures are representations of the Holly Shroud in diverse contexts (entombment, lamentationes etc.); the shroud of Turin IS (really or supposedly) the shroud.\nIf we have to compare two pictures, we should compare homogeneous pictures. This is a problem because we know scarcely anything about other shrouds. We compare in fact a shroud with some pictures with a different iconic concept. We are comparing the mark or impression of the Jesus’ body in a shroud with an entombment scene.\nThis implies an important difference when we analyzed the idea and representation of naked Christ in the tomb and also poses a theological and pictorial problem to a painter who wants to paint the image of the body on a shroud of Christ. The Gospels say that Jesus body was wrapped in a clean shroud (Mathew, 27, 59). There are a lot of medieval representations of Christ in the entombment or the resurrection (most common), where the nudity is veiled by a shroud. Obviously, this solution to the problem was not possible with the Shroud. We don’t know what the solution of this problem in other shrouds was, because only a shroud (true or false) has come to us. We can not compare in any way. We only can compare the codex Pray illustration with others with the same motif and to check out that the codex Pray is not the unique case in which the artist has dared to paint Jesus naked. See my gallery. The codex Pray is odd but not exceptional.

Several features necessarily connect it to the Shroud, one in particular was an undeniable replication of the herring-bone twill.  Other features included a bloodied, scourged, prostrate Christ with crossed hands over the groin.  Despite the many similarities, thumbs are nevertheless clearly visible.  However, there was clearly disagreement about the date of provenance, some asserting it as late 15th – 16th centuries, while others insisted that it was as early as 12th century, a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  I have attempted to pursue this further via the web, but the only references to this particular epitaphios all relate back to Dan’s web-site only.  There appear to be no other web references to it.  I can’t even find it on any of the Mt Athos Stavronikita monastery web-sites.  \nThere were several other comments relating to herring-bone twill representations, including several from Max PH referring to the St Mark’s 7th century carving.  Someone had found a reference to the Stavronikita in a university library, but the matter of dating it still remains unresolved.  \nEven though the TS was known in the west by the 14th century, would monks or artisans at Mt Athos be likely to use this knowledge as a model for an epitaphios for use in Greek Orthodox liturgies at this time?  I think not!  A rational explanation for whatever model was used for it, demands that some remembered features of the Shroud cloth when it was under Greek custody influenced its design. \nMeantime, someone may like to pursue the date of provenance of the epitaphios stavronikita with better success and more conclusivity than I’ve been able to manage.\n\n","date":"June 28, 2014 at 7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-133268","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"David Mo:\nIf the shape of the shroud of Turin is its most distinctive feature, and no artist has ever represented it till the fourteenth Century (fibula) or sixteenth Century (Clovio and Della Rovere), we must conclude that the shroud of Turin was not known till the fourteenth Century.

We are sure that a number of copies of the shroud of Turin are genuine. All them without exceptionpresent the characteristic shape of the Turin Shroud. Ergo this is a relevant and distinctive feature. We have also an alleged influence of the Turin Shroud on a number of images of Christ. But you intend to base this influence on some features common to medieval art. You have no reason to suppose that the altar of Lübeck is “likely” influenced by the shroud of Turin. Not a single one. Prove it! \nIt is you that affirm (inconsequently) that the features that matched the altar and the Shroud were common in medieval art. This claim is mine also. So you need a characteristic feature that identifies the copy of the Shroud. I have found a very reliable one: the shape of the shroud of Turin. You can not deny that this shape is characteristic of the Shroud. But you propose another: the L shape of the supposed holes. But this one is very ambiguous because…\n– There is not a L shape in the “holes” of the codex Pray. There are a L form and a P form.

They need to change to 12th century lenses.\nFirstly, picture what the shroud might have been like in the 1100s, if indeed it did exist then. It didn’t have the burn marks. It quite possibly had the poker holes. It quite possibly had the blood.\nI’ve seen the shroud with my naked eyes. It is far less defined than what we see in photographs. In fact I would call the image somewhat ephemeral, appearing more or less defined depending on the distance from the object.  \nKeep all these things in mind when you form your 12th century image of the Shroud:\nfaint ephemeral image, conspicuous poker holes, no burn marks, conspicuous blood marks. Does the HPM image then start to make more sense?\nAn indisputable FACT is that the “3 Marys” image on the HPM contains PLENTY of symbolism. This is demonstrated at the very least by features such as the head next to Mary’s right arm, and the floating character. This symbolic approach differs from the literal artistry of other images in the HPM. It’s as if the artist is saying: “The resurrection and its representation must be mysterious”. In this light, I see no problem in seeing a cryptic allusion to the shroud in the object we’ve all been debating: faint image represented by central crosses, framed on one side by two wavey red lines representing the blood, and the “L shaped” poker holes on the other side. \nIf the artist was a senior cleric who visited Constantinople, then it’s no leap of faith to think that he might have seen the Shroud, and might then have been deeply impressed by it. It’s not then a big leap to think he might have alluded to it in his picture.\nAnyhow, that’s me on the HPM.\n\n","date":"June 29, 2014 at 5:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-134271","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"O.K.:\nThere is a brand in the “forehead” in the Jesus of the entumbamiento who is own of the image of the Shroud of Turin.\n(en español)\nHay una marca en la “frente” en el Jesús del entumbamiento que es propia de la imagen de la Sábana de Turín.\nCarlos\n\n","date":"June 29, 2014 at 5:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-134276","author":"Carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"I consider David Mo’s own claim to logic quite faulty.\nThe drawings of the Pray Codex are a style of their own, almost in a cartoon style, simple ink drawings with only two uniform primary colours.  In no sense are they in the same category as their contemporary high European art, with all their concomitant artistic styles, and reliance on precedents.  The Pray drawings occur in their context of the very first attempt at producing a written text in the Hungarian language.  It may be regarded as a form of primal Hungarian art.  Nor do I see that O.K. is basing his arguments on artistic features of representations of the Shroud in medieval art.  That does not seem to be his assertion, but rather that he claims to see that there are direct congruences between the proto-Shroud itself and features appearing in the drawings. \nDavid Mo claims to find a very reliable characteristic feature in the shape of the Shroud.  Very well then!  Casual inspection of the oblique rectangle in the drawing will show that it has a length to width ratio of very close to 4:1, the same proportions as the Shroud cloth, the very same object that has a zigzag pattern on it, as has the Shroud, and the very same object that has an ‘L’ arrangement of holes.  A further characteristic of the Shroud is that it is of fabric, so it need not be represented as having straight sides, but can be curved, without these being symmetrical.  A straight edge placed against this rectangle will show the edges are indeed curved, and without the curves being symmetrical about the centre-line.  \nA slightly earlier work, more in the classic style, is the Lamentation scene on the Klosterneuberg pulpit near Vienna which is said to predate 1181.  Here the partially draped Christ, with crossed arms across the groin, is being laid to rest in what is clearly a patterned casket.  In the background, is also an oblique rectangle, patterned in the same way as the casket, having straight sides, and is clearly intended to be the lid of the casket, which it would seem to be designed to fit very well.  This is quite a different object.  \nAnother aspect that would seem to disqualify the Pray rectangle from being a casket lid, is the absence of a casket.  There is no casket shown for this to be a lid to!  What is exactly the point in portraying a lid without a casket to own it? The base rectangle conveys no impression of being intended to represent a casket, so much as a kind of slab or stone, perhaps even something like the limestone shelves seen in any of the Jerusalem tombs, by wandering crusaders.  \nI am bemused by David Mo’s assertion that there is not a ‘L’ shape in the Codex Pray, and I do not catch whatever subtlety he is attempting.  There is clearly an arrangement of circles arranged as an ‘L’ shape in the oblique rectangle, which look very much to me as an attempt to represent a similar arrangement of holes found on the Shroud unrelated to the 1532 fire.  It is true that the artist for whatever reason has chosen to include arrangements of tiny circles in other locations: as dress decorations, and on the underlying slab, perhaps representing oculi, and on the waist of the angel.  They might for all we can guess suggest that we ought to be looking for a more subtle arrangement of circles, such as those arranged in an ‘L’ shape! \n DM: “The alleged shroud in the codex Pray is not a shroud; it is the sepulchre. There are several reasons that show this.”  I venture to suggest that there are several many more reasons to assert that the oblique rectangle is intended to represent the Shroud than there are to say that it is a sepulchre! \nHowever, all the great men have spoken and have expressed their skepticism all to their own satisfaction no doubt.  I for one consider that they have all simultaneously come to an incorrect conclusion.

I don’t know a “Hungarian Gothic style” and the concept of “Prayan” style is inconceivable. \n The Pray drawings occur in their context of the very first attempt at producing a written text in the Hungarian language. It may be regarded as a form of primal Hungarian art. \nThis is a common mistake among sindonists. The Pray Codex is an ensemble of texts. Only the Funeral Prayer is written in Hungarian and can be dated in 1192-95, according to E. Poulle. Other parts of the codex include a list of Hungarian kings (till 1210) and a collection of liturgical songs in Latin. The illustrations are inserted in the latter part and can be dated about the beginning of the thirteen Century (1216 as likely ante quem. All these texts and illustrations were influenced by the French and the Italian style. That is to say, they belong to the Gothic style.  \n Casual inspection of the oblique rectangle in the drawing will show that it has a length to width ratio of very close to 4:1, the same proportions as the Shroud cloth, the very same object that has a zigzag pattern on it, as has the Shroud, and the very same object that has an ‘L’ arrangement of holes.

The surface where the small circles are painted is rigid and differs completely with the representation of cloths and fabrics in the Pray Codex. The angel is seating over it, as is usual in the representations of the scene of the Holy Women.

At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields where there is a deficit or inaccessibility of information, the need for communication, and respect for different perspectives.” \nThus it is clear that there is an inability on the part of some to measure and calculate a simple length to width ratio.

Perhaps it is because these are NOT the poker holes.\nIf  you look front on at the poker holes on the Shroud they do not present an L shape in the same pattern as on the Pray Codex. This is why I am wondering whether you do not mean the top layer of the poker holes but a lower one down. As you know they diminish the further into the folded cloth that you go but when the Shroud is fully extended you can just see them all so we cannot be sure which of the four the your artist has picked out to reproduce.over to you to tell us what you think -or perhaps if the artist is inaccurate anyway it doesn’t.’t matter but it makes your argument even weaker than it already is.\n         I have asked Nabber to actually show the examples of circular holes that he seems to know about, but he hasn’t.

If Nabber is right that these are sometime reproduced in a greater number than three then there are no problems with there being four Jerusalem oculi on the tomb lid but we do need to see his examples. My suspicion , that Nabber can prove unfounded, is that he actually has not seen the originals. This is because from what limited information I actually put into my posting, it would take some time to actually go through all the sculptures concerned to pick out Forsyth’s examples.

I shall look forward to your  (and to anyone else’s) choice of the poker holes.\nThe basic argument is that we have a shroud with two images, apparently unique as I know of no other examples, which was heavily bloodstained but we see absolutely no sign of its size, the images or bloodstains in the Pray Codex. The artist has not even shown the wounds of Christ without which the bloodstains could not have soaked into the Shroud. \nAll this when,as depictions of relics such as the Image of Edessa show, artists had no inhibitions about representing painted cloths as they appeared to be. We have documentary accounts of the marble lid placed over the rock tomb in the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre and eye -witness reports of oculi in the lid. There is nothing in the Pray Codex, other than its inept artistry, that is outside conventional depictions of these scenes. However, there does seem to be a particular concentration on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre/crusader crosses that ties in with the crusading hysteria that apparently swept Hungary in the mid- 1190s after the loss of Jerusalem in 1187.\nWe need to get together all the examples from the twelfth century onwards that Forsyth provides to see whether we can say anything coherent from them about the positioning of the oculi in the marble lid that is illustrated in the Codex as the original is lost. Much though I would love to go and visit all these places . . .  \nI can see from photographs of the fine Romanesque sculptures of Modena where the scene with the tomb is but alas it is not close up enough for me to see the oculi. I have no reason to doubt an expert such as Forsyth who has no axe to grind on this issue.\nNabber tells us that he has examples of four or more  oculi but we wait on him to provide them. If he is right that there are cases of four oculi then that is an argument in my favour but I suspect that as none of his are on a tomb he is looking at the wrong images so I am not counting on him for support.\nSo there is absolutely no reason to read the Shroud into the Pray Codex. This is a simple argument, very typical of those made by art historians every day of the week. You have to find some firm foundation stones from which to build an argument and a vague reference to what you say admit inaccurate representations of a defect in a holy relic by an artist whom you admit had no intention of representing the Shroud in the first place are simply not good enough in the real world of academia. \nIt is up to you go on abusing me if that is your way of conducting discussions.\nAnd all this to ‘prove’ the existence of a particular burial shroud of Christ which may, like many of its rivals ‘genuine’ burial shrouds of Christ, have been made in the medieval period but in this case before 1195 (e.g. Cadouin has now been dated through its calligraphy to 1095).\n\n","date":"June 30, 2014 at 12:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-134501","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Nice one Charles.\nOne tiny quibble: the issues raised go way beyond those of academia.\nWhat the world of academia does or does not think frankly does not bother this experimentalist too greatly . \n We’re down to the nitty gritty details at a more visceral level –  resenting those who try to browbeat us into submission with their shallow, self-serving agenda-driven line of argument, carefully selecting what they want us to see, getting ratty and insulting when one points out the inner contradictions.\nIt’s a microcosm really of a battle for hearts and minds that been going on for centuries –  enlightenment v mind control propaganda.\n\n","date":"June 30, 2014 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-134505","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Dear Colin,\nA question from a purely scientific point of view.\nApproximately two decades ago, I attended two seminars given by Dr. Alan Adler, the Porphrin Chemist, who was initially a member of STURP.  He performed the blood studies on the Shroud.\nI distinctly remember Dr. Adler stating.  “I am so good in my field that had the shroud not been exposed to a flood, causing water damage, I could have told you if Jesus was circumcized or not.”  Obviously, he was referring to that private area.\nWith that in mind, some researchers have stated DNA studies determined a trisomy (XXY) on the sex chromosome, indictative of Kleinfelter Syndrome, while other scientific researchers determined this chromosome to be XX with a Y embedded into one of the Xs or de la Chapelle Syndrome, referred to as XX male.\nFurther, I have read de la Chapelle mimics Kleinfelter and, as well, de la Chapelle syndrome is often misdiagnosed.\nRegardless, as to what is finally determined (Kleinfelter Syndrome or de la Chapelle Syndrome), the salient feature of both are female traits in the male.\nNow, observe the full body image of the Shroud of Turin and then look closely at the upper portion of the body and  then compare this image to the  image posted on this site (link below) \nComment Promoted: The Stavronikita Epitaphios\nhttps://shroudstory.com/2014/06/28/comment-promoted-the-stavronikita-epitaphios/#comment-134352\nNow compare the two images mentioned above to that of the Hungarian Pray Codex.\nAs a woman, I am clearly able to see female breasts on all three images, indicating either Kleinfelter Syndrome (XXY) or  de la Chapelle Syndrome, (XX male).\nMen diagnosed with Kleinfelter Syndrome are very tall, as a rule, and have female breasts. Jesus was tall, compared to other Jewish males, at that time.\nI realize, as well, most believe Ron Wyatt was a fake, but surprisingly, back in the 70s or 80s, he found blood beneath the cross hole, after engineering a a dig into Zedekiah’s cave  and supposedly, he had that black blood reconstituted and scientifically analyzed.  The lab  analysis also revealed the trisomy XXY.  This study was done prior to any of the more recent studies on the sex chromosomes.\nFinally concluding, what are your thoughts concerning the relationship of female traits, found in men with an extra X chromosome, to the three images I’ve mentioned in the paragraphs above?\nAre you clearly able to see what appears obvious to me or do I need an opthalmologist?  :) \nAnd if you are able to make the connection of the female traits on the shroud image to the other images, would you consider this to be a type of proof, considering sex chromosome studies verify the images?    \nThanks in advance.\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 30, 2014 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-134543","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"P.S.

The “Empty Tomb” was really just a generic description of the scene (IMHO).  I would not say the Shroud got  “passing mention” — it was mentioned in all 4 Gospels, with details of it provided.

Actaeon was torn apart by hounds when he saw Diana bathing. Apparently the mutilated body of a man killed in his prime became equated with Christ. Wertzmann shows a sarcophagus (from the Louvre)  of a naked  Actaeon being laid out in a very similar pose to many Lamentation scenes and sees this as an important source from the tenth century in both east and west ,when there was a renewed interest in copying classical iconography for New Testament texts.

Indeed, as I said above, one of the major themes of such scenes would have been the discovery of the relic, which must have been shown rather more explicitly than by a couple of wavy lines and some holes. (By the way, are we not making rather a large assumption in supposing these burns to have pre-dated the Pray manuscript. They may well not have occurred until much later!). OK made the point that, even after the Shroud’s incontestable date of existence, Three Marys scenes still do not show it. The reason for this, I fear, is not that artists felt it detracted from the scene, but that they didn’t think it was there in the first place. I think it most unlikely that an artist believing that the image of Christ was left behind in the tomb after the resurrection, would not include it in any depiction of it. In my experience of medieval relics (minimal), what was important to the faithful was not what it looked like – any old sheet would have done – but its provenance, and artistic renderings of its discovery would abound, rather as all those pictures of nails, crowns of thorns, whipping stones and so on tend to resemble a supposed relic rather than any actual archaeological artifact.\nOr does this defy logic?\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 2:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-134818","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Hugh I agree it is an assumption that the poker holes existed circa.

But when the father saw the lines (remember that they are only lines)… Well, I cannot translate adequately the joke to English and it is not very suitable for this blog. Let it stay .\nThat’s clealry a bench, what else could it be!\nNaturlich! Two lines = a bench. Every intelligent man sees this!  But the no-intelligent men see anything; for example, perhaps it is the left angle of the edge of the sepulchre. I think the artist of the Pray Codex was not very skilful. He is probably trying to copy or remember another illustration but paints badly some things. See the sceptre with the cross. Nothing appears to hold it, and there is something as four fingers in an impossible place. Or see the ornament of crosses under the so called shroud. (By the way, the shroud of Turin has not any cross similar to these that are on this alleged shroud of the Pray Codex. It is not a shroud, of course).\nBut this story of the bench that not seems a bench at all intrigues me. How appeared it here? Is the angel who brought it from the heaven? Perhaps he was afraid of having to wait for the Holy Women for too long (the women, you know). \nDon’t worry if I don’t take too seriously your famous bench. The non-intelligent people don’t be able to understand the theories of intelligent ones. That’s why, all the painters of the Middle Ages  -non-intelligent, of course-, put the angel naturally seated on the sepulchre or on the lid, exactly in the same position of the angel of the Pray Codex. No one has the very intelligent idea to paint a heavenly bench. This is another extraordinary exploit of the Pray Codex… or of your intelligent interpretation of it.\nIn any event, let me abandon you at this point. You’ll be tired to discuss with non-intelligent people as me, and you become the more and more interested to introducing some issues which I have not interest in discussing with you; as the level of intelligence, for example. I let you rest and be calm.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2014 at 2:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-134820","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"It is a bench or a slab of some sort that the angel sits on.

Even assuming authenticity it is still not known how long the image took to form.  Although the process is evidently different, one might draw an analogy with Volkringer patterns of flora which can take some considerable time to appear.  A miraculist believing that the image was a byproduct of the resurrection, might assert that the image very likely formed immediately, but that is not necessary even for the miraculist.  It is certainly not necessary for those who prefer a naturalist explanation.  A medieval artist who knew of the Shroud might assume that the image was immediately visible after the resurrection, but evidently none did.  It is of course the assertion of De Wesselow, who seems to believe that the image explains the belief in the Resurrection, while other commentators believe that John’s gospel narrative of two angels, one at the foot and one at the head, is a subtle reference to the image.  \nThere is a considerable weight of documentary evidence that the burial cloths were present in Constantinople.  The first specific reference would seem to be that of Constantine VII in a letter to his troops of 958 AD.  ” … the sindon which God wore, and other symbols of the immaculate Passion.” cited by Scavone.  Other documentary evidence is persuasive that the sindon bore a full body image.  Various later Byzantine liturgical rites such as the melismos imply a close association with the burial of Christ with the eucharist rite.  The earliest threnos mural and a liturgical epitaphios would seem to be that in Nerezi Serbia of 1164.  From the 12th century, epitaphioi become prevalent in the Easter Friday liturgies.  It requires little imagination, to guess what initiated this departure from preceding depictions and what their originating stimulus might have been.  \nFrom what we know of Byzantine liturgies, much of it is not for the public gaze.  These are mysteries which only the privileged may witness.  The eucharist rite of course is carried out behind a reredos.  Consequently we cannot expect to see depictions of the sacred burial cloths with their image in Byzantine art.  We are only allowed to see an interpretation by way of the epitaphioi. \nIt seems that in 1204, the burial cloths with their image disappeared from Constantinople, according to the report of Robert de Clari, and it is not until 1355, that the Shroud is said to appear in Lirey France.  Nevertheless, despite this knowledge and although various copies were made, it  still seems that it was seldom depicted as an art object in its own right, neither in the west nor in the east.  But the epitaphioi continued to appear, imprinted on the Byzantine collective memory.\n\n","date":"July 3, 2014 at 7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135070","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"daveb: “The fallacious assumption is that the image was visible soon after the resurrection.

Even if the image was formed immediately, it may simply have not been seen because it was on the inside of the Shroud.  The Apostle who collected the Shroud (Peter?) went over to the Shroud (the image not visible, being on the INSIDE of it), rolled it up, and probably soon put it in a box, leather pouch, etc.   How can you determine when somebody unrolled it and looked at the inside of the Shroud, to see an image?  You can’t.  To add to that, the “insiders” (the new Christians), were almost all Jews and would have been reluctant to handle a bloody object related to death, and reluctant to handle something related to the Divine.  If anybody saw the Shroud at all, it was probably when Peter (or the next Custodian) opened the box and said, “See?”.  Then closed it right back up.

(…)\nThere is a considerable weight of documentary evidence that the burial cloths were present in Constantinople. (…)\nFrom what we know of Byzantine liturgies, much of it is not for the public gaze.

It is irrelevant if the image was produced immediately after the resurrection or two centuries later, miraculously or made by a forger. If the shroud was known at the time you like, we should have a description or an image of it. This is the point I share with Hugh and Charles.\n2. Neither of the examples you cite (Constantine VIII, Clari and these other mysterious not specified by you), provide us with a description of the shrouds mentioned that can be compared with the Shroud of Turin. There is no description. There is no way to know if they were painted or not or. In the case that there were some image, we cannot know if these images were similar to the Shroud of Turin or were different. You can not make any comparison of something familiar with something that is not known. The mention of the word “shroud” can not solve the problem.\n3. The epitaphioi are liturgical fabrics with representations of the dead Jesus. None of these paints or embroideries shows an identifiable image of the shroud of Turin.\n4.

It is not about one or another particular viewpoint, but about attitude.\nHugh: Not at all.\nBut no kidding, Hugh!\nJust to quote IW (The Shroud: Fresh Light on the 200-yeart old mystery, Bantam 2011.\nOn the radiocarbon dating:\npg. 21-22:\nIn 2005 American scientist Dr Ray Rogers, dying from cancer, issued a peer-reviewed scientific paper claiming to prove that the Shroud sample used for the carbon dating was cut from an area rewoven during the Middle Ages, instead of having come from the true, original fabric. But as we will see later, even this argument lacks serious substance, and in general the 1988 radiocarbon dating finding has been able to rest unchallenged as science’s overriding ‘verdict’ on the Shroud, snuffing out any evidence, from any discipline, that might suggest to the contrary\nWhat counterarguments Wilson presents against Rogers? As we will see, none (he mentions Rogers only twice in the whole book!), but let’s make another quote from his book. \nSo now this ‘trash’ -chapter 7 ‘What’s in a date?’\npg. 129-130.\nMore recently it has been claimed, […], that the area of the Shroud from which the radiocarbon dating sample was taken was one which had been extensively rewoven in the Middle Ages (footnote 9 : Marino and Benford 2009). purportedly the ‘new’ areahad been invisibly matched to the rest of the cloth, so the radiocarbon dating laboratories had unwittingly dated from a piece that was not part of the original cloth but added thirteen centuries later.\nThirteen centuries -here is ne clue that Wilson completely misunderstands Benford/Marino ideas. But he goes further:\nDespite this idea having been put forward, even in peer-reviewed scientific journals, it has little more going for it than the ‘clandestine switch’ theory. During my eight-hour examination of the Shroud back in 1973, high among the priorities was a very carefu search fo any anomalies that may disclose an early historical display method, any ancient fold marks, signs of fastenings, etc. Every area of the linen’s surface that was accesible on that occasion (footnote 10: The dorsal half was not, being above my head, because of the upright display mode) was carefully surveyed from a glancing angle for this purpose, and the area from which the radiocarbon dating sample was later taken was well within my viewing range.(footnote 11: The opposite end of the cloth was not, being well above my head because of the upright mode of display on that occasion.) Not theslightest sign of any compositional difference was apparent.\nLater, Wilson goes on bringing Vial’s and Flury-Lemberg opinions. Anyway, as we have seen, he prefers his own eye examination, back in 1973 (!), when no one had C14 dating on mind, over peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals. \nAnd later Wilson is going on, describing generalities, how C14 is unreliable, without any proper understanding of the subject. He as far as 2009, despite his visual examination, considered discredited bioplastic coating theory as credible, and believed its presence in the C14 area (see pg. 135, and a footnote 18, that is an e-mail from Stephan Mattingly, dated 8 April 2009).\nAbout Danin, Marion, Courage and Castex, pg. 376:\nWhen none other than Avinoan Danin, Professor of Botany at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, very forcefully insist on seeing the images of certain plants(footnote 13: Danin et al, 1999 and 2008.), it deserves to be taken seriously -particularly given that he can in no way be accused of any pro-Christian bias. Most other such claims, however, are extremely doubtful, particularly the Latin, Greek and Hebrew inscriptions which have been ‘seen’ by two French researchers, André Marion and Anne Laure Courage. (footnote 14: Marion and Courage, 1997.) Also the claims of a French ‘scientist’, Thierry Castex, that he has found the Aramaic word ‘found’ written in Hebrew letters.\nSo Danin is fine, but Marion, Courage and Castex are not. And Castex does not even deserve the name of ‘scientist’. Very gentle, Mr. Wilson.\nOh, btw: what is in the Wilson’s bibliography? Marion, André, and Anne Laure Courage, Nouvelles Découvertes sur le Suaire de Turin, Paris, Albin Michel, 1997 \nIn fact, I have a polish edition of that book? And I can say, that it is quite technical, for a popular book standard. Here I have question: had IW even read it? Because I have sense that either he had not, or he had not understood it at all. This is the only place where he adresses Marion and Courage saying simply they are bad, without any adressing to it in essential way. It is not about agreeing, or not, with Marion&Courage conclusion, but I am under impression  that Mr Wilson had lost a great opportunity to remain silent on the subject (that he probably doesn’t know at all).\nThat’s all so far, I am going sleep. Goodnight.\n\n","date":"July 3, 2014 at 6:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135186","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"The 1204 to 1355 gap may be an artificial one based on the belief that the de Clari shroud and the Lirey shroud are one and the same.

I pointed out that there was no way of knowing whether the image was present on the burial cloths or not immediately after the resurrection.  There is only tenuous evidence that it may have been.  It would then be presumptuous of an artist to assume that it was visible at that time, and so none apparently depicted it as such.  The tenuous evidence is found in John’s gospel when “the other disciple” entered the tomb saw the cloths and so believed, and the two angels one at the foot and one at the head.  However John’s gospel is unlikely to have been written earlier than about 50 years after the event, by which time the image might then have developed to be visible. There were excellent reasons including secrecy as to why the image is not otherwise explicitly mentioned in the scriptures.  There are further hints and suggestions to be found in Revelations. \nYou seem to complain that I have not specified other Byzantine documentary evidence.  I prefer not to spoon-feed those who feign ignorance.  A comprehensive review of the documentary evidence can be found in Scavone:\n“Acheiropoietos Jesus Images in Constantinople: the Documentary Evidence” found at:\nhttp://www.sindonology.org/scavone-acheiropoietos.pdf\nScavone provides further evidence in his review of the origins of the epitaphioi:\nGREEK EPITAPHIOI AND OTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE SHROUD IN CONSTANTINOPLE UP TO 1204, found at:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/scavone.pdf   \nIt does not seem to have been in the Byzantine mind-set to be overly-explicit about sacred objects, perhaps a more recent western practice.  So any descriptions of the Shroud and its image are by way of general allusions only. Nevertheless, the documents and the epitaphioi clearly have a basis for their origin and appear to reflect knowledge of the Shroud.  The Shroud as we know it exists as a real object, yet no-one has provided a satisfactory explanation for its characteristics and properties.  There is much to support the view that it is what it appears to be, the burial cloth of Christ.  There is only one piece of evidence that can challenge its authenticity, and that is the most unsatisfactory unrepresentative carbon dating, which is seriously questioned, but which is now only tenaciously clung to by the most rabid of non-authenticists. \nI am happy to debate the pros and cons of the authenticity of the Shroud, and its various enigmatic properties with those prepared to discuss it with an open mind.  However I see it as a rather fruitless and pointless task of continuously arguing minor details with those whose mind is made up and not prepared even to consider the possibility of authenticity no matter what arguments might be presented.  That is not my mission in life, and I have rather more pressing priorities than wasting my time in such a way.\n\n","date":"July 3, 2014 at 6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135191","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Good morning, O.K.

Icon worshippers were persecuted 726 – 786;  Council of Nicea 787 condemned iconoclasm; But Second iconoclast period 814 – 842; Icon veneration restored 843.  So even if Shroud image was in fact known, and represented in art, survival of any such art works might well be unlikely.  Nevertheless there are hints that it was known to a few, epitaph of Bishop Avercius Marcellus d.~200AD;  Bardesanic Hymn of Pearl 2nd century; various comments alluding to chest wound. \nMore likely it was not generally known because it was concealed as something else, and it seems significant that references to the burial cloth only emerge in Constantinople, following the arrival of the mandylion there, and Constantine VII’s letter of 958 AD.  Until the time of the Crusades, the burial cloths along with other relics were generally kept hidden in the emperor’s collection.  Even so there are references to sightings of it by various western visitors.  The Shroud itself as such might not be considered an attractive or appealing subject as an art work, but it is represented in the highly decorated epitaphioi, and is there given a religious significance, important to the Byzantines, rather than just its cold realism more attuned to a later age. \nThe two sides of the debate seem to approach the Shroud from two entirely different perspectives.  For the non-authenticist, there is the appeal of the enigmatic, the inexplicable, a subject of curiosity, which may be discussed purely as an intellectual exercise with absolutely no commitment.  However for the authenticist, there has to be a reason why the Shroud has been given to humanity to contemplate.  It is the predecessor of all iconography, it is a divine gift, to be treated with reverence, and has the potential to affirm faith, and to evangelize.  We may gaze in awe at the pyramids, and the handiwork of earlier ages.  But for the authenticist, the Shroud is so much more, and creates commitment.  That is the distinction between the two approaches as I see it, and what creates the difficulties in attempting dialogue between the two sides.  Try telling an Islamist that the Black Stone in the Kaaba at Mecca is really a meteorite and see how much mileage you can get from that!\n\n","date":"July 3, 2014 at 10:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135221","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Well, that’s all much more sensible – I think I can stop foaming at the mouth now.\n\n","date":"July 4, 2014 at 3:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135260","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"O.K.:\nNo, David Mo we do not have enough descriptions and pictures of the Mandylion to be 100 % certain how it looked like.

The iconography of the Three Marys very rarely has anything that looks as if it was carved out of rock – a cave. The earlier ones show the tomb as a building, sometimes just a big doorway, which I suppose could be interpreted as the built-up entrance to a cave, but mostly they seem to be round temple-like buildings, complete with domed roofs, and seem to me to be derived from the Holy Sepulchre rotunda in Jerusalem. The angel is often sitting on a squarish stone – very rarely a round one – which has sometimes been ‘turned’ to an odd angle. The modern concept of a round millwheel-like stone rolling away from a hole in the hillside is wholly foreign to these pictures. If the stone the angel is sitting on is not the entrance to the tomb, then it is probably modelled, as Carlos suggests, on the Stone of Unction.\nLater there comes a transition stage in which the building is still there, but a rectangular sarcophagus is also illustrated, and later still the building goes completely and the the angel’s stone becomes the lid of the sarcophagus. This transition and one or two variations of it are very clearly evident if one prints out all David Mo’s, and Carlos’s examples. The architectural elements of the Pray manuscript fit very well into the tradition. The building has gone, the sarcophagus (the polystaurion block) remains, and the skewed ‘lid’ could be either the stone of Unction or the lid of the sarcophagus. Charles divides the tradition into Eastern and Western, and I think it is significant that the text above the Pray picture is in Latin, not Greek.\n\n","date":"July 4, 2014 at 2:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135349","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"HF: “The architectural elements of the Pray manuscript fit very well into the tradition. ” \nSo a skewed coffin lid, with unsymmetrical curved sides, apparently intended to cover no hollow space for a body in what is said to be a sarcophagus (the only sarcophagus in history known not to contain a space for a body), and with four small circles arranged in an ‘L’ shape, decorated with a zigzag pattern, complete with two matching zigzag red stripes, with a mysterious floating head, and a peculiar alpha like symbol, is said to fit well into the traditional pattern of the Three Marys. \nIt’s evident that people will only see what they are predisposed to see, and nothing else!\nI think I’m out of here, and will leave you all to follow your fruitless search!\n\n","date":"July 4, 2014 at 5:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135369","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Well said dave.

The architectural elements, as opposed to the decorative elements, really do fit very well into the tradition; the skewed slab, be it lid or Stone of Unction, and the “big block” which is often shown hollow – an incontestable sarcophagus – but occasionally solid, possibly representing the shelf on which Jesus’s body was laid, or simply the sarcophagus from sideways on. The likes of me can indeed get our heads around the various departures from decorative convention, but there is really very little departure from archaeological convention.\nThroughout this saga, the sceptics have explained carefully with numerous examples why they do not believe that the Pray drawing demonstrates the pre-existence of the shroud. They have countered with dozens of similar scenes, with discussions of possible alternatives and with thoughtful suggestions as to further possible research. They have demonstrated that a large proportion of Three Marys scenes show a skewed slab over a rectagular sarcophagus, a crumpled shroud and an angel balancing like a surfer on the slab. They have pondered the meaning of the concentric zigzag ‘circles’ and the polystaurion block. They have suggested comparisons with marble and the crusader crosses. They have differed over possible explanations for the various little circles. They have researched possible connections with epitaphioi. They are not immune to the significance of the Shroud as an important Christian icon. They do not insist that authenticists instantly change their minds, but it would be nice if they could at least see some validity to their observations.\nIs any of this untrue?\nThe response of those who believe that the Pray manuscript does derive from the Shroud, that the Shroud is truly the burial cloth of Christ, has been an unceasing tirade of invective and abuse. They have offered nothing new in the way of evidence, and demanded slavish acceptance of their point of view. \nIs any of this untrue?\nYou think a series of concentric zigzag semicircles represent herringbone weave. I disagree. I understand your point of view, you think I’m a moron. You think the rectangular slab has sufficiently wavy edges to be considered representative of a cloth rather than a stone. I disagree. I understand your point of view; you think I’m blind. You think the wavy lines on the slab represent the blood flows on the shroud. I disagree. I understand your point of view; you think I’m arrogant. You go on and on about how you cannot bear to argue with me any more; I think that gently pointing out misrepresentations of my point of view and trying to make it clearer will enable to help undecided readers of these comments to make up their own minds; all you can say in reply is that I’m a blind, rabid, arrogant, ignorant, irrelevant, uncomprehending, illogical, obsessive, absurd, desperate, poisonous, dishonest, deceitful, envious, fearful, fanatical, sychophantic moron.\nWell, good for you. With friends like that, the Shroud’s rejection as a worthless shibboleth seems assured. With friends like mine, even though we doubt its authenticity, its value as a central icon of Christianity may yet be saved.

The two slabs are characteristic of the genre, of course, but it is quite rare to see a tomb hovering in mid-air. One of the examples in Carlos’s last link has something a little similar, with the tomb appearing as a kind of bridge, through which we can see the dresses of the women. They seem to be derived from the style which shows huddled guards in the front of the picture, sometimes in a little hollow of their own. Take away the guards and it seems some painters interpret the space left behind as a void right through. A fascinating one to add to the collection. Thank you.\nI’m not sure what Louis is referring to. Which of the pictures in his link shows a burial slab? If he is referring to my earlier comment, then I agree that one of the two blocks may have originated as the burial slab, the one that eventually slid out of the tomb building and became a sarcophagus. The other block, the one the angel is sitting on, which eventually became the llid, is more likely to have been originally either the Stone of Unction or the door of the tomb (the stone rolled away).\n\n","date":"July 5, 2014 at 3:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135445","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Well, we are talking about possibilities and probabilities, as Hugh will agree.

It seems he was trying to include as much information as possible in limited space, pre- and post-Resurrection scenes.\nThere are problems with the interpretation:\nFirst-century Jewish tombs had burial slabs and shelves, so it is possible that the artist intended to show the stone of unction as a burial slab, but what would the stone of unction be doing in a tomb? It is not that famous one preserved in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. We now now that the burial place was “honeycombed with tombs”, to quote Bahat, so how many dead bodies were washed on the “stone of unction”? Jesus was the only one who had his dead body washed on this “stone of unction”? Does the NT say that the body was washed? No, it doesn’t. Did the artist think about this?\nIf the artist intended to show a sarcophagus,then he had little culture, he was mixing Egypt with Israel, mixing Jesus with a pharaoh.\nDid the artist think about the door of the tomb? The NT says that the door was rolled, not pushed. Was it round? Could be, but only four round entrance stones have been found. Did the artist visit Jerusalem before painting?

The verse Matt 28:1 is often cited, suggesting the artists’ intentions of representing that scene.  Mark’s gospel also refers to the visit of the three women, but Matthew deliberately gives the story a different twist (contrasts rebuff of Jews with the commission to teach the gentiles).   If it’s Matthew 28, then there’s an earthquake, which would dislodge the stone, and so Matthew brings in the angel indicating that the earthquake is providential, and who brings the message of Christ’s resurrection to the women.  Matthew 28 has the angel sitting on the stone.  In few if any of the sample illustrations is the angel actually sitting on the stone.  He is often either sitting or standing on a skewed rectangle, which often looks more like a Persian magic carpet, than a sarcophagus lid.  This skewed rectangle seems a persistent feature whether or not the sarcophagus is shown or not.  Sometimes the rectangle has a thickness suggesting a casket lid, sometimes it does not.  In some cases it almost seem suspended in the air suggesting the carpet analogy.  Why does the skewed rectangle persist, whether or not the sarcophagus is shown or not?  It seems peculiar that this one feature endures regardless and independently of the sarcophagus.   \nIn the HPM, 12th century (1192-95)  the angel is not sitting on the rectangle but seems to be sitting on a type of rock shelf, again not necessarily the rolled-away entrance stone, and the skewed rectangle seems more part of the foreground.  \nI think it unfortunate that the debate seemed to reflect too much the personal agenda of the participants.  Thus all non-authenticists have insisted that the HPM shows no connection with the TS, while all authenticists have insisted that it does.  Clearly both sides have allowed their personal attitudes to authenticity to interpret the HPM.  This is not the way to arrive at the truth of the matter.  I consider that several of the illustrations from the 11th century are not all persuasive of the rectangle being interpreted as a casket lid.  In fact I am wondering if there’s more of a hint in the theory that the stories about angels in the various resurrection stories, might refer to the images on the Shroud, allowing that all of the gospels were written some decades after the events they purport to recount.  The fact that the angel is often shown placed on this rectangle might even suggest it!\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 12:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135567","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Carlos: \nFirst of all: I wrote: “on the lid or on the sarcophagus”. “Lid” in English means “tapa”. Please, read more attentively my words and you will not blunder again. \nHugh suggests that the rectangle may be the door of the sepulchre. Maybe. I consider more probable the rectangle represented the lid as in almost all the representations in West Medieval Art. So I see the angel is seated or stepping on a rectangle in the examples from St. Gall and the Cloisters. In the example from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Angel is seated on a sarcophagus. I interpret this form this way on the basis of the figures of sleeping warriors that is an iconographic issue of many representations in the Medieval Western Art.\nBut your interpretation is mainly flawed because you put here some examples of art from different time and styles we are discussing. We are speaking about the Pray Codex and its illustrations -it is to say Thirteenth Century-, and the shroud of Turin (1350 circa as unquestionable date). All my examples (if I remember well) came from the Twelfth to the Fifteenth Centuries. It is to say, a plausible time of impact of both objects in a coherent geographical space and a peculiar style: the Gothic. They are coherent with our subject of discussion. Yours aren’t.\nHowever, it matters little that we interpret the rectangle as the lid of a sarcophagus, as in the Western Art, or a door of the Holy Sepulchre, as in the Byzantine tradition (Russian icons included). It matters little if we see the angel sitting or stepping on the rectangle. Therefore, the rectangle ever will be a door or a lid, never a cloth. In both cases the sindonist interpretation of the rectangle in the Pray Codex is inconsistent.\nDaveb: \nIn the Western Art the rectangle is the lid of the coffin or sarcophagus. We can understand this not by a mere game of appearances, but by the iconographic comparison of this element in a lot of representations. The rectangle takes up the place beside the coffin/sarcophagus as the other unequivocal lids. It is rigid as a lid. It is a lid. \nIn the Eastern Art the thing is ambiguous.

There are a few of the early “temple-type” Three Marys scenes in which the angel is standing on a very flat slab lying on the floor. In these few I think the slab is being interpreted as the door. In many more he is sitting on a more substantial block, which I think indicates the Stone of Unction which sits outside the sepulchre even today. The later “sarcophagus-type” Three Marys scenes clearly show the angel-slab as the lid of the sarcophagus. In intermediate types the angel-slab is not so clearly a lid (the Pray manuscript being one such), but it is skewed, which I have interpreted either as the lid or the door of the tomb being “rolled away,” but could represent the Stone of Unction being thrown over by an earthquake, as daveb suggests.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 3:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135592","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"I would love to get the discussion back to what is this shadowy group that was sending out hidden messages about the Shroud that only a few, then  and now, could spot in the  Pray Codex.

The 16th / 17th century depictions had the sole purpose of portraying the Shroud, often for expositions.\nThe HPM artist was portraying the empty tomb scene. Consistent with the biblical narrative he needed to show the left-behind shroud. He didn’t need or want to show the fully laid out Shroud with all its detail.\nOf course, if he had recently seen the Shroud in Constantinople, and seen its very prominent blood stains and “poker holes” (pre-1500s fire) – he might have had reason to at least reference those, especially if they held some symbolic significance.   \nRefer this link below. Note how the poker holes seem to hold less significance as time moved on. Quite probably because visually they were so prominent pre- the fire, and conversely much less prominent after the fire:\nhttp://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/History/Western-European/manycopies.html\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135743","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"DM: “The flying carpet seems to me a joke, is it not? We are not in the 1001 nights.” \nMatt 28:2 has the angel sitting on the rock, that sealed the tomb, and which the earthquake has rolled aside.  [I’ve previously mentioned any number of instances where even moderate earthquakes in NZ and elsewhere will fling rocks from cliff faces and other outcrops several metres;  I think this explains what moved the rock well enough.]  I would have assumed that the artists portraying the scene of the women’s visit, would have done their homework and ought to have known that the angel was found sitting on the rock.  But they show him as sitting or standing on this rectangular object.  The gospel records that the tomb was sealed by a rock and there is no mention of a door.  Why should the angel be sitting on the door of the tomb, the door is not in the gospel and it’s not scriptural!  I agree that in some of the depictions this rectangle is shown clearly enough as the lid of the casket, and usually in those cases the casket or sarcophagus is also clearly present.  However in other cases where there is no sign of a casket or sarcophagus, the rectangle is often ambiguous, and there is no evident thickness indicating the solidity of a lid.  In a few cases this rectangle seems to be floating in the air with the angel perched atop it.  That is the only reason why I said it looked more like a flying carpet, the closest resemblance I could think of.  I am guessing that you would probably say that it is not meant to be the burial cloth,  But I don’t know that we can be so certain.  The images on the TS have sometimes been used to explain the appearance of the angel(s) and I think it’s possible that the ideas may be connected. \nNow on the HPM,  note the position of the angel’s foot. It indicates he is seated (the foot is placed well in front of him), and three lines are sketched at the extreme left of the picture, which suggest to me the bench or shelf on which he is sitting.  Furthermore, the oblique rectangle is set in front of the angel and in front of the women, and appears to be resting on the slab underneath, and it is placed in the bottom one-third of the lower picture.  That is why I say it is in the foreground.  You may call the underlying slab a sarcophagus; I say that it is not obvious as such.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 4:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135603","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Prominent relics of Constantine of the late 12th century are shown or alluded to in various HPM images:\n– the shroud\n– the red marble stone of unction which arrived in the city in 1180\n– the true cross\n– the 3 crucifixion nails\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 5:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135606","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"“The gospel records that the tomb was sealed by a rock and there is no mention of a door.” This is, of course, true, but the iconography of the Three Marys scenes does not derive directly from the gospels. The earliest versions, as I have described, do not show a cave sealed by a rock. They show a building, with a doorway. Occasionally the thing the angel is sitting or standing on looks like the door which might have stood in the doorway, and more often it looks like a big stone outside. It is often shown skewed, which may be a reference to the earthquake. The thing the angel sits on, and the thing associated with the tomb (first the temple alone, then the temple and included block or sarcophagus, then the temple with the block or sarcophagus outside, then the block or sarcophagus by itself) are the only two consistent architectural elements of the scene. The other elements are the angel or angels, the women, and the shroud. Very occasionally one or more of these elements is omitted, but where they are included, they are prominent. It is inconceivable that the angel-block would ever be reduced to a couple of lines. Perhaps if the picture was complete we would be able to see more – the entrance to the tomb-building perhaps – but as it is, they’re just lines.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135613","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"DaveB:\nI think it unfortunate that the debate seemed to reflect too much the personal agenda of the participants. Thus all non-authenticists have insisted that the HPM shows no connection with the TS, while all authenticists have insisted that it does. Clearly both sides have allowed their personal attitudes to authenticity to interpret the HPM. This is not the way to arrive at the truth of the matter.\n“all authenticists have insisted that it does”\nIt is not precise that I insisted that HPM in general must show connection with the Shroud. No. My article shows a different approach, approach that no sceptic has been able to undermine. I assumed that there is no direct connection between the HPM and the Shroud, and all similarities are random coincidences. Then I tested this hypothesis. It turned out that the chances that all the similarities A-F are simply random coincidences aree NEGLIGIBLE. So the conclusion of every reasonable person would be to reject that hypothesis. The HPM is based on the Shroud with estimated 99.9999 % significance -that is beyond even the most strict criteria.\nOf course sceptics want to deny this -but they can’t. They are not interested in arriving at the truth of the matter, but simply in DENIAL. Thus they talk nonsense about lids (which cannot change the conclusion in any way)-but as I will show in next post their approach is faulty. The problem is that you and several other pro-authenticity guys got engaged in the discussion about lids, tombs and Three Marys portrayal -and that’s mistake.

Sadly I’m not persuaded to change my mind, and quoting lists of possible ‘logical faults’ doesn’t help. Over the last few comments, i have outlined the development of the Three Marys icon. The subject is not an individual whim; most religious pictures illustrate particular, often well known gospel incidents, and cannot be considered in isolation from their pictorial forebears. Any picture, or sculpture, of the Crucifixion, the Deposition, the Lamentation, the Anointing, the Resurrection, the Three Marys, the ‘Noli Me Tangere,’ and many others, is to some extent derivative from what has gone before, and the Pray manuscript does not, to me, appear to be an exception.\nOf course, an image cannot be considered to belong to a class of images unless there are some generalisations which connect it to its genre. These are not sweeping generalisations or logical faults, they are the constituents which determine the nature of the image. We see that the Three Marys (or Quem Quaeritis) image has several fundamental constituents, which are common to the vast majority of the individual members of the class. There are at least three women, and at least one angel, and an angel-block and a tomb-block, and a shroud. Where these can be observed, then that is what they are. Occasionally one or two of the constituents are omitted, but where they are present, they are important parts of the composition. The Pray painting shows all of them. It is not therefore a sweeping generalisation to assume that the artist was depicting them. It would be a bold leap of fancy to suggest that one of the major constituents of the icon had been omitted or marginalised, and then replaced with something very similar which actually represented something else.\nIf these arguments are faulty, then I would be grateful if someone could point out where, with appropriate references, as I have done, rather than simply re-iterate opinions I disagree with.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 9:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135643","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"If these arguments are faulty, then I would be grateful if someone could point out where, with appropriate references, as I have done, rather than simply re-iterate opinions I disagree with.\nHugh, I have shown this in the post before ( July 6, 2014 at 8:08 am )\nAlthough discussion on the evolving Three Marys scene may be beneficial on its own, it does not apply to the one very specific case which the HPM is.

Those that are of interest for purposes of the argument must predate 1195.  Maybe there were 40 or so, but I haven’t bothered to count them. \nQ1:  How many showed four holes arranged in an ‘L’ shape on the rectangular object? A1: None.\nQ2:  How many showed a zigzag pattern on the rectangle?  A2: None.\nQ3:  How many showed red-coloured randomly placed streaks on the rectangle that might be interpreted as representing blood-stains?  A3: None.\nQ4:  How many include a naked prostrate Christ with crossed wrists across the groin? A4: None.  Objection – This relates to a Lamentation or Threnos scene not a Three Marys scene;  You need to refer to pre-1195 Threnos scenes.  But there are very few such Threnos scenes predating 1195. \nDevelopment: In what ways does the HPM illustration relate to other depictions of Three Marys?  There are three women present, with nimbi around their heads suggesting sanctity, one holding a vial presumably of spices, an angel is pointing to a vacant slab and seems to be giving them a message, there is a patterned oblique rectangle, all of which are consistent with earlier depictions of Three Marys.\nIn what ways does the HPM illustration not relate to other depictions? The draftsmanship is relatively crude, essentially an ink drawing with only limited use of two colours, primary red and blue without subtle hues or texture.  It is almost a cartoon style.  The illustration also includes a Threnos scene, not usually associated with Three Marys.  It also includes the features Q1 to Q4. \nAssessment:  Does the HPM have sufficient in common with other depictions for it to be related to them? Yes, particularly with the presence of the oblique rectangle.\nWhat is unique about the HPM illustration?  Its crude draftsmanship, inclusion of a Threnos scene and the features Q1 to Q4.\nWhat is significant about features Q1 to Q4?  They can all be related to the Turin Shroud.\nWhere else do these features occur?  Q2, Q3, Q4 frequently occur on epitaphioi from the 12th century onwards.  Many of these show a connection and knowledge of the Turin Shroud.  Q1 seldom appears before modern times.  \nConclusion:  Does the HPM illustration show a sufficient connection with the knowledge of features of the Turin Shroud?

But they show him as sitting or standing on this rectangular object. The gospel records that the tomb was sealed by a rock and there is no mention of a door. Why should the angel be sitting on the door of the tomb, the door is not in the gospel and it’s not scriptural!(…)  But I don’t know that we can be so certain. The images on the TS have sometimes been used to explain the appearance of the angel(s) and I think it’s possible that the ideas may be connected.\nNow on the HPM, note the position of the angel’s foot. It indicates he is seated (the foot is placed well in front of him), and three lines are sketched at the extreme left of the picture, which suggest to me the bench or shelf on which he is sitting. Furthermore, the oblique rectangle is set in front of the angel and in front of the women, and appears to be resting on the slab underneath, and it is placed in the bottom one-third of the lower picture. That is why I say it is in the foreground. You may call the underlying slab a sarcophagus; I say that it is not obvious as such.\nYour interpretation begins badly. There are three lines in the back of the angel, but the lower one is the edge of the lid/shroud. Then we have only two lines. And you have not answered my question. You repeat that these lines are a rock shelf (before was a bench) but you don’t explain how two simple lines can be interpreted as a rock shelf instead of a bench or an extension of the coffin (this is more according to the West Art tradition), or another else. Where can you see this rock shelf represented by two lines? How?\nThe angel’s feet are before the lid/shroud. The angel’s position (one leg bent and the other more extended) implies the classical angel seated on the lid or the sarcophagus, resting one foot on the lid. The other examples I put here indicate that the feet (at least one of them) are over the lid/shroud. This one is supported by the empty coffin/sarcophagus, as in the rest of representations at this time. All this obviously discards the “shroud” interpretation. I am ready to accept a correction of the most obvious interpretation but not without good reasons to do it.\nThe ancient illustrators of the Bible rarely were experts on the subject they were painting. They simply copied other images and sometimes added some personal incongruities. Some contradictory, or non biblical, features were repeated and sometimes magnified. For example: the Pray Codex includes two incompatible biblical traditions in the same drawing. In the first, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea are anointing Jesus’ body. This is John 19: 39. In the second, the Holy Women carry still more substances for anointing. This is Mark 16:1 or Luke 24:1. This is an unlikely double anointing that the illustrator of de Pray Codex put together without any objection.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2014 at 1:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135838","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"David Mo – yes, the HPM artist tries to reconcile a number of gospel discrepancies within one drawing.

In the Pray manuscript the twisted block is most likely the lid and the other block most likely the sarcophagus. My discussion was really about how this “lid and sarcophagus” design evolved from the “stone and temple” design. Placing exteme examples of each genre next to each other one could think the evolution absurd, rather like putting a whale next to its dog-like forebear, but by showing all the intervening links (easier with the Three Marys than with the whale!) the connection becomes clear. The Pray manuscript is an intermediate form, when the precise designations of the two slabs were often indistinct.\nI’ve no idea what any original rock or stone might have been. The gospels stay “stone” so a stone was drawn. A stone shaped a bit like an altar might actually have been there (many are drawn with a larger surface area on top than at base and trapezoidal sides), and it may have been replaced by the current stone, which is rectangular but I dont know how thick (It seems to be 60cm or so, but it might just be a thin slab lying on somerhing). I have called these slabs the “Stone of Unction” more for ease of nomenclature than because I thought they were actually used for annointing. If there was any annointing not done in situ on the burial shelf, it could have been on another shelf or the floor or a wooden table for all I know.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2014 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135855","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Daveb:\nSeveral galleries of Three Mary depictions have been shown.

There is no sign of any of the distinctive features of the Shroud in the Pray Codex, the size of the Shroud, its dual images and its bloodstains. We know that the artist was not aware of the bloodstains as he did not show them on the body of Christ.\nThe arguments for the presence of the Shroud have got weaker and weaker with time. We now have an inept artist who apparently knew of the Shroud, wanted to show it but didn’t have the space or ability to do so. It has even been accepted that the L holes are not even the right way round to represent the actual  damage on the Shroud – which for some unknown reason became more important for the artist  to show than the spiritual features that made the Shroud significant for the believer .\nAnd then there is the shoddy maths,as yet unsupported by anyone on either side of the argument.\nSo while this is obviously a lid rather than a Shroud that has received more than its fair share of starch, this is really a sideshow.\nJust look at the Shroud, let’s say in its earliest confirmed depiction, the Lirey Pilgrim badge, with its very distinct images. Just look at the Codex with its laying out of Christ in a pose already represented in the west before this . No obvious similarities – or is the earlier laying out scene in the Klosterneuberg  monastery example ( Austria) with crossed arms also based on the Shroud?\nAnd after all this, the Pray Codex does nothing either way to show that the Shroud is first century – even if it is there, it only says that it might have been made before 1195.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2014 at 3:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135854","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"One thing that has been underestimated or ignored in this debate is the degree to which an object which is not considered a relic is still accepted as an object of veneration.In the east, this was ,of course, typical of most icons, except for the few of the Virgin and Child that were considered to have been hand painted by Luke. \nSo far as the Catholic Church is concerned the Shroud is a classic example. The Church authorities believed that it was a cloth on which the images had been painted but they still authorised it as an object of veneration – even when it was still in situ in Lirey. This tells us that they did not believe that it was a deliberate fake or they would have ordered it destroyed. \nThe document I would love to discover is the one that tells us why the Church considered it a worthy object of veneration even though they believed it to be recent painting.

This may have been because, as with many icons, some miracle had been associated with it, irrespective of when it was actually made.\nAs those of you who have read the, essential for me at least, Beldon Scott, will know after the failed attempt in the 1350s to have the Shroud accepted as a genuine relic, it only re-emerges a such when the Savoys have it and probably its acceptance by Carlo Borromeo in 1578 in Turin was the crucial moment  when it aroused widespread support from the masses, despite the Church’s continual refusal, to this day, to accept it as any more than an object of veneration.\nThe idea that I have come across that it is either authentic or a clever forgery does not hold water. Objects of veneration , spiritual artefacts usually associated with some apparently miraculous event, were very common in this period and this is clearly how the Catholic Church saw and continues to see the Shroud.

I don’t see any. \nOn the rectangular object under de angel’s feet: Idem and idem plus: if this rectangular object is the same as the some early and Byzantine images of the Rock of Anointing, this says nothing in support of the sindonist thesis.

It can be described as sweeping generalization (a dicto simpliciter see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicto_simpliciter)\nThe fact that large number of Three Marys scenes does not mean that similar rectangle in HPM must also be a slab -and it isn’t. I showed this many times -the presence of a bench on which angel is sitting refutes allegations that this rectangle is a slab. Then it seems that this rectangle is indeed the Shroud.Anyway, the exceptional case of HPM precludes making any generalizations -which shows that practically all sceptcs’ arguments are faulty\nAnd of course it does not change in any way the conclusion from my probabilistic approach, presented in article above.”\n You repeat that these lines are a rock shelf (before was a bench) but you don’t explain how two simple lines can be interpreted as a rock shelf instead of a bench or an extension of the coffin\nIt cannot be extension of the red-crossed “coffin” -it is a different angle on a different level, and has no crosses.

There are several fallacies and even contradictions in his comments. They are a distraction and to be discussed adequately need a new thread.  Most of them merely reflect his own subjective viewpoint. \n1) The Lirey badge is a western representation of the Shroud.  Byzantines didn’t do that sort of thing.  Scavone provides comprehensive Byzantine documentation on the burial cloths, and also covering the question of difficulties of interpretation of these various documents.  The Byzantine response as reported by various western visitors was clearly one of veneration.  The Byzantine artistic response to discovery of the Shroud image was to design epitaphioi for use in their Easter liturgies, an appropriate religious response. \n2) Charles asserts that there are no signs of distinctive features of the Shroud.  That is his viewpoint but it has not been conceded by the authenticist camp. \n3) His interpretation of the western history of the Shroud is garbled by his own predispositions against it.  It draws on the fable of a non-existent memorandum said to have been sent by Bishop Pierre D’Arcis to Avignon anti-pope Clement VII from a story concocted by Jesuit Herbert Thurston and by Ulysse Chevalier, and is now discredited.  Clement VII ordered D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under threat of excommunication.\nRef: “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD”; By Jack Markwardt; 2001\nExamines Chevalier & Thurston’s attempt to misrepresent D’Arcis memorandum.\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf \n4) First western showings of Shroud at Lirey 1356, badge with De Charnay (dexter) and De Vergy (sinister) arms;  1356, 28 May Bishop Henri (Troyes) praises Geoffrey I for founding of Lirey church with canons; 19 Sep Geoffrey I killed at Poitiers;  1389, Geoffrey II displays cloth as “True Shroud of Jesus”, prompts D’Arcis complaints, royal officers seek seizure of Shroud but are foiled; 1398 Geoffrey II dies, Shroud passes to Margaret De Charnay; despite two marriages remains childless; From 1418 annual displays on Doubs River; 1443-47 Lirey canons seek return of Shroud but unsuccessful; 1449 Margaret De Charnay displays Shroud at Liege Belgium, 1452 at Macon; 1453, still childless she only then decides to pass it on to House of Savoy, receives castle and estate from Duke Louis; 1457 Margaret threatened with excommunication if she does not return Shroud to Lirey canons, Duke Louis negotiates compensation; 1460 Margaret De Charnay dies.  In 1464, Francesco della Rovere (later Pope Sixtus IV) writes book, refers to Shroud kept by Savoy, ‘coloured with the blood of Christ’.  ); 1506 – Pope Julius II assigns Shroud own feast day of 4 May, many subsequent public showings on this day.  \n5) Relics do not require an associated miracle to be declared authentic.  They merely require adequate certification of provenance associated with a holy person or place, such as part of a saint’s body or clothing.  Certified miracles have sometimes been associated with specific relics.  In the case of the Shroud, it is venerated as an icon, which may well be an authentic relic if it was ever adequately corroborated as the burial cloth of Christ, or if Science is ever able to confirm that the image was not made by human hands, which remains a particularly difficult scientific challenge.  Hence the present prudent caution. Church evidently sees authenticity as a matter of science and other scholarship.  The Shroud is not regarded as part of the “Deposit of Faith essential to salvation”;  The Church may at some future date make a declaration on the Shroud when more is known, but such a statement would not be binding on members of the Catholic Church as an article of essential belief.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2014 at 7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135918","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Daveb .you have failed to spot my point : that the Catholic Church has never accepted that the Shroud is a genuine relic but it has allowed and encouraged it to be venerated. The question is why. It certainly shows that the Church regards it as more than a mere forgery. The question is what it believed it to be in the 1390s.\nThe question is also at what point it was first venerated. Kennedy’s introduction to his book on de Charny’s Chivalry suggests that it was an icon that Jeanne de Charny transformed into a relic while her husband was away on campaign. A possibility certainly and this would imply an earlier tradition of veneration. So my point so far as THIS posting is concerned is that even if, and I can see no sign of it, the Pray Codex showed the Shroud, it may mean no more that it had achieved the same status as hundreds of other icons.\nAre you saying that the papal document allowing the Shroud to be exhibited by Geoffrey de  Charny II at Lirey on condition that it was announced beforehand that it was not a genuine relic  does not exist or is a forgery or that such expositions did not take place? This seems to me to be the first document that sets in place the attitude the Church has had to the Shroud ever since and later documents fall within this tradition.  The point is that here the Church asserted firmly that it was NOT the genuine burial shroud. No sitting on the fence here as you suggest.\nBut I agree that the fundamental question as to why the Church accepted the veneration of the Shroud in the 1390s and did not condemn it as a forgery does need separate discussion ,not least to overthrow the old dichotomy that that Shroud must either be authentic or a forgery. Clearly the Church did not believe it was either and this needs further exploration.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2014 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-135925","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"O.K.:\nDo you remember that?\n“Large frequency of congruences in a population indicates a model”.\nThis is correct.

The artist never goes to the canvas or the stone with his mind in blank. Specially in the Ancient Art, the artist has passed by a learning process, he has seen other representations of his subject and carries in his mind a model as an iconic structure. This model is dominant even when he is trying to copy an object. (For the concept of iconic structure see my previous comment).\nThis model is easily detectable (not always easily) when comparing a relevant set of works of art. (“congruences in a population”)\nThe individual model (an object) can exist, but it is weighed up by the iconic rules of the structure. In the medieval Art the individual model (another painting, a man) are almost ever undetectable. A few portraits exist as exception. In general, and this is valid even for a genius as Giotto, the structure is predominant. The genius works into the framework of the structure.

The point is that the chance for randon accumulation of so many scarce traits, similar to those spotted on the Shroud, is really negligible.

First of all, you don’t have “6” features, but 3 at most, because whatever appears on the tomb lid is irrelevant to the question of the shroud. Even supposing you establish the uniqueness of the tomb lid there is still the brute fact that it’s not the shroud.\nBut the rest of your features don’t fare much better. Cut-off legs don’t count (explained in a comment above), so that’s 2. Nakedness and 4 fingers are not independent, so that’s 1…\n“This is is the part of the job you sceptics have done for me”\nDoesn’t work that way, sorry. The research is still up to you.

And nudity is the key feature here, not crossed hands (maybe I didn’t explained that in the article clear enough).”\nYou didn’t get this one, I’m afraid. It’s not about the crossed hands. It’s about whether nudity is independent from 4 fingers.\nNudity is correlated with crossed hands, that’s a fact (because nudity needs to be covered – and if not with a cloth, then with crossed hands, unless we imagine some Austin Powers-like visual devices which surely weren’t in use back then ;) ). And it seems that crossed hands are correlated with 4 fingers. So it seems that nudity is correlated with 4 fingers and thus cannot be treated as an independent variable. Again, not a 100% proven fact, but the images I found are enough for a decent prior probability. It’s up to you to refute this.\n“Because you selected those images.”\nI didn’t really have to try hard to select the images, most are from the first Google Image search pages. But in any case that’s hardly an answer.\nWhy is the thumb absent or barely visible on the images I selected?\n“None of your illustrations show full nudity like in the Codex Pray.”\nWhich is relevant how? Where the images are not nude, they still have crossed hands which seem to be correlated with 4 fingers. Where the images *are* nude, they *almost necessarily* have the crossed hands, and so there still seems to be the correlation between nakedness and 4 fingers. That is, where Jesus is naked, we expect with extremely high probability that his hands will be crossed over the genital area, and with a decent probability that they will lack thumbs.\n“It doesn’t really matter whether 1 in 20, 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000. The point is that the chance for randon accumulation of so many scarce traits, similar to those spotted on the Shroud, is really negligible.”\nOh, but it does matter. E.g. 10^-3.9 may be small, but it is still much better than 10^-6. (Not that I would agree with this number for the reasons outlined above.)\nSo you still owe us the reasonable probabilities and not simply something taken out of thin air.\n“I took into account such possibility -but the whole reasoning is totally irrelevant on that, as it doesn’t assume whether the rectangle on the lower illustration is lid or the Shroud,”\nWell, that’s the fatal flaw, because if what we see is a lid (and it is a lid) then none of the probabilities matter. \n“or anything (just the potential possibility of it being the shroud is enough).”\nThere is no such realistic possibility. The comparative analysis with the iconography of the same era shows that the rectangle could only be a lid, while the shroud is never portrayed as a huge hard rectangle and certainly not under the angel’s feet (what is often portrayed under the angel’s feet is, again, the tomb lid). In fact, the shroud is present on both illustrations, on the top one it’s below Jesus, on the bottom one it lies on the tomb lid. This fully corresponds to the traditional iconography of the era, where the shroud takes relatively little place after the resurrection since it’s all bunched up. So there is simply no question of the rectangle being anything but the lid. If you will be consistent and apply your probability analysis to this particular issue (how many images show the shroud as a rectangle, etc., etc.), you might see this. I’m afraid that probability will be astronomically lower even that the one you have calculated above.\n“Besides the bench I found and on which the angel is sitting clearly disproves it being a lid:”\nThat’s a non sequitur. Whatever the angel is sitting on has no bearing whatsoever on the rectangle being a shroud or a lid. Although I also disagree that he necessarily sits on a bench, just because there is something drawn there doesn’t mean he sits on that something. Although he might. Doesn’t make a difference.\n\n","date":"March 2, 2015 at 8:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192254","author":"Skeptic","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"So ‘Skeptic”, I start the list of your errors:\nWell, that’s the fatal flaw, because if what we see is a lid (and it is a lid) then none of the probabilities matter. \nThere is no such realistic possibility.

Together with the legs, the angel’s wing, text above, etc.\nThe fact is that the legs are indeed cropped there. This is undisputed coincidence with the Shroud. We don’t bother about any possible alternative explanation for the presence of key traits A-F. The very presence of rare non-trivial coincidences with the Shroud is important here. \nThe folio is trimmed, I agree. I saw this long before you joined this discussion. But it is irrelevant here. It is of course possible that the crop of the legs is merely accidental. But this could have been as well deliberate decision of the illustrator who put the legs on the very margin to be cut while trimming. So the point C is still valid.\n“Because you selected those images.”\nI didn’t really have to try hard to select the images, most are from the first Google Image search pages. But in any case that’s hardly an answer.\nWhy is the thumb absent or barely visible on the images I selected?\nBecause you have selected those images with invisible or hardly visible thumbs. You have admitted this here. Thus the whole your reasoning is invalid, as you introduce bias by selecting the images that favor your claims.\nBesides lack of thumbs is something different, much stronger than “hardly visible thumbs” or thumbs obscured by geometric perspective. There is no obvious rationale for portraying 4 fingers on the entombment illustration in the Codex Pray, except that illustrator desired to do so for some reason.\nNudity is correlated with crossed hands, that’s a fact (because nudity needs to be covered – and if not with a cloth, then with crossed hands, unless we imagine some Austin Powers-like visual devices which surely weren’t in use back then ;) ). And it seems that crossed hands are correlated with 4 fingers. So it seems that nudity is correlated with 4 fingers and thus cannot be treated as an independent variable. \nThis whole reasoning is obviously wrong. Your own illustration shows why:\n\nHere we have crossed hands, yet no nudity, as the loincloth is clearly visible. And there are 5 fingers visible on each hand.\nRemember correlation is not the same as implication, although they are related. And implication can go either way, but not necessary both. Nudity implies crossed hands (to cover genitals) of course, so there is correlation between nudity and crossed hands. But crossed hands does not imply nudity nor 4 fingers..\nOh, but it does matter. E.g. 10^-3.9 may be small, but it is still much better than 10^-6. (Not that I would agree with this number for the reasons outlined above.)\nBut 10^-3.9  (close to 1 in 1000) is a small number, even if two orders of magnitude larger than 10^-6. it is close to null -and that’s the main point. The odds for finding 6 tiny features that reasonably coincide with the Shroud just by chance is remarkably small. Small enough to reject it by any reasonable criteria. And that’s the conclusion of the article, which you have been unable to refute.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192288","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"“The fact is that the legs are indeed cropped there.

The conflict of the “debate(?)” above illustrates how unproductive dogmatic statements concerning the Shroud can become, and from whatever side adduces them.  I personally consider that the Pray illustration is highly suggestive of Shroud influences, and may well be indicative of its earlier presence and sighting in Constantinople by King Bela III of Hungary.  As a past master of probability theory, most of which I’ve now forgotten, I consider it an error to arbitrarily designate numerical probabilities to events however rare they might be.  Quantitatively, I consider the probabilities meaningless.  But I consider them qualitatively highly significant. \nBela’s older brother Stephen III succeeded to the Hungarian kingship in 1162, upon which Bela moved to Constantinople in 1163, was given the name Alexios by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and was betrothed to the emperor’s daughter Maria, and was designated heir in 1165.  As such he would have had access to the imperial relic collection.  Assuming that the Shroud was part of that collection he would doubtless have seen it.  The betrothal to Maria was dissolved in 1169 upon the birth of her brother, and Bela was deprived of his titles being demoted to kaiser only. \nIn 1172, Stephen III died, and Bela returned to Hungary and was crowned king there in 1173, surviving until 1196.  \nThere are a number of art works preceding the Hungarian Pray codex, depicting the visit of the Holy Women.  They all follow a surprisingly similar pattern.  The skewed rectangle is inevitably recognised as a casket lid.  However the Pray Codex illustration almost seems to be the first that includes a prostate naked Christ with arms crossed over his groin, and only four fingers visible on each hand.  Whence did the concept of this representation come?  Given Bela’s presumed familiarity with the imperial relic collection, it requires little to make a judgment that it was very likely the Shroud image which he had seen in Constantinople.  It is unlikely that he himself was the artist, more likely some monk who may have been advised by Bela. \nThe drawing itself is somewhat crude in its execution.  The sides of the rectangle are not straight as one would expect a tomb lid to be, nor are they symmetrical about their centre-line, a poor piece of carpentry indeed.  Conceivably they may represent the cloth of the Shroud, but it cannot be so stated dogmatically.  The zigzag pattern may be a representation of the herring-bone twill of the Shroud.  The small cloth resting upon it, might wrap a head, but certainly not a whole body.  It would be the only tomb-lid ever drawn with four poker holes drilled in it in the shape of an L.   \nThe Pray Codex drawing is persuasive of it including Shroud-like features.  It is certainly not conclusive, but it cannot be so lightly dismissed as not significant.  I personally consider that the illustration was inspired by Shroud-like features at some time before 1196.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 6:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192328","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"“The skewed rectangle is inevitably recognised as a casket lid.”\nThank you for agreeing. Even if you contradict yourself in the next paragraph, for there is no chance that this rectangle is anything but the lid. One need not do more than compare this with other miniatures.\nIn fact, one need not do more than compare the top and the bottom images, because the shroud at the top looks nothing like the rectangle at the bottom.\nOh and this: “The small cloth resting upon it, might wrap a head” – like some others, you have fallen into a trap of not studying the provided links. You can see clearly that on some of them both the covering and the shroud appear, and both are very small and “bunched up”. Moreover, it can easily be that the cloth on that image is supposed to extend up to the red zig-zag lines, i.e. the area with the crosses may belong to the shroud. Be that as it may, this has no bearing on the function of the rectangle.\n“It would be the only tomb-lid ever drawn with four poker holes drilled in it in the shape of an L.”\nThat they’re holes is an interpretation in need of evidence. They’re circles, decorative elements beloved by the master of the Pray codex. These circles are everywhere. In fact, there are also 5 circles on the sarcophagus – which believers interpret as the second half of the shroud, thereby receiving an obvious contradiction, because the real Shroud has 4 holes on both sides.\nConclusion: there is no evidence tying the Pray codex to the shroud of Turin. Personal feelings aside, it certainly cannot be used to disprove the carbon dating.\n\n","date":"March 4, 2015 at 12:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192346","author":"Skeptic","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Supposedly inspired  from the shroud’s image, but I can’t see any moustache, any beard … Jesus has 4 fingers, but the other guys drawn by the artist ( a very bad artist by the way) also have 4 fingers.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 10:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192338","author":"PHPL","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Sometimes the most obvious is so invisible… So thanks for this insight.

Also above, if you haven’t found them yet (David Mo on July 1, 2014 at 2:30 am) is another superb collection of links by David Mo.\nLooked at as a whole, it is fascinating to watch the various architectural features of the scene gradually alter over the years. In particular, the rectangular element usually placed at a ridiculously odd angle across the sarcophagus may have begun life as the door of a temple, the blocking stone of the tomb or the anointing stone before taking up its familiar job as the lid of the coffin itself. Often it is sufficiently indistinct to suggest several interpretations at once. (The Shroud itself, of course, is not one of those interpretations).\nIn an interesting form of atavism, I have seen some recent Three Marys icons in which, although there is no cave, temple or tomb, the angel is sitting on a round stone, right next to a rectangular sarcophagus. Anyone unfamiliar with the gospel narratives could have no idea why it was there.\nAnd finally, why is the slab often at such an absurd angle?

Hence my comments attacking dogmatism whether by fellow religionists concerning Pray Codex illustrations or by skeptics who place their faith in uncritical pseudo-scientism.  \nWe do not have an 8th century altar cloth that mimics the Shroud image, but there are early references implying the significance of the burial cloths and what they might have been or appeared to be.

This liturgy is “intimately associated with and possibly even partly rewritten” by Leandro, the Bishop of Seville, who, while serving in Constantinople from 579 to 582, would likely have learned that the emperor was in possession of a burial cloth which bore the imprints of Jesus’ dead body.  \nThe references indicate that the burial cloths and their likely survival were considered significant from a very early stage in the history of Christianity.  There are also many other independent references.  The hints and clues seen on the Pray Codex illustration is only one other such.  Hence the authenticity of the Turin Shroud may be seen as a rational belief.  I do not see that placing one’s entire faith in an extremely suspect radiocarbon dating showing the contrary, is nearly so rational.\n\n","date":"March 4, 2015 at 2:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192421","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Yawn.

Psychopath is a new one. However, I believe Skeptic, whoever he be, is correct about the nature of the architectural elements of the Pray Codex, and I believe that there is ample evidence to demonstrate that. The squabbles over whether the markings are ‘texture’ or ‘design’ seem to me slightly petty – OK and Nabber are correct in that the zig-zags on the tomb-lid are not random squiggles, while the markings on most of the other Three Marys depictions usually are, but I believe that all of them are attempts to depict the actual nature of a specific slab of stone, through direct observation, imitation of others, or report, which probably consisted of veined marble. I do not think that four or five concentric ‘circles’ of zig-zag lines look anything like herring-bone weave; I do not believe that anybody attempting to depict herring-bone weave would come up with concentric circles as a method of depicting them, and I do not believe that anybody attempting to illustrate the Shroud of Turin would plant it as an irregularly placed rectangle, across a tomb, with an angel standing on it, in exact imitation of generations of ‘tomb-lid’ depictions from similar scenes over the previous few centuries.\n\n","date":"March 6, 2015 at 2:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192595","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"I’m not saying that the zig-zags are random squiggles.

There are in my opinion too many highly suggestive links for a Shroud influence to be rejected outright, at least as a credible possibility.  But as I’ve indicated above I don’t see that such an influence can be asserted dogmatically.  Nor do I believe can it be rejected. \nThere are strong arguments for the Shroud being part of the Imperial Relic collection.  If so, it is certain that Bela III, as imperial heir-designate pro tem would have seen it at some time between 1165 and 1169, and it would have left him with an enduring impression.  In 1172 he returned to Hungary and assumed the kingship.  Some 20 years later, the Codex emerged.  Any links with what Bela had seen may have been assisted with crude sketches from what was now a distant memory, so that exactitude could hardly be expected. \nThe visitation of the Three Marys to the empty tomb follows a long tradition of known art works in the West, where a tomb lid was commonly shown as an oblique rectangle.  The depiction of the preparation for burial as shown does not follow such an established tradition.  It may well be the first western depiction of a prostrate naked Christ in the manner shown.  It certainly shows some remarkable correspondences with the Shroud image.  I think this is sufficient to admit the likelihood of other recognisable Shroud-like features in a modified version of what had become a standardised Visitation illustration.  \nOK has proposed that the rectangle is now to be seen as the Shroud resting on the tomb, the oblique angle being a crude attempt to represent a type of perspective.  Perspective in art was known to a few of the ancient Greeks, but its knowledge had been lost.  This knowledge was rediscovered by the Florentine Brunelleschi (1377-1446) and later codified in Genoa by Alberti (1404-1472).  so that attempts at depicting depth in any art form as early as the end of the 12th century still remained crude.  Therefore OK’s proposition may be thought credible.  \nYour presumption that the herring-bone weave is asserted as being represented by concentric circles is I think a distortion.  What I believe has been asserted is that the weave is represented by the zigzag pattern.  The five small circles arranged as an L echo the Shroud poker holes whose known origin is lost to history.  Nor do I see the angel as standing or sitting on the “tomb lid”.  The gospel accounts merely say with some variance that the women saw the angel(s) where Jesus had lain, and that is represented in the picture. \nI think there are sufficient indications to admit the possibility of a link with the Shroud.  It is my personal belief that they do.  But as previously stated I can agree that it cannot be asserted dogmatically as such.  But nor do I believe can it be rejected.  Can any further argument advance the debate?  I believe not, and perhaps that is where it should rest.\n\n","date":"March 6, 2015 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192605","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"“Your presumption that the herring-bone weave is asserted as being represented by concentric circles is I think a distortion.

Formal grounds:\na) The author did not provide any justification for his probability estimates.\nb) The author did not provide any justification for treating his probabilities as independent, which can only be established through actual statistical research of the contemporary iconography.\nFor example, there is a probable connection between nudity and 4 fingers (a nude figure will almost certainly be exhibited with crossed hands, and there is an abundance of images from different eras with crossed hands which lack thumbs; indeed, the person anointing Jesus’ body in the top image on f.28 of the Pray codex also lacks a thumb while his hand is in the position similar to that of Jesus; thus it is not proven that nudity and 4 fingers can be treated independently for the purpose of estimating probabilities).\n2. Substantial grounds:\na) The author claims the cropping of Jesus’ feet as a significant coincidence with the Shroud of Turin, yet there are two facts that undermine this conclusion:\na1) We know that as a rule medieval manuscripts had very wide margins, because the scribes knew that their books would be rebound and trimmed several times in the next  few centuries. It is thus extremely improbable that the current very narrow margins are the original margins, give or take a few mm.\na2) We know that the Pray codex *was* trimmed, because it has some marginal text neatly cropped, which means that the manuscript as a whole did undergo this standard treatment.\nIt is thus the default fact-based assumption that the original margins were a few cm wider than what we have now. This assumption must be proven false before one ascribes any significance to the cropped feet and uses them in any probability estimates.\nThe author has failed to do this.\nb) The image has to be interpreted first and foremost in the light of the contemporary iconography. A comparison with other medieval manuscripts demonstrates that the bottom picture on f. 28 of the Pray codex shows three Marys standing behind the cross-adorned sarcophagus, with the angel having his feet on the lid of this same sarcophagus. The contemporary iconography allows for no other interpretation, various fishy analogies notwithstanding.\nc) The author’s claim that the pyramid-like pattern on the tomb lid refers to the herringbone weave pattern is false, because it looks nothing like the actual herringbone weave pattern, which looks like a series of parallel straight fish bones. Hence this alleged coincidence is also imaginary.\nd) The author’s claim that the tomb lid is actually the Shroud of Turin is also refuted by comparing the top and the bottom pictures on f.28: the top picture shows Jesus’ shroud, which, with its numerous folds and without any pattern, looks nothing like the rigid patterned rectangle on the bottom image.\ne) The author only takes into account what he thinks are convergent features, while ignoring the divergent features in his probability estimates. These divergent features include:\ne1) Lack of the image on the alleged shroud.\ne2) Lack of the actual herringbone pattern on the alleged shroud.\ne3) Lack of the corresponding pattern on the second half of the shroud (which is actually a depiction of the sarcophagus).\ne4) The different number of circles on the two alleged halves of the shroud (4 and 5).\ne5) Lack of wounds on Jesus’ body.\ne6) Jesus’ hands are crossed at the wrists (or even above them), not at all like the hands on the shroud.\nConclusion: the author failed to show that his probability estimate is valid. Moreover, it has been shown that the rectangles on the bottom image of folio 28 in the Pray codex refer to the sarcophagus and its lid, not to the two halves of the shroud. The discussion about the Pray codex and its relation to the Shroud is now over.\n\n","date":"March 6, 2015 at 11:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192631","author":"Skeptic","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Mr Skeptic, your obsession on me is really boring.\na) The author did not provide any justification for his probability estimates.\nThe author makes a rough estimation of probability assuming plausible order of frequency for each feature -1/100 for the simplicity of calculation.

Stiff upper lip and turn the other cheek and all that. Although you will find that 90% or more of the personal abuse on this site is directed from authenticists to non-authenticists (and sometimes to themselves), we damage our reputation by stooping to their level. I’m certain that OK and Nabber are pillars of their communities, and if they lack the cold unemotional rigour of non-authenticist analysis, perhaps they are more fun to be with at a party.\nIt may be instructive to explore why this one way abuse should be the case. We must remember that most authenticists begin with a belief and work from there to the evidence, whereas most non-authenticists begin with the evidence and work from there to determine the truth. This is not invariably true – Barrie Schwortz and Ray Rogers are shining examples of those who came to their convictions from the evidence, and (beg pardon if I malign him) I think Joe Nickell was convinced the Shroud was a fake long before he investigated it in any depth.\nBut being generally so, I think it the case that authenticists have convictions, whereas non-authenticists have conclusions, and it is more emotionally upsetting to have one’s convictions challenged than one’s conclusions. This is why authenticists are more passionate, less logical, and more abusive. My advice is to forgive them; they know not what they do.\nNor must we deny that there are peculiarities in the Pray Codex pictures which we cannot explain. The stepped pyramids (yes, alright, ‘circles’ was an oversimplification) and the polystaurion tomb are reasonably enough derived from Constantine’s Holy Sepulchre, but the three diagonal crosses are anomalous and were clearly not a mistake. They mean something, and so do the little circles which accompany them. Just because we reject their identity with features on the Shroud does not mean that we can ignore them altogether.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2015 at 11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192702","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Yours are words of wisdom, but I am only human.

Let me explain.\nIf the upper rectangle is a lid (Proposition A= true) then the lower rectangle is necessarily the sarcophagus (Proposition B = true).\nA (true) implies B (true). Do you agree ?\nThe skeptics thinks that the upper rectangle cannot be anything else than a lid.\nIt is true that the rectangular shape of this object strongly suggests that it is a lid.\nBut it is also true that , in the context of medieval paintings and illuminations of this particular event, the lids (when present) are not similar to the ‘lid’ of the Pray Codex.\nThey are always depicted as an homogeneous rectangle and very often, their three-dimensional properties are obvious.\nTo the contrary the upper rectangle of the Pray Codex is bi-dimensional (flat) and heterogeneous (two parts with something which can be interpreted as a stylized herringbone weave, the other part with crosses).   \nTherefore we can not know with certainty what is the upper rectangle.\nIn this case, I suggest to test the hypothesis: If B is not true then A is not true.\nLogically, this proposition is strictly equivalent to the previous one: If A is true then B is true. \nIn other words, if the lower rectangle is not a sarcophagus, then, the upper rectangle is not the lid of this sarcophagus.\nTherefore the question is now: does the lower rectangle of the Pray Codex represent a sarcophagus or not ?  \nI have uploaded the 70 first pictures cited in David Mo:\nhttps://sombraenelsudario.wordpress.com/2014/08/10/las-santas-mujeres-en-la-tumba-vacia-imagenes/\nThanks to you David for this work.\nIf you look at ALL these pictures, you will discover that in almost all the pictures the sarcophagus is clearly depicted as a sarcophagus. I mean a 3D object that is immediately understood as the sarcophagus of Christ (in this context).\nAt this time (XI-XV century), the painters were truly able to represent the 3D properties of an object via some kind of perspective (even a naive perspective).\nI only could find 4 pictures in which the sarcophagus is depicted as a flat 2D rectangle.\nBut in these cases, the painter used some ‘trick’ so that the observer immediately understands that this object is in fact a 3D object.\nThe fact is that there is nothing in the lower triangle of the Pray Codex suggesting a 3D object, i.e a sarcophagus. This is the key point.\nAs shown by the other paintings in the Pray Codex, the author of the Pray Codex was certainly not an amateur.\nIn other words, if the author of the Pray Codex wanted to depict the sarcophagus in the lower rectangle, he would have used beyond any doubt some kind of 3D representation.\nTherefore, the lower rectangle can not be a representation of a sarcophagus.\nTherefore the upper rectangle can not be the lid of this sarcophagus. \nSo what is it ?\nSkeptic asked: ‘ But anyhow: do you think the two rectangles represent the two halves of the shroud?’\nMy answer: yes.\nMore later….\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 3:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192817","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Heimburger: “Therefore, the lower rectangle can not be a representation of a sarcophagus.” If so, where is the sarcophagus?

I don’t think so. All of the paintings (even the most naive) shows that at the time everybody could represent more or less a 3D object. The high (the third dimension) of an object is always shown and obvious. For example, on the Pray Codex (upper scene), we can see that the author was able to represent the 3D (the high)  of the table.\n2) The painter was sure that, despite the lack of 3D characteristics, his lower rectangle would be interpreted as the sarcophagus. I cannot eliminate this hypothesis.\n3) Although the whole scene is a ” three Mary scene”, the upper and lower rectangles does not represent the sarcophagus and the lid but Christ’s shroud. After all, the shroud was in the empty tomb. \nLet’s try to interpret the Pray Codex this way: the Angel shows Christ’s shroud, not the sarcophagus.\nMore later…\n\n","date":"March 9, 2015 at 4:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192986","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"Is the angel sitting on the edge of the empty sarcophagus?\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-192827","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?","post":"I think that what makes the strength of the Shroud of Turin myth is that it (the Shroud) is now  very old and in a very bad condition.

When a medieval painter wants to paint a lid, he paints a lid according the iconic conventions of his epoch. The medieval conventions imply that the lid of the Three Marys scene was often represented as a rectangle and the angel seated on it. This is just what you can see at the Pray codex.\nA medieval painter doesn’t paint trails of blood as broken lines (there were other conventional signs for blood) and I don’t know why he would paint a herringbone (bone of fish) as pyramids and a holes series in form of P in order to imitate some holes that had not any form of P. This sounds amazing. (And I leave aside the many differences between the Shroud and the picture of the Codex Pray in more relevant aspects).\nThere are two possible accounts of this: the painter of the Codex Pray was absolutely crazy or the Codex Pray bears no relation to the Shroud. I prefer the latter, obviously.\nYou can see a lot of images of the Three Marys and the burial of Christ in my blog. If you find some similar things to the “representations” of the Shroud in the Pray Codex you could say me, please.

Some of these are seldom discussed:\n1. Just look at the top image. I really think it is so representative of the image of Christ that we see on the Shroud. Naked, positioning of limbs etc.\n2. Red mark above the eye? Really just a coincidental mark?\n3. Shapely, almost feminine thighs? Another coincidental similarity?\n4. High chest\n5. Along with the asymmetrical 4 circles / holes, skeptics need to explain the two red streaks on the lower image. I think it is totally insufficient to just ascribe these as some sort of random decorative features. Neither make sense from that perspective.     \n6. Skeptics claim continuity with artistic tradition but there are several departures from artistic tradition (as mentioned above). A very curious departure is the ‘floating head’ next to the sleeve of one of the women, seemingly connected back to the shroud via a floating letter   / symbol. I really don’t know what this symbolises – I can hazard some guesses. At the very least, it shows a lot of symbolism in the mind of the artist – this artist is not one who simply wishes to convey literal depictions. This is very important when considering potential meaning behind the PM.  \nPoints 1-4 can be argued as co-incidences. I accept that. Points 5 and 6, in my opinion, cannot be so easily dismissed.

I was particularly searching for examples from Eastern Europe, of which there seemed very few indeed.  I noted a singular Turkish example, but it was quite elemental, almost crude and conveyed little.  I would have liked to have seen a few examples from about the Balkans, a little closer to Hungary. \nOne striking example was from Bohemia.  It did include an empty sarcophagus, with just a few cloths inside, and it did show an oblique rectangle rising from inside the sarcophagus, and having the suggestion of a pattern.  If it was intended to represent a casket lid, then I doubt it would have covered the space.  It might even conceivably represent a large sheet such as a shroud. \nIs not an empty sarcophagus, more of a Western Europe tradition, reflecting that culture of burial.  Certainly the gospels do not mention a sarcophagus nor any type of casket.  It is essentially an artistic invention reflecting a local burial practice.  I doubt that sarcophagi are represented in any examples of Byzantine Christian art of the burial, although I might be corrected on this. \nThe Pray Codex illustration of the Three Marys does not illustrate an empty sarcophagus, in any way like the various Western Europe examples.  It appears to be more of a stone slab, which is likely a lot closer to the truth of the actual burial.  It was doubtless influenced by Bela III sojourn in Constantinople, which then had no tradition of representing sarcophagi in burial or resurrection art.  If then there is no sarcophagus represented, then there can be no lid to it, and the oblique rectangle in the Pray Codex Three Marys illustration, may well represent something entirely different!\n\n","date":"March 11, 2015 at 6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-193110","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
