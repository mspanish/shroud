Brian Lai knows what a negative image is, and has a positive in front of him to ‘invert.’ It’s a clever party trick, but not really related to the image on the Shroud. If the Shroud was painted as it is, it was not because the artist wanted to produce a negative, but a deliberate attempt to depict the image that might have been left by a moist body on a covering cloth, with closely pressed parts more dense and less firmly contacted parts less dense. John Jackson, you will recall, got police artists to attempt exactly this, with moderate success. What we must ask ourselves is: Is the resulting image too good to be true? And, by way of clarifying what we mean by that, is the resulting 3D image as produced by ImageJ or the VP-8 analyser too realistic to be credibly the work of an artist? If the answer is yes, then non-authenticists must abandon the straight painting hypothesis and go for the bas-relief powdering, smearing or scorching method, when, it might be supposed, a more realistic ‘negative’ might be an inevitable consequence of the process, as demonstrated by Garlaschelli or Colin Berry.\n\n","date":"February 22, 2015 at 2:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/very-disturbing/","cat":"art","id":"comment-191576","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Very Disturbing","post":"Unless Brian Lai also indulges in time travel. we can eliminate him as a forger of the Shroud.

We know beyond any doubt from medieval manuals and the few surviving medieval,painted linens that painting  took place only on the outer surface of a cloth sealed with gesso. We also know that with folding and unfolding the pigments could disintegrate.  A place called Barley Hall has apparently done some experiments with this but they never replied to my e-mail.\nThe question then becomes: ‘if the pigments have been in place for five hundred years and then disintegrate what is left underneath?, Presumably the cloth has been affected depending on the density of the pigments  so that one is left with shadowy images that will vary in consistency with the density and perhaps types of pigment of the original paint. My suspicion is that they will vary so light painted areas will appear darker and heavily painted areas lighter so,perhaps,providing us with the apparent negatives. But in addition to this we have the artist creating a mirror image.\nSo now one needs to find a textile expert who may know of similar examples. The best case of the pigments disintegrating that I know of is the Zittau Veil- the pigments came off when steamed- but I don’t know whether the remaining shadows where the pigments were are negatives or not.\nThis is a plausible hypothesis and so needs to be tested out, just as the Oxford lab tested out John Jackson’ s hypothesis about carbon monoxide affecting the radiocarbon date and finding that it did not.\nSo to go back to the original questions: my hypothesis is that the artist WAS trying to create a mirror image but that the apparent negative image is what is left when the pigments came off after five hundred years of covering the weaver: so nothing to do with the artist himself.\n\n","date":"February 22, 2015 at 3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/very-disturbing/","cat":"art","id":"comment-191584","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Very Disturbing","post":"You have not cited a single fact in support of your hypothesis and typou ignore the body of science opposed to your speculation.\nTo place yourself on the same plane with your speculations  as John Jackson is absurd.

Both the negativity and the 3D qualities have been reproduced many times by many people, not least myself.

Firstly only the exit wound of one nail hole of the left upper limb is shown, it is smeared, and no entrance wounds are visible.  The length of phalanges between individuals is known to vary considerably;  there is an underlying assumption that the outer surface of the hand is laying flat against the cloth, whereas it seems more likely to be an orthogonal projection, and for all that may be surmised, the fingers may be cupped to some extent, and also not parallel to the cloth;  there is an assumption that the image of the ends of the fingers are clearly visible, but for all that may be guessed the end of the fingers image may merely be the end of the phalange bones, if that.  I believe the measurement method described is therefore flawed. \nI have before me a particularly clear image of the exit wound.  It appears to coincide with the narrowest part of the wrist, where the base of the thumb and little-finger metacarpals converge at the join of the wrist.  The “blood-smear” extends from the base of the palm as far as and beyond the join with the fore-arm, that is, generally what most people would call the wrist.  \nAs for the entrance wound, that is not visible.  Barbet deduced from his experiments, that it was at the wrist.  Zugibe considered it was at the base of the palm, and showed a particularly graphic example of a stabbing victim’s wound which he believed was similar.  I believe Zugibe’s analysis of arm tensions was flawed, as it failed to take account of the fact of the raising of the cross-beam, with the victim attached, when the full body weight would need to be carried by his outstretched arms, until the feet were nailed which only then could give any relief to arm tension.\n\n","date":"February 23, 2015 at 5:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/very-disturbing/","cat":"art","id":"comment-191625","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Very Disturbing","post":"Louis wrote: “I don’t see why what STURP team scientists discovered about the possibility of painting should be ignored.

I was never claiming she was a “noted” physicist-what “no background” means is open to interpretation I suppose.  I was just going by what comes up when her name is searched.  I also mentioned de Wesselow’s in the accompanying sentence.  I think both might have useful things to say, irrespective of any major experience in medieval art.  It would seem reasonable that IP’s knowledge of science vocabulary may be above that of a typical artist, having some connection to physics, but that’s neither here nor there-I think her comments on pigments flaking, now you see it now you don’t, would be interesting-it seemed a bit too much of a trigger finger reaction to me, particularly given her known support for authenticity.  \nBTW, using the same measure, others may claim to have a “science background”, but the meaning could be various.  To some, the claim of a scientist is based on taking graduate courses in various subjects or teaching science or exposure at some level.  To others, the claim of being a scientist, implies having conducted original research in a university-associated laboratory or independent company, having a published cv.  Could mean different things to different people, no doubt.\n\n","date":"February 23, 2015 at 5:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/very-disturbing/","cat":"art","id":"comment-191679","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Very Disturbing","post":"Fair enough.

If the cloth follows the contour of the hands, or if the hands and cloth are in the same plane, then the absolute measurements are valid. If the hands are in one plane, and the cloth in another, then either a) The measurements are shorter than real life if the ‘radiation’ is perpendicular to the cloth or b) The measurements are longer than real life if the radiation is perpendicular to the hand.\nBut by how much? To increase any of these measurements by a single millimetre requires that the cloth be in contact at one end and about 10mm higher than the cloth at the other end. This is wholly impracticable. It is simply not enough to say, we don’t know this or that. Nor does it matter if the hands are cupped, as only two bones of each finger are under consideration here. The positions of the thumb and outer joints of the fingers are irrelevant to these calculations.\nI would indeed be very grateful for any evidence that I’m wrong. Please do send over the forensic slides.
