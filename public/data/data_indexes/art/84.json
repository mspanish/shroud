[{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"Dan\nI am surprised and disappointed you made a separate blog post out of an exchange of comments we had on my blog, under my post, “My critique of “The Pray Codex,” Wikipedia, 1 May 2011“. You did not ask my permission, and your post amounts to an attack on me. I find that unethical, and I have never, and would never, write a separate blog post attacking you, or any of my fellow Shroud pro-authenticists. \nYou also imply falsely that my “empty vessels [who] make the most noise refers to “my [your] readers” generally, when in the context it clearly did not. I made it clear I was only referring to “those who have done the least study of a topic” (the Shroud) but “are the most frequent and confident posters on that topic,” and who “tend to drive away all but the most hardcore debaters on it” [your blog]. \nYou claim you did not block me from posting to your blog, but the facts are:\n1. On 8 February this year my comments to your blog ceased to appear, immediately after I respectfully disagreed with you. I tried reposting my comments and even sent a plain text test message but they did not appear.\n2. I mentioned under a comment you had made on my blog the same day, 8 February, that my comments were not appearing on your blog. I repeated my comment to this effect late that same day and again the next day, but there never was a response from you.\n3. I find it strange that you never checked to see what my response to your comment on my blog was, in which case you would have read that my comments to your blog were not appearing. Were you not interested to read what my response to your comment was? And did you not notice that I had stopped commenting on your blog? \n4. I also find strange your comment today that: “If something went wrong I apologize. If I made a mistake, perhaps, I apologize. There is no intent to block your comments, ever.” But as I commented back, “Your `If I made a mistake, perhaps, I apologize’ seems strange. If you did not block my comments to your blog, then there would be no reason for you to apologize.”\nQuite frankly Dan, for the above reasons, I find it hard to believe that you did not block me, especially now after your unprovoked hostile post against me.\nBut as I said in my last comment today to you on my blog, “it was a blessing in disguise that I was unable to comment on your blog, because I have saved a lot of time from not having to respond to those commenters on your blog who seem to take no notice of what I, or anyone else writes, anyway. So I still do not intend to resume commenting on your blog …”\nAnd now after what I can only regard as your above unprovoked hostile post against me, Dan, I certainly will not resume commenting on your blog!\nStephen E. Jones\n\n","date":"June 4, 2012 at 9:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11892","author":"Stephen E.

I have edited a couple of comments from people and have always noted the fact. I have withdrawn two comments that I thought were inappropriate but wrote to the commenters. There are a couple of troublesome trolls that I do block.  \nBelieve what you want Stephen about my blocking you. Incidentally, your comment went right in without moderation and I did nothing to make that happen. It meant you were not blocked. \nDon’t comment if you don’t want to, Stephan  But do expect me to post about your blog which is 99.9 percent of the time great, much better researched and better written than mine. Tell me why it is unethical to do a separate post about you or anyone, skeptic or otherwise. What does your being a fellow shroudie have to do with it? \nIf Joe Nickell or Barry Schwortz or Russ Breault or Richard Dawkins or anyone including you implies that even one of the commenters on my blog is an “empty vessels,” I’ll call them out on that. It is not a personal attack. You did write, afterall, “Personally I think you give too much `oxygen’ to those `empty vessels which make the most noise’ on your blog.” \nI consider nothing has changed. I’ll write as I do.

My guess is that the very first epitaphios was made by an artist who saw the Shroud and then, after that, this kind of art form depicting the burial of Christ became a tradition in the byzantine world and the other artists were just following closely the first epitaphios.  That doesn’t mean they too were able to see the Shroud, but there’s a very good probability that the one who did the very first epitaphios had that chance.  That’s what I think…  You’re right about the fact that the body of Christ in these artworks is just too close to the one on the Shroud to have nothing to do with it…\n\n","date":"June 4, 2012 at 4:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11909","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"En el arte medieval hay muchas escenas del BAUTISMO de Jesús mostrándolo desnudo.\nLas relacionadas con su MUERTE son sin embargo excepcionales.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2012 at 12:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11898","author":"carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"Bing Translation: There are many scenes of the baptism of Jesus in medieval art showing him.Those related to his death are however exceptional.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2012 at 12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11902","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"Carlos, that would seem significant.

In fact, there is even an example provided on this very post, with Christ being lowered into a sarcophagus, and with a gentleman at the foot end ensconced on a domed lid!\nI am now more than ever convinced that what we are supposed to assume to represent the “Shroud” in the atrociously-drawn Pray Codex – viz the slanting white panel with zig-zag pattern (“herring bone weave”) and L-shaped arrangement of 4 holes (“poker holes”) –  is in fact the raised lid of a recently vacated sarcophagus.

This is really interesting but this cannot be taken as some kind of argument against the fact that the depiction of Christ in the Pray Codex is surely linked with the Shroud.  In fact, in my mind, I think we can make the opposite reflection :  Since those artworks were done in Europe during the 13th century, after the 4th crusade when some crusaders like Robert de Clari probably saw the body images on the Shroud of Turin, I think there’s a fairly good probability that those paintings of a nude Christ were influenced by the testimonies of these crusaders who had seen the Shroud in Constantinople in 1203, before the sack of the city.\nOne other thing to note :  the Pray Codex is still, as I know, the only artwork made during the 12th century (not the 13th folks, the 12th !!!) to show Jesus nude.  Despite what the skeptics might say, this fact alone makes this artwork very unique in the history of art, since it is the only known depiction of Christ nude made during the time the Shroud was most probably kept in Constantinople (before 1204)…\nAnd there’s one more thing very important to understand :  The nudity of Christ in the drawing of the Pray Codex, even if it is a very good clue that indicate a probable link with the Shroud, is not what I consider to be the most important feature.  No, the feature that is even more important, because it indicate an almost sure connection between this artwork and the Shroud, is the L-shaped holes.  Nevermind what the skeptics can say, the fact that there’s such a series of holes in the drawing of the Pray Codex indicate clearly a close connection with the Shroud.  If you use your logic, there’s no room for any other RATIONAL explanation…  Of course, any skeptic (like Collinsberry) can come out and give us some explanation of his own using his imagination, but is it rational in the context of a religious artwork of the 12th century ?

No, we have to look at the WHOLE PICTURE AT ONCE !  And what it the whole picture ?  That the artwork in the Pray Codex show a series of L-Shaped holes like we see on the Shroud, that it show Christ naked like we see on the Shroud, that it show the hands crossed over the pubis like we see on the Shroud, that it doesn’t show the thumbs like we see on the shroud and that it show a very particular weaving style like we see on the shroud.\nNow, you have to ask yourseltf one question :  If the artist who did this artwork never saw the Shroud and never heard about it, how’s the chances that everyone of these very particular features (some of which, like the nudity of Christ, are, as I know, the most ancient features ever to appear in a religious artwork) could have been put in one single artwork during the 12th century ???   \nIf someone is honest, he have no choice to answer this question by saying EXTREMELY LOW !  I don’t even know if the probability would be 0,1 % !  THAT’S THE ONLY QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES.\nOf course, there’s also a few differences but this doesn’t really matter if we think the Pray Codex was never intent to be an exact copy of the Shroud by the monk who probably did it.  When you understand that the art style of the depiction of Christ is the same kind of depictions we see on the epitaphios, it is very probable that the artist who did the artwork had the intention to make some kind of epitaphios that would include some of the characteristics of the Shroud he knew (because he had previously seen the relic or because an eye-witness gave him these particular details).  In my mind, in the light of the answer I gave to the important question I asked in this comment, there’s not much room left open for another scenario…\nAnd if you don’t agree with me, then look everywhere and found me another religious artwork that predate the first known publich showing of the Shroud in Lirey, France, around 1350, and that show ALL of the features I mentioned in this comment !!!

In the tomb scene there are no wounds visible; in the later post-Resurrection (Enthronement?) scene both hands show wounds, with one at least showing the wound in the centreof the palm (which did not prevent Stephen Jones claiming the other to be in the wrist – despite that hand being drawn with scarcely no palm worth speaking of).\nWhen is this obsession with the Pray Codex going to end? The Codex (“book” in modern parlance) was simply text accompanied by some small and somewhat amateurish line drawings – almost cartoons –  in an obscure Hungarian volume that was probably intended only for the eyes of a few clerics and/or pious well-to-do folk – many of whom were probably able to read and not needing vague and inconsistent symbols in cramped pictures to tell them things that are not in the scriptures – like a burial shroud, referred to briefly in the Gospels merely as “fine linen” or “clean linen cloth” or “linen clothes” that somehow acquired an imprint of its brief occupant with no mention whatsoever of a unconventional up-and-over configuration…  all this to remain a well-kept secret for the next thirteen and a half centuries. One couldn’t make it up …\n\n","date":"June 5, 2012 at 5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11962","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"we cannot analyse one element alone and then, analyse another element alone.

It’s like finding a written work and conjecturing that it was created by random banging on a keyboard because you’ve seen all the same letters elsewhere. The confluence of the naked Christ and his general appearance, hidden thumbs and long fingers, hands crossed over the genitals, and long shroud establish the connection. The question from that point is which direction the connection is in (I consider it more plausible that the Shroud was the ultimate source for a number of reasons). The L-shape and herringbone pattern wouldn’t be significant on their own, imo, but they become suggestive in light of the connection established by the other factors.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2012 at 9:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11993","author":"The Deuce","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"no blood trails on the forearms, hair or elsewhere, no scourge marks, no swollen cheek, no wrist wound\nBecause clearly the artist didn’t think Jesus had been scourged or crucified….\n\n","date":"June 6, 2012 at 9:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11990","author":"The Deuce","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"NOT AT ALL DEUCE !!!  If there’s no blood on this artwork, it is simply because it was done during the 12th century and up until that time, there was absolutely no depiction of a suffering Christ with bruises and bloodstains !  You must never forget the historical context !!!  In fact, the very first depictions of Jesus with blood are dated of the 13th century and were done in Europe.  We have to wait until the 14th century before seeing the byzantine artist having the guts to do the same.  Why ?  Because before the 13th century, showing a suffering Christ would have been considered scandalous and disgusting for the people !  And more than that, up until the 13th century, theologically speaking, a suffering Christ didn’t fit at all with the mainstream teaching of the Church (whether it was the European Church or the Orthodox Church).  It was mainly the Christ in Glory that was showed before the 13th century (along with some depictions that shows kind of a sad Jesus).   So, during the time the Pray Codex was made, it wasn’t “in the air” at all to depict a suffering Christ and that’s why this artwork don’t show any blood or bruises or injuries.  And, because of this particular religious and artistic context of pre-13th century that was completely repulsive to any depiction of a suffering Christ, you can easily understand that the hypothesis of Ian Wilson concerning the Mandylion is VERY HIGHLY UNLIKELY !  In my mind, it’s even ridiculous when you understand well the context of the time the image first appeared in Edessa during the 5th or 6th century (the context that I just describe).  At that time, if an image of a beaten and bloody Christ would have been publicly showed, it would have made a scandal !  And there would be a lot of textual reports (here, I don’t refer to one or two dissonant legendary text.  I talk about eye-witness accounts) that would clearly states that there was a very particular image of Christ in Edessa (and later on, in Constantinople) that was showing him suffering with lot of bloodstains.  There’s absolutely no doubt about the fact that many copies of it showing the bloodstains and the beaten face would have been made and there’s also no doubt at all that an image of a suffering Christ the point directly to his Passion (the crown of thorns is easily discernible on the head of the man of the Shroud) would have had a MAJOR IMPACT on byzantine art, especially any form of art related to the Passion of Christ.  The influence of an image of a suffering Christ would have been dramatic on byzantine art first and then, on all the Christian art everywhere.  But the fact is this :  The Mandylion had absolutely no influence like that whatsoever and there is absolutely no depiction of a suffering Christ showing bloodstains before the 13th century (some 7 or 8 centuries after the first apparition of the Mandylion) !  In itself, this important historical fact is enough to completely discard this relic as having been the Shroud folded 4 times to show only the face.   Like I say, I don’t have any doubts that this image of Edessa was related, directly or indirectly, to the Shroud (just like the Pray Codex, the Pantocrator, the epitaphios and other artworks of the byzantine era), but believing that this image and the Shroud were one and the same cloth, I really think that this is ludicrous.  In sum, this idea of Wilson just doesn’t fit at all with what we know about the byzantine art of the first 13 centuries A.D. !!!  It’s as simple as that.  But nevertheless, the image of Edessa is important because it is a good indicator that the Shroud was already known by some people in the Middle East around the 6th, possibly even the 5th century.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2012 at 5:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-12013","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"Totalmente de acuerdo, Yannick, es lo que he estado manteniendo.\nExisten MUCHAS obras de arte con Jesús desnudo en el BAUTISMO anteriores a 1350, yo guardo una COLECCION de ellas.\n[La que muestra David Mo se conserva en en la Capella Palatina di Palermo y es del siglo XII.]\nPero obras de arte que muestren a Jesús MUERTO desnudo anteriores a 1350 SON TOTALMENTE EXCEPCIONALES ( 2 obras si aceptáramos además del Codex Pray la obra del pintor español del siglo 12 de la Clouster Collection, cuya datación me parece muy dudosa).\nY obras de arte que muestren a Jesús muerto desnudo, con los brazos cruzados sobre el pubis y los pulgares ausentes, como en la Sábana Santa, SOLO conocemos 1 obra, la del Codex Pray.\n\n","date":"June 5, 2012 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11963","author":"carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"Colinsberry, creo que usted de arte medieval NO ENTIENDE NADA.\n\n","date":"June 5, 2012 at 5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11964","author":"carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"Maybe not carlos – though I hardly think that a handful of crudely-executed line drawings – almost cartoon-like- constitutes art.

You make basic mistakes, like when you say that there was no convention of painting the dead (not the Christ only) with arms crossed over his abdomen. You want examples?\n2. You talk about identity when speaking of similarity.\n3. You look only at the similarities and forget differences. Striking differences especially.\n4. Your theory of the medieval artist who leaves clues “encrypted” is illusory. I have never seen or read anything similar. Medieval artists represented its subject directly or resorted to conventional symbols of his time. Perhaps the Codex Pray is “unique” at this issue also\n5. You talk about a process of transmission of iconographic motifs that is not real. The art forms do not arise by diffusion of a single work all imitate, even in cases of very famous works in his time.\n6. You seem to believe that the thing you know matches what exists. In the Middle Ages there was a wealth of manuscripts and paintings now disappeared. Only a few thousands of the hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and paintings survives. These thousands are but the tip of the iceberg. To say that the Codex Pray was the first naked representing Christ in the tomb is naive. In all likelihood is just the tip of the iceberg.\nFinally: I exposed a plausible method of work for the codex Pray artist that does not involve direct imitation of any painting allegedly existing in Constantinople or anywhere. I have not heard responding to my proposal. Unless the answer is to repeat once more that the codex Pray is the only one that was identical to the Shroud of Turin. As Colin and I have amply demonstrated, neither is true. It is neither unique nor identical.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2012 at 2:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-11975","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"\nYannick Clément :\nFind me the correct datation of this baptism scene and we will talk.

The baptism scene you show me has nothing to do with the Shroud or the Passion of Christ.\n\nPalatine Chapel, Palermo. 12th Century. We talk?\nYes, the passion is not baptism. I know. The Pray artist also knew. But he had the same problem as the Palatine Chapel artist: how to paint a naked Christ without showing your sex? The Palatine artist found the solution in water waves. The Pray Codex artist used a conventional resort in the painting of 12th, also common in real burials: hands folded on his abdomen. (See Charles Freeman: The Shroud of Turin and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey On burial practices).\nOther artists solved the problem differently. They place people in front of the body of Christ. Or putting a cloth napkin. Perhaps the solution of the Pray codex artist was original, but not so original because he used iconographic resources of his time. It is not necessary to resort to a hypothetical visit to Constantinople or a hypothetical vision of a hypothetical shroud of Christ, and so. Too many assumptions.

Both take liberties of course with the Biblical account, but this one more so than the Shroud. This one has Christ being anointed with oil in the presence of Joseph, Nicodemus AND the Marys, which of course was not how it was described in John. It was the men only who did the initial treatment with the 100lbs of myrrh and aloes, with no mention of oils, and it was the women who were intending to administer the oils, ointments etc later, but were prevented from doing so by the Sabbath, and on returning to their duties at the earliest opportunity, i.e. the first day of the new week, found the tomb empty.  So here we have a composite picture, with the men, the women, the oil, and perhaps not surprisingly a Christ who is not completely naked. \nBut when you look at the Codex, it’s just the men, but still with some artistic licence (oil being applied, but no sign of bulk myrrh and aloes), but with the absence of women from the picture, pre-Sabbath, the artist has allowed himself the licence of oil being applied to a completely nude body.\nHaving made that decision to show a nude body, finer sensibilities are preserved by showing hand crossed over the privates. So it’s wrong to count both the nudity and the crossed hands as if representing TWO separate points of correspondence with the Shroud, since one – the position of the hands – is a consequence of the other – the decision to allow the more realistic nudity that might accompany anointing, especially of preceded by washing.\nYes, it  may well have been the decision to show a strictly  male-administered anointing, albeit having no scriptural reference, that influenced the decision to show a body with no signs of blood or other mistreatment, leaving the viewer to assume that the body had had a prior wash –  in short a more sanitised version of what might otherwise have made for a gut-wrenching depiction of the immediate aftermath of crucifixion. \nHaving removed any suggestion of spilt blood from the anointing scene, it would make no sense to have any suggestion or hints of a bloodied Turin Shroud (as we now call it) in the subsequent scene with the empty tomb, with just  the angel and ladies in attendance. The panel with the zig zag pattern, the tiny holes, the red streak was NOT therefore an attempt to represent the Shroud, but merely the patterned lid of the tomb… Any idea it was the Shroud is a total red herring, but I’ve no doubt that idea will run and run, thanks to the existence of this and other sites that give free expression to dogmatism and scepticism alike, the former always guaranteed to win more support from those who might be described as iconophilic…  that about exhausts all that this sceptical science bod wants to say on the subject of the Pray Codex – as good an example of subject-selecting  pseudo-science if ever there was (Stephen E.

He paints clearly the end of the sheet under the shoulders and foots of the corpse. It is clearly seen in the bottom angle of the cloth that would be impossible if continued. The realism of the Pray codex painter is quite poor, but here it is very clear. If there is an angle, there is the end of the cloth. If the thing on the shoulders of Joseph and John’s hands were the same sheet the painter should paint both in the same way. This is not the case.\n\n","date":"June 15, 2012 at 1:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-12492","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”","post":"I try to stay clear of that upper anointing picture, having no idea as to what is burial shroud as distinct from garments, or where the burial shroud starts or ends, or drapes around whom. All is speculation, given the illustrator fails to provide clues in terms of patterning, colour etc.\nWhat is certain is that our minor league illustrator was making no attempt to use the anointing scene with the three men to signal his having previously laid eyes on any iconic Shroud, assuming it were contemporaneous and residing hundreds of miles away, as shown by the absence of “herringbone weave” or “L-shaped poker holes”. \nA degree of caution is needed when interpreting the lower “angel/empty tomb” scene too, where the illustrator’s abilities to depict an abandoned burial shroud on a sarcophagus lid atop any empty sarcophagus are stretched to his technical limits. It’s anyone guess whether there’s a face cloth/napkin sitting in that heap of linen – but given the fairly close adherence to the Biblical account in the scene, i see no compelling reason why he would have felt obliged to show it. \nThe only folk here who desperately want a napkin in the lower scene are those who want us to believe that the lid with the holes and zig zag pattern is THE Shroud, and that any heaps of linen must be the napkin alone. That’s hardly objective analysis and interpretation, is it?  –  more a case of “seeing what one wants to see” to fit a favoured previously-scripted  narrative.  There are a few scientists, or rather so-called scientists, who operate like that too. I have a name for them – but can no longer use it here, since Dan will then put me back on watch.\n\n","date":"June 15, 2012 at 2:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","id":"comment-12493","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"}]
