[{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"I have read Davor Aslanovski’s “Is Sindonology a relic cult?” with great interest, as it provides some fascinating insights into the obsessive mind of a specialist, a specialist in matters Byzantine.  I have been a specialist myself during my working life, and I have also been a generalist.  So I think I know and understand the strengths and weaknesses of both callings.  \nWithout wishing to bore you with personal details, my first specialty was in the design and construction of certain major civil engineering structures, subject to heavy dynamic loads, significant seismic effects and prone to foundation scour, of a kind unique to NZ.  I spent some 13 years in this specialty.  I have been in other specialties, such as the design of certain auditing and sampling systems.  Some of my generalist work involved investment risk assessments across a full breadth of engineering projects, civil, structural, architectural, mechanical, electric traction, communications and information technology, and other such trivia including the management of major capital investment programmes.  I feel I had a most satisfying and fascinating engineering career. Now to the point! \nThe strength of the specialist is that a narrow focus can be brought to bear on highly technical matters, in a way that cannot be done by a generalist.  Conversely the weakness of the specialist is that he is not fit for much else, without a major retraining programme.  His particular specialty is the entire world for the committed specialist, his particular strength is also his weakness.  He becomes too narrowly focussed, and he is prone to obsess about it. \nThus in the case of the specialist in Byzantine history for instance, he will generally be entirely ignorant about matters scientific.  The world of blood stains, blood types, recognition of pollen grains, textile weaves, carbon dating, imaging processes, chemistry, finer points of geometry are a closed book to him.  While others might manage at least a  superficial grasp of the significance of such matters, the Byzantine historian specialist will not have time for any of this.  And what is true for one kind of specialist, is also true for other specialists,  Your specialist in chemistry for instance may be found wanting in the matter of Byzantine history, general forensics, an inability to see the logical connections among evidential sources and be unable to draw a logical synthesised conclusion.  Certainly your chemist will, most of the time, be able to provide you with sound advice and factual conclusions providing that he stays within the limits of his discipline.   \nI mentioned the susceptibility to obsession of the specialist.  Thus what he accuses in others he will fail to see in himself.  Just read Davor’s primary posting above.  He accuses those involved in discussing the Shroud with various kinds of bad faith.  Does he deal with the various arguments brought to bear on the subject? No! He likens them to pornophiles!  He accuses them of Ad hominem arguments, which may be fair comment for some of what appears here from time to time.  But then he himsef brings contempt to bear on various named bloggers.  I say “Physician, Heal thyself!”         \nDavor sees sindonology as some kind of heresy.  The truth of the matter is that the great majority of sympathetic bloggers on this site consider this relic important, because for various reasons they believe it may well be the burial cloth of their Lord and Saviour.  As such it is potentially the most important relic in all of Christendom.  However its authenticity is by no means so clear to others.  There is such a thing as constructive conflict in coming to the truth of such matters which hopefully might be fruitful within our own lifetimes if we are lucky.  Such conflict should be confined to the weight of argument, and not to persons.  However bad faith can at times be only too apparent, and can be a challenge even to Christian patience.   \nWhen the formerly agnostic Yves Delage, Sorbonne’s professor of comparative anatomy, presented his objective findings on the Shroud before the French Academy of Science, he encountered downright hostility, purely it would seem on the basis of the subject-matter. The Academy was dominated by so-called rationalists and free-thinkers, anti-religious to a man, a survival perhaps of the “French Enlightenment”.  There remains a a distrust of Academia among those devoted to what they consider to be this most precious relic, a distrust which Academia itself has done little to dissipate, including I must say, what I have so far read from Byzantine historians. \nThe great British chronicler of the Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill was once reported to have said, “History is Bunk!”  I sometimes wonder if he was right!\n\n","date":"September 4, 2012 at 7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15834","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"Dear Mr Belz, \nWhat in the world gave you the idea that I was a single discipline specialist?\nAnd what would that have to do with the question whether the image reverently transferred to Constantinople in 944 can be identified with the Turin Shroud?\n\n","date":"September 4, 2012 at 10:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15840","author":"Davor Aslanovski","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"1) You have yet to demonstrate any understanding of any scientific matter concerning the Shroud, which is vastly more relevant to its authenticity than its whereabouts at any given time.

Some of this is peer-reviewed; some is not.  Much of it has been carried out on a voluntary basis, some perhaps with the assistance of grants.  It seems that peer-review is not necessarily the guarantee of rigour that it once might have been. \nIf one were to wait for academe to take an interest in it, I think we should wait a very long time indeed.  There does appear in my view to be an academic conspiracy against the Shroud, based perhaps on faulty received wisdom.  It commenced with the reaction of the French Academy of Science to Delage and Vignon.  Sadly I have recently learned of the apparent intent to deceive by two notable cleric historians, Chevalier & Thurston.  If you are not already aware of it, I would refer you to Markwardt’s paper “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD” 2001.  It would seem that these two notable historians set about with a deliberate intent to deceive.  Markwardt is an attorney at law and understands these matters very well.  http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf   Chevalier & Thurston seem to have set an unfortunate precedent followed by some of their successors. I am sure that you would not willingly want to be such a participant yourself, but perhaps “caution” might be a good watchword. \nYou refer to neglect of any potential healing power of the Shroud.  That might well be true, but perhaps indicates that pro-authenticists are more cautious than you have assumed.  Albert Dreisbach has written extensively on its historic association with healing, most of them fairly ancient.  I found the last paper he wrote, shortly before his death in 2006 quite moving.  Although this paper does not specifically refer to healing, it certainly has a strong religious appeal which I hope you might be able to relate to.\n“THE ECUMENICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN”; (Perugia: Revised 2006) by The Rev. Albert R. Dreisbach: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/dreisbach4.pdf .\nHe was on his way to deliver the paper at two conferences in Italy when he died. According to many, this is his finest work, completing a theme he had written about frequently.\n\n","date":"September 5, 2012 at 7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15874","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"Discussing here how scientific research should be conducted and where and how the results of it should be presented would be a waste of time. \nThe idea that academic historians today could be ‘conspiring’ against the Shroud shows how little Markwardt understands what the academic world is and what historians do – despite the fact that he calls himself a historian.\nAnd the case that he mentions dates from a hundred years ago and has to do with nothing but the d’Arcis memorandum. And Wilson’s theory has not been rejected on the basis of the d’Arcis memorandum. (In case it still isn’t clear, it was rejected because there is no evidence for it. It is a piece of historical fiction. And if it’s historical fiction you want, give me five pounds and I’ll tell you a dozen more amusing stories to ‘explain’ the ‘provenance’ of the Shroud. And for a tenner, I’ll let you see where the aliens probed my spine.) \nAnd as for Dreisbach, these few lines will exemplify why I don’t hold his writings in very high regard: \n‘On that first Easter morning the Magdalene “saw two angels in the place where Jesus had lain…one at the head and one at the feet.” (John 20:2l).

Their own presentation was itself fraudulent.  How pervasive it was is demonstrated by the frequency with which the D’Arcis memorandum continues to be quoted by hostile Shroud sceptics even today. \nYour curt dismissal of the Dreisbach paper demonstrates your failure to distinguish a paper with an honest religious intent from a paper intended for other papers, specifically history.  It also shows your inability to grasp the sub-text that may have been intended by writers of scripture. \nI have attempted the retort courteous, the retort brutal, the retort rational, the retort religious.  There only remains the retort humorous, but I doubt that this would be any more effective with you either.  I also doubt that there is any further point in engaging in further dialogue with you on the matter.

If your fantasy was true, how can you explain that we know only ONE type of artistic copie of the Image of Edessa, which CLEARLY and ALWAYS depict ONLY the face of the LIVING Christ on a SMALL towel WITHOUT any traces of BLOODSTAINS and/or INJURIES ???\nYou, Wilson, Scavone and anyone who have a good imagination can make say anything you want to a legendary kind of text BUT…  You will never be able to change the known and SIMILAR aspect of these artistic copies which NEVER presents any great resemblance with the Shroud of Turin or any other kind of artistic depiction related to the Passion of the Christ.\nIf you’re right, where can I found the artistic copies of the second cloth (Tetradiplon/Himation/Sindon) you always mention ???\nThe only way real Byzantine scholars could start looking at Wilson’s hypothesis with some interest is if one day a new discovery would be made in an ancient text which would make a clear description of the Image of Edessa as being a long burial cloth showing bloodstains (idealy mentioning that these bloodstains refers to the stigmata of Christ), along with a full-size body image (idealy mentioning the presence of a ventral and a dorsal image).\nIn all the ancient legendary text of the Abgar legend, in all the theological kind of text mentioning the Image of Edessa (like the discourse of Gregory Referendarius) and also in all the ancient list of relics coming from Edessa, there’s absolutely no single reference that can be clearly understood as being the kind of reference I just mentioned.  And until a discovery like that could be made (that will most probably never happen folks !), the way to do good history is to consider this hypothesis of Wilson as being HIGHLY UNLIKELY because it rest mainly on speculation, extrapolations and special assumptions.  And the truth is this :  Science (and the Occam’s razor principle) REALLY HATES hypothesis that rest on that kind of imaginative stuff.\nI ask you the question :  Using Occam’s razor and taking account of all the known data coming from historical and artistic sources concerning both the Shroud and the Mandylion, which one of these 2 hypothesis MUST be considered the most probable :\n1- The one of Wilson which goes against ALL the known artistic copies of the Mandylion.\n2- The one which pretend that the Mandylion was exactly what all these artistic copies are showing (i.e. a small cloth showing only the face of the living Christ without any injuries and/or bloodstains), what the totality of the known list of relics from Constantinople are saying and what the vast majority of the legendary text concerning the Abgar legend are also saying ?\nIf someone here dare to answer #1, then I don’t know why I am wasting my time here !!!  If you really dare to answer #1, that would be the best proof of your Pro-Shroud complete bias, which is, by the way, as ugly as the ones who get an anti-Shroud bias.  Bias for Bias, they’re all as ugly in my book.\nCan we start talking seriously and honestly while leaving our preconceived ideas at the door please ?  For all the good reasons I brought to you over and over again and one more time here in this comment, I’ll repeat it: The Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson MUST be considered as being HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  PERIOD.  It’s not that I like it or not, it has to do with rational thinking in face of all the known data, particularly facing all the known artistic copies of the Mandylion.\nI’ll repeat it :  Max or Wilson or anyone else cannot change the fact that there is only one general kind of depiction associated with the Image of Edessa and it fits perfectly well with the vast majority of the known ancient sources, i.e. that this relic was an image of Christ resting on a small cloth and showing only his living face without any signs of injuries and/or bloodstains.\nLast note :  Unlike what Max is saying, the Veronica is another relic that was created AFTER the Image of Edessa and it’s fair to describe it as the Western version of the Abgar legend.  In other words, the Veronica IS NOT the Mandylion. The vast majority of the Byzantine scholars agree to say that these 2 “relics” of Christ are most probably painted relics made by and/or for the Church.\n\n","date":"September 5, 2012 at 8:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15907","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"Yannick; \nMOST OBVIOUSLY you’d better stick to Geography as you are TOTALLY IGNORANT of the Image of Edessa Bizantine iconography.

From the various contributions they have made recently, it would seem that they are quite prepared even to deny that such a cloth was ever in Constantinople.  Not for them the evidence of Robert de Clari, the Hungarian Pray Manuscript, the complaint of the Patriarch to the Pope that the French Crusaders had made off with it, nor any other such clues.  That is their affair, and it may very well come back to haunt them.  Now for those who deem it credible that such a cloth was indeed  in Constantinople before the year 1204, and was the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, consider the following: \nSo the Shroud must have arrived in Constantinople some time during the period 30 AD and 1204 AD.  By the year 328, Helena had apparently ensured that Contantinople was apparently swamped with relics of the crucifixion, the early martyrs, and indeed according to Charles Freeman and his mentor John Calvin there was a whole shipload of True Crosses there.  Curiously, the Shroud is not included in any of the inventories of this largesse, so presumably it arrived there after 328 AD, \nLet us fast-forward to the year 943 AD.  The great Armenian general of the Byzantines John Curcuas with an army of 80,000, had turned the course of history by his military conquest of the Turks.  The Arabs had been weakened and here he is at the gates of Edessa which lie at his mercy together with a potentially utter defeat of the Muslims.  What would you do as a general?  Would you not press on and make the defeat complete?  What does Curcuas do? Why, he camps at the gate and negotiates over several months for some old icon, a piece of rag with a picture on it, or so we are told.  The Arabs are perplexed; the Caliph in Baghdad has to be consulted, and eventually the icon is surrendered.  \nNow there are two possible scenarios to consider.  Either the Byzantines already have the purported burial cloth, and this must be known by the Emperor and the Patriarch, or else they do not.  If they already have such a relic, together with Helena’s largesse, why would they ever send such a prestigious general with his army merely to capture some picture, when there was a much more lucrative prize on offer, the utter rout of the Arabs?  Very likely then, the burial cloth would have arrived in Constantinople some time after 943. \nThe Mandylion, as it is called, is brought to the Emperor, together with whatever else had been captured, with great ceremony, it is seen so prestigious that a special feast day on August 16 is declared for its arrival, still celebrated throughout Eastern Orthodoxy even today.  The Mandylion is made part of the Orthodox liturgy, and the legend of Abgar is recited. \nLet us now surmise that the Mandylion is not the Shroud, and therefore it arrives in Constantinople at some later date.  Surprisingly, I cannot tell you the feast day for the arrival of the burial cloths of Jesus Christ in Constantinople.  The Orthodox do not celebrate the arrival of such a prestigious relic.  Robert de Clari saw something very like it in 1204, and the Patriarch complained to the Pope that the Crusaders made off with it.  But of the arrival of teh burial cloths there is no mention. \nBut of course I shall be told that all of this is my over-wrought imagnation working overtime.  It couldn’t happen that way at all.  We have it on the best authority from Byzantine scholars who work so hard to affirm with each other in their closed circle that they are right and they are the specialists, even although Hans Belting knows that they are uncomfortable with the very idea of burial cloths.  \nPerhaps it is just my imagination.  You be the judge!\n\n","date":"September 6, 2012 at 7:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15927","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"Dave, \nIn the light of the sermon pronounced by Gregory Referendarius, Archdeacon of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople on the occasion of the Image of Edessa’s arrival in the city, no true philologists e.g. can totally rule out the Archdeacon could have been referring to TWO DISTINCT RELICS (here…there) either.\nI can only advise you to  plunge into a comparative study of the Holy Face iconography and in particular that of the Holy Faces as shown on the Veil of Mannoppello, Holy Shroud of Saint Veronica (early 15th c.

The legend associated with the Veil of Manoppello suggests that it may very well be the Veronica after its disappearance from Rome ~1608.  Whether it was in Edessa or not might be argued.  One version I read (Heinrich Pfeiffer) has it going from Jerusalem to Camelia in Capadocia, and thence to Constantinople in the VI c. whence it disappeared in 705.  The VI c. is suggestive I think, and may point to an Edessa provenance as many copies of Edessa image seem to have radiated from there at that time (Belting).  \nThe three alleged originals (Melkite, Nestorian, Monophysite) make it further confusing, as do the various names used at different times for a single object.  Byzantine chronicle says that Bishop Abraham only took the one object in 944 and returned the others, but that I suppose could be questioned. \nFor me a compelling argument is the 15 Vignon markings.  Whatever the original template (and perhaps its copies) that artists worked from happened to be, then the facial image on the Shroud must have been the model for those template(s).  As the copies radiated out from Edessa in the 6th century, I find it hard to dismiss the inevitable conclusion that the Shroud was in Edessa at that time.  It could no longer have been there when Edessa was destroyed in 1146.  \nAround 1130, Normandy-based Orderic Vitalis reports that western visitors to Constantinople are shown the emperor’s relic collection and that the Jesus-imprinted Edessa cloth, besides Jesus’ facial imprint displays ‘the form and size of the Lord’s body to all who look upon it’.  BUT It might of course be a report second-hand. And then again, it may be an authentic report!\n\n","date":"September 6, 2012 at 10:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15963","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"To Dave, \nMostly agreed. \n  In all likelihood the Veil of Manoppello and the Holy Veronica (kept in Rome till the 1537 CE sack of the city) are one and the same relic (a small transparent face cloth most probably placed on top of the TS during the TSM’s burial along with a skull-cap (“buttoned up” on top of the VM so that to fasten a “Jaw box” made of three wooden pieces) to both counteract head and lower jaw rigor mortis and thus honor the deceased. \n  Later, faint markings left on the small burial face veil by the TSM’s face were ingenuously enhanced and completed in an attempt to reconstruct and preserve the memory of the deceased via a funeray painted portrait featuring the dead as living, hence the Abgar LEGEND of Yeshua’s painted portrait when he was alive.\n  In the alternative hypothesis, the Rome Holy Veronica now kept in Manoppello was not one of the “three Images of Edessa” handed over to Abramos in 944, then the scenario we are left with is two (or at least one) of the three alleged Edessan relics having been ingenuously painted copies in portrait mode on cloth of the said Holy Veronica (as original template) while the “third Image of Edessa” could only be the “four times longer than wide” stained/soiled himation/sindon with symmetric sets of small holes and framed into a reliquary-table so that the facial imprint only appeared through a circular central opening.\n\n","date":"September 7, 2012 at 8:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15983","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"Mistyping : the sack of Rome in 1527 CE\n\n","date":"September 10, 2012 at 11:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-16104","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?","post":"Correction: ), the “third Image of Edessa” could only have been the “four times longer than wide” stained/soiled himation/sindon with symmetric sets of small holes and framed into a reliquary-table so that the facial imprint only appeared through a circular central opening.\n\n","date":"September 7, 2012 at 9:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","id":"comment-15985","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"}]
