Is it Possible?","post":"Hello Mr. David Goulet:\nI will put all 3 of those images into the negative image of the The Shroud.    All 3, Mona Lisa, “Honest Abe”  and  John Lennon.   It is fairly easy to do this on Sony Vegas Video Editing Software.  It is important to note that the aspect ratio of both the Fresco and the Shroud were not altered in any way.  I will do the same with the other photos neither taking anything away or adding anything to them. Fair and honest.\nGive me a link to which images you would like, I will place them inside exactly how the fresco was done. Exact same procedure.   I will upload them and use the same time sequence to fade in the images.\nI am a artist and have done over 100 portraits, if I was asked to do a reproduction of The Shroud I would not change the dimensions, but do it the exact same size as original image.\nI would like to know the dimensions of the fresco in Rome.   It should be a dead on match to The Shroud of Turin face.   It is not likely an artist would change the dimensions, possible but not likely.  Sometimes I will do a portrait X 2 if it needs to be bigger.   But any deviation from the original, even a few millimeters will change the face and it will not come out right.\nThe biggest challenge a artist would have with The Shroud, would be where to place the eyes exactly since the resurrection image has no eyes illustrated.  That in itself is extremely out of place if this was the work of a man.  A resurrection image with no eyes?!\n\n","date":"August 19, 2014 at 5:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-144835","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

If an artist was going to show this was Jesus rising, he likely wouldn’t have put Jesus in an obvious death pose.\nI think what makes your theory of the fresco interesting isn’t so much the points of congruence angle but the very fact that there is a fresco that may be 2nd century and does look like the Jesus of the Shroud. If this fresco can be identified and provenance proven it would be highly significant because, as you pointed out, where did the inspiration come from.\n\n","date":"August 20, 2014 at 1:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145004","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

I will keep trying to get the best possible match of another face that I can.\n1. Mona Lisa    Not enough close,  it is a completely different face.  If one needs to see what it looks like I will put it together the best it can be and upload it.   It is stunning, stunningly bad looking.\n2. John Lennon:  Some points of congruence.  But again it is a different type of face altogether.     I can get the beard and nose to line up, then another part of the face goes out of whack.  eyes in wrong place, ect.\n3. Abraham Lincoln:  I can get the nose and lips to line up, and the beard but then the forehead goes way out place.   Eyes are to small.   I will put it together in the best way it can be done, but it is not even a close match to what the fresco is.\n4. Johnny Depp:   A completely different face, eyes are completely in the wrong place.  There is no way to get it to match.   At first glance it looks like it will work, then when placed over Shroud it is completely different.\nI am going to collect more photos and get the best straight on shot that looks like the Shroud face and I can do everything to debunk this “new evidence” as not being significant.\nIt seems the more I try to debunk it, the more convincing it gets.\n\n","date":"August 19, 2014 at 8:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-144855","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

Outstanding presentation.\nThere were 2 sources I found that presented this fresco, both claimed it was 1st Century, not 2nd Century.   I believe it comes from the 1st or 3rd century, so I chose the number in between so it would not look like I am tilting the scale in favor of authenticity.   To be fair on both sides, convinced and not convinced.\nThe aspect ratio of both images in this video are NOT altered, it was easy to put them together because I did not have to do much of anything, just place one over the other.\n I can do the same with any image anyone would like to see.   Using the same time sequence for fade in, exact same procedure.  It is not difficult.  I am in the process of doing a Mona Lisa, | Abe Lincoln and John Lennon.   I can even do a Johnny Depp for Hugh.\nHere are some links and quotes from them. \n “It is believed to be of the first century as Pope Urban II is shown in the painting looking intently at the face of the Christ.

I learned the hard way, you cannot make a mistake or be off even a few millimeters if you want a face to look right.   To do a accurate face reproduction is difficult,  detailed work that requires very specific and unique measurements to be replicated.\n No 2 faces are the same, in the same way no 2 snow flakes are the same when viewed under a microscope.\n I did go on google and got the best straight on shot of Johnny Depp I could find that looked like it could work.  I will attempt with others of him.\nThe problem is when I drop his face image into The Shroud it is not the same.   I enlarged the image correctly and matched up the nose as perfectly as possible, then placed image over The Shroud and then the eyes are way below the place they need to be, and numerous other points will not line up.    Some match some don’t.  It is awkward looking. \nThe same challenge occurred with every image I have tried so far,\nJohn Lennon (3 different photos)\nMona LIsa and Abe Lincoln.\nWhat is noteworthy in the case of the fresco is that it just falls into place. I enlarged the image maintaining aspect ratio matched up the nose and that was it. It worked. No struggle, not fighting with the image to fit.   The forehead lines up, the eyebrows line up, the eyes are in the right place, the gap between the eyes is correct, the space between eyes and nose is correct,  Space between nose and mouth is correct.  Beard lines up.  The whole thing lines up.  It took me less than 15 minutes to put the images together. \nNo other image is lining up like this fresco does.  It not only looks right,  “it feels right”  \nNonetheless, I am going to play the role of a hard core serious skeptic on this and not just wave a white flag because I spent a few hours with 6 different images, if you have a image you think will fit, let me know and I will drop it in and see if it works.\n\n","date":"August 19, 2014 at 11:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-144887","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

No two portraits, even of the same person, match perfectly, so the question is how much distortion of various features is permitted before identity is rejected.

I had to tilt the image just a bit, spent a few hours working with it.   It is not a completely awkward fit, but you would not connect the 2 and say one was used as a role model for the other.  It does not just fall into place, like the Fresco did.  It is kind of there and kind of not there type fit. It does have several points of congruency. There is no denying that. .  Without changing aspect ratio I could blend the Lennon shot with the Shroud, so I know what you did was honest and upfront.  It does work to some degree.\n Now The Manoppello Image that I just got through comparing, was a stunning match.  It dropped into place in less than 30 seconds.\n I have never thought these 2 images had anything to do with each other.  They look vastly different to me, but when you lay this image over The Shroud, it is truly amazing.  Nearly a dead on match.  The Manoppello Image looks like there is no way it is going to blend in, but it does.  It works in a way hard to put into words, astounding is the 1st word that comes to mind.\nI do not even know what the Manoppello image is but I am certainly interested now.\nAnyways,  I am interested in using the Johnny Depp that you used in the blend shot.

But you would never look at the 2 images and conclude they were related and one was used as a role model to make the other.\nThe fresco looks like it was done using The Shroud as the role model. It is a superior match vs Depp image, there is no denying that.  Some of the accidental characteristics of the Shroud image are copied on Fresco.   No ears illustrated, odd beard shape with 2 angles going off to the left are copied.   Owl shape eyes placed precisely where the artist would see white blotches.  Forehead match.  Eyebrows match, no variation. Hair parted in same spot,  image is a straight on shot, exactly as seen on The Shroud..\nThe Image does not move as opacity is being changed and the images are combined.  It is not unlike a very odd shaped puzzle piece that fits into the empty spot. \nThe other photos I tried can fit in to some degree, but they are vague, and have errors. Like a similar puzzle piece that does not fit into the empty spot, close but no cigar.   Fresco image is not a “vague match” it is precise match.  A big difference.\nThe fresco is a triple 777 winner. It fits inside just right.\nLike the combination to a lock, even if you are off a few numbers, the lock will not open.  The fresco opens the lock,  the Depp image does not.  The numbers are off. \nTo be fair and thorough, a large number of images should be compared, like 99,000 or 1 million using facial recognition software and congruence pts.\nOf course that  It does not prove the authenticity of the Shroud. This is a single display that supports authenticity.  A small stone placed on the scale.  How much weight does it carry?  Time will tell on that one, there is still some missing information on this Fresco.\nCan’t assign a numerical weight without the info.\nBut it could start getting heavier or lighter,\nBut either way, my paycheck stays the same.

They compliment each other, like 2 halves of the same person.

In 1831, when a lad of seventeen, Heaphy accompanied his father on a visit to Italy, where he acquired a knowledge of the language and cultivated a taste for religious art, for which he always retained a strong predilection. Adopting his father’s profession, he commenced life as a portrait-painter, and for many years enjoyed an extensive patronage. He exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1831, and in 1850 sent his first subject picture, ‘The Infant Pan educated by the Wood Nymphs.’ Among his most successful works which followed were ‘Catherine and Bianca’ (1853), a series of peasant girls of various countries (1859–62), ‘Kepler mistaken for an Astrologer’ (1863), ‘Palissy the Potter taken for a Coiner’ (1864), ‘Lord Burleigh showing his Peasant Bride her new Home’ (1865), and ‘Lizzie Farren, afterwards Countess of Derby, waiting at the Prison Bars with her Father’s Breakfast’ (1872). In 1867 he sent to the exhibition of the Society of British Artists ‘General Fairfax and his Daughter pursued by the Royal Troops,’ and in that year was elected a member of the society. In 1844 he was commissioned to paint an altar-piece for the protestant church at Malta, erected at the expense of Queen Adelaide, and he also executed one for a church at Toronto, Canada. He devoted much time to investigating the origin of the traditional likeness of Christ; in the pursuit of this inquiry he travelled widely. At Rome he made careful drawings of everything illustrating the subject to which he could obtain access in the Catacombs and Vatican Library. He has given an interesting account of his difficulties in procuring the necessary permissions for this purpose. His last journey to Rome was made in 1860, and in the following year he published the result of his labours in a series of eight articles in the ‘Art Journal.’ The papers with the necessary illustrations were not reissued till 1880, seven years after his death, when they were brought out in a folio volume under the editorship of his friend Mr. Wyke Bayliss, F.S.A., with the title ‘The Likeness of Christ; an Enquiry into the verisimilitude of the received Likeness of our Blessed Lord.’ A cheap reprint has since been issued by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. The original drawings are now in the print room of the British Museum. Heaphy possessed considerable literary ability, and contributed articles on various subjects to the periodical press; among them ‘A Night in the Catacombs’ (‘St. James’s Magazine,’ 1861), ‘The Beggar Saint’ (‘Once a Week,’ 1862), and ‘Mr. H——’s Own Narrative’ (‘All the Year Round,’ 1861); the last tale attracted great attention, and was subsequently republished in a separate form under the title ‘A Wonderful Ghost Story,’ with letters from Charles Dickens to the author on the subject. During the last four years of his life, when ill-health kept him much indoors, he painted a series of types of foreign beauty, and wrote accounts of them in various publications. At an early period Heaphy assumed the additional christian name ‘Frank,’ with the view of thereby distinguishing his works from those of his father, but dropped it before 1850. He died in South Belgravia, 7 Aug. 1873. In 1842 he married Eliza Bradstreet, daughter of Joseph Bradstreet, of the family of Little Wenham, Suffolk, by whom he had many children.]\nDictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 25\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900\nCarlos\n\n","date":"August 21, 2014 at 12:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145131","author":"Carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

In the absence of a Secondo Pia in medieval times or earlier, it’s hard to see how the TS image could have hugely influenced art (except for providing a beard and moustache)? They say the eyes are the window to the soul, but the eyes of the TS image are generally and conveniently agreed to be shut!\nThere are other reasons why a beard and moustache (and longish hair) could have come to be adopted as standard that do not depend on prior sight of the TS. They disguise to some extent the individuality of clean-shaven features, making easier the task of representing Jesus in art, and perhaps also as a sop to those who considered any image to be blasphemous. The facial hair serves therefore as a partial cover-up.\n\n","date":"August 21, 2014 at 3:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145158","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

I agree with Hugh below, ultimately the facial recognition exercise, while intriguing, is only going to frustrate both sides of the argument because it is so subjective and is not decisive.\n\n","date":"August 21, 2014 at 9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145234","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces. Is it Possible?","post":"I don’t dispute any of that, David G,  but there’s no escaping from the somewhat scary quality of the ‘as is’ TS image,  which is the only one that artists of any period would have seen prior to Secondo Pia. \nPut (shroud of turin) into Google image files, and the vast majority of returns are Secondo Pia type reversals, ones that most folk respond to immediately as ‘the real Jesus’. Then look quickly at the few ‘as is” images on offer, and there’s that off-putting dare one say grotesque quality, seemingly with eyes gouged out.\nSo I fail to see how the TS could have produced the appearance we now describe as ‘Christ-like’  (gentle Jesus meek and mild, as per hymn). At best, it would have said there’s a beard, moustache  and longish hair. Anything else would have been blanked out in the artistic eye and mind.\nBut here’s a thought to conjure with. Suppose it had been artists, maybe under pressure from the early Church, who decided that Jesus had to be shown with facial hair, to avoid revealing too much of a “real” likeness, that being largely, indeed entirely conjectural. \nBut that has knock-on effects. When you add a beard and moustache to an initially clean-shaven male face, you tend to make it bottom-heavy. The facial hair tends to dominate, and not everyone warms to the sight of facial ‘fungus’ anyway.. Artists may then have been tempted to compensate,  first by elongating the face and nose, making them thinner, to de-emphasize the bulking effect of facial hair, while also omitting ears that might tend to detract from the haunting new sallowness via their Toby Jug like effect. Larger more doleful eyes too would have helped in balancing out the image . \nWhat you end up with is an arguably less realistic, more stylized, more arresting iconic face, one that some have described as displaying a ‘gothic’  influence.\n The evolved image, now ticking all the correct sensibility boxes, religious and artistic, may then have served as a model –  first for codex illustrations and oil paintings, then for 3D crucifixes and life-sized bronzes etc.and finally as template for that unattractive 14th century negative imprint that we now call the TS, rather than things being the other way round.\nAs I’ve said before, my money’s on the TS having initially been a Templar-created artifact, possibly to represent Jesus, or perhaps  ‘Jesus-like’ for reasons one can only speculate. It was then skilfully re-invented by the knightly De Charny and/or his wife as a Veronica-like sweat imprint on the ‘real’  burial shroud, designed to attract pilgrims to their newly-founded church.  The rest as they say is history (and supporting 20th century science of uneven quality, much of it, dare one say, clearly agenda-driven).\n\n","date":"August 21, 2014 at 11:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145242","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

And if the image was originally sharper (having faded much over time) then I don’t see any major challenge for an early artist to produce a portrait of some detail – certainly filling in the gaps with imagination and some knowledge of Jewish facial features.

Thus we have the absurdity of the ‘collapsing cloth’ theory that even Rogers felt obliged to dismiss as unscientific.\nTo be scientific means to be entirely objective, considering all possibly models without preconceptions as to age or provenance. In a medieval scenario, that means viewing the image as produced by contact-only, i.e. in accordance with feasible physics and chemistry, and contact moreover, i.e. a source of thermal or chemical energy capable of leaving a contact imprint. But one is then no longer constrained to modelling with a loosely draped cloth. One can consider the problem of imprinting into the valleys and hollows of a 3D template that would normally be inaccessible to a loosely draped cloth that missed them through bridging extremities. That’s where some methodology I described previously comes into its own, i.e. with manual moulding of linen to 3D relief, increasing the area that is imprinted.\nAs for contact or contact-only, I consider that a semantic irrelevance, believing as I do that there is no known physics that will imprint across air gaps.  If you or anyone thinks there is, Thibault, then please specify the nature of the process. Is it convection or radiation? If radiation, is it electromagnetic or not? if electromagnetic, which part of the spectrum? \nFor my part, I regard the TS image as the product of a contact-only mechanism, so make no apology whatsoever for occasionally omitting the word “only”.

That’s where some methodology I described previously comes into its own, i.e. with manual moulding of linen to 3D relief, increasing the area that is imprinted”\nAt least we agree that the “scorch hypothesis” is a contact-only model: no contact=no color.\nYour experiments as well as my own experiments clearly show that neither convection nor radiation can produce a color in this model.\nI agree that manual moulding of linen to 3D relief can increase the imprinted area.\nThis is obvious.\nHowever, looking carefully at your crucifix experiments, many areas of your heated crucifix are not at all imprinted (for example the thighs): there is no color at all in those areas.\nYour 3D rendering is misleading: these uncolored areas seem to have 3D properties (ImageJ) but these pseudo-3D properties (in those uncolored areas) come from the shadows coming from the “valleys” in the fabric which are only the result of the pressure applied to the fabric.\nIn practice, it seems very difficult (according to my and your experiments) to obtain a color from the “valleys” of the template. \nYou wrote: ” As for contact or contact-only, I consider that a semantic irrelevance, believing as I do that there is no known physics that will imprint across air gaps. If you or anyone thinks there is, Thibault, then please specify the nature of the process. Is it convection or radiation? If radiation, is it electromagnetic or not? if electromagnetic, which part of the spectrum?”\nYou know what? I have to thank you for your help.

Now look at the TS image, or any negative image for that matter, and you will see that the parts of the face that one would normally see in life or positive photographs as that all-important shade are not there, having been converted by tone-inversion to white space. So is it any surprise that it is easier to achieve “congruence” between a positive and a negative image, each complementing and thus making good the deficiencies of the other, than between two positive or two negative images?\nSorry, but the technique is biased in favour of achieving a match (or at any rate, an impression of one, probably spurious) via that mutual complementation effect.\n\n","date":"August 21, 2014 at 4:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145167","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces. Is it Possible?","post":"Hello Mr. Collin Berry: I can assure you there are no parades taking place on my behalf here in Central America or any other  country.\nThe Fresco matches up with The Shroud image whether I want it to or not.  Any portrait painter (including myself) would not have any trouble determining where to place the lines based on this negative image. There is more than enough image to know where to draw the lines of the face, chin, nose, length of head and beard.\n  The sides of the face are vague,because of the white lines (chin band?) that would present a challenge.\nBut All the important gaps are clearly visible.\nThe placement, size and shape and of the eyes would be the most difficult aspect of this work, since none are illustrated.  In which I would have struggled the hardest to place. \nThe artist that did this fresco did not have the Shroud in front of him, but the person who painted the fresco on the wall in which this was made may have the actual Shroud as the role model.  There is no way to be sure of that, but it CANNOT be eliminated as a possibility that this could be a second or third generation copy.\nTo really map out the points correctly on the Shroud and make a reproduction would take 2 or more people, one up close to the image another standing back and confirming points.   Once that math was established a standard would be set for future and additional replica’s.  Which I am convinced is exactly what happened.\n  But it does not matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove.  I am not a point where I am able to do that yet.   This Fresco is just a appetizer, the main entree is being prepared, so every body can get a full meal and be satisfied.\nIn the early centuries of course a reproduction would be made with the rights and lefts not corrected.  With “E” on left side. Unless one thought to do a replica with the image in a mirror, “Hey, let’s correct the lefts and rights of the image”   Possible, but not likely. \nComparison image should also be matched with the rights and lefts not corrected. \nThis  reproduction of Jesus matches the unique characteristics and even a few of the accidental characteristics of The Shroud of Turin. Some but not all.\nI am looking at it up close on video editing software.  The images are placed on separate tracks and I can change the opacity so one begins to bleed into the other.\nI observing what I am seeing and writing it down.   Going from one to the other.  The same thing I have done with over a 100 paintings to replicate them. \nI cannot force either image to do what I want, or display what I want to see, only what is and then replicate it.  I am very good at replicating art.   I see a person replicating The Shroud. \nStarting from the top.\n1. Same width of hair on top of head before forehead visible.\n2. Parts hair in middle in replicating Man in The Shroud,\n3. Forehead same length, width and shape\n4. Eyebrows begin at exact same location and follow same unique shape\n5. Owl Like Eyes added precisely where they need to be with proper space between\n6. Nose begins and ends at the same spot and follows same shape\n7.Does not illustrate ears, although it looks like they should be,  matching Shroud\n8. Illustrates blood stains in the hair where blood is on Shroud (Accidental characteristics)\n9. Width, size and shape of lips match, follows same unique path.\n10. Mustache and beard line up and leaves blank spots where Shroud image is blank.\n10. Copies shape of dark angled lines of forked beard  (Accidental characteristic)\n11. Replicates lines on side of face by shading both sides. (Accidental characteristic)\n12. Length, width and unique shape of entire head is the same. \nWhere the image deviates is the hair on the lower ends. That is all. \nthere is no one piece of evidence that authenticates The Shroud.  This is only a single display that tips the scale toward authenticity.   No one can argue that this tips the scale the other way, or has no weight at all.\nIt is not possible to assign a numerical value of weight to this evidence until more information is available and more comparisons done, up to 1 million\nusing Congruence points and facial recognition software. That is how a accurate number could be established. A combination of both.   That has not been done yet.\n\n","date":"August 22, 2014 at 4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145504","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

It’s the entire validity of the exercise in attempting to merge one image with another of entirely different character – positive and negative – where one makes good the gaps in the other through combining (apparent) shade v non-shade.\nWhat’s more, having slept on the composite image posted earlier, focusing especially on the two positives, I’ve come to the conclusion that the most basic aspect of physiognomy – the overall shape of the face  – a reflection of underlying bone structure – is entirely different for TS v fresco image (or rather derivative at-second-hand fresco).\n\nThe TS face is iconic in an artistic sense by virtue of its peculiar and distinctive linearity, nay ‘rectangularity’, which some have described as essentially gothic (though I’m largely ignorant re art history). The fresco image is not iconic, except maybe for the depiction of those sad doe-like eyes, which while arguably gothic as well (“Man of Sorrows”) is an exercise in artistic licence, inasmuch as the eyes of the man on the TS are either closed (or possibly non-imaged). The fresco face is more typically triangular, tapering from a broad forehead down to a narrow chin.\nNow I’m aware that some consider the linearity of the TS face to be a result of banding in the yarn, due in turn to bleaching differences, with alleged additive effects of image and background colour (that I don’t pretend to understand). But even if that were the case, implying that the TS image is not a true “likeness” and in need of image-supplementation – which some have experimented with – one is left with the small embarrassment of a work of art failing to match the iconic one on which you claim it is based, in respect of its most crucial feature, namely that vertical linearity and severe symmetrical cut-off at both sides.\nNice try DavidH. Maybe a slim Havana cheroot, but no fat cigar.  Not from this sceptic at any rate – one who views the TS as an ingenious medieval artefact (serving only to “remind us of the Passion” as a recent Pope cautiously put it).\n\n","date":"August 23, 2014 at 1:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145572","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

They look to be eyebrows on the cloth image but they are not. Manopello image was “not fooled” by the falsely perceived  high set eyebrows image on cloth and did not copy them,  it matches the true face. They are set lower in the 1898 negative. Many of the old frescoes copy the “falsely perceived high set eyebrows”  More evidence that supports authenticity.\nThe Thomas Heaphy reproduction of the fresco copies the high set eyebrows,  Also Thomas H sketch copies the angle of the forked beard, leaves blank what is blank on Shroud, and when that is matched up everything lines up, eyebrows, nose, eyes, lips, everything.  That cannot be a coincidence, possible but highly unlikely.  IT is a match, no one shall convince me otherwise.

I did some experiments with 3D figures of Jesus covered in myrrh and aloes and left them for 3 days.\nIn pure linen fabric.    I still have the photos and the linen from 3 years ago. \nIt did look convincing.  Made a great mold and could stand up the linen,  a linen statue of Jesus at the end, the sepia, caramel color, no traces of paint or pigment, yet the linen does look painted.   Over time the cloth softens a bit and flattens.  (3 years ago I did this)\nOf course no distance information, numerous other problems that did not match Shroud image.  It was just a experiment I did, then exposed the myrrh resin to the brightest light I could get.  A poloraid flash gun. \nI really think if the Templar Knights were going to do a Shroud deal, they would have the read Gospel and done it this way, according to Gospel account\nAnd there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices\nI believe Shroud image is combo of both.   Mr. Light and Mr. Imprint both involved.\nBear in mind myrrh resin will react to light by changing color.  Up close with a poloraid flash gun it will turn darker. ” Can be used as a substitute for cellulose acetate.  (not as good though) \nRay Rodgers found starch fractions and pectin that he believed made up the micro thin where the image resides.\nPerhaps you could try a few experiments with myrrh resin.  Bear in mind it is expensive.  I would not want your hard earned money to be spent with dissappointing results. \nBut before eliminating myrrh as being on The Shroud I made these comparison notes.\nCOMBINED CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF STARCH FRACTIONS & PECTIN IN COMPARISON TO MYRRH AND ALOES AS MENTIONED IN THE GOSPEL\nThese substances (Starch fractions & Pectin) were found to make up the micro thin layer where the image of The Shroud of Turin Resides.\nLet’s begin by defining what starch & pectin is made up & see if the chemical properties match up with “the 100lb weight of myrrh and aloes” as mentioned in the Gospel of John. \nAmylose (you might disagree with that) was found on the Shroud of Turin and is a spiral polymer made up of D-glucose units.   It is the main component which makes up starch. Starch and cellulose are polymers derived from the dehydration of D-glucose. Starch is a polysaccharide (meaning “many sugars”) made up of glucose units linked together to form long chains.\nThe main component of Pectin is D Galacturonic acid, which is a sugar acid, an oxidized form of D-Galactose.\nPectin is a polysaccharide of 1 – 4 linked polygalacturonic acid with intra chain Rhamnose insertion, neutral sugar side chains and methyl esterification from many of the rhamnose residues, side chains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-Galactose, L-Arabinose and D-Xylose,\nPECTIN is also a uronic acid,  Naturally occurring uronic acids are D-glucuronic acid, D-galacturonic acid.  \nLet’s make a simplified list of what Starch and Pectin are made up of.\n1.Uronic Acids\n2.D Gluceronic Acid & D-Galacturonic acid.\n3.Polygalacturonic acid  (An oxidized form of D Galactose)\n4.Glucose\n5. L-Arabinose\n6.D-Xylose\n7.Rhamnose\nNOW LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MYRRH AND ALOES IN COMPARISON TO STARCH AND PECTIN \nMyrrh resin contains D Galactose and L Arabinose, Xylose and 4>0 methyl D-Gluceronic acid  From the resin yields Uronic Acid 19% D-Galactose 60%\n L-Arabinose 10% and L-Rhamnose 5% \nMany of the health benefits associated with Aloe vera have been attributed to the polysaccharides contained in the gel of the leaves.\nA variety of polysaccharides are present in the cell wall matrix. An overall carbohydrate analysis showed that the cell walls of the aloe leaf hold mainly polysaccharides, cellulose and pectic polysaccharides whereas the skin of the leaf contains in addition significant quantities of xylose-containing polysaccharides\nAloes contain cellulose and hemicellulose and store carbohydrates.\nSaccharides in aloes are,  Mannose, Glucose, L-Rhamnose, Aldopentose\nTHE PRIMARY POLYSACCHARIDE IN ALOES IS A PECTIC SUBSTANCE.\nMYRRH & ALOES          STARCH & PECTIN\n1.

Glucose                          5. Glucose\n6.  L-Arabinose                  6. L-Arabinose\n7.. D-Xylose                        7.. D-Xylose\n8.. L Rhamnose                   8. L Rhamnose                                                                      \nDr. Baima Bollone a professor of forensic medicine in Turin claimed to have found myrrh and aloes in the BLOOD by antibody-antigen testing, this evidence would support his findings.\nNote   Myrrh resin also contains many volatile oils and other chemical properties such as (limonene, eugenol, pinene, terpenes, sesquiterpenes, esters, cinnamaldehyde, cuminaldehyde, cumic alcohol, heerabolene, dipentene, m-cresol and cadinene), resins (myrrhin, alpha-, beta- and gamma-compiphoric acids, commiphorinic acid, alpha- and beta-heerabomyrrhols, heeraboresene, commiferin, campesterol, beta-sitosterol, alpha-amyrone\nAll of which would have evaporated over the course of almost 2000 years with only the remnant of the sugars/carbs of the myrrh remaining.\nThere is, on the outermost fibers of the cloth a clear washing residue: a thin coating of starch fractions and the various saccharides found in soapwort: glucose, fucose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid.\nSugars in myrrh and aloes are the same sugars in soapwort\n1.Glucose\n2. Galactose\n3. Arabinose\n4. Xylose\n5. Fucose\n6. Gluceronic Acid\n7. Rhamnose\nAnd there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices.\nBottom Line:  Try some myrrh resin with your contact experiments.   It also has other great side benefits,  a great skin cream, it makes you look younger, not saying you look old.\nLeaves no trace of paint or pigment.\n\n","date":"August 24, 2014 at 11:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145940","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

Fanti, Di Lazzaro, Jackson etc etc are not beavering away as we speak,  accumulating and publishing more and more experimental data in support of their corona discharge, laser beam or other radiation models? Go figure, as they say.\nI maintain now, as I have done since looking briefly at a radiation model in December 2012 (charcoal-sensitized thermo-stencilling) that contact imprinting, thermal or thermochemical,  is the only game in town, not just through being able to accommodate most of the distinctive features  of the TS image (negativity, superficiality, lack of external pigment, 3D-properties etc) but to do so utilizing the laws, facts and principles of chemistry, physics and botany. \nIn passing, if you are so convinced of your ideas re the power of the Holy Spirit to intervene directly in folk’s personal lives, then why did that book of yours (“Convinced”) need to run to 245 pages? Could it not have been expressed more concisely, maybe with some divine assistance?\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Convinced-steps-clothed-healing-Spirit-ebook/dp/B0071BFHXG\nDo you really believe you have a “hot line” allowing you to act as go-between, as the publisher’s (author”s?) blurb would seem to suggest? \nThinks: who was it who said ” I won’t insult your intelligence by suggesting you really believe what you just said?\n\n","date":"August 25, 2014 at 2:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145968","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

But that’s ok.\nThe Shroud of Turin is actually involved in the writing of that book.  That is a long story.\nBut the title and illustration kind of says it all.   I got convinced.\nIt was written with a chemically dependent person in mind.  It is based on the steps of the AA program. The reason for the seemingly long length of the book is because people represent the world in different ways, visual, audio and kinesthetic, so things are explained in all 3 ways, which takes up more space.  I did a series of 40 paintings for the book that took up more space.  Only some of them made it inside. \nAnyways I’ve seen some your past posts so I know you have elevated knowledge in chemistry and physics,  far superior than my own primitive, basic understanding at best.\nI thought there might be something in what I wrote that could be useful info for you.\nPerhaps.not.\nI’m here in Central America on a rather serious mission, seeking the will of God and the power to carry it through.

The argument, this time as in the past, follows a well-worn route, and goes like this:\n1) These two images are identical in so many instances that anyone can see one must be directly derived from the other.\n2) Tiny detailed congruences are more significant than broadly obvious differences, such as the overall shape of the head and distribution of hair.\n3) Of course the artist did not copy the Shroud exactly, as he did not want to portray a dead body.\n4) The image on the Shroud shows such a battered face it is hardly surprising that the artist cleaned it up for his portrait.\n5) Although we now admit that the two images don’t look anything like each other, we still think it is perfectly obvious that they must be related.\nWell, it won’t do. Either the two images are an ‘exact match,’ (by some definition of ‘exact’) in which circumstance a case for identity can at least be claimed, or they are not, in which case it can’t. Of course, it’s not impossible that an artist, seeing a rectangular face, vertically falling hair, bushy moustache and prominent lower lip should nevertheless convert this to a triangular face, moulded hair, minimal moustache and prominent upper lip, but such a hypothesis cannot be defended on the strength of the images alone.\n\n","date":"August 24, 2014 at 8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145809","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

You will see mentions in that link to the new artistic fashion of representing the crucified Jesus, right down to “crossed hands” (though unhelpfully not illustrated). \nThat medieval New Age trend would almost certainly have been mightily assisted  (according to that same wiki article) by the Pope in 1350 lavishing  rewards in the form of indulgences (“14,000 years” no less off one’s thumb-twiddling spell in purgatory) in return for paying homage to the then original and still extant ‘Man of Sorrows’ image, a come-on marketing ploy if ever there. Inescapable imperative: to conform, nay prostrate oneself, to the then prevailing fashion (sounds off stage – ringing cash registers, or the medieval equivalent thereof). \n1350 note, that being just 5-7 years before the first recorded appearance in the written record of a certain image at Lirey of a presumably crucified man with those, er, crossed hands, arguably displaying the same artistically-daring, height-of-fashion “man of sorrows” look, albeit somewhat quirky and OTT.\n Maybe it was the medieval equivalent of the ‘socialist realism’ demanded of artists and musicians in the Soviet era.

But there is a way of amplifying image density in a manner highly suited to the TS image on Shroud Scope, which is to apply the 3D tool which simply reads image density as elevation on an imaginary z axis. In other words, it amplifies into a viewer-friendly third dimension.\nThis is what you see when you do that:\n\nIt would seem to me that Thibault’s figure of 80% would apply more to the dorsal than the frontal side.\nImprinting of the frontal side is nearly complete, except for a few awkward locations that are easily explicable in a contact model, e.g. in and around crossed hands etc where linen would tend to bridge at the boundaries separating higher and lower planes.\nIt is the dorsal surface where there are major areas that have failed to imprint (not just poorly imprinted note – an important distinction).\nAs I’ve said before, there is a simple way of accounting for the differences between frontal and dorsal imprinting that is not only explicable but largely anticipated in a contact-only imprinting model.\nIt arises from a single-stage imprinting where a 3D template is first pressed dorsal side down onto the  lower half of the linen, underneath which is a soft yielding underlay, and the top half then turned over to cover the frontal surface, with a soft yielding overlay. The double layer of the latter is then being patted in and around the major contours. The two configurations are LUWU and LOTTO respectively (Linen Underneath With Underlay; Linen On Top Then Overlay). The first of those is more prone to bridging, with incomplete imprinting, whereas the latter gives a superior imprint, thanks to manual moulding of fabric to frontal relief.\n\n","date":"August 25, 2014 at 6:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-145995","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

LUWU imprinting relies on the template being pushed forcibly down into the underlay, with no possibility of precision moulding of cloth to contours. It depends solely on brute pressure with much bridging of fabric and loss of contact, e.g. backs of thighs and knees. LOTTO on the other hand involves much lighter pressure between fingers and template exerted through two layers of cloth.It permits precision imprinting, with fewer non-contact dead zones.\nThanks for the tip, OK.

Bear in mind and I am sure you must know that a imprint image will have rights and lefts reversed.  The Manopello Image if it is the result of imprint as said, the rights and lefts will be reversed.

In the same way I cannot lay the negative image of The Shroud over the positive and expect them to line up. rights and lefts are mixed up.   I understand how this needs to be done because I have done it with The Sudarium,\n I also horizontally flipped the negative image of the Shroud and laid it over the positive, so the rights and lefts are in the same place and I can see the color reversal when I bleed the images together, which is actually a amazing sight.

The image presented in your paper is the true image with rights and lefts corrected.  Bottom Line:  They match up.   I made some final fine point adjustments just now.  I am slow but persistent. I will put them together in a video so you can see how they blend together in slow motion.\n\n","date":"November 3, 2014 at 12:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-168070","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces. Is it Possible?","post":"I’m not sure what Dave Hines means by “imprint”.  The Shroud itself is a mirror image essentially because it is quasi-contact.  Do we think that the Manopello image was formed by some other process.  I would have thought that if a genuine printing of Jesus, then it would have been formed by some kind of similar quasi-contact process.  Alternatively if it is a copy of the Shroud facial image, why would the artist have reversed left-and-right?  The only way I can think of if left and right are different from the Shroud facial image, is that what is seen is actually the back of the contact surface, when they would indeed be reversed.  Do we think that is the case?  I pray that Dave H is able to resolve his current problems in Central America, and that he is not in some kind of peril.\n\n","date":"September 1, 2014 at 6:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-147715","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

Is it Possible?","post":"Hi Daveb:\nWhen I say Imprint, I am referring to blood stains.  But yes Shroud image is a mirror image with lefts and rights reversed, imprint will have the same effect, rights and lefts reversed.  If Manopello image is same process as Shroud cloth image then rights and lefts will be reversed and it would be matched up with the negative.  I looked at it both ways.  It is very easy to horizontally flip a image on video editing software, not a complicated process.\nSo if the Manopello image we see on the cloth is the same as the Shroud image on cloth that means the rights and lefts are reversed and need to be corrected.when compared  with a positive image on Shroud, or leave it as is, and match to negative so rights and lefts are in correct. place.\n I will show it both ways and also I will horizontally flip negative image of Shroud and place over positive, so only the color reversal process can be seen happening very slowly.  which by the way is a amazing sight in itself. To see the negative with positive matching up.\nI have a family member here in Central America I am helping out in a “uncomfortable situation”  which I nearly have resolved. Appreciate your concerns and prayers.  That helps.\n\n","date":"September 1, 2014 at 1:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-147820","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces. Is it Possible?","post":"I am travel mode presently but wanted to make comment about the fresco in this video and The Manopello image.  I spent well over one hundred hours looking at The Manopello image and placed it in The Shroud Face in every possible way, horizontally flipping the image and laying it over both the negative and positive image.  In the process of doing so I discovered something unique about The Shroud image that I had never noticed before.  Out of curiosity I horizontally flipped the negative face so it would match the positive and then slowly merged the 2 together so I could see the color reversal taking place in super slow motion.\nWhat are perceived as “high eyebrows” on the negative image, actually are not. That is just where the cloth made closer contact giving the illusion of “high eyebrows” which of course was copied in the fresco in this video and countless other frescoes.\nHowever, The Manopello image does NOT imitate the “high eyebrows”  they drop lower and match the positive image of The Shroud, better than the negative.  I seriously doubt the Manopello image is a result of using The Shroud as a role model, as in doing art.  It looks more like the result of contact with a face and then touch ups added with paint. Although the eyebrows seem to be in the wrong place when laying it over the negative they are actually placed correctly if one desired the true image of the Man in The Shroud.  \nThe fresco matches up the with the negative image of Shroud incredibly well.   One area that is very noteworthy is the forked beard that has 2 dark lines going off at a angle to the left and a blank area in between. This is copied exactly,   Not only that, when that is lined up, everything else lines up, nearly perfect.   The entire face. Every gap, length, distance and width.   It is the easiest image overlay I have ever done because it fit’s so perfectly.\nYou can put other faces in there, but I seriously doubt you will ever find a forked beard that fits in this image the way this Fresco does, and have every other aspect of the face line up near perfect when that is done.\nI had a harder time matching The Shroud face with the Shroud face than the Fresco.  I am convinced the Shroud was the original role model and this fresco is a 3rd or 4th generation copy of it.   But it does not matter what I believe only what I can prove.  Unfortunately that cannot be done with a single fresco.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2014 at 1:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-148423","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

Is it Possible?","post":"Hi OK,  I am behind the times. Unfortunately I cannot devote my time to this because the sick problems going on in Central America that I had to drain my bank account to fix.  My research money,  I am not happy about it. But yes I referred to the image on The Shroud as the negative and the image with color correction and rights and lefts corrected as the positive. I was looking at the Manopello image in the same way I looked at the Sudarium as possibly being a image more of a result of contact than a artist doing a reproduction using another image as a role model.  I do not think the Manopello image is a reproduction using Shroud as a role model, I think it is a contact image with a actual face.\nI wanted to know exactly where the Manopello image made contact with a face if it was indeed the result of contact. But how exactly? Both ways have many match points, whether the image is flipped horizontally or not, it is a little bit confusing. So using the paper you wrote and looking at it for well over 100 hours I made a final determination of the correct placement of the rights and lefts. As highly improbable as it may seem, that the Manopello image made contact with the face of Jesus it cannot be eliminated yet as a possibility.\nThe fact the eyebrows are in a place that matches the color corrected image and are where they should be got my attention. That image was not seen until 1898.   It could not have been used as a role model, yet it looks like it was the role model, something that was not yet in existence.\nThe frescoes follow the dimensions of the Shroud image  without color correction and imitating the “not yet corrected rights and lefts” imitating what appear to be eyebrows set up high, when actually they are not.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2014 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-148538","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.

It has been known from ancient time and is woven from the filaments exuded by certain molluscs, for attaching themselves to the sea bed.  It is now extremely rare, because of the loss of the sea grass on which the molluscs feed.  The art of byssus cloth is now only practised by a few women on a remote island near Sardinia.  I have heard that it is impossible to paint and even very difficult to dye.

If you want to see it I will put the 2 together and slowly blend them in together in a video, not changing aspect ratio of either image, fair and honest.  The Pantocrater does not fall into place like the Thomas H. fresco reproduction does,which is a superior match to the Pantocrator in many ways. \nThe Pantocrator looks to me like a reproduction of a later dated reproduction.   Basic face is there, but missing details this Thomas H. sketch has. (apparently a copy from a 1st to 3rd century fresco in Rome) I bought his book so I can hear what he has to say and look more at his art.   It was a bit difficult to find, it is out of print.\nBut the Pantocrator does have the ” unusually long bony fingers” with the thumbs barely visible,    “I wonder if that has anything to do with the shroud?” Ha, Ha.\n\n","date":"November 3, 2014 at 2:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","id":"comment-168111","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Matching Faces.
