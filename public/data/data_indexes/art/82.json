I was a little unhappy with the picture because the perspective of the picture and perhaps the camera lens made his head much larger than the body.\nThe other day while working on a piece of my work in progress, I was struck by an insight that  explains some of the quirkiness that some found in the Shroud image. Bogie’s head in the image is in disproportion to his body. He is sitting and I was taking the picture from above him. The disproportion of the image is essentially an inverted triangle.\nWhat it does is define the angle from which the picture was taken.\nThe disproportion that some see in the Shroud, is not proof that it is a painting, it may be an indication of the angles at which different parts of the image were created. Possibly only one, maybe a couple or more. \nThe proof that the Shroud is not a painting was proved by STURP whose examinations were conducted by devices that functioned at the quantum level. We do not understand yet how it was created. I think the biggest fools of all are art experts who proclaim it a painting. \nTell me art expert: was he the artist left or right handed? A good one can discern that. Where was the light source? What was the directionality of the brush strokes? How did your medieval artist learn about serum halos around blood clots which on the Shroud revealed by X-Rays. Why did he/she add features such as serum halos which were invisible until detected by twentieth century technology?\nPoint is that the “distortions” in the image don’t prove it was a painting. In fact, the variations of proportionality point in the opposite direction.\nSee http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2013/01/clumsy-me-and-shroud-of-turin.html\n\n","date":"March 1, 2013 at 9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/observations-consistent-with-a-medieval-artist/","cat":"art","id":"comment-26023","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Observations Consistent with a Medieval Artist?","post":"Can CB see/check also the Pray Ms for a nail wound in the wrist (just in case he would cate to).\n\n","date":"March 1, 2013 at 9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/observations-consistent-with-a-medieval-artist/","cat":"art","id":"comment-26024","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Observations Consistent with a Medieval Artist?","post":"Typo Can CB alos see/check also the Pray Ms for a nail wound in the wrist (just in case he would care to).\n\n","date":"March 1, 2013 at 9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/observations-consistent-with-a-medieval-artist/","cat":"art","id":"comment-26025","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Observations Consistent with a Medieval Artist?","post":"Methinks Mr Colin Berry is lackin a PhD in so many fields as far as the Turin Shroud is concerned.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2013 at 9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/observations-consistent-with-a-medieval-artist/","cat":"art","id":"comment-26028","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Observations Consistent with a Medieval Artist?","post":"Typo: lacking\n\n","date":"March 1, 2013 at 9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/observations-consistent-with-a-medieval-artist/","cat":"art","id":"comment-26029","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Observations Consistent with a Medieval Artist?","post":"In his blog CB presents us a very poor/biased picture of the Pray Ms (what about his high quality enhancements he is usually so proud to show us?) and writes: \n“I believe this is the image ( the last of 4 in the relevant Pray Codex series) that is claimed to show a nail wound in the wrist.\nOne has to be pretty desperate to base any claim for a correspondence between this image and the Shroud of Turin on the location of nail wounds, given this inexpert line image is  more like a “cartoon” in its execution than a serious attempt at art, and with there being no obvious points of correspondence here.”\nMethink, CB relies too much on a very poor/biased picture of the Pray Ms in order to make his point ‘clear’.
