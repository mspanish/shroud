I have an icon of the (same) image painted on wood that I purchased many years ago at the St. Catherine’s monastery in Sinai — after seeing the 6th century original on the wall. Sitting at my desk here in Paris, I just printed out your rendition and have now placed it immediately below my painted icon on wood. No doubt in my mind; both images taken from the Shroud — one by an artist of the day, the other by you ( I surmise) with the help of the Dynamic Auto Painter program.\n\n","date":"February 24, 2013 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/24/impression-for-a-sunday/","cat":"art","id":"comment-25491","author":"Judy","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Impression for a Sunday","post":"Judy’s comment sent me searching for an icon that might match her description – Google on “ikons of St Catherine’s monastery Sinai”.  I landed on a site with an amazing array of icon images, but couldn’t identify anything that matched Dan’s posting above (evidently a Shroud image).  Can Judy give a title to the work she has a copy of, maybe even post a copy to Dan?  \nFor those who want to see an amazing array of St Cathenne’s icons, go to:\nhttp://www.google.co.nz/search?q=icons+st+catherine+monastery+sinai&hl=en&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=S2sqUZKJB-isiAKEtIHIDg&sqi=2&ved=0CEMQsAQ&biw=1418&bih=772 \n[Sorry about the length of the URL, but that’ how it copied!]\n\n","date":"February 24, 2013 at 3:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/24/impression-for-a-sunday/","cat":"art","id":"comment-25539","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
