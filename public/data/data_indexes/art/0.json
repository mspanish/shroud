[{"title":"The Veronica is not in St. Peter’s","post":"This is only my personal perception but I never thought the face on the Manoppello vail is really the same as the face we see on the Shroud.  Just a quick comparison between the beards and it’s pretty evident to me that this is 2 different faces.  The beard on the Shroud look much more hairy.  I think it’s just a “psychological suggestion” kind of thing that make some people say that the face on the Manoppello vail come from the same man than the one who was buried in the Shroud.  That’s my personal reflection on the possibility that the vail and the Shroud can be related.  \nNow, for the Veronica vail, I think it’s true that the authentic cloth is not in Rome no more because there’s some good clues to show that the one in Rome is a copy (and not even an exact copy) of the original.  I also think it is possible that the Manoppello vail can be the authentic Veronica vail that was stolen from Rome.  But, as I said earlier, I don’t think this relic is directly related to the Shroud of Turin.  And since I believe the Shroud is authentic, I have to think this Manoppello vail (maybe the authentic Veronica vail) have to be a false relic (most probaly an artwork).\n\n","date":"January 8, 2012 at 8:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/08/the-veronica-is-not-in-st-peters/","cat":"art","id":"comment-6693","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"}]
