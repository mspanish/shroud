Were all of these “add ons” sometime after 1516? One would think that the Lier Shroud would have depicted them if they existed on the shroud at the time the Lier Shroud was painted.\n\n","date":"April 25, 2014 at 5:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/paper-chase-pam-moon-suggests-lucas-cranach-the-elder-painted-the-lier-copy/","cat":"art","id":"comment-103511","author":"Thomas","site":"shroudstory"}]
