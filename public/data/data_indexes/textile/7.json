[{"title":"New Textile Report","post":"Trying to take a quick look at the new report by Donna Campbell MA,\nat p. 12 of 17, we can read:\n>When enlarged (Fig. 24) the black fibre appears to be a tightly twisted thread.\n>Possibly a byssus thread (or sea silk) used in ancient times.\n>Since it doesn’t seem to be woven into the fabric, its function could have been for stitching.\n>This may lead again to signs of repairs within the shroud fabric. Whatever its use, the black thread appears in the images to be an integral part of the sample. …\n— —\nOriginal website image ref: p2575_2\n— —\nSo …\nI have found a photo showing extreme fineness of the byssus thread of Pinna nobilis :\n\nThen I am curious about the exact dimensions for that thread.\nSee also the textile composition :\nHow many fibrils are present in that “black fibre” ?\n— — —\nIs that “black fibre” a modern synthetic thread ???\nI hope to see the truth for that sample after future analyses …\n\n","date":"September 19, 2014 at 9:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/18/new-textile-report/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-152488","author":"Piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Textile Report","post":"I believe you want to see the inherent image:\nhttps://archdams.arch.ox.ac.uk/?c=1203&k=1bcdc90a8b\n\n","date":"September 19, 2014 at 9:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/18/new-textile-report/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-152490","author":"Piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Textile Report","post":"I have written to the author of the paper for a bit more explanation. The fibre is far too thin to be any kind of stitching thread. If it is twisted into a shroud thread I wondered if it could be a hair from the weaver or spinner. If not, then a fibril from one of the stitches used to connect the backing cloth to its outer backing, a hair from a researcher or priest, or a modern fibre from clothing or floating house-dust.\n\n","date":"September 19, 2014 at 11:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/18/new-textile-report/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-152506","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Textile Report","post":"Or a hair from the body itself?\n\n","date":"September 19, 2014 at 11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/18/new-textile-report/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-152509","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"New Textile Report","post":"Looks interesting.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2014 at 10:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/18/new-textile-report/","cat":"paper_chase","id":"comment-153203","author":"Andy","site":"shroudstory"}]
