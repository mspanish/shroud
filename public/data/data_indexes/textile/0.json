[{"title":"Analysis of Fibers in the Raes Area","post":"Dear reader,\nI did not analyse the “fibers” (in fact threads or yarns) # 1 and 14.\nI only tried to count the number of cotton fibers in Raes thread #7.\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdf\nSee also part 2 and 3.\nQuestions ?\nRogers (not myself), using micro-chemistry,found a dye on the other Raes (and C14) threads he had.\nHe also found and end-to-end splice in Raes #1. Villareal and al. from the Los Alamos laboratory confirmed this observation and found that the splice was secured by a brown crust which seems to be some kind of resin. \nThibault.\n\n","date":"November 28, 2015 at 3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/28/analysis-of-fibers-in-the-raes-area/","cat":"reader_inquiry","id":"comment-215254","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Analysis of Fibers in the Raes Area","post":"I am just curious as to whether the Raes threads 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ,13, and 14 were analyzed, because so far the only threads that have been found with traces of cotton are only 1, 7, and 14.
