You as a historian might be interested in what I’ve just this minute found on a site called http://www.historian.net:\nFACT: The shroud is a herringbone twill with a 3:1 weave, of probably 1st century Syrian design. The flax fibrils contain entwisted cotton fibrils from a previous work of the loom. The cotton is Gossypium herbaceum, a Middle Eastern species not found in Europe. (Raes, G.: La Sindone, 1976; Tyrer, J. Textile Horizons, Dec, 1981)\nHow can the writer be so certain that the cotton is carry-over from previous weaving, especially as cotton fibrils are “entwisted”? Would the latter not suggest that there was co-spinning of flax and cotton  fibres with the deliberate intention of producing a blend?\nOh, and am I not right in thinking that just because the cotton is not indigenous to Europe does not mean that it could not have been imported from Egypt, say, in the cotton boom period of medieval France?\nIrrespective: why all the song and dance right now about cotton in the radiocarbon sample when it seems clear from above that cotton has long been recognized as a component of the Shroud’s weave (whether there as a contaminant or purposeful addition)?\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 3:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48344","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?","post":"According to Mazzaoui, Gossypium herbaceum, now superseded by other species, was the  species of cotton  imported into medieval Europe. There was lots of it around as importing raw cotton for manufacture into cloth was big business and linen and cotton weavers worked together and, as noted above, cotton threads and linen threads could alternate, as in a Milanese cloth where there was a ratio of twelve linen to three cotton warp threads. Lots of potential for cotton fibres to drift in and out of flax piles and then even, unwittingly, get spliced in !\n So Raes’ claim of ‘not found in Europe” is not true of the Middle Ages and if his cotton did come in from a loom it is likely to be a medieval one.\nMy personal view, and it echoes in a contribution by Hugh in another posting, is that there is simply not evidence of ENOUGH cotton, wherever it came from, to make a difference to radiocarbon dating.\nIt will need a minute examination of the Shroud to find out in which other parts cotton fibres are present and, of course, these may well have come in from cotton coverings of the Shroud.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 4:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48345","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?","post":"QED, maybe.\n I posted to Hugh as I recall, someone can check, that Rogers tests had determined a difference in vanillin between C14 fibers and fibers from the rest of the Shroud. I would be interested in any tests demonstrated contrary results in the non-C14 areas from the main portion of the Shroud.. That test was limited to the linen fiber content of both C14 area and non-C14 areas. Has anyone replicated those tests or shown them to be in error?\nI also recall that explanations that the vanillin content being non-existent may have been caused by the fire in 1532. That of course would mean that the anomalous C14 area was certainly much younger than than the main body. Now the vanillin content may be a rough indicator compared to other methods of measuring age, but the difference between existence and non-existence is pretty absolute.\nLet me quote Rogers directly:\n“Sometimes it is simpler to do an experiment. The fire of 1532 did that experiment\nfor us. Any heating at the time of the fire would decrease the amount of vanillin in the\nlignin as a function of the temperature and time heated. Different amounts of vanillin\nwould have been lost in different areas, depending on the temperature and how long the\ntemperature took to return to normal.. No samples from any location on the Shroud gave\nthe vanillin test. Since the Shroud and other very old linens do not give the vanillin test, I\nbelieve that we can be confident that the cloth is quite old. It is very unlikely that the linen\nwas produced during medieval times. See Chapter IX for an explanation of the difference\nbetween the radiocarbon age determination and the observations on the linen’s production\ntechnology and composition.” (Rogers, p. 43, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, Barrie Schwortz, Florrisant, CO.,  2008) (Barrie was the editor and publisher of Rogers’ book which is available on Lulu.com)\nWhat this may mean is a direct connection between the Margaret of Austria’s will and the patch is not likely. However, that was a theory or speculation. The key is  the difference in composition, whatever the cause. \nThe fact is that we do not know, and will probably never know, how many times the Shroud was altered or mended. Enzo Delorenzi, a member of the Turin Commission that studied the Shroud in 1969 and 1973, wrote:\n“…I should like to mention the impression I received during\nthe course of my examination, namely, that more pairs of\nhands have carried out the darning than is suggested in the\nhistorical records (the four Clarissas of Chambery, the\nBlessed Valfre and the Princess Clotilde).” \nBecause  the only interwoven cotton verified on the Shroud is in the anomalous area of the C-14 testing, what  Berry and Freeman  have demonstrated is that the anomalous area is in fact of medieval origin. QED\nDoes anyone have any evidence of this cotton interwoven in any other area of the Shroud?  Rogers had fibers from non Raes -C14 areas of the Shroud and checked those against his findings of he Raes sample. They were different and he did not find interwoven cotton.\nI think I cam agree with Berry and Freeman: the C14 area contained medieval cotton and linen inter woven. To prove that it is not anomalous, demonstrate were else on the Shroud such interwoven fibers exist? Do  they exist throughout the Shroud?  Note, there are other patches but only some are documented.\nEvidence other Mde Fleury-Luxemburg’s visual observations is necessary because the contrary evidence is “deep” scientific examinations. Until someone does, I’m moving on although I will cover this in a post to my blog sometime this week if I have a chance to do it right.\nLet me state, I appreciate these interchanges. I will adjust my thoughts when appropriate. There is great deal of romance to the Margaret of Austria will theory. It appears that it will never be proven. It also appears that while Rogers and his associates proved the anomalous nature of the C14 area, he may have  may disproven the will theory.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 7:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48370","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?","post":"John Klotz: “I think I cam agree with Berry and Freeman: the C14 area contained medieval cotton and linen inter woven.

It has first to be shown that is is anomalous!  I can’t speak for NY courts of law, but that’s how science operates (onus or burden of proof etc). Declaring the radiocarbon sample to be a late intruder on account of cotton contamination is simply not evidence of it being anomalous, given that it has long been recognized that there are at least traces of cotton throughout the entire Shroud.\nTime and again one finds it is the presence or absence of proper controls that distinguishes genuine science from inferior imitations.  So much for the basic principles and MO of science. As for the practice, no one should underestimate the difficulty of instituting proper controls for quantifying the amounts and distribution of cotton contamination, given we are dealing at the level of individual fibres, not whole threads (there being typically 200 or more fibres per thread that would each have to be examined to check whether they were cotton or flax).\nMethinks the ball is in your court, John, if you still wish to maintain that the radiocarbon dating was wrong due to contamination, at least by an exceptionally cotton-rich patch. You may find it jerst one big, cotton-pickin’ nuisance…  ;-)\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 7:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48376","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?","post":"“Berry and Freeman have demonstrated is that the anomalous area is in fact of medieval origin.” If you are happy to buy that, John,  and there may be objections to it, then you are only just beginning .

There have been detailed scientific examinations of the Shroud particularly in 1978. None of  the STURP scientists found interwoven carbon in the parts of the Shroud they were examining.  The lower corner that was frequently handled throughout the public expositions of the Shroud through 1933 was not an object on interest because they were concentrating on the image and blood stains, none of which were in that corner.\nThere is an interesting papers by Mark Oxley that covers the water front. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf\nOne thing I learned from the Oxley paper that I had not noticed before is a comment by Rogers that the procedures for cleaning the samples prior to the C14 tests would have removed the evidence of the dye that he found.  Rogers samples were not decontaminated and therefore the evidence of the dye was still there. I would appreciate your not arguing this point with me. None of my research is original and I rely on published sources. Read the sources such Oxley’s article and then if you have counter sources or observations state them. But the Shroud is a physical object and there is an enormous amount of published data on its scientific examination. Seat of pants observations or “trust me, I am a physicist,” without citation to that data, just  don’t cut it. That certainly  applies to art historians who carefully opine with out any detailed reference to the scientific data.\nAs I noted in an earlier post today, the rapture that you have proven that the interwoven cotton was of medieval origin only proves that the patch is newer than the main body of the Shroud which lacks such interwoven cotton. QED\nI am sorry that my request to Freeman to produce his resources offended you. I think my language while sharp was appropriate. I sure you are aware, given your background,  of the old adage: “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.”\nPerhaps my work at sometime will invoke a more public debate beyond this blog.

Hugh (below) mentions the use by STURP of sticky tape samples, but when you read Rogers claim that the Raes corner was more cotton-rich than his rare sightings of cotton from the rest of the Shroud you find he is comparing Raes threads with sticky tape surface extractions only (in other words, not like-with-like, since tape tends to extract surface fibres, not whole threads).\nSo before anyone adduces or tries to adduce cotton as evidence of patching, they have show they have searched thoroughly for it outside the radiocarbon region, and to have done so by dissecting threads, not relying on sticky tape samples. It’s not enough to say that it was not seen, if there was no systematic attempt to find it among all the flax fibres. Surface cotton fibres, being much shorter than linen fibres, may tend to be preferentially shed with age and handling, and thus be poorly represented on thread surfaces. They are also harder to see against the Mylar adhesive under the microscope than flax fibres (due to refractive index differences, or lack thereof,  and thus weaker birefringence under crossed-polaroids), Repeat: one has to tease out the entire thread into its scores of separate fibres..\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 9:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48397","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?","post":"As far as I know, the only opportunities for determining the proportion of cotton to linen in the main body of the shroud were by examination of the famous sticky tape slides and, possibly, by examination of the fibres vacuumed up from underneath. To the best of my knowledge no threads from areas away from the C14 corner have been analysed.\nThe sticky tape slides were analysed by Heller and Adler (A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin), who say: “The microscopic survey revealed that there were a large variety of fibrils and particulates present in the samples along with occasional assorted “incidental” debris found in limited quantities such as insect parts, pollen, spores, wax, modern synthetic fibrils, red and blue silk, wool, and flair tip pen dye marks (due to a previous investigator).” They do not mention cotton as “incidental” debris, but then nor do they identify the “variety” of the fibrils they observed.\nThe slides were also analysed by Walter McCrone (Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud), who says: “Since the extraneous but rare particles may be of interest, I will list them: silk, wool, linen and cotton fibres of various colours, wax spatters, bird feather fibres, rodent hairs, mica, limestone (calcite), quartz, aragonite, starch grains (corn and wheat), pollen (average less than 2-3 pollen grains per tape), mold spores, trichomes (leaf hairs), flash (oil soot, power plant, incinerator, trash burning, Jeweler’s rouge, paper fibres, pigments (madder, orpiment, yellow ochre, azurite), paint fragments (titanium white, ultramarine, yellow ochre), plant and insect parts, charred linen fibres, etc.” I wonder how Heller and Adler came to miss all that!\nNeither of the above descriptions seems to be at all definitive. It is clear from both sources that the composition of the woven material was assumed to be linen, and no consideration was given to any possible admixture, all the non-linen fibres being dismissed as ‘incidental’ or ‘extraneous.’\nAnd that brings us to Gérard Lucotte’s highly controversial examination of some fibres hoovered up from between the shroud and its backing.

There are a number of possible reasons for this, but I don’t know enough about them, yet, to be able to account for it.

Rogers gave a standardized test for vanillin which he tells us is actually the standard test for  for lignin. .Are you playing possum? Asking a questions for which you think you have an answer? It would be nice if you could spare us the suspense and cite some authority for your speculation. If you can’t you are clearly in the area of pseudo-skepticism, searching wildly for an explanation for facts you just can’t accept. I really think at this point, barring an explanation with citations to scientific authority as to why an experienced master chemist (which he was) like Rogers would be so ignorant as to not recognize the truth you may be withholding and mistake these seemingly disparate chemicals for vanillin which he has identified.  That test was zero for the Shroud and quite high for the C14 and Raes samples.\n Are you saying the positive result for the test was caused by these chemicals. If you don’t have authority for that proposition, this discussion is over for now.

Once more into breach. Bravo Andy, bravo. There is no interwoven cotton on the Shroud in chief. That is the quite positive determination of the STURP team. Whether the interwoven cotton  in the C14 sample itself was sufficient to skew the C14 results, the fact is that Rogers identified the linen in C14 as being of medieval or later manufacture. The initial impulse to think the cotton was the principal skewing agent was incorrect. It was the medieval manufacture of the patch with new European linen that was the principal cause. The test for vanillin by Rogers on the fibers from the Shroud in chief was negative – zero. The presence of vanillin in the sample taken from this woebegone corner was positive. They were not the same material.\nWhat you have pointed it reinforces the fact that the cotton would not have been in the Shroud when obtained by Joseph of Arimathea. As a devout Jew he would not have purchased a mixed item. As a matter of fact, when it was purchased by Joseph the science supports the conclusion that there was no cotton in the Shroud. Transient cotton contamination was observed. Not interweaving and splicing as occurred on the C14 sample.\nThe interwoven and spliced cotton is an important marker, but the principal proof of age is the vanillin tests. \nPS: This discussion has really helped me sharpen my view.

Why should it – when there were no big controversies at the time regarding the significance, if any, to attach to cotton (they having come post radiocarbon dating). In any case, STURP’s sticky tape sampling of surface fibres could only have detected a major presence of cotton, and been hard pushed to distinguish between, say, 1% and 5% cotton, and even then we are assuming that there is no difference between flax and cotton fibres in their relative ease of detachment (by no means self-evident).\nI for one will keep looking for pre-STURP references to cotton, considering that STURP is/was not the last word on the subject (and certainly not the first).\n\n","date":"October 23, 2013 at 3:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48492","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?","post":"I see we have moved on from the evidence to the summing up, in the hope that the jury will forget the evidence.

I do not dispute that for a moment. I wish I could ask him if it is possible that the positive vanillin test came from the madder rather than the threads, as the standard test he describes would not differentiate between the two.\nNor does Rogers at any time say, or even imply, that he tested main shroud threads for vanillin.

Each disc would be subjected to close scrutiny under the microscope (crossed polaroids etc) to determine their relative content of linen v cotton fibres.\nIf there’s any truth in the patch theory (which I doubt somehow) there should be some kind of systematic trends or maybe abrupt transition zones. That’s assuming the entire retained fragment is not 100% patch. If there’s been no patching, the cotton/linen ratio should show no systematic transitions or trends. \nOh, and repeat the radiocarbon dating on that same (oddly neglected) retained strip,  but using a single clean-up procedure to minimize statistical noise.

They strain at gnats and swallow camels. With no formal training in Critical Thinking, they fail to understand the  concept of ‘weight of evidence’ as far as all the properties and other features of the TS is concerned. The TS is a challenge to their particular world-view, and creates a chronic anxiety that this world-view of theirs may indeed be false.\nConcerning the mixing of kinds, there is no Judaic prohibition on mixing cotton with linen. The prohibition relates to the mixing of animal and vegetable products sucj as the mixing of cotton or linen with wool. It is possible that its origins  may have been associated with the practice of pagan priests mixing these products in their garments, or else to restrain lower orders from wearing expensive linen. Its religious significance comes from the concept of distinctions whereby Yaweh’s people of Israel were to be separate from gentiles. \nConcerning the mixing of cotton with linen:\nIts earliest occurrence commenced in Egypt about 200AD with the manufacture of fustian, whereby cotton and linen were used separately for warp and weft threads to compensate for the weaker properties of the other, expense, brittleness, susceptibility to dyes, etc. It slowly spread through North Africa, not reaching Spain until the 13th century. \nCotton found its way to Italy possibly as early as the 13th century. Bulk cotton and linen fibres were stored in the same spinning work-rooms, the cotton permeating the air, getting on the clothes of the spinners and contaminating linen thread. Cotton as a contaminant of linen would therefore date from this era. There is no such contaminating cotton in the linen threads of the TS, except for that in the Raes area. I have seen several photographs of many of the STURP scientists minutely examining the TS for signs of cotton with microscopes. None of them found any cotton. \nPossible sources of surface contamination, include the stitching of the 1534 patches with cotton, and perhaps the cotton gloves used by the STURP team. \nFrom about the 13th century, cotton was deliberately mixed with linen for a number of reasons: it bulked out the more expensive linen; it compensated the brittleness of linen, and would accept dyes more readily. On the other hand linen was more durable and longer lasting, as lacking pectin needed by moths it was more resistant to insect attack. \nRaes discovery of cotton in his sample, found its way into Ian Wilson’s 1978 book, leading to the speculation that it was more pervasive, and that perhaps the cloth had been woven on looms also used for weaving cotton, and it was therefore of Middle East provenance.  That speculation is no longer viable.  \nUntil 1842, the Savoy showings of the TS were always displayed by five bishops holding it along its edge, often in the open air, doubtless with prospects of all sorts of contamination, and damage to the cloth. There are several different illustration of these events on record. Even bishops in those days did not take regular showers! \nIn 1868, Princess Clotilde replaced Valfre’s lining with a new red silk lining. She may well have been the one who carried out the evident repair in the Raes area. She had the skills, and the resources. From 1868, the manual displays had ceased, and from that date, the displays were always held in a static frame. If Clotilde did the repair work, that would certainly account for the skewing of the C-14 date. It may also account for the decision to abandon the manual displays. \nThere is much more evidence corroborating the authenticity of the TS, than the mere absence of cotton in its main body. They include the absence of vanillin as one such. However the absence of cotton is merely another link in the chain of evidence, which places its provenance well before the 1355 display at Lirey. \nGet over it! You’re wrong! The Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth! Whether that challenges your world-view or not, is your problem!\n\n","date":"October 23, 2013 at 3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","id":"comment-48550","author":"daveb of wellingon nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?","post":"“There is much more evidence corroborating the authenticity of the TS, than the mere absence of cotton in its main body.
