[{"title":"Or it is the first century burial cloth of Yussuf Schmoe?","post":"This is a fascinating blog by someone well versed in Catholic theology and history (or so it appears to me). It is amazing the number of good, dedicated people who study the Shroud. Then, there are some strange, not-so-well motivated.

It DID last at least 2h30 once they had reached the tomb (most likely time-frame). In the koine Greek Gospels it is clearly said the buriers wounded/encircled, compressed/tightly wrapped up, bound/fastened his body in linen clothes with spices, as the manner of the Judeans is to bury. WHERE is it written his body was just draped over? NOWHERE!\nHe also wrote: “The women would need to get at the body to wash and anoint it come Sunday morning. Also in most burials, the deceased generally did not get up afterward and leave the shroud behind neatly folded up. ”\nIn the Gospels NOWHERE it is written either the women were to wash Yeshua(’s wrapped-up) body. It is just written they were to anoint it (most likely with oily spicy perfumes). NOWHERE it is written either “the shroud was left behind neatly folded up”! It’s patently false!\nBesides, he most misleadingly also wrote: “some of the lettering on the coins, when examined, falls in the spaces between threads, so they’re clearly spurious.”\nWhen the suspected right and left eye areas are CORRECTLY examined from 3D, digital squeeze and red paint brush images, this is not what one can observe at all as three printed letters are complete/not fragmented and five are pieces of letters.\n\n","date":"August 14, 2013 at 12:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/14/or-it-is-the-first-century-burial-cloth-of-yussuf-schmoe/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-41266","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Or it is the first century burial cloth of Yussuf Schmoe?","post":"How is it that this is the ONLY such cloth ever found??  Tens of thousands of people crucified, buried, but this is the only surviving cloth?  How is “Yussuf Shmoe” has the exact same documented, down to the letter identical wounds and torture marks as Jesus, or was crowning with thorns a daily occurrence, maybe some sort of Hebrew custom we know nothing about?!  BTW, How is it Y.S. is about a foot longer in the back than he is in the front, is that a common occurrence as well? The more “scientific” explanations people try to come up with, the more ridiculous they sound.  If this is a natural phenomena, then reproduce it.  Should be easy, right? Then do it. Or shut up, and get down on your knees with the rest of us.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2013 at 6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/14/or-it-is-the-first-century-burial-cloth-of-yussuf-schmoe/","cat":"other_blogs","id":"comment-41465","author":"Josie L.
