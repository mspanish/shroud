[{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"Sr.(sic) Ann writes:\n(…)If we want to preserve the concept of identifying facial portraits of Jesus derived from the Holy Shroud we need to revise Vignon’s pioneering work. (…)\nIt would be wonderful if an interim report could be prepared in time for the St. Louis Conference. The message being, “Vignon was wrong but we’ll carry on.”\nI’m sorry Ann, but it will be a waste of time. \nFirst of all, an inquiry as you propose would have to be carried on by a competent team of Art historians. I’m not an expert on medieval Art at all, but I know that some essential features of Byzantine Art have been ignored by Vignon and other zealous amateur inquirers (1) and the mistakes due both to the inexperience as the lack of method can invalidate their efforts. Internet aids, but is not the answer.\nBut last but not least, if this imaginary team will arrive to conclude that there will be some relevant similarities between the Byzantine Art and the Shroud, we have not resolved our problem because we have no reason to think that the Shroud influenced the Byzantine Arte and not conversely. Even if we can demonstrate similarity between the Byzantine Art and the Shroud this is not the basis for any argument in favour or counter authenticity, because the Byzantine influence in European Art arrives till the fall of Constantinople (1453). Sindonism and scepticism will be compatible with it. \nHence, I think the relations of the Shroud with Art is an interesting and curious issue, but not relevant to the authenticity case. \nFootnote (1): I’m thinking in Erwin Panofsky: Meaning in the Visual Arts as a striking instanceof this oversight.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 3:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119033","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"Damn, what is with this WordPress: “Duplicate comment detected: it looks as though you’ve already said that”\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 3:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119038","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"Dan, have you received my e-mail?\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 3:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119042","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"David Mo, due to the WordPress error, I reply here:\nYou are in a mistake. Jesus beardless and with the short hair was an icon that persisted till the first centuries of the Middle Age. And John the Baptist was ever presented with long hair and sometimes with a curl on the front. This has no necessary relation to the Shroud nor the actual appearance of Christ but to some theological conventions. Jesus with a beard and long hair was assimilated to the philosophers and Wisdom. Jesus beardless was the symbol of the Life.\nCf: Chavanne-Mazel, Claudine A.: “Popular Belief and the Image of Beardless Christ”, Visual Resources, Vol 19, no 1; 2003; p. 19-24. It is on line, I think.\nFirst thanks for the article, it is indeed interesting.\nIt shows clearly that the further from Constantinople, the dominance of long-hair, bearded, skinny Christ comes later. But this dominance since the 6th century is undisputable, and some exceptions confirming the rule cannot change that! And all the theories that development of such image occurred without influence of the Shroud are in fact nothing but pure academic speculations based on no evidentiary basis at all!\nWe enlarge arbitrarily the rank of our survey. For example, we accept the Pantocrator of Taüll but not the Pantocrator of the Cristo de la Luz of Toledo. Why? Because we think the first accomplish (??- I doubt a lot) some Vignon Marks and the latter not a single one.\nThat’s not true. There are several marks on the latter (http://www.arteguias.com/imagenes/cristoluzpinturas.jpg ), for example 1, perhaps 2 or 3, 12, 15, maybe more. Are you blinded or simply lying?\nHow long the influence of the Shroud reached ? How? These are some important points to an historical hypothesis never specified in this case.\nIt lasts up to this day, as I have shown a couple posts above. For practical reason I would consider only the period 500-1350, between discovery of Image of Edessa and the first appearance of the Shroud in Lirey. I hope this criterion is clear. The influence of the Shroud on Christ iconography post 1350 is beyond any discussion, as I will show one day. The influence in a period before 1350 (when , according to the sceptics, Shroud didn’t exist) as well. \nIn what sense ‘oddity’? I think they are a ‘stilyzed’ sign, perhaps of concentration and power. (‘Stylization’: a natural feature modified in terms of an aesthetic style). But they scarcely ever or never appear as a vertical succesion of signs in form of V+rectangular box+V (2,3,4 marks) in the space between the eyebrows. Not in the Shroud, of course.\nThey are rarely present all three (usually one or two), but on the Daphne Pantocrator they are all three, very expressly highlighted (why? ad hoc ideas about “stilyzed’ signs, perhaps of concentration and power.”  don’t hold water) http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Meister_von_Daphni_002.jpg And they are certainly noticeable on the Shroud. Closing eyes and denying this don’t help you, David Mo.\nYes on the non-Christ they are accidental. On the Christ they are related to the Shroud.\nPetitio principii. You suppose the Mandylion is the Srhoud. This is far to be demonstrated.\nI suppose nothing about the Mandylion at this moment. I simply notice that frequency of the oddities known as Vignon marks is far beyond from what one could expect from mere random occurrences (the case of non-Christ icons). And the very similar oddities can be found on the Shroud. Reasonable conclusion: they are derived from the Shroud.\nBut of course unacceptable by fanatical sceptics.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 3:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119044","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"Further:\nFirst of all, an inquiry as you propose would have to be carried on by a competent team of Art historians.\nNot necessary, and rather not -as the art historian usually are stuck in their theories and paradigms. Some people with fresh insights, outside their circle would be better. Anyway this task is much better suited to be performed by some criminal investigator, experts in facial composite or similar.\nBut last but not least, if this imaginary team will arrive to conclude that there will be some relevant similarities between the Byzantine Art and the Shroud, we have not resolved our problem because we have no reason to think that the Shroud influenced the Byzantine Arte and not conversely.\nConversly is impossible -there is virtually no way to copy or fake the Shroud. And why forger should copy all those tiny features from Byzantine icons into the Shroud?\nSo I agree with the statement:\nHence, I think the relations of the Shroud with Art is an interesting and curious issue, but not relevant to the authenticity case. \nThe authenticity of the Shroud can be established by other means, even without reference to the Byzantine arts. However, the relation between them is obvious, and helps to track down the history of the Shroud.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 4:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119053","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"O.K.

Now you seem to be a staunch defender of the Spanish Pantocrator, even though, as it has short hair, by your own repeated and insistent criteria, it cannot be derived from the Shroud, and therefore any Vignon markings it may posess are accidental!\nTo every rule, there are some exceptions.For example, the Mandylion from Skylitzes (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Surrender_of_the_Mandylion_to_the_Byzantines.jpg )has no recognizable shoulder-lenght hair, but surprisingly it has two strands of hair. \nWe can say that one “Christ style” dominates from the 6th century, but what about Michelangelo? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Michelangelo%2C_Giudizio_Universale_03.jpg\nWhen I said: “Jesus without long hair is not Jesus”, of course I meant general, not absolute rule. And frankly, I expected that sceptics would be trying to play red herring with it. That would show how despearate measures they need to utilize.\nThere are not absolute criteria, and even Vignon marks have some flaws, though no one has yet suggested better system. What one needs is some common sense, which is dismissed by so favored byt he sceptics overconcentration on particular elements.\nAre there multiple Vignon marks on Byzantine potraits of Christ? They are there in majority of cases, and no one except most  prejudiced sceptics deny this. Are there Vignon marks on non-Christs? Yes, sometimes, but they are minority. It is obvious that on non-Christs they cannot be derived from the Shroud -but in the case of the Christs they can, and are -the frequency of their presence is simply too high, and there are other notable similarites with the Shroud (beard, long hair, similar proportions etc.). Possible minor differences (ears, no blood traces) can be easily, and rationally explained. And that’s the whole philosophy. \nAs to the Spanish Pantocrator, one can argue that there is long hair, hidden at the back of the head- it is definetly not short hair.\nBut that it would be unkind, one would feel like asking you the question you asked of Mo, wouldn’t one?\nIn the case of David Mo, I hardly believe he didn’t notice marks 12 & 15 at last. So either he was dishonest, or so blind, that his opinion was absolutely irrelevant.\nThe game is over. I stopped looking for fight when I was at school.

They are paintings which have a message for faithful to deliver: the Holy Face of Jesus looks in this or that way -without giving full description.

I consider that O.K. makes a valid point that many of the Christ icons do show Vignon markings, and when they occur, they are consistently more frequent than such markings on non-Christ portraits.  It would not be uncommon for artists to imitate such features as Vignon markings in portraits of their other subjects.  Who can enter the mind of an artist?  Artistic styles often seem to follow a fashion. \nI have previously referred to Ian Wilson’s paper showing several slides of a wide range of Christ icons and representations said to be of the mandylion.  Ian Wilson – “Discovering more of Shroud’s Early history”, Valencia Conference 2012; Paper and slide show:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/wilsonvppt.pdf\nUnfortunately many of these examples have suffered the ravages of time and neglect, and are sometimes indistinct. \nBoth Vignon and Wuenschel together identified some 20 characteristic markings, and Wilson in his books reduced the number to 15. I would agree that we now need to move beyond Vignon. Clearly the basic idea was to identify those characteristics that were often repeated in the icons, particularly those that had some claim to be representations of the mandylion. But it should not be surprising if such characteristics may sometimes be repeated in other sacred non-Christ portraits, as imitating artistic style. \nThe time sequence and geographical dispersion of such characteristics would be important to detect any changing trend or development.  Whether this can be done on an objective basis may be awkward, as there would be often some reliance on variable subjective perceptions, as is already too evident in the recent discussions. \nThe project is essentially one that ought to rely on artistic expertise, and it seems unfortunate that few such experts have demonstrated much interest in committing themselves to such a project, but have been content to rely on the received wisdom of their skeptical predecessors. \nThere has to have been a discernible development in the representation of Christ icons, which can be analysed and stated in an authoritative way.  Perhaps it does need a multi-disciplinary approach as suggested by the initial correspondent. Like all such projects it requires time, interest, serious research, hard work and commitment, of the type that Paul Vignon was prepared to devote to it 80 years ago, before there was ever any concept of the internet and its advantages.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119477","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"Well I agree with that, of course.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 6:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119486","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"daveb of wellington nz\nMay 14, 2014 at 6:21 pm\nThis “watcher on the hill-side” does not believe that Vignon was wrong at all.

Etc. \nI have done my personal inquiry about Vignon’s marks on 44 instances of Christ’s images from Sixth Century to Fourteenth Century. This is a very imperfect study (as Wilson, and others) because I can not keep in mind thousand of manuscripts, woods, icons, frescoes, etc. I have focused my study on some instances of Byzantine images or influenced by Byzantine Art, iIncluding those usually quoted by sindonists.  \nOnly marks 1, 10, 11, 12 and 15 are regularly present in these images and can see clearly. The marks 5, 6 7 or 8 are practically inexistent, the same as the combination 2, 3 and 4. The mark 13 has two different ways of representation. In the same form as in the Shroud, i.e. has a soft curve (http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Painting/Fajum44.jpg) , is scarcely represented in the examples I have consulted. It is more frequent as an angular form (http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Painting/Fajum2.jpg). \nFirst problem: Marks 1, 10, 11 and 13 in both forms are common marks to a lot of portraits of these times and even before. Then, we have only two marks that can be considered identifying of Christ: 12 (divided beard) and 15 (lock of hair).\nBut in some portraits of John the Baptist (for example) we can see the same lock of hair. Evidently here it doesn’t represent any blood stain, but only a lock of hair. Why do you think that the same lock of hair represents a blood stain in the Byzantine representation of Christ? Have you any reason to think so? Surely not. I haven’t heard any explanation of this arbitrary interpretation. \nSo, even in the supposition that the 15 Vignon’s marks were present in the Shroud (and I don’t see more of six or seven), there is not any “extraordinary coincidence” between these marks and the Byzantine iconography of Christ when we examine better the facts.\n\n","date":"May 15, 2014 at 3:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-119744","author":"David Mo","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"Only marks 1, 10, 11, 12 and 15 are regularly present in these images and can see clearly.

Have you any reason to think so? \nThey have similar shape, simply. And the easiest way to represent this epsilon shape on the glorious Pantocrators and Mandylions is with the use of hair lock. Of course the audience don’t know the true nature of it. Painters, if the whole Shroud had not been fully unveiled, perhaps also.\nAnd the form of the wrinkle in the neck of the Shroud (that actually is not) is very different of the wrinkle of the neck of the most part of Christ’s images we are analyzing. But these latter are very similar to many roman portraits. I think you will be able to extract the adequate inference.\nThat wrinkle, or rather the whole base of the neck visible on the Shroud, can be interpreted in various ways, and both representations you showed can be justified. Just look carefully at the neck area on the Shroud. Just look a little bit below that wrinkle, there some U-shaped area, similar to the mark 2.\nThe sole feature common to the Shroud and the standard representation of Christ in the medieval art that might be clearly observable is the divided beard. All the other are based either on subjective vision or ad hoc inferences.\nAnd those ad hoc intreferences are indeed in those places on the shorud -isn’t that remarkable? As to the subjective vision, everyone has it’s own.

I admit that this mark is problematic, as it is unclear what “heavily accented owlish eyes” actually means. Nevertheless, this is a feature that is visible on several icons -those black eyes, like after some boxing fight, or three nights without sleep.

Have you any reason to suppose the first artist’s intention that converted the blood to hair or it is a mere supposition? \nStriking, or almost invisible, the most important point is their presence. The Byzantine icons ususally (although not always) have real obsession on this strand of hairs.as they are present even on miniatures http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mandylion#mediaviewer/File:Surrender_of_the_Mandylion_to_the_Byzantines.jpg So there must have been something important in those strands (even if they are just symbollically marked), for, if we forget the blood mark on the Shroud or similar strand on Manoppello (assuming it is identical to Camuliana Image, as Pfeiffer suggest), otherwise unknown reasons.\nYou should not be blamed by have claimed these nonsense. Vingnon’s theory is based on remote analogies and statements of intentions without any verifiable support.\nI have never concealed that Vignon’s system has some weak points -it mixes absolute marks (like 9, 12 or 15)  with relative ones (6,7, 14). Besides marks 10 and 11 are usually related. Nevertheless, although flawed as it is, it allows for some basic systematic survey of all those icons, and makes a point, that there are several similarities between Shroud and Byzantine images of Christ. But the matter is of course much more complex, and one cannot stay just with the Vignon only. There are probably the whole famillies of genetically related icons -there is some equivalent of “textual criticism” needed. Each icon has also its own specific similarites to the Shroud, not listed among Vignon marks. One could expand or revise that system. Besides there are some basic similiarites of proportions, and basic feature: long hair, presence of beard and mustache, thin nose, skinny face, and so on.\nDaveB:\nIt would seem that Paul Vignon was better informed 76 years ago than his amateur critics are today.

Accepting that the most common image of Jesus since at least 6th century is in fact derived from the Shroud of Turin, would be Copernican Revolution in Christian art studies. It would be like moving from geocentrism to heliocentrism.\nBut the Copernican Revolution you claim becomes a ridiculous thing if the sole historian you quote is against the method of Vignon with at least a similar argument as I have done here.

(p. 12)\nand it goes further: \n“Vignon is right when he affirms that a resemblance exists between the classic type of the face of Christ and the Shroud face. He is right when he says that certain deformities on the Shroud face are due to the maltreatment Christ suffered during the different stages of his passion. If identical traces are found in art works representing Christ, Vignon reasoned, then these art works must be seen as dependent on the Turin relic. These same disfiguring marks seen on the Shroud face are indeed found on images of Christ but, Vignon added, they are found also on other personages. This, for art historians, is the weak spot in Vignon’s argument. In establishing a connection not only between the Shroud and images of Christ, but also with images of other persons, Vignon went beyond the limits of a method of certainty. He was the first to compare the sindonic face with the diverse art images, the first to introduce a method fundamentally sound (boldings mine), but he did not realize its limitations. Therefore, even though we owe so much to Vignon, we will take a different path.”\nDo not take sentences out of context.

Absent “the skewed nose” we can also “think we see” when we overlay the Holy Face of the Manoppello Veil on the Holy Face of the TS (a pareidolia that is featured on more than half a dozen justinian II soldii), how else do you account for teeth featured on the Holy Face of the Holy Veil ?). \n– “Reminder (two): Saints who died in imitation of Christ’s self-sacrifice and martyrdom (i.e. in imitatio Christi) could be depicted with Christ-like and even at times Shroud-like characteristic traits AND/OR (pareidoliac) attributes.”\n–  Reminder (three): “the geometrical fourfold series of blackened-rimmed L-shaped burn-holes could date back as early as 390 CE (see the  of Santa Pudenziana with the mosaic of Christ in majesty). Both cryptically and symbolically reminiscent of the blackened-rimmed burn holes, we can see a black L (for Lumens Christi) marks standing out on the flashing gold pallium of a Resurrected Christ in Majesty (Santa Pudenziana apse Mosaic, ca. 400, Rome).Now the pallium is the Roman evolved form of the Greek himation that was a very large rectangle of fabric that can be draped as a shawl, a cloak, or a head covering and  a current 4,20×1,40m for a 6ft tall man was the correct size; sizes totally congruent with the TS man). Also notice the zigzag weave pattern on the left arm pummel.”\n(” The L letter identifies the clothing as Pallium Lumeni Christi = Lumen Christi in Sindonem = L in Sindonem = Linus Christi. The official first Pope’s name was Linus as secular representative of Christ on earth that is as his vicarius (Peter was not officially Pope). Lumen Christi (Latin: Light of Christ). See also Lumen verum illuminans omnem hominem (antiphon) and Inventor rutili dux bone luminis (hymn).”)\nBesides in the apse mosaic, “a 111/112cm width cloth shows stretched as a backdrop just at the back of the throne at Christ shoulder level. Before the 2002 restoration of the Shroud exact width was 111-112cm.The two Christ faces (that of the mosaic and that of the Turin Shroud) are at the same scale 1:1 with congruent spy details: the face of Christ is 4-5cm off-centered on the left just like in the Turn Shroud and the position of the feet on the Pudenziana mosaic is also asymmetrical as on the TS.The latter’s body image, seen under a certain angle and light, looks like translucent straw yellow impression. This is consistent with the use of flashing gold mosaic tiles to feature Christ’s pallium.” So what is first ?\n\n","date":"May 16, 2014 at 1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-120491","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"On June 12, 2013 at 2:04 pm I wrote:\n“Reminder: As far as the Holy Face of the Holy Mandylion and the Holy Face of Holy Himation aka the Turin Shroud connection as relics is concerned, the very word Mandylion is a Byzantine-Greek borrowed from the Arabic mandil (mindil in Syriac) i.e. a “SCARF”. Now Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos comments in his Book of Ceremonies that the loros (or ceremonial LONG SCARF or stole of Byzantine emperors) symbolized the burial shroud of Christ. The (co-)emperor(s) (+(co-)empress(es) + the 12 most important imperial figures + archangels in paintings and mosaics) normally wore it on Easter Sunday. It was draped “himation/achiton fashion” all over his WHOLE BODY: “The men’s version of the loros was a long strip, dropping down straight in front to below the waist, and with the portion behind pulled round to the front and hung gracefully over the left arm. The female loros was similar at the front end, but the back end was wider and tucked under a belt after pulling through to the front again.””\n\n","date":"May 16, 2014 at 2:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-120506","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"Louis\nMay 16, 2014 at 11:26 am\nFather Heinrich Pfeiffer holds an important post in the Vatican’s cultural heritage department and it is a pity that the book he co-authored with Father Werner Bulst has not been translated into English.

It is that what I had said.\nBut what is “sound” in the Vignon’s method is not explained here and I disagree on this. If he means that “these same disfiguring marks seen on the Shroud face are indeed found on images of Christ” I don’t know what “images of Christ” he is refering. If he has in mind the Pantocrator and other icons we had considered here, I absolutely disagree. I don’t know if this point will be explained later in the Pfeiffer’s writings you gently provide us.

Whether genuine or fake, the representation is obviously Jesus Christ.”\nAnd why could this man said this with so much confidence?  Because of the great similarity that exist between the Shroud man’s face and the most common depictions of Christ in ancient Byzantine art, starting with the Christ Pantocrator icons.  Vignon could have been maybe wrong on some points (in fact, I’m pretty sure he was on a few), but if we look at the global portrait of the situation, he was certainly correct:  Most of the ancient Byzantine representation of Christ (and of course, I include the Mandylion in that group) are showing great similarity with the face on the Shroud.  So much in fact that it’s certainly not a coincidence due solely to hazard.  It’s evident that there’s a connection there that is strong enough to be taken as a good piece of evidence for the presence of the Shroud as early as the apparition of the first known Christ Pantocrator icon, around the year 500 A.D.\n\n","date":"May 19, 2014 at 6:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","id":"comment-121588","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On","post":"“Most of the ancient Byzantine representation of Christ  are showing great similarity with the face on the Shroud”.
