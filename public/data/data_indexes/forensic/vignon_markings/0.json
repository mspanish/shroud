[{"title":"More over at Stephen Jones’ blog on the Vignon markings","post":"I’ve always been curious about those two strands of hair coming down from the hair line ….it seems quite widespread in depictions of Jesus from 500 onwards, but looking at the Shroud, they are not the most obvious of features. I’m looking at the picture of the Shroud’s head via the ShroudScope (cool name!) viewer\nhttp://www.sindonology.org/shroudScope/shroudScope.shtml\nand can just about make out two darker areas (on the negative image) in the middle at the hairline (one strand of which leads into the blood stain shaped like a reflected 3). Is this what inspired the two strands to appear in the depictions? Not exactly damning evidence, but intriguing. A good trick from my artist days, if you want to see broad tonal differences and not be distracted by details, is to squint through semi closed eyelids…then I can just about see the two strands or at least vaguely convince myself I do.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2012 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/more-over-at-stephen-jones-blog-on-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8362","author":"ArtScience","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"More over at Stephen Jones’ blog on the Vignon markings","post":"It may sound simplistic, but I always seemed to find a correlation of the two strands as a depiction of the two blood traces seen on the hair on the right of the natural image. Also considering that maybe depicting blood was not a pleasant thing to do, so they just painted the two blood traces has hair???…Maybe extreme conjecture on my part, but who knows?\nR\n\n","date":"February 16, 2012 at 7:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/more-over-at-stephen-jones-blog-on-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"image_theory","id":"comment-8374","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
