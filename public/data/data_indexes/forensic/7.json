[{"title":"Shroud Scope 3: Now let’s take a closer look at the wrist – the one with the bloodstain and, supposedly, an underlying nail wound.","post":"you sir are absolutley correct, the standard manner of crucifixion was to tie the person to the cross\nwith ropes, the nails were added to the palms of the hands to keep him from being able to hold himself up to insure he would die quickly as it was jewish custom that he should die before sunset.\nthis is the way it has been taught in every christian church i ever attended. if there seems to be a discrepency to the shroud maybe others should not doubt the validity of scripture and seek out the why’s for the descrepency.  \nthe bloodstain at the wrist is prominent but if you look closely there are also brown spots in the center of the palm that are no doubt bloodstains they are faint but they are there.\nthe stain at the wrist could have come from laying one hand over the other and then they were switched during preperation for burial. or maybe as a result of coagulation at the site of the ropes holding him to the cross in any case to just jump up and say scipture is inaccurate is to deny eyewitness acounts.\n","date":"August 8, 2012 at 6:17 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/shroud-scope-3-now-lets-take-a-closer-look-at-the-wrist-the-one-with-the-bloodstain-and-supposedly-an-underlying-nail-wound-5/","cat":"blood","id":"comment-440","author":"ROB SKOGS","site":"colinberry"}]
