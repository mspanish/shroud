And this is based on the claim that hair cannot create the blood pattern we see on the Shroud. Once again, no experiment is done to show that this is not possible.

Right?\nYou wrote:\n“There are blood images in the hair (frontal side) which are NOT consistent with this fact.\nMainly the winding blood mark seen in the hair area (front side). It is simply impossible even if “the hair is compressed against the bloody wounds on the scalp and the blood seeps through the hair”\nThe compressed explanation I gave, is for the back, not the front.\nThe bloodstains you mentioned, coming from the front on the side of the face, cannot be coming directly from the scalp, because these bloodstains are far away from the scalp. They could simply be coming from the hair from blood that drips from the head into the side hair. I could should you such transfer, from hair to cloth by using a viscous liquid. They look similar as we see on the Shroud.\nAs for the back, they do not look much like rivulets of blood. They look like compressed hair with blood in them that is pressed onto a cloth. I can show some similar transfer as well.\nRemember what is claimed, and what you wrote: “It is simply impossible”, which means that you have to show that there is no way these bloodstains cannot come from the hair. But I see no clear explanation (from Lavoie, Lind or Antonacci) of such impossibility and no experiment done.\nI want to emphasize this point because it is important: At no point in any of the papers written by Lavoie (probably 3 such papers in various publications like SSI) that he claimed that these bloodstains cannot (i.e., impossible) come from the hair. Some people may have inferred that, but that claim is never made. So, Lavoie never attempt to prove that point, which would be very difficult to prove because, again, simple experiments show that it is possible.\nHave you tried to put some blood (or viscous liquid) on some hair and pressed them on a cloth and see the result?\n\n","date":"January 5, 2015 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181511","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"The most important thing is that blood was detected on the Shroud.\n\n","date":"January 5, 2015 at 6:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181441","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"The key materials on the Holy Shroud seem to be blood and cellulose\nand both have to be controlled in a non destructive manner.\nDo you agree on that idea?\nLink for CFM (= Chemical force microscopy):\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_force_microscopy#Frictional_force_mapping\n>CFM has been primarily developed by Charles Lieber at Harvard University in 1994\n\n","date":"January 5, 2015 at 11:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181473","author":"piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"Friendly suggestion to Piero:\nLess (empty) talk please about AFM or CFM in 2015 pending some real ACTION.\nPossible re-design of Piero’s kitchen:\n\nYup, that’s the gear that we’ve been told is the answer to all our problems.\nCrowd-funding maybe?

Should be some clarification here: human, human, human, etc. Was this truly demonstrated?  Cross-reactivity in immunoglobulin, albumin studies precludes a definitive answer from the data.  Adler was appropriately cautious in his interpretation (at least primate).  This goes beyond that.  Opinions, assumptions have to be screened out.  Relatedly, the above sentence refers to “human hemoglobin” Was the hemoglobin characterized relative to species in these early studies?   Human whole blood serum-again, species characterization-how?  Finally, “DNA from the man’s blood marks”.  Is this a scientifically valid statement?  What specifically demonstrates that the DNA is from the blood marks of the man? One can’t and shouldn’t push the data beyond what it objectively shows.\nPart 2 illustrates the complexity of variables that exists in trying to re-create a collection of unknowns.  Unknowns on the transfer or application of blood.  Unknowns on the potential effects that the cloth may have on the results.  Some combination of the two.

As a former research scientist, I cannot imagine not wanting to write up original research with the goal of publication in a respected peer-reviewed journal.  This is how I was trained.  Among professional scientists, if it isn’t published it basically doesn’t count, or at least you don’t get credit for it.  And that’s just where it starts, whether it’s valid or not, time will tell.  Peer review takes some knocks-it’s not perfect, but it’s the respected, established system among professional scientists.  A key step in Shroud science gaining more credibility, respectability is the publication of new, original research in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\nThe best approach a scientist can undertake with his or her particular hypothesis/idea is to try to design experiments to prove themselves wrong; it broadens one’s objectivity to play the devils’s advocate regarding his or her own research.  Subjecting your work to peer-review is part of this-Ideally, it is continually ongoing (with the primary investigator and him/herself & colleagues) as the research progresses and develops.\nI think it is great that the possible information that could be gained from DNA analysis is being considered.  Contamination, degradation could be challenging issues, but one doesn’t know unless one looks-this seems especially relevant  given the advances in molecular biology in the past thirty, even ten years ago.\n\n","date":"January 5, 2015 at 7:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181513","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"How do we know when the DNA was deposited?

That may sound strange, but this is what the paper says. I quote their paper \n“Direct contact alone cannot embed all the Shroud’s various blood marks with their complete and intimate features.”\nSo, how do these blood stains come from the scalp and not from the hair according to Lind & Antonacci? The body dematerialize and re-materialize: the transfers of blood is not occurring by “simple” contact, but when the body dematerialize and goes through the cloth, then when the body materialize again (resurrection)! This is essentially Jackson’s  hypothesis. This is very far fetched (with all respects to the authors).\nDid you notice that general theory to explain the blood stains in their paper?\nAgain, the main problem is the following: This scenario (i.e., body disappear and reappear), as presented in that paper, is based on the assumption that the blood stains cannot have been produced by simple contact from the hair. This point is a fundamental premise that must be proven and discussed before going any further. But this point is not even discussed and nobody has ever proven that point (again not even Lavoie ever discussed at length that point and proved that the blood stains cannot come from the hair). This is major flaw of this paper.\nYou made the statement that the rivulet-looking bloodstains we see from the hair, from the front, on the side of the face cannot come from the hair. Any proof of that? How can you prove that? \nI think the burden of proof is on the person making that claim.\nOf course, blood does not typically behaves the same if it is transferred from the skin or the hair. The main difference is that the density of blood that can be transferred, if no pressure is applied, is going to be larger from the skin when compared to the hair. This is exactly what is happening when considering the photos taken from the recto (underside) of the Shroud, in 2000 (See “Shroud Images 2000”, published by Editrice, 2001). From these images we can see that all bloodstains from the hair on the sides of the face, in particular the rivulet ones, did not penetrate through the cloth, as far as it is possible to see from Fig. 5 of that book. That means that a smaller density of blood transfer occurred at these locations, which is coherent with a transfer from hair, not from skin. All blood stains coming from the skin in the face transfers as coming from the skin. This is an import point to notice when discussing the blood transfers of hair vs skin.\nAnd, there is nothing extraordinary about these rivulet-like looking blood stains in the hair. I see them as, for example, simply locks of hair with blood on them that slightly touch the Shroud. I could produce some photos of such transfer, but they will be very simple and nothing special (I did some many years ago). What does prevent this possibility? It is quite straightforward.\n\n","date":"January 6, 2015 at 11:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181729","author":"Mario Latendresse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"Thanks Mario,\nI’ll read carefully your comment tomorrow.\nBut today, as everybody in France, I am to much shocked by the ultra-violent terrorist attack in Paris.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 3:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181891","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"Hi Thibault,\nYes, a terrible terrorist attack just happened in Paris.

Take those thumbnail Mark Evans images referred to in the first of  Mario’s links above. At first sight, one could be forgiven for thinking they are a repetition of the images that appeared in TH’s pdf. But there’s a difference, due partly to format. Not only do those images on Mario’s site expand to full screen when you click on them, but one can then magnify them further with repetitive clicks (up to 8 on my laptop) with CON+, with no appreciable loss of resolution. \nHere’s a before- and after-comparison of what one sees with just one of  Evans pictures (small of back with blood).\n\nMagnificent!\nBut there’s a sting in the tail. Suppose the kind of image you see above had been available before STURP set off to Turin in 1978. Would the protocol have been content for STURP member A to take sticky tape sample of blood regions back to the States to be examined and interpreted by STURP members B and C, resulting in seemingly conclusive mantras like “no red blood cells” and “not whole blood, but a serum exudate of retracted blood clots”?\nLook closely at those photographs. What was needed (surely?) was a separate lifting of the TWO kinds of pigment one sees in the magnified pictures – the denser spots of dark red pigment, and the diffuse much paler red regions. Might remnants of whole red blood cells have been seen in the first of those one wonders? Might it be the second that is better described as more serum-like, albeit with  some accompanying pinkish porphyrin  pigment due to haemolysis? \nThen there’s a second question that needs to be addressed. Is the ‘patchiness’ a faithful record of the initial imprinting. or were the dark red areas far more extensive originally,prior to having subsequently flaked off over the centuries? In that view, all we see now are the surviving patches of ‘whole’ (?) blood dotted about here and there that are anchored more firmly. \nRoll on STURP Mk2.

I am not certain whether our views are similar, or different.\nYou wrote:\nIt was a specific discussion of the few rivulet-looking blood stains on the side of the face. \nDo you mean side of the head (cheeks area, ~90 degrees from the nose) or frontal (face) side of the head? Because we may understand the term different.\nThey certainly cannot come from the scalp. Perhaps from the cheek as you wrote, not the scalp, but I do not think this is the case either, explained at length in the paper that the Shroud was not flattened I presented at Dallas in 2005.\nIn fact, this is the case, but, this does not contradicts your 2005 paper, in fact only strenghtens it. I definetly agree that the Shroud was not flattened -it couldn’t have been But this does not exclude the bloodmarks in the cheek area -and the presence of hair there also. \nLet me explain this.\nFirst the Shroud layout on the face:\n\nYellow line is the flat reference surface (flattened Shroud, which we reject). Red line is the Shroud in strict contact with the body -the contact image (which leads to consideable distortions, so we reject that hypothesis). Blue line is the Shroud  being stretched while wrapping the face. This is the most likely position of the Shroud while the body image was created -leading to moderate distortions. That’s what you have shown in the paper.\nNext we have projection mechanism:\n\nWhere:\n1. Vertical projection\n2. Projection perpendicular to the body\n3. Projection perpendicular to the sheet\n4. Projection via the lines of the closest distance between body and sheet.\nYou conjectured that the most likely projection mechanism is 4. Yet, in your paper you assumed 1. for its simplicity.\nMost people also assume mechanism 1.(verical projection on the sheet), even not being aware of the problem. It appears to be “natural”, so most people adopts it by default.\nBut this leads to considerable delusion, if any other mechanism is correct.\nIf other mechanism of projection than vertical is invoked, the results on the flat sheet would be different. For example 4. We apparently see hair being a few centimeter to the side of the face, separated from them by dark areas. But this is illusion! If you take some measurements via Shroud Scope, and compare it with meauserents perfromed on a living men, using simple elastic tape measure (which reflects approximately the shape of the linen wrapped around the face), it is obvious that the hair must be next to the face. This is further strenghten by the 3D relation -the intensity of the hair area is similar to that of the face. \nFurther, if you eliminate dark bands, it is apparent that the image is continuous between the face and the hair -thus clearly showing that the hair must be closely bound to the sides of the face. No other option.\nThe only solution is the presented Mask of Agamemnon. It was once normal mask, a 3D block  covering the normal face -but was forcefully flatten by collpasing roof.

Not a challenge, just interested in your viewpoint, i.e. other blood marks (located on head or other areas) were originally there, and touch ups, additions were made, or do you believe all blood marks were applied, added on?  If certain ones, is this based on color differences or mainly flow pattern/just doesn’t look right?  No bait trap involved, just interested in your opinion.\n If touch ups, additions in only certain areas, this would be relevant to the color issue(s), specifically as it pertains to the influence of the (processed, treated) cloth on the blood appearance (van der Hoeven).  As mentioned in the STL presentation (mine), technically the previous studies only demonstrate that primate (human) blood components are present, with the exception of one other species (serendipitously), they don’t evaluate the possibility that non-primate blood components from other species might be present.  Not a criticism here, it’s just the nature of the particular experimental design.   This could be done serologically (using antibodies) and there are ways to set it up that help to minimize the amount of sample required.  A potential spin off benefit of DNA analysis is sequence data of specific genes (that differ in certain regions among various species) could possibly address this as well.\nAnyway, was just wondering if you thought the touch ups were selective, and if so, which ones.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 6:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181802","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"David Mo wrote:\n“This is a paradigmatic example of collective blindness.

Glad to see you all are well and fine this morning.\nThis will be my first time commenting on this blog (I have little knowledge in science, so I hope its ok that I post here! I come here in pure ignorance, hoping to learn from responses and educate myself further on this subject)! I’ve been watching it since I discovered the shroud in November 2014. Ever since then, I’ve been completely hooked on the mystery of it all. I’ve watched and read almost everything I could on the shroud, from Mr. Barrie Schwartz to Russ Breault. I’ve read some of the papers from the late Dr. Alan Adler (May he rest in peace) and John Heller, Kelly Kearse, the late Raymond Rogers (May he also rest in peace), and Giulia Fanti. I try to understand as much as I can when reading these papers, but some of it just goes over top of my head unfortunately. Sometimes I have to pick words out and look them because I want to understand the science behind this shroud better.\nThis specific article has caught my attention. As I stated, I come here with the opportunity to present my opinions and learn from them best in the shroud world. Ever since I watched Mr. Breault’s “What If”, I think he actually poses the greatest question to the Shroud of Turin. What if this is actually authentic, and we did nothing with it? Which of course, we are doing all we can! When it comes to my personal opinion, I believe we are staring the divinity of Christ right in the face. The evidence alone is astounding, and its hard for me to believe that some people completely rule the shroud out from being authentic because of the carbon dating.\nBut, that discussion is for another time. My few questions deal with the blood and blood shapes, mostly from the few things i’ve read from the comments.\nI thought the blood was confirmed to be human male blood of the AB group? I remember reading that Dr. Adler said that it was “Primate”, but that Prof. Baima Bollone confirmed it to be human AB blood?\nI also believe that the blood on the front of the head to be genuine, from personal experience of having surgery on my head while I was awake. When I was younger, I use to have long hair (Maybe as long as the Turin shroud man’s hair, maybe slightly shorter.) and not only did I have blood matted in my hair, but it also flowed in nice rivulets down the side of my face. I would imagine that, if they carried this man from the cross, it would of been down while he was in the shroud, which could of possibly of caused the blood to look the way it is on the shroud?\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181831","author":"C. reid","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"C. reid wrote: “I thought the blood was confirmed to be human male blood of the AB group? I remember reading that Dr. Adler said that it was “Primate”, but that Prof. Baima Bollone confirmed it to be human AB blood?”\nMy Comments:\n1. Human male blood-this is based on the DNA sequencing results reported by Dr. Garza Valdes in his book, the DNA of God. In these studies it cannot be determined if the DNA signal originates from the blood sample or is due to contaminating, exogenous DNA.  Partial sequence of a hemoglobin subunit was also reported (same study)-this doesn’t help, this gene is expressed in other cell types, including skin cells.  Only real scientific conclusion that can be made here is there is human DNA on the Shroud. Is it human male blood? Still unknown (my opinion).   \nAB group-this is based on the studies of Baima-Bollone, published in a Shroud specialty journal.  Two different methods were presented, forward typing & reverse typing.  Reverse typing is especially problematic in aged samples.  Two complementary tests are really needed for a firm conclusion.  Forward typing results suggest AB, but needs to be confirmed by additional methods (my opinion). \nProfessor Baima Bollone confirmed it to be human AB blood-the antibodies BB used were raised against human proteins, however, such antibodies, especially those in use at the time, are infamous for cross-reacting with the same molecule in other species.  This has to be tested directly for any antibody that is used..  Cross-reactivity was experimentally addressed by Adler, hence the designation “primate.”  This issue was never explored in BB studies (at least not reported).  It is a very safe assumption that such antibodies cross-react with molecules from similar species.  The designation on the label of such antibodies “anti-human” only refers to the particular protein the antibody was made against.  Cross-reactivity has to be directly examined.  It’s very similar to having your own house key and feeling very good about it as you lock the door, but then four people show up and three of them have different keys that also open your front door.  It can be a game changer.  By beating the primate drum, I am not endorsing the idea that a forger rounded up a barrel of monkeys for his or her use.  I just don’t think conclusions should be stretched beyond what the data truly show.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 12:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-181861","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?","post":"Ha, I can say that I couldn’t fathom a forger either rounding up monkeys for this shroud either, especially without any real knowledge at the time that humans and monkeys even shared almost common DNA.

Ezequiel 12:12).\nMichael Baden, al menos, la asociaba más bien a Miguel Angel (Michelangelo Buonarroti, 1475-1564.)\nCarlos\n\n","date":"January 12, 2015 at 2:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","id":"comment-182846","author":"Carlos","site":"shroudstory"}]
