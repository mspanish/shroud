With a contact process, it is just those parts of each finger that are approximately in the plane of the linen (i.e parallel) that make best contact, especially if there is applied pressure, and that is the top surface. One has only to go a few mm below that topmost plane, and the curvature of the finger means progressively less contact and pressure. There is also the likelihood of a tenting effect across the fingers that means poor imaging between the fingers. Now look at the Shroud image and you will see precisely the kind of shadowing one would expect.\n Radiation theories, collimated radiation? Why should they produce any shadowing effect between the fingers, given the proposed orthogonal projection of radiation, and given that the cloth-body distance differences are relatively small in the case of fingers, certainly much smaller than the mysterious 4 or 5 cm cut-off that is said to operate in the radiation model? \nA day or two ago I was drawing attention to the deep shadow in the eye sockets, which in the contact model is similarly  accounted for in terms of curvature and obliqueness, with a resulting fall-off in contact pressure and imprinting tendency. Obviously there are other issues to be addressed, like tenting with a stretched fabric, or less tenting if there is manual moulding of fabric to the contours of the subject – but at least those possibilities exist and can be advanced by way of excuse/explanation if necessary (albeit at the risk of inviting Occam’s police involvement).\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 6:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k-on-the-allegedly-too-long-fingers/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-50282","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K. on the Allegedly Too-Long Fingers","post":"Colin, I know you are wedded to your scorch theory but….you are a scientist not me (I being a mere architect / urban planner), so you might be placed to answer this – could the pressure inflicted on the hands through the crucifixion and / or the action of removal of nails have torn flesh away from fingers?\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 7:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k-on-the-allegedly-too-long-fingers/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-50288","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K. on the Allegedly Too-Long Fingers","post":"Wedded to scorch theory? Didn’t STURP describe the image as essentially that of a scorch (if not using that precise term)?  It would be truer to say that I was attracted to Shroudology not by the contact scorch model, but by profound scepticism as regards Di Lazzaro’s radiation scenario with those uv laser beams. But I still started experimenting with radiation first, using a photosensitizing pigment (charcoal) to trap radiant heat from an incandescent lamp, and producing scorch marks under the charcoal but not elsewhere. It’s only in the last few weeks I’ve realized that the technology is essentially no different in principle from  that used by Luigi Garlaschelli (substitute ochre as sensitizer, and warm air/infrared radiation in an oven for my spot lamp, but the end-result is the same – selective scorching under the sensitizer. Methinks contact models have a lot going for them, but one now needs to compare direct contact between hot template and cloth, or indirect via Luigi’s rubbing/frottage procedure followed by secondary thermal cooking. (Incidentally, he had to use a touching -up brush to get the fingers looking right). Luigi’s gives a fuzzier and arguably more authentic look than my relatively sharp imprints, but I would maintain the templates are still relevant and certainly handy for quick modelling of macro-level contact scorch characteristics.\nAs regards your other question, I expect you have heard of “degloving”. It’s a horrible injury that folk get when their ring gets trapped in a conveyer belt, or the dog’s lead gets wrapped around a finger, and can strip off the entire flesh with nerves and blood vessels right down to the bone. I personally can’t see why that should happen as a result of crucifixion, but then what do I know? I’m just a scorch-bore through despair with agenda-driven so-called scientists attempting to make up new laws of radiation physics as they go along.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2013 at 8:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k-on-the-allegedly-too-long-fingers/","cat":"guest_posting","id":"comment-50291","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by O.K. on the Allegedly Too-Long Fingers","post":"the hands are really interesting.\nThe upper part of the hand wound measures about 15 cm to the tip of the longest finger.

Almost all of my knowledge comes from Le Linceul de Turin et la Tunique d’Argenteuil, other sources  are either older and before 1997-2005 investigations (but can be useful for historical research), or are simply derived from “Le Linceul…” like Górny& Rosikoń.
