That is why you did not get an answer from that Professor. Furthermore many educated people are trying to visualise ancient itemss using today’s technology and they don’t know how people survived about 2000 years ago. Even they don’t know how people think about 2000 years ago.\n\n","date":"April 9, 2015 at 4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/a-number-of-marks-falling-all-over-the-surface-of-the-body/","cat":"history","id":"comment-195877","author":"Sampath Fernando","site":"shroudstory"}]
