I am not aware of anyone mentioning that.But Mt 27:34 & Mk 15:23 record that immediately prior to His crucifixion Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh (an analgesic) but when He tasted it, he refused to drink it.Two of my commentaries assume (as I do) that the reason Jesus refused to drink the wine mixed with myrrh was because He wanted to remain fully conscious throughout His ordeal:\"[Mt 27] 33-34 ... The drink of wine mingled with gall ('myrrh' in Mark) is usually understood as a narcotic to reduce the pain of crucifixion, and Sanhedrin 43a tells us that such a drink was offered by the noble ladies of Jerusalem to those about to be executed (a practice inspired by Pr. 31:6-7). If so, Jesus' refusal of it might mean that he was determined to undergo his fate in full consciousness.\" (France R.T., 1985, \"Matthew,\" Tyndale, p.395. Italics original)\"[Mk 15] 23. The sour local wine which they gave Him was 'laced' with myrrh; this would give it a bitter taste, but a soporific effect, and was an act of mercy. Jesus, however, would not take any such anaesthetic; all His faculties must be unclouded for what lay before Him. Such drugged wine, tradition tells us, was provided by pious women of Jerusalem for condemned criminals, to dull the pains of execution: whether 'incense' (so the Talmud) or myrrh was used, makes little difference.\" (Cole, R.A. 1989, \"The Gospel According to Mark,\" Tyndale, p.316. Italics original).>Anyone of us would have fainted fairly early in the ordeal. No. If fainting when undergoing extreme pain was a way of avoiding that pain, then crucifixion (and indeed most torture) would be pointless and we would not need anaesthetic during surgery! Wikipedia says that \"fainting, passing out and swooning\" is \"a short loss of consciousness\" with \"spontaneous recovery\":\"Syncope, also known as fainting, passing out and swooning, is defined as a short loss of consciousness and muscle strength, characterized by a fast onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery. It is due to a decrease in blood flow to the entire brain usually from low blood pressure. \" (\"Syncope (medicine),\" Wikipedia, 5 October 2015)[continued]\n\n","author":"Stephen E.
