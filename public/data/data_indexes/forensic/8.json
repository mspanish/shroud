There were so many people with PhD‚Äôs in this and that it was hard to follow at times. There were people from Spain, Italy, France, Australia and a group from China. A lot of it had to do with chemistry and the mathematics.\nIf I had one sticking point it would be image formation and how it could have been done by folks in the MA. The image is not a pigment of any sort nor is there carbonation of the fibers which are microns thick (or thin however you want to look at them) and the discoloration is on the surface of the fibers.\nThe image is barely discernible (again bringing that up) when viewed up close (in fact disappears) and can only be seen from a distance. At the conference they had a replica(?) of the image as it is without contrast enhancement and you simply cannot see it clearly; get close to it like eight inches and the image just becomes a smudge, nothing there.\nThe presenters on Saturday brought up subjects as:\nImage Formation On The Shroud by Giulio Fanti\nChemistry Of The Image Imprinting Process by Jose Carlos Godinez\nNaturalistic Processes For Image Formation by Mark Antonacci\nRole Of Information And Radiation In Image Formation by Bob Rucker\nThese plus other papers were presented in an all day seminar on Saturday.

They they migrate to the opposite side of the linen  on the superficially -situated fibres of threads but using the interior of those fibres as  protected ‚Äòpassageways‚Äô. Along the way. further complex chemical reactions lead to the final yellow melanoidins that deposit colour evenly (half tone effect) inside fibres, visible (just) from the outside, better with the naked eye as it happens than through a microscope (through close-packing effects). Some colour, maybe not much, gets deposited on the opposite side of the linen, accounting for the scarcely visible ‚Äúsecond face‚Äù. Then what? Answer: what‚Äôs to stop the liquid returning to the irradiated face,  blurring the edges of the image, making it more ‚Äúdiffuse‚Äù especially viewed at close quarters (with ref to your earlier point, also addressed by Hugh) given that threads in a weave criss-cross from one side of the linen to the other. We now have an explanation for why the colour is concentrated on the ‚Äúcrown threads‚Äù‚Äù of the ‚Äòmain‚Äô image side, but is not exclusive to those crowns ‚Äì see the Mark Evans photomicrographs where the colour can be seen going into interstices ‚Äì and who‚Äôs to say it‚Äôs not coming OUT of interstices too, having made a complete circuit so to speak!\n(Late addition: come to think of, there‚Äôs no reason why the first formed liquid exudate from the superheated flour should not make multiple circuits. Little happens initially when it reaches the non-irradiated side, but when it returns to the irradiated side it gets a fresh injection of heat which sends it on a second round trip, the process being repeated several times which results in a more spread -out image on the radiated side than would otherwise be the case (especially if the infrared promotes the final polymerisation reactions that result in the more highly pigmented solid high MWt melanoidins, and if the much reduced infrared results in little darkening on that opposite side as the liquid exudate rapidly ‚Äòpasses through‚Äô without stopping, at least initially)\nYou want subtlety ‚Äì I can give you subtlety (modified Model 10!)\nYou may feel that the image properties are far too unusual and subtle to be the end-result of human technology. But you cannot expect a scientist ‚Äì this scientist ‚Äì to uncritically accept your bewilderment as grounds for giving up on the science and passively accepting yours and others ‚Äòmiraculist‚Äù interpretations. Human development and material progress would scarcely have proceeded beyond witch doctors and their magic spells and incantations if that kind of thinking had prevailed centuries or millennia ago. Scientists question ‚Äì and then EXPERIMENT! It‚Äôs what we do. It‚Äôs not purposely disrespectful to the spiritual word ‚Äì it‚Äôs just not willing to let that world have the final say on every subject under the sun, given what we now know about the complexities of atoms, ions and molecules.\nLate addition: I‚Äôm thinking I should drop my description of Model 10 as the ‚Äúflour imprinting‚Äù model. It‚Äôs insufficiently informative, and may indeed act as an instant turn off for those seeking a more with-it ‚Äòsciency‚Äô name.

I can‚Äôt find them, but Colin seems to refer to one by ‚ÄòCharles A Rogers‚Äô, so maybe they are? They‚Äôll no doubt turn up on Shroud.com eventually.\nSecondly ‚Äì from what I can gather of its website, the entire organisation of the the Pasco conference was predicated on two premises ‚Äì one might almost call them axioms ‚Äì that the Shroud is the authentic grave-cloth of Christ, and that the image was formed by a miraculous process. There was little or no consideration given to the possibility that either of these might be incorrect, and piles of evidence listed in favour of them without any reference to the fact that almost all of it has been, and still is, disputed or rejected by other researchers.\nThirdly ‚Äì to specific points raised by James Bond here.\na) I don‚Äôt think it is true to say that ‚ÄúThe 14C carbon dating group went into the investigation already determining in their minds that the TS is a fake‚Äù. There is little evidence at all for that, and quite a lot to suggest the reverse. One or two of the Oxford team were avowed atheists, but that‚Äôs not the same as wanting the Shroud to be a fake. And this: ‚Äútossing data that didn‚Äôt agree with their preconception of the age‚Äù is wholly untrue and without any evidence at all. And later this: ‚ÄúThe Arizona data was thrown out because their data was too far outside what they considered the norm to be and just use the other two labs‚Äô data.‚Äù This is utterly untrue. Wherever did you get that idea from? I don‚Äôt believe that even the most ardent authenticist could have said that ‚Äì you must have misunderstood.\nb) This ‚Äòbottom line‚Äô ‚Äúthe image is not a painting or any other medium used to produce a very faint image‚Äù is precisely one of those axioms which is hotly disputed. This: ‚Äúthat has to be viewed from a distance to even see any discernible image and the closer you get the image just disappears‚Äù is no truer for the shroud than for any other image. Shroud 2.0 is an iPad app which allows you to investigate the Shroud in huge detail, and distinct features are discernible from a few inches away.\n‚Äúwhereas in a painting or photograph the image becomes more distinct the closer you get.‚Äù Not at all. It depends very much on the size and style of the painting or the resolution of the photograph. It is very wrong to compare the Shroud‚Äôs style to a conventional portrait. Try looking at, say, one of Monet‚Äôs waterlily paintings in close up and see if you can guess what it is! ‚ÄúThe only reason you can see anything now is that the image is produced with a higher contrast‚Äù This is true of most photographs, especially the Enrie ones of 1938. However I have seen the Shroud ‚Äòlive‚Äô at the last ostentation, and the image was perfectly visible. \nc) ‚ÄúAll the attempts at copying and trying to reproduce a similar image has failed because paint or some other medium is used not a radiation burn such as is on the cloth.‚Äù This is another highly disputable ‚Äòaxiom‚Äô. It stems from the disagreement between Walter McCrone, who claimed to see iron oxide particles on the cloth whose density corresponded to the intensity of the image, and John Heller & Alan Adler, who found almost no iron oxide, and did not attribute what they did find to paint. It is insufficiently realised, especially by those who do not want to realise it, that McCrone was examining whole areas of tape, covered with all the debris lifted from the Shroud, including all the pigment particles, whereas Heller and Adler were examining individual fibres extracted from the sticky tape, which had to be washed thoroughly to remove the gum, thereby removing all the paint particles they were subsequently unable to find. It is also not sufficiently realised that the X-Ray Fluorescence study of the Shroud carried out in Turin by STuRP‚Äôs Morris, Schwalbe and London clearly showed a direct correlation between image intensity and iron concentration.\nd) Next, I‚Äôm afraid, is a recitation of another set of axioms, usually touted by authenticists as indisputable facts, but none of which is any such thing.\ni) The Shroud has some characteristics of a photographic ‚Äònegative‚Äô, rather like a wood-engraving, or a bas-relief rubbing. It is not a true photographic negative unless we assume that Jesus had very blond hair and beard, and that his nose was much lighter in colour than his cheeks.\nii) All images contain 3D-information of one kind or another. When the Shroud is subjected to a computer program which converts intensity to height (such as imageJ or the infamous VP-8) it looks like a bas relief emerging from a flat base. It does not look like a fully three-dimensional body. It only works at all if one makes several assumptions, disputed even among authenticists: the shroud must have been horizontal, the ‚Äòradiation‚Äô must have been vertical and rapidly attenuated in air, and all the different materials of the body (hair, skin, lips, etc.) radiated in exactly the same way.\niii) Anybody who rubs an old fibre-tipped pen over a fairly dense cloth will find he makes an image with all the characteristics specified ‚Äì minimum penetration, no capillarity, only the uppermost surfaces of the threads discoloured, etc.\niiii) It does seem to be true that at least one component of the image, and probably an important one, is a discolouration of the flax fibres themselves, such as caused by a scorch. There is some research being carried out, not least by Colin and myself, as to how these ‚Äòscorches‚Äô can be formed. The two broad avenues are by heat (or radiation), and chemically, such as by acid. Various possibilities were available to medieval artists. However, all attempts to derive such discolouration ‚Äònaturally‚Äô from a dead body seem to have been abandoned in favour of  supernatural approach, although a few authenticists still hope that some kind of vaporograph effect, or geological piezo-electric effect, are also possible explanations.\nv) ‚ÄúThe conclusion is that an artist or forger could not have produced the bizarre characteristics of the images in any era, either ancient or modern.‚Äù That is only the conclusion of those who do not even acknowledge that any research into non-supernatural explanations is still being carried out.\nvi) On the Shroud the bloodstains from the nail-holes are only visible on the back of one hand. Of course they do not show holes in the palms. They are exit wounds. They are, however, consistent with the conventional idea of where the nails went in, although there are several medieval images which are exceptions to the rule. ‚ÄúWhere all religious paintings bar none have the nail holes in the hands.‚Äù Not quite, there are exceptions.\ne) Your last comment: ‚ÄúIt surely begs the question as to why. No artist has come forth claiming that he/she did it all during the MA era ‚Äì you would think that one would. There‚Äôs no signature on the linen as to who the artist is whereas all painting from that time forward always has the artist‚Äôs name or logo or something.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know where you get that idea from, but it couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Throughout the Middle Ages individual artists were very rarely recognised, especially ecclesiastical ones. The decoration of a church or palace was largely up to unsung, unrecognised, and now completely unknown ‚Äòcraftsmen‚Äô who did a range of things from sculpture to embroidery. Some of the most impressive are now known as by ‚Äúthe Master of‚Ä¶‚Äù a place or painting, without any idea of his name. The Shroud was not made for permanent public display, but as part of something else, a ritual, a pilgrimage, a play, or similar, and as such its artist would not have been considered a particularly distinguishable individual. And if, of course, it was made deliberately to be mistaken for the original thing, then of course it wouldn‚Äôt be signed!\n","date":"July 26, 2017 at 1:31 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/shroud-scope-8-372-impossible-scourge-marks-surely-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood","id":"comment-9801","author":"Anonymous","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Shroud Scope 8: 372 impossible scourge marks (surely?) on the Shroud of¬†Turin","post":"Thank you for your enlightening reply.

I find your responses interesting and informative and take them under advisement when searching out what‚Äôs really true or not.\nWell, I‚Äôm heartened to learn that sindonology is not ignoring this lone wolf researcher completely! (Oh, and the only reason I operate as a lone wolf is because there‚Äôs no comparable ‚Äòsceptics‚Äô club‚Äô or even website that responds as I do the the claim that the Shroud image is non-reproducible by modern technology).\nBut again, we have this piece of linen with the faint negative image that has 3D information in it (no other man made painting or medium can do that) and that the closer you get to it the more it disappears rather than getting more detail to view. There‚Äôs just too much there to just toss it off as some sort of Middle Age fake.\nYou‚Äôve chosen a posting of mine from some 5 years ago for your visit here James without saying why. It makes a point which could,  if checked out ,  deliver a knock-out blow for authenticity ‚Äì namely that the 372 scourge marks on the shroud which we‚Äôre told are faint imprints of blood ‚Äì not part of the body image ‚Äì  are accompanied by unexplained uncommented upon  physical scratching of the linen threads too. That suggests the scourge marks were not delivered to a body, whether 1st or 14th century,  and then imprinted,  but delivered straight to the linen!  The latter if true provides virtual proof of forgery/simulation, call it what you want, while at the same time neatly explaining why the scourge marks are (curiously) NOT part of the body image.\nHowever, the main reason for posting this reply is to ask whether you are familiar with my current Model 10 (flour imprinting/thermal development) and the manner in which it developed from Model 2 (one-step scorching from hot metal template)? Forgive me saying but I get the impression you are not. Were that to be the case, then you need to know that I have addressed issues like negative image and 3D-rendering almost from the word go, and was able to reproduce and account for them even with Model 2. Negative image and 3D are really no big deal.  If you wish I‚Äôll supply photographs from old experiments that make the point better than a few words here can.\nModel 10 arose after searching for a means of sensitizing otherwise resistant linen to heat. Various agents were tested, but the one that performed best was white flour, initially rubbed into the surface of linen before ‚Äòbranding‚Äô with a hot metal template to get a negative 3D-enhancible image (which could be as faint as one liked if one used repeated pressing while the template cooled). It was a red letter day for this investigator when he realized first that a COLD UNHEATED oil-smeared metal template could be dusted with flour, and used to make a flour imprint on linen, then heating the linen instead of the metal to get the two-stage image.There was another red letter day when realizing that the process could work just as well by dusting skin as well as cold metal, resulting quickly in imprints of my hand that were also negative and 3D-enhancible! Microscopy followed in short order, starting 2 years ago, albeit instantly mocked by one of sindonology‚Äôs high-profile promoters of authenticity, and I am now no longer as bemused as you are with fibres that are essentially either coloured or non-coloured with few in-betweens (the half-tone effect) or with discontinuities, striation etc ertc. In other words Model 10 reproduces most, indeed probably all the allegedly ‚Äòbizarre‚Äô, enigmatic characteristics of the Shroud body image. Model 10 invokes a thermally-generated chromophore that is briefly LIQUID and thus able to migrate within threads, indeed within fibres too, accounting for many perhaps all of those otherwise weird microscopic properties. It remains to be seen how long my message will take to percolate through the hard impenetrable rock surface that is sindonology. Things do not augur well if the last two years are anything to go by, without a single  reference to flour imprinting appearing on any other site bar Dan Porter‚Äôs retired one ‚Äì not even on the otherwise impressive Hugh Farey‚Äôs supposedly ‚Äòsceptical‚Äô BSTS Newsletter.\nIt surely begs the question as to why. No artist has come forth claiming that he/she did it all during the MA era ‚Äì you would think that one would. There‚Äôs no signature on the linen as to who the artist is whereas all painting from that time forward always has the artist‚Äôs name or logo or something.\n‚ÄúPainting‚Äù is a needless diversion from the essentials, unless used as an inferior and easily debunked means of faking the Shroud. Artists‚Äô inorganic pigments would have been easily recognized as such when newly applied. (Even that mid-1350s Troyes bishop described the newly ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù Shroud as ‚Äúcunningly‚Äù painted). But the clincher that shows the image is not artists‚Äô paint pigments, not even age-degraded ones, is Adler and Heller‚Äôs finding that the body image could be bleached quickly using diimide, which is virtually 100% proof that the chromophore is organic, i.e. carbon-based, relying on conjugated double bonds for colour (-C-C=C-C=C- etc, maybe with nitrogen in the sequence too, e.g. -C-C=N-C=C- ) I don‚Äôt have access to diimide, but simple domestic bleach quickly decolorises all my images, whether direct scorches (Model 2) or developed flour imprints (Model 10). I‚Äôll take a bet with anyone that diimide will work too!\nDiimide  (N2H2) is highly specific in the way it acts, hydrogenating those conjugated double bonds, destroying the specific light-capturing wavelength-specific properties of the chromophore. There are no grounds whatsoever for thinking diimde could bleach solid inorganic pigments like red ochre etc, the sort invoked by Walter McCrone. He may well have seen microparticuate matter (which can be accounted for in Model 10 as flecks of wheat gluten or other constituents of the flour-imprinting medium) but he failed in my opinion to make a convincing case for his ‚Äújust a painting‚Äù interpretation, and neither has Charles Freeman for that matter. As I say, the ‚Äújust a painting‚Äù school of so-called thought is a needless distraction. The Shroud image is an IMPRINT, not a painting, which explains among other things the negative image and 3D-enhancibility.\nPS The reason the Shroud body image is an imprint is because it was INTENDED TO BE SEEN AS SUCH, instantly ‚Äì with added visual cues from the DOUBLE body image showing BOTH sides of a naked recumbent man, flagging up a discarded shroud, not a work of art for hanging on a wall or similar.  All the effort that went into conceiving that unique and iconic way of representing the imagined appearance of Joseph of Arimathea‚Äôs linen after removal of the body for burial would have been for naught if ordinary paint pigments had been used for the body image. No, it had to be something far more subtle, something that could be interpreted as an ancient yellowed sweat IMPRINT, with blood in all the right places to allow the pilgrim to identify the man immediately by the manner of his death. Forget paint entirely.

That bizarre scenario is generated by mathematics. How did that arise? Well, until seeing the entire argument (I confess to being in no hurry t0 do so) I think what we see is a textbook example of someone who fails to appreciate the difference between heat and temperature, who being unable to conjure up a source of heat able to produce a classic scorch ‚Äì the kind you or I could produce with a hot iron, oven etc ‚Äì has to resort to to a scenario where the absence of appreciable mass is compensated by dreaming up astronomical temperatures operating ever so briefly!\nWhy is it so important to consider heat as well as temperature (heat being determined not only by temperature ‚Äì an intensive property ‚Äì but by extensive properties too, notably mass of the particles, their specific heat capacities etc)?  There‚Äôs a simple experiment anyone can do  that brings home the problem facing anyone looking to any kind of direct scorch mechanism that thermally discolours  (‚Äúscorches‚Äù) the surface of untreated linen, no matter how superficially. Get some metal that can be heated strongly, then gripped in pliars or similar. One can use an aluminium pencil sharpener as I used to 5 years ago. Place it on a ceramic hob and leave it there till it reaches maximal temperature, then pick it up with the pliars and stamp onto linen. You‚Äôll get an immediate dense scorch, maybe smoke and smell too. \nNow for the interesting bit. Lift and apply the metal to another patch of linen. Note the substantial drop in image intensity. Keep doing the same and you may well find you don‚Äôt get more than 5 or 6 imprints, of rapidly decreasing intensity, before there‚Äôs finally no visible scorch at all. Why? Because scorching is highly endothermic.  Chemically dehydrating the carbohydrates of linen, i.e. driving off the elements of water (2H per O) as steam, requires lots of energy. So each pressing drains a big chunk of thermal energy from the metal making it progressively less able to produce a new scorch. For the scorch model to work reliably one would have to have some kind of thermostat-regulated system, i.e. operating at and holding one‚Äôs carefully selected intermediate temperature, replacing drained-off energy as soon as it was lost, without which one would be struggling to get a manageable system for producing an image that was of even intensity all over, and not too faint, not too strong. That incidentally is why I gave up on Model 2 (scorching off hot metal template). The combination of high temperature initially AND maintaining that temperature was simply asking too much of medieval artisans. I‚Äôd suggest that it is likewise asking too much of  supernatural forces too if the dissipating heat problem is solved by invoking  close on a hundred atomic bombs offset  by a vanishingly small application time to make the superficial scorch possible. That‚Äôs true, even if spell-binding conference mathematics delivered to a receptive self-selected audience from a home computer by PowerPoint  (like the one in Pasco last week) maintains it‚Äôs  not only feasible but worthy of serious consideration!

What was needed was an appreciation that medieval forgers were not attempting to reproduce a burial shroud, but Joseph of Arimathea‚Äôs fine linen delivered to the cross, intended primarily for discreet transport from cross to tomb, later to be replaced by more specialized burial garments. The task was to simulate the impression that a sweat-laden body plus blood might leave on linen, and look like centuries later.  The inspiration for the body imprint may well have been the legendary Veil of Veronica that was attracting large numbers of pilgrims to Avignon ‚Äì the mid 14th century site of the Papacy.\nMy flour-imprinting method produces an actual image ‚Äì i.e. negative, reasonable 3D response in the appropriate software, the matching microscopic properties (halftone effect, striations, discontinuities etc)  bleachability, fuzziness, water-resistance, longevity etc etc. All of those can be accounted for in my model which explains the body image as a thermally-developed contact-imprint, one in which Maillard browning reactions between the reducing sugars and proteins etc of flour result finally in high molecular-weight melanoidins. \n Can the same be said of all the weird and wonderful mechanisms based on sudden flashes of neutrons, protons, uv radiation, pulsed laser beams  etc etc? All I‚Äôve seen so far are patches of yellow or brown discoloration, e.g. those that Paolo Di Lazzaro reported back in 2011.\nThe way to dismiss medieval forgery is to adopt the mindset of the medieval forger and try to produce a Shroud-like body image using  only the technology available in the 14th century (which I believe I have done). If one fails repeatedly then fine, then by all means set aside the radiocarbon dating, then propose miraculous intervention that generates a truly unique image with properties inexplicable with the modern-day science and technology (though how you hope to reproduce them in the home or laboratory to convince sceptics is another matter). \nPasco?  Which presentation impressed you the most? None that I‚Äôve seen thus far has impressed me in the slightest. But then I‚Äôm biased, towards the strictly-applied scientific method that involves putting all preconceptions to one side when planning and performing experiments.

Then of course the negative image; in MA times that concept wasn‚Äôt known then‚Äù.\nAren‚Äôt you and the authorities you quote making a huge assumption there, not just that the image was ‚Äúscorched on‚Äù (which leaves much to the imagination) but more importantly, went onto plain untreated linen, with the implication or assumption that it was the major constituent of the linen (cellulose) that was being chemically-modified. \nYes I know that to be part of the Di Lazzaro narrative, and that of many others too, that their radiation or whatever is targeting cellulose. Heller and Adler promoted that message too when interpreting the visible, uv and ir reflectance spectra as indication the presence of ‚Äúconjugated carbonyls‚Äù formed from dehydration./oxidation of ‚Äúcellulose‚Äù as the explanation for the yellow chromophore. But where was the backing evidence? And what about Rogers‚Äô claim that the cellulose of the TS looked physically intact, judged by its allegedly native crystallinity under crossed polaroids etc? Why was Rogers‚Äô claim never followed up by requesting  from the Turin custodians a few more fibres from which to judge whether the chromophiore was derived from something added to the linen at manufacture (starch, saponins etc) and that the end product was in fact complex, high molecular weight melanoidins formed by chemical reaction between nitrogenous compounds and reducing sugars (I‚Äôll spare you the details of Rogers‚Äô pro-authenticity naturalistic model, or rather semi-naturalistic given the added starch, the focus being on those melanoidins which are NOT products of all the assumed cellulose-modifying chemistry).\nImage thickness?  Rogers estimated it at 200-600nm, i.e. 0.2 to 0.6 microns, a bit smaller than the range you quote James. That was based not on what he could see under the microscope but what he couldn‚Äôt see, i.e. alleged detachable image layer in cross section (ipso facto it must be thinner than the shortest wavelength of visible light).\nI‚Äôve since seen comments from one or other of the chief Italian groups, I don‚Äôtr recall which, to the effect that they have been able to confirm the thickness of the image layer with improved technology, finding it to be in the same ballpark ‚Äì maybe the one you quote, but have still to see any hard evidence  to back their claim (I don‚Äôt spend $40 or more on reprints purely on the off-chance they might have what I‚Äôm looking for‚Äù.\nBut if my flour-imprinting Model 10 is correct, which I now believe it to be with virtually 100% confidence (OK, 99.99%) then all talk of detachable coatings and precise image thicknesses is misleading. Why? Because the thermally-generated briefly LIQUID chromophore gets inside the threads and travels via capillary channels between and around cellulose microfibrils, colouring  up weakly the most of the thread‚Äôs interior (it‚Äôs hard from the outside to tell how much, but my initial results with cross-sections- admittedly with equipment that is pushed to its limits re magnification and resolution- suggests most of the interior of the thread is coloured. How do other folk manage to measure image thickness if the chromophore is dispersed so diffusely in the interior of threads?  One waits for their evidence with bated breath!\nSo sorry to disagree, but I say the image is not just on top of the threads, it‚Äôs inside too!\nNegative image?  One mustn‚Äôt assume that means photographically-derived negative image. ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù simply means tone-reversed. Any contact image, say a muddy footprint on a white tiled floor, is a ‚Äúnegative‚Äô image, inasmuch as real  Caucasian feet are not black, and not all floor tiles are white. The negative Shroud image is the least of one‚Äôs problems where modelling is concerned, and indeed is prima facie evidence for imprinting via contact, notwithstanding those hugely misleading  pro-authenticity modelling exercises that deploy linen loosely draped over volunteers, essentially begging the question (since medieval imprinters of a whole body onto linen would press the fabric firmly down onto the flour-coated surfaces so as to include desired relief that would otherwise be missed due to initial air gaps).\nStill more to follow!\n","date":"July 25, 2017 at 11:07 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/shroud-scope-8-372-impossible-scourge-marks-surely-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood","id":"comment-9792","author":"Colin Berry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Shroud Scope 8: 372 impossible scourge marks (surely?) on the Shroud of¬†Turin","post":"‚ÄúThe 14C carbon dating group went into the investigation already determining in their minds that the TS is a fake (different from a forgery) and intended to prove it which they did, tossing data that didn‚Äôt agree with their preconception of the age.

Yet the Shroud first entered recorded history in about mid 1350s with its first display at Lirey, i.e. corresponding to the radiocarbon dating, and did so with no ‚Äòback story‚Äô worth speaking of, bar a ragbag of anecdotal sightings much later of this or that piece of cloth, never once described in terms of the once-seen-never forgotten head-to-head life-size double body image.\nI‚Äôm sorry to hear you subscribing to what I frankly consider to be hugely insulting to the radiocarbon scientists, and to the highly reputable journal Nature too with that multi-author paper. What I don‚Äôt understand is why Turin allows all these dark whispers to continue, based either on the kind of slander you and others perpetuate, or even the more mundane idea that the  corner sample was atypical of the whole, invisibly mended etc etc.\n It‚Äôs high time that Turin and/or the Vatican did the decent thing and arranged for repeat dating using a wider range of sample sites.

I‚Äôm saying there was some sort of bias where their minds were already made up and then went on to prove it. The Arizona data was thrown out because their data was too far outside what they considered the norm to be and just use the other two labs‚Äô data.\nThe whole thing about the TS to me is there is no discernible method of how the image could be produced without any sort of pigments. The image lays on top of the fibers not in the threads and density is not coloration placed heavily on top of one another fiber but just more densely packed as in more coloration next to but not on top.\nThe front and back (dorsal) images of the crucified man are negative images and contain 3D or topographical information content related to the distance of the cloth from the body. Of the 100 to 200 fibers in a thread, the images result from only the top one or two layers of fibers in a thread being discolored. The thickness of discoloration in a fiber is less than 0.4 microns, which is less than a wavelength of light. There is no indication of capillarity (soaking up of a liquid) between the fibers or the threads. The discolored regions of the fibers in the image result from a change in the covalent bonding of the carbon atoms that were originally in the cellulose molecules in the linen. This change in the covalent bonding of the carbon atoms is equivalent to a dehydration and oxidation of the cellulose molecule. The conclusion is that an artist or forger could not have produced the bizarre characteristics of the images in any era, either ancient or modern.\nIf you‚Äôll also notice that if the image is a fraud and used as some sort of icon or religious artifact then why, in all the paintings of Christ crucified/hanging on the Cross are all the nail holes painted into/onto the palms whereas on the Shroud image the nail holes are in the wrist. Surely a religious painter or whoever created the Shroud would have also put nail holes in the palms and not right behind the hand where the body could be hung from without tearing out of the palms. Okay, some folks would argue that He was held up with ropes is why the nails didn‚Äôt rip out but then again it comes back to where the nail holes are on the Shroud and where all religious paintings bar none have the nail holes in the hands.\nIf you would consider yourself an investigator would you really want to slip out without being noticed because you disagreed with one point or other that was made? Also unobtrusively as possible really wouldn‚Äôt have been necessary since people were getting up all during presentations without anyone caring. I did it several times myself when some of the foreign (Spanish, Italian) presenters‚Äô accents were difficult to understand so I went outside and caught up things on them later.\nThe whole point of this exercise to me is: I like to see what proponents of a Middle Age image/painting/whatever believe vs those that believe that there‚Äôs an image of a crucified man on a linen cloth.\nI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs Jesus on there but there‚Äôs been no other crucifixion with similar injuries such as Shroud Man. \nYou mentioned the scourging ‚Äì  The Shroud shows 100 to 120 scourge marks from two Roman flagrum, one striking from each side, with dumbbell shaped weights on the ends of the straps. The blood marks from these wounds show blood serum rings (visible only under UV) around the dried blood exudation.\nThere‚Äôs been no record prior to the 1500‚Äôs that showed the TS as being venerated as an icon or anything like that, the reason being it was hidden in different families households since around AD600 and was known however to have been in Constantinople.\nAnyway, it is interesting to see the disagreements from other sources and I value your input.\nRegards,\nJames\n","date":"July 25, 2017 at 11:03 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/shroud-scope-8-372-impossible-scourge-marks-surely-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood","id":"comment-9796","author":"James Bond","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Shroud Scope 8: 372 impossible scourge marks (surely?) on the Shroud of¬†Turin","post":"I attended the Shroud seminar in Pasco, WA in July 2017 and found it fascinating.
