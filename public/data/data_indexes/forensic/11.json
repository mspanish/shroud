As with all your work, this is amazing and very helpful as I try to develop a presentation explaining the Shroud to others. Thanks very much. Thanks again for your encouraging feedback.I model my posts in this series on the researched and referenced assignments that I used to enjoy doing for my Bachelor of Science degree (2000-2004). Maybe someone will award me a Bachelor of Sindonology degree when I have completed the series? :-)Stephen E.
