Which would you choose? One with the herringbone weave clearly visible, or one without?  I know which one I would choose, because I know objectively that the real object in the Turin cathedral has a herringbone weave. Any image that fails to show that weave pattern must clearly be a defective one.\nI personally had never encountered a Shroud image that showed the herringbone weave so clearly until last week – viewing the banner on David Rolfe’s relatively new Enigma blog. I don’t know if it is or is not a video still. It may well be. If it is, then it was taken with a good tripod support that eliminated camera shake – because there is no hint of blurring. The only limitation is the inevitable pixellation that occurs on magnification, but one can enlarge sufficiently to see that the image is confined almost exclusively to those diagonal ribs, and that the superficial image on those ribs is largely of the  same character wherever one looks – the bridge of the nose, the eye ridges, and even the vertical shank of “hair” on the left side, showing no discernible strands of hair.\nFor a unique HD image to appear as a blog banner, unlabelled, unheralded, is a curious way for a valuable research resource to enter the public domain with no fanfare whatsoever. Hopefully David Rolfe will provide some background in due course, and better still release the entire HD image.

Note that it too shows nothing in this HD close-up that would distinguish it as strands of hair. The darker image is essentially no different from what one sees, say, on the bridge of the nose.\nAs before, the caveat is needed that one needs to see the HD image of the entire face and head.  But some tentative conclusions are possible: while one can argue, as I have done above, that the “eyebrows” are not really there – that it is the brow ridge that could have been imaged by a kind of pressure imprinting (“barography”?) the same can hardly be said of the “head of hair”, given that the outer margin of the hair (at leas)t does not have underlying bone if viewed as a frontal image. So what would cause head hair, if indeed real hair,  to be imaged if neither photography nor “barography” can be invoked?  Certainly not vapourography either (see comments) given that hair does not putrefy to form those organic amines (putrescine, cadaverine) that Ray Rogers thought were instrumental in image formation via Maillard reactions. The plot thickens, as they say…”\nI have two more postings planned. One will be to document a curious effect I discovered last night, and briefly reported to Dan Porter’s site, namely the loss of the herringbone weave pattern in 3D imaging (ImageJ software) and its replacement by a uniform mesh pattern (the implication of which need to be considered by the high priests of Shroud image analysis).

No disrespect to Ray Rogers, who was clearly an ill man (died 2005) but I like to think that any one of them could have shot down that vapour theory in seconds (based on the science of gaseous diffusion etc).\nThat theory depended on not just one but two qualifying assumptions, both highly speculative. To support an hypothesis that the image was the product of Maillard (sugar-amine) reactions he first proposed the presence of  impregnating saponins in the cloth to provide chemically-reactive pentosans, and then the presence of advanced decomposition gaseous organic amines (cadaverine etc). That’s two small probabilities multiplied together to get an overall probability that is close to zero… and that’s without taking gaseous diffusion into account that would have prevented recognizable images being formed…\nSorry, but dreaming up possible scenarios without rigorously testing them is not science. It’s daydreaming.\nFortunately, there is a way of testing Rogers’ highly improbable ideas. If he had been correct, then the image areas should contain higher levels of nitrogen from those decomposition amines, bearing in mind that linen fibres contain little nitrogen (being mainly non-nitrogeneous carbohydrates).\nI confidently predict that there is no enhanced level of nitrogen in any of the the image-bearing areas, including those that are said to be “blood”.\nWhy did Rogers not perform that simple test?\nRogers, towards the end of his life, was sadly “losing it”.

It should be clear that there is nothing imaged that anyone would have recognized as “eyebrows”, had the surrounding area been blanked out, andthe observer told merely that it was part of a face. \nI strongly suspect that the same would be true for “moustache” and for “beard” in close-up too, which is why the absence of the complete image is so frustrating, especially as Rolfe was saying 4 years ago about interesting features –  which is a bit of a tease given he gave no specifics. It is ludicrous that a documentary maker can see and report on the HD image, whetting appetites so to speak, and for scientists like myself to have to jump through hoops to get access…\n","date":"April 16, 2012 at 2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/did-you-know-there-is-a-high-definition-image-of-the-turin-shroud-most-of-it-still-under-wraps/","cat":"beard","id":"comment-109","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Did you know there is a high-definition image of the Turin Shroud (most of it still under wraps)?","post":"I do agree with you.

Where else can you see the relationship between image and weave in such high definition?  If you think Enrie’s images have that same clarity – as if examining under a hand lens – then please let me know. Better still, provide a link.\nYour comments re interposing of objects between face and linen are noted – but are pure speculation on your part, needless to say, and pretty fanciful at that too. Your initial assumption is that the image is from Palestine, 1st century AD. Mine is not. Until the C-dating is repeated, I am happy to accept the findings of the three labs, and view the Shroud as a very clever medieval artefact.\nIt may not have been made in Europe, needless to say. That French knight may have acquired it in the Middle East while away on his Crusades. He may have been offered the Shroud as the next best thing to the Holy Grail.\n","date":"April 16, 2012 at 12:05 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/did-you-know-there-is-a-high-definition-image-of-the-turin-shroud-most-of-it-still-under-wraps/","cat":"beard","id":"comment-105","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Did you know there is a high-definition image of the Turin Shroud (most of it still under wraps)?","post":"Don’t you ever forget, it is common knowledge in archaeology, glyptology and criminology to use flash in an oblique angle to make appear imprints/impressions that do not appear under other lightings.\n","date":"April 16, 2012 at 11:55 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/did-you-know-there-is-a-high-definition-image-of-the-turin-shroud-most-of-it-still-under-wraps/","cat":"beard","id":"comment-104","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Did you know there is a high-definition image of the Turin Shroud (most of it still under wraps)?","post":"Colin,\nThe apparent absence of eyebrows on the Shroud face is most likely due to the presence of objects placed or displaced on the corresponding areas (such as a small band shaped papyrus\nfragment written both in Hebrew and Greek/Latin on one side and covering the right eyebrow arch and a coin and the petalless head of a crown daisy on the left one).\nFor research purpose (to triple check my fondings), i myself wrote to Turin (in January2010 and February 2011).
