[{"title":"Stephen Jones on the Stuttgart Psalter","post":"It is nicely done, I agree.\nBut being nice doesn’t make it correct…\nAlthough the depiction of scourge wounds is indeed rare, especially as early as the 9th century, they are more common in psalters and other less public works than in big paintings.  The marks here are on a body only a few centimetres high, so the fact that there are only 20 or so, each one representing a cut about 10cm long, should not count against them. However, it is quite wrong to call them “realistic.” Both the Ducio and Colombe paintings are considerably more so. Lorenzetto and Huguet also attempt realism, while Memling, for example, clearly stylises the effect. De Wesselow is probably correct in saying that artists deliberately shied away from any confusion with the “five wounds.”\nNext, however, we are told the artist accurately depicted the Roman flagrum. Regular readers will know this is one of my hobby horses, but the flagrum in the accompanying photo was not “recovered from the Roman City of Herculaneum”, and nor does Wilson, to whom this absurdity seems to be attributed, say it was. I believe it was made specifically to fit the marks made on the shroud in the early 20th century.\nThen we move to the “smoking gun”, which is the unnatural depiction of “curved fingers” apparently mimicking the epsilon blood stain. It is clear that neither Jones nor Hamon are familiar with many others of the 150 or so illustrations in the Stuttgart psalter, the majority of which contain unnaturally curved fingers, a hefty proportion of which are in exactly the same configuration as they are here. Several of these show people pointing to their own head, which I believe to be a convention representing thinking, and perhaps by corollary, guilt.\nAlthough it is a wonderful find, neither the psalter, nor this particular picture, are anything like evidence for an early provenance for the shroud.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 6:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/stephen-jones-on-the-stuttgart-psalter/","cat":"flagrum","id":"comment-48364","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones on the Stuttgart Psalter","post":"Hugh you wrote: “It is CLEAR (upper cases mine) that neither Jones nor Hamon are familiar with many others of the 150 or so illustrations in the Stuttgart psalter,”\nI don’t know for Jones but as for me I AM PERFECTLY FAMILIAR WITH THE SP MINIATURES.

Done with the right hand, it can be read as Victory over Evil/Death Sign or Election/Lucky Sign; done with the left hand, it can read as Mockery/Defeat of Good over Evil/Unlucky/Evil Eye Sign; in the Stuggart Psalter when done with the left and/or right it can also be read as Recognition/Identification Sign according to the miniature specific context.\nd)Your non-discrimination between right/left hand gestures forming the tale-tell sign of an Epsilon or 3 with a tail; your non-discrimination between back- and palm- of-hand views, in vertical, horizontal and oblique positions, have you TOTALLY MISSED THE REAL THING/MEANING of the 4 fingered hand gesture forming an Epsilon or 3 with a tail.\nActually if ever you have achieved to demonstrate anything here, it is how shallow, arrogant and unscholarly your arch-scepticism is. \n(To continue if need be i.e. just in case you still are “without much fear of contradiction”).\n\n","date":"October 28, 2013 at 10:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/stephen-jones-on-the-stuttgart-psalter/","cat":"flagrum","id":"comment-48985","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones on the Stuttgart Psalter","post":"Max, please, is there one person among your cryptoarcheology peers who can corroborate your assertions?

No, I can’t do any of these things.

You will be pleased that I have ordered a copy of “A Bestiary of Christ” and very much look forward to pages 109 – 123. I have even looked at the ‘glimpse’ view on Google Books. Remarkably, there is no reference to a “Hand of Victory”, nor “Victory over Evil”, nor “Victory over Good.” But then I expect you know that.\nThere is, however, a reference to a “Hand of Justice,” so I looked that up on Wikipedia. The Hand of Justice shown is a model of one used at Napoleon’s coronation and looks nothing like the gesture we have been discussing. However, it led me to investigate the “Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve” which you may not be familiar with, as it also contains instances of the gesture you claim appears in the Stuttgart psalter only.\n\n","date":"October 30, 2013 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/stephen-jones-on-the-stuttgart-psalter/","cat":"flagrum","id":"comment-49272","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones on the Stuttgart Psalter","post":"Hugh, \nfirst you wrote: “anybody can become an ‘iconographic cryptanalyst’ without much fear of contradiction”, then ACTUALLY NOW YOU HAVE TO ADMIT your own impotency to become one as “[you] can’t do any of these things” since all your claims are UNSUBTANTIATED in other word just wind and blabla.\nRe the hermeneutics of the most specific four-fingered hand gesture forming BOTH a “3 with a tail” AND “an Epsilon with a tail” with the elongated/telescopic and non elongated/telescopic index finger pointing to a character’s head or forehead, let’s see what you JUST CANNOT DO or of which you are TOTALLY IGNORANT and what I can do and do know:\n1/ you JUST CANNOT justify any evident conventional hand gesture symbolizing ‘GUILT’ or ‘BETRAYAL’ within any pre-existing or existing TYPOLOGY OF MEDIEVAL HAND GESTURES. Your claim has no iconographic ground at all. It is nothing else but a figment of your layman’s imagination. Your ‘guilt sign’ and ‘betrayal sign’ are just NON-FACTUAL.\nReminder: Unless you can provide us with a proof to the contrary, which you JUST CANNOT, to the alleged ‘sole exception’ of the PS MS, such a specific hand gesture never ever appears in conjunction with any Betrayal of Christ scene in medieval iconography. THIS IS AN ICONOGRAPHIC FACT. It is clear you haven’t done much research work and are totally ignorant of medieval iconography. Could you JUST DO your homework, please, before writing your unsubstantiated prose?\nTHE TRUE ICONOGRAPHICAL FACT is the specific hand gesture can read as a CRYPTIC VARIANT of the APOTROPAIC sign of ‘horned hand’ done with a vertical or horizontal RIGHT hand (back-hand or palm view) to ward off Evil/Evil Eye/Perversion. Such a sign DOES EXIST and your ignorance of this very fact is just flabbergasting! Actually it dates back to Antiquity. \n(Re the starting theme of the whole debate namely the CRYPTIC HAND GESTURE forming an Epsilon with tail in conjunction with Christ head to be read as VISUAL PUN on BOTH the ‘horned hand’ and the Shroud face tailed-Epsilon-like shaped blood mark,) Whether done with the RIGHT or LEFT hand within the context of an execution, the specific hand gesture can symbolize either Fair Retribution/Good Justice from G.od or Kings (see RIGHT hand gesture e.g. in Le Livre des Merveilles by Marco Polo, Ms. Fr. 2810, Bibliothèque nationale de France, miniature of King Chesumur Rendering Good Justice, fol. 19v) or Persecution/Perverted Justice from Men (see LEFT hand gesture e.g., in the Stuggart Psalter, miniatures of both the flogging of Christ and the Second Beating of Christ, Stuggart Psalter fol. [149]-73r).  In each miniature the hand gesture symbolizing the Sign of Good Justice (or Victory over Evil/Sin) or on the contrary Perverted Justice (or Victory over Good/Righteousness) is EVIDENT as far as a Medieval Art History or Iconographic Analysis and/or Cryptanalysis is concerned. Just ask any Medieval Art Historian worth his salt, they ALL but can confirm my reading. \n(To be continued)\n\n","date":"October 31, 2013 at 10:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/stephen-jones-on-the-stuttgart-psalter/","cat":"flagrum","id":"comment-49324","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Stephen Jones on the Stuttgart Psalter","post":"Just a side note observation of the devil’s horns hand gesture. It is indeed an ancient sign but interestingly enough it was reintroduced into modern usage by the late Ronnie James Dio, heavy metal singer of Black Sabbath and Dio. He drew on his childhood experience of his grandmother using the sign. Contrary to what many critics of heavy metal have assumed, Dio used the symbol as his grandmother had – as a symbol of warding off evil and not to curse. Though he was agnostic at best, Dio was fascinated by mythology and hidden symbolism.

Max Patrick Hamon (sse above), whose work I have a lot of respect for although we drive each other up the wall sometimes, has had a go at the one with the two middle fingers clenched, suggesting either evil horns or victory horns according to which hand is doing it and where it is pointing, but there are several others, including that spidery pair of scissors to which I think you are referring.\nI’m glad you found us.
