The simple fact that the bloodstains on the Shroud show a much brighter and redder color when the cloth is displayed in sunlight is a strong indicator that Adler’s hypothesis versus the very high level of bilirubin in these stains is probably correct.  But, as you asked in your question, what has not been answered yet is how an unstable compound like bilirubin have been well preserved for so long?  And in my mind, I really think there should be not a single one, but a series of factors that can explain this preservation…  I seriously doubt that it is due to one single factor.  Just my guess of course.\n\n","date":"June 4, 2013 at 10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36060","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"Dr. Alan Adler is deceased; therefore, it would be wiser to direct your questions on blood and hemoglobin to Professor Albert Zink, who has found the oldest blood in Otzi the Iceman, (5300 year old mummy) to be *real* blood. \nZink used a new procedure to verify Otzi’s blood and perhaps this test or something similar could be performed on the Shroud of Turin blood.  Here is an excerpt from the link below:\n“Feeling for blood\nZink and his colleagues took tissue samples from Ötzi’s arrow wound and from an earlier wound on the mummy’s hand. Using a light microscope, they identified round objects that looked a bit like red blood cells, Zink said. But to be sure, the researchers needed more advanced technology.\nThey turned to a device called an atomic force microscope, which works by “feeling” rather than “seeing” an object. The minuscule probe, itself invisible to the naked eye, runs over the object like a needle on a record player. As the probe bumps up and down along the object’s contours, a laser measures the movement. The result is a three-dimensional “tracing” of the object.\nIn the case of the mysterious Ötzi contents, an exciting picture emerged: The roundish shapes were indeed red blood cells.”\nRead more: http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/05/02/iceman-mummy-holds-world-oldest-blood-cells/#ixzz2VTszq6WH\nFound this information on Professor Albert Zink\nProf. Albert Zink\nTel: +39 0471 055 561\nFax: +39 0471 055 579\neMail\nMain fields of activity\n– biological and biomolecular anthropology\n– nanotechnologies\n– paleopathology\n– paleoepidemiology\n– forensic studies\nhttp://www.eurac.edu/staff/azink/default.html\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 6, 2013 at 7:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36326","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"Yes, it is a great discovery.

When iron is deoxygenated, Iron (II) the blood appears as a dark red color.  When blood hemoglobin is oxygen rich, Iron (III) the blood is then seen as bright red in color.  Now, there may be a difference with aged-blood, such as Otzi’s or the TS blood, or the way it was preserved over time.\nPerhaps, and this is only an opinion, the Shroud was kept in a sealed casket for decades, and then when it was taken out for public viewing, and exposed to air, the color became a brighter red. I don’t believe the Otzi mummy was placed in a vacuum-type environment, but he was preserved in ice.   \nAnother thought came to mind.  When red blood cells are placed in fresh water, they burst, so I would wonder, since the Shroud was exposed to a flood, would the red blood cells still be intact? Carbon dioxide and Carbon monoxide, as well, have an effect on blood cells.  A Porphrin chemist would be able to expand on the topic.\nWith respect to the new method, even if it isn’t scientifically accurate, Professor Zink may, at least, be able to resolve the problem of the Shroud blood being actual human blood, rather than a painter’s dye.\nThe Shroud scientists will have to research the subject.\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 7, 2013 at 3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36392","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"Angel,\nred blood cells burst ( hemolysis)under other conditions as well – there were plenty while thee Man of the Shroud was still alive and there are also a lot after death\n\n","date":"June 7, 2013 at 6:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36402","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"Interesting!   \nYes, more than likely anemia (blood loss), as a result of severe stress, would also have contributed to the hemolytic episode experienced by Jesus, the man on the shroud.\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 8, 2013 at 12:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36417","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"\nAngel :\nInteresting!   \nYes, more than likely anemia (blood loss), as a result of severe stress, would also have contributed to the hemolytic episode experienced by Jesus, the man on the shroud.\nBest,\n\nHis hemolysis was mostly stress-related, IMHO and there also was rhabdomyolysis – because of the stress and severe dehydration.

What specific genetic\ndisease is associated with that marker? \n As far\nas I remember the bits and peices of DNA were so fragmented that\nthere was no possibility to draw ANT conclusions fro that. XXY is\nKleinfelter syndrome. While there is always a possibility in\nsomeone who never had children of their own that such a male has\nKleinfelter’s ( unless they are unusually short), there is no\nreason except the fantasy of a filmmaker to think Jesus Christ had\nthat particular syndrome. Taking into consideration that by Gospels\nHe did not have the source where the Y will come from, it is highly\nunlikely He was genotypically XXY or even XY If one\nremebers the birth history of Jesus, one must conclude that His\ngenotype will be that of XX even without a SRY gene – this has been\ndescribed:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16556678 \n Angel\n: While it is probable Methemaglobin was the result\nof trauma and stress, we are not certain Jesus was deficient in\nproducing the diaphorase enzyme, nor if Jesus had an abnormal\nhemoglobin variant (Hemoglobin M).

In other words, the person would have lost so much blood he would go into shock. The results of this would be\n1) The heart would race to pump blood that was not there.\n2) The victim would collapse or faint due to low blood pressure.\n3) The kidneys would shut down to preserve body fluids.\n4) The person would experience extreme thirst as the body desired to replenish lost fluids.\nThere is evidence from Scripture that Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock as a result of being flogged. As Jesus carried His own cross to Golgotha (John 19:17), He collapsed, and a man named Simon was forced to either carry the cross or help Jesus carry the cross the rest of way to the hill (Matthew 27:32–33; Mark 15:21–22; Luke 23:26). This collapse indicates Jesus had low blood pressure. Another indicator that Jesus suffered from hypovolemic shock was that He declared He was thirsty as He hung on the cross (John 19:28), indicating His body’s desire to replenish fluids.\nPrior to death, the sustained rapid heartbeat caused by hypovolemic shock also causes fluid to gather in the sack around the heart and around the lungs. This gathering of fluid in the membrane around the heart is called pericardial effusion, and the fluid gathering around the lungs is called pleural effusion. This explains why, after Jesus died and a Roman soldier thrust a spear through Jesus’ side (probably His right side, piercing both the lungs and the heart), blood and water came from His side just as John recorded in his Gospel (John 19:34).\nhttp://www.gotquestions.org/blood-water-Jesus.html\nAnd below is an excerpt on the subject of the blood and water.\n“One view concerns the pericardium, the sac which surrounds the heart, and which contains a small amount of watery fluid. When the body undergoes great stress, as crucifixion would certainly entail, the amount of fluid increases and the sac expands. The Roman lance would then have passed through Jesus’ pericardium and into the right side of his heart, which is filled with blood even after death. As the lance was withdrawn, it would draw out the blood from the heart and the watery fluid from the expanded pericardium.”\nAnd there is a second view is as follows;\n“Anthony Sava, an American physician, has a different explanation for the water flow. He believes that the severe scourging caused internal hemorrhaging in Jesus’ chest, and the pleural cavity filled with blood. The blood settled on the bottom of the chest cavity while a clear liquid was left on top. Sava says that the Roman lance entered the chest and, upon being withdrawn, released the blood and the water from the chest.” \nEither of the two views gave the conclusion:\nThe explanations for the blood and water flow are closely related at several points. All physicians who have examined the question agree that Jesus was already dead when the chest wound was inflicted. The blood and water most probably flowed from both the heart and the chest cavity. \nhttp://www.godonthe.net/evidence/forensic.htm \nBest,\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 5:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36883","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"there was no blunt trauma to the liver or any other internal organs to cause internal bleeding.\nYou keep inventing nonsense to prove what exactly?\neven massive blood loss will not release NO in a such amount that it will cause methemoglobinemia – it is impossible.\nread about free radicals a bit before producing fantasies.\nBest :-)\n\n","date":"June 12, 2013 at 11:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36828","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"jesterof, your comments indicate you may also be of the opinion prisoners who are beaten with a rubber hose, do not experience internal bleeding.\nI disagree with your assessment, but that doesn’t mean I do not respect your opinion.\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 5:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36884","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"jesterof, not fantasy, but reality.\nAs I mentioned, nitrites and nitrates are found in soil and contaminated drinking water, which was common in ancient Jerusalem.\nSoil Properties Affecting Formation of Nitric Oxide by Chemical Reactions of Nitrite\nA.

He had pulmonary edema. Pericardial effusion has nothing to do with it.\n\n“Those who were flogged would often go into hypovolemic shock, a term that refers to low blood volume. In other words, the person would have lost so much blood he would go into shock. The results of this would be\n1) The heart would race to pump blood that was not there.\n2) The victim would collapse or faint due to low blood pressure.\n3) The kidneys would shut down to preserve body fluids.\n4) The person would experience extreme thirst as the body desired to replenish lost fluids.\n\nHe did not loose much blood. He was in shock – but not because of the blood loss but becasue of pain, severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysis\nyour results as 1,2,3, can cause a smile, because those are just bites of what is going on in a human body in the shock conditions. They are not incorrect, they are simply just some of. And one might be tachycardica and hypertensive prior to becoming bradycardic ad hypotensive  –  or another combination of parameters – depending on a time frame.\nSince Jesus did not loose blood massively adn severe dehydration does not egual severe hemorrhage, the last terminal stage of shock ( hypotension,bradycardia and death) would not develop in a 12 hour time frame.\n\nThere is evidence from Scripture that Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock as a result of being flogged.\n\nNo there is no such evidence becasue He did not have hypovolemic shock hwile carrying the croos to Gogotha – he was in a pain shock and was developing severe dehydration, but this was still not hypovolemic shock.\nHe fell down not because of the hypotension ( if that would be the case, He would not get up) but because of lot of trauma after scourging and the heaviness of the cross – that was too much.\n\n Another indicator that Jesus suffered from hypovolemic shock was that He declared He was thirsty as He hung on the cross (John 19:28), indicating His body’s desire to replenish fluids.\n\nwhich not a proof of hypovolemic SHOCK just a proof of hypovolemia as a result of dehydration. One does not have to be in shock and still be hypovolemic. As I stated above – if His fall would be from hypotension  as a late stage of shock ( which is usually seen quickly only upon severe hemorrhage, not dehydration – that is more prolonged) He would not be able to get up and would have died there – o the road.\nPrior to death, the sustained rapid heartbeat caused by hypovolemic shock also causes fluid to gather in the sack around the heart and around the lungs.\nI can guarantee you He was having tachycardia from the agony in Gethsemane.\nAnd rapid heartbeat does not cause fluid to gather in the pericardium or around the lungs. Not even in a week time frame, and we are talking here hours – that is not enough time for pleural effusion or pericardial effusion to accumulate. This gathering of fluid in the membrane around the heart is called pericardial effusion, and the fluid gathering around the lungs is called pleural effusion. This explains why, after Jesus died and a Roman soldier thrust a spear through Jesus’ side (probably His right side, piercing both the lungs and the heart), blood and water came from His side just as John recorded in his Gospel (John 19:34).\n\nNo it does not explain it – because there is no way enough fluid will accumulate in the pericardium or pleural space in less than 12 hours we have, unless the fluid is blood as a result of mechanical trauma ( which is not the case)\nInterstitial fluid from the lungs is a result of pulmonary edema which was one of the causes of death and which developed already after crucifixion – and pulmonary edema is a result of acute heart failure with literally flooding of the lungs with interstitial fluid \n\nThe explanations for the blood and water flow are closely related at several points. All physicians who have examined the question agree that Jesus was already dead when the chest wound was inflicted. The blood and water most probably flowed from both the heart and the chest cavity.\n\nThat is true, but blood is ALWAYS in the heart, which when pierced will give the flow of the blood and it is also always in the lungs – lungs are filled with blood, because they are the filter for it, so to say, so piercing of the lungs will cause blood flow as well – no need to additional accumulation of blood anywhere. Fluid is a result of the pulmonary edema, which was a process preceding death and basically the cause of such a rapid death\n\n","date":"June 14, 2013 at 9:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-37029","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"\nAngel :\nI just saw a paragraph attached to an article on Kleinfelter (Kleinfelter’s) where it was stated it would be interesting to test Lincoln for Kleinfelter’s, since he was tall and lanky.

Why is it not possible to test the Shroud blood for the S antigen?  Wouldn’t this determine the Shroud blood was, in fact, human blood?\nSiemens offers a test for the S antigen.\nhttp://healthcare.siemens.com/news-and-events/news/healthcare-news-2012-08-29-1\nI’ve read D’Adamo’s papers on ABO blood and initially he stated AB blood was first introduced in 700 AD. \nI often wonder if knowing the Sudarium of Oviedo had C-14 dated to 700 AD and was found to contain AB blood type, if this was the reason D’Adamo stated the oldest AB blood was found to be 700 AD.\nAs well, I’ve seen type “A” blood was found in ancient Egyptian mummies, and why Egyptians state, this find proves they are/were Caucasian, but have not seen type AB found in Egyptians.  Is there a paper that details which Egyptian mummy had type AB blood?\nLastly, if the Shroud is found to date from the first century, then Jesus was responsible for introducing type AB blood, unless AB was found in one of the Egyptian mummies.  Otzi the iceman had type “O” blood.\nYes, I’m honored to have met Dr. Adler.

I missed the Ballone (MNS) line.  When I returned to the internet to finish reading the article, I picked up at King Tut, missing the Ballone line (MNS).\nRon Wyatt stated the blood he found beneath the cross hole, possibly the same blood as that of the shroud, was dried and black in color.  This would have been aged, oxidized blood.  He mentioned it was tested in a lab in Israel, but did not state the name of the lab..  \nAll Ron’s US chemical testings, specifically analyzing for sulfur in the sulfur balls that God rained down on Sodom and Gomorrah, were done by Galbraith Laboratories in Knoxville, TN.  \nGalbraith is a very reputable lab for Carbon, Hydrogen and Nitrogen (CHN) analysis.

His satellite photographs have been superseded by Google Earth’s extremely detailed aerial photographs which show no sign of his city streets. The geology of the entire area has been extensively studied and none of it demonstrates any extreme volcanic activity (although a fair amount of seismic activity is clear). His chemistry, suggesting that the deposits of limestone and gypsum are the products of vulcanicity rather than aquatic deposition, is eccentric in the extreme. All his photos of “crystals of sulphur” are actually “desert roses” of gypsum. Pure sulphur balls are not exclusive to the Dead Sea but relatively common in similar conditions across the globe and may be caused either microbiologically or due (more likely in this case) to the reduction of gypsum by hydrocarbons. They are not direct evidence for, let alone proof of, the existence of God. For further details you could try Googling Lake Lisan Geology, or the name of the scientist who went out to check Ron Wyatt’s claims, Elizabeth H. Gierlowski-Kordesch.\n\n","date":"June 17, 2013 at 6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-37236","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"Don’t know about Sodom and Gomorrah, but a claim about “blood of Christ” in the hole from the Cross is priceless.\nHowever I did not find anything about that in his site – but Angel claims his discovery is real :-)\n\n","date":"June 17, 2013 at 6:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-37239","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse","post":"There are different ways of interpreting the Bible by avoiding both extremes, fundamentalism and allegorical reading.

Scientists and historian have not “ignored” Jacobivici, not did they “dismiss” Wyatt in the same way. The claims of both these men were examined closely, and simply did not live up to the interpretation put upon them. The claims were therefore rejected. No doubt if more convincing evidence were adduced, that too would be examined carefully, with the possibility of accepting the claims after all.\nIt is all to common for people with extreme ideas to declare that their views have been completely ignored, when in fact they have been carefully assessed, and found wanting.\n\n","date":"June 18, 2013 at 4:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-37278","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"}]
