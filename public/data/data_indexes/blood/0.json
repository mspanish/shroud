Is he disagreeing with this statement? It refers to:\n– “no signs of putrefaction of the dead body” which could be explained by the disappearance of the body before putrefaction set in, which fits the Gospel accounts of the Resurrection within 40 hours or so.\n– “the dumbbell-shaped scourge marks on both halves of the Shroud are not smeared.” If one were to accept that the body left the inside of the Shroud while the blood-stains were still damp (not something I go along with personally), then it could be thought miraculous that they were not smeared, which fits in with the miracle of the resurrection referred to in the Gospels. \nOn its own merits the concluding sentence of the abstract is perfectly reasonable, although the Resurrection is not mentioned anywhere else in the paper, which devotes itself mostly to explaining the pink colour of the bloodstains.\n\n","date":"September 23, 2014 at 5:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/23/a-bold-conclusion-the-blood-the-image-the-man/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-154466","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Bold Conclusion:  the Blood, the Image, the Man","post":"I’m not quite sure what Hugh is saying: are you disagreeing with her statement?

Hyperfibrinolysis describes a situation with markedly enhanced fibrinolytic activity, resulting in increased, sometimes catastrophic bleeding. Hyperfibrinolysis can be caused by acquired or congenital reasons. Among the congenital conditions for hyperfibrinolysis, deficiency of alpha-2-antiplasmin… etc.,  etc., etc.\n>Bleeding is caused by the generation of fibrinogen degradation products which interfere with regular fibrin polymerization and inhibit platelet aggregation. Moreover, plasmin which is formed in excess in hyperfibrinolysis can proteolytically activate or inactivate many plasmatic or cellular proteins involved in hemostasis. Especially the degradation of fibrinogen, an essential protein for platelet aggregation and clot stability, may be a major cause for clinical bleeding … etc., etc, etc. …\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfibrinolysis\nBut the problem is that we were talking about a body of a deceased person …\nunless you want to consider the alternative of living body! And this idea of the living body, in my opinion, is not credible … unless of having to postulate a “resumption of life” (ie the Resurrection!), which is a religious event outside of the normal routine of scientific inquiry…\nPlease, excuse me for that convolution/clumsiness of this talk about a medical term…\n\n","date":"September 24, 2014 at 5:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/23/a-bold-conclusion-the-blood-the-image-the-man/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-154858","author":"Piero","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Bold Conclusion:  the Blood, the Image, the Man","post":"Reblogged this on Best of Shroud Story.\n\n","date":"December 5, 2014 at 3:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/23/a-bold-conclusion-the-blood-the-image-the-man/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-174725","author":"Dan","site":"shroudstory"}]
