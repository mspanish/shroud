Thus far no one has been able to do so. How about trying to find whose likeness truly is on the cloth? \nThe Shroud is real. It is not a fake. The proof is that it can be seen and it has been seen by millions. The question is whose image is imprinted on the cloth?. Does it necessarily need to be Jesus because he is the most acclaimed person to have been crucified? MAny other people were tortured and crucified.  Who else has been crucified? Who else was tortured and crucified and dressed with a crown of thorns? We know the approximate time period the cloth was made (1310-1340 and from where it emanates (Palestine). How could such a cloth have survived 2000 years?\nSome answers: First the cloth is probably not 2000 years old. It is probably more like 700 years old. The Templars were also known as heretics like Jesus was. They had brought back numerous objects and artifacts from Palestine including cloth and clothing. Many of them were burned at the stake. The most renowned was Jacques de Molay the leader of the Templars. He too was tortured in the same fashion Jesus was and he was crucified. This took place in France where the Shroud was first discovered not long after the death of de Molay. The markings on the cloth were made by blood, sweat and acids the body produces when it is in extreme agony.\nPS: Even the Catholic religion does not claim the Shroud to be “an original” as in the true image of Jesus.\n\n","date":"December 25, 2012 at 5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-21103","author":"Jean L Genibrel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"Jean wrote: The question is whose image is imprinted on the cloth?\nMy answer:  In my paper, I don’t say anything else dear Jean !!!!  I described 4 different possible scenarios that are, I believe, the only 4 that can still rationaly explain the Shroud and 2 of them didn’t imply that the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth… \nBut concerning the idea that the Shroud can really be only 700 years old, this if almost impossible for numerous reasons that concern principally some very particular features related to the ancient technique of making linen cloths.

And acting like that, the Church prove that she is bright.  I’m sure you have noticed how Pius XI had 2 different languages when he was talking about the Shroud personally and as the Pope ?  This is a very good example of how it goes for many people inside the Church, and I think it’s the right way to act.  Imagine one second if the actual Pope would declare the Shroud to be genuine and then, 10 years from now, some scientist could prove without any doubt that the cloth is not the one of Jesus !  That would be a disaster for the credibility of the Church and that’s the main reason why the Vatican will never claim something else than what science can conclude about the Shroud.  \nAnd right now, science is able to conclude that 1- The Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man who suffered the same exact tortures than Jesus of Nazareth, as reported by the Gospel.  And 2- The body image on the Shroud come from an interaction between the cloth and the corpse it covered.  That’s all what science can claim for the moment about the Shroud (without any reasonnable doubt) and that’s all the Church can also proclaim (for the moment of course).  And the outcome of these 2 very solid conclusions is the fact that, in front of the Shroud, we are only left with the 4 scenarios I described in my paper (and nothing else).  So, make your bets people !!!  Which one of the 4 do you think it is ???  I say that correctly because right now, there is no certainties on that questions.  On the contrary, there’s only probabilities.  That’s why I think the Occam’s rasor principle is so important if we want to analyze these 4 scenarios honestly !!!\n\n","date":"July 29, 2012 at 4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-14307","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"My congratulations to Yannick for an excellent paper.  One particular aspect I liked about this particular paper of Yannick’s, is that It is self-disciplined withour excursions into speculation on theories which I know are close to his heart, but wisely he has refrained from including them and just given facts, and the consequential reasoning to logical conclusions,  \nI would make two observations of a semi-technical nature: \n1)  Identity of the victim:  There were thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of victims executed by the barbaric punishment of crucifixon.  So identifying the actual victim, “Whose image is on the Shroud?” is a fair and reasonable question.  However, capping or crowning with thorns was never a normal part of Roman crucifixion.  In the case of Jesus, it was a spontaneous act carried out on the whim of a Roman soldier, perhaps on sighting some thorn branches gathered for firewood, and to mock the claim that he was KING of the Jews.  “They dressed him up in purple, twisted some thorns into a crown and put it on him; and they began saluting him ‘Hail, King of the Jews!’ They struck his head with a reed and spat on him; and they went down on their knees to do him homage.” (Mark 15: 16-19).  The crowning (capping) of thorns then is clearly seen as being solely part of the mockery as King of the Jews. and UNIQUELY identifies the Shroud man as Jesus Christ.  It is just too long a shot to assert that someone else was similarly capped and that it may have been some other victim.  Even the Jesuit sceptic Herbert Thurston was obliged to admit in 1903: “If this is not the impression of the Christ, it was designed as the counterfeit of that impression.  In no other person since the world began could these details be verified.”  \n2) Option 4: “In any way, a “dematerialization” of his body at the moment of the resurrection (accompanied or not by a burst of energy) could explain why the body left the Shroud before it started to corrupt,”\nThere is a physics problem with the literal notion of “dematerialisation”.  As recently stated on a previous blog, dematerialisation would result in too great a burst of energy as matter would then be converted into radiation, someone estimating that it would be equal to a 10 GT nuclear explosion, which clearly didn’t happen.  I prefer an explanation that envisages resurrection of the body as some kind of supernatural transformation – St Paul and theologians explain it as a “glorified body”.  One explanation I offered was that the body entered some kind of parallel universe.  In other words somewhere in all of creation, there is still a resurrected body of the Christ.\n\n","date":"July 28, 2012 at 7:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-14284","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"Thanks for your comment Daveb !\nFor the first point your raised, I invite you to read (again) the footnote #15 in my paper because it talks exactly about this specific question of the identity of the man of the Shroud.\nAnd concerning the 4th scenario, when I think about a “dematerialization” of the body of Christ (by the way, as I said in my article, this metaphysical concept is not necessarily inconsistent also with the scenario #3), I really don’t understand why there should be a burst of light or a burst of energy of another kind !  The way I personally understand this concept (that goes way beyond our material understanding of the Universe), it is more of a disappearing of the material body of Christ from our material world (space-time) that went directly, instantaneously and without leaving any material traces into the Spiritual world (which is a completely different reality than ours here on Earth).  And I really don’t think this line of thinking isn’t at all against the “glorified body” image used by St. Paul.\nFor me, the body of Christ is now Spiritual and that’s why we don’t see him with out material eyes (with the exception of some mystics over the years to whom Jesus WANTED to be visible, just like it happened for the disciples after the resurrection) !!!  \nThat’s only how I personally see the concept of the resurrection of Christ and, of course, you’re totally free to see it otherwise.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2012 at 6:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-14314","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"¡Congratulations, Yannick!\nDaveb, es una “desmaterialización-rematerialización”, probablemente instantánea en el tiempo que eludiría el “burst” de energía…….\n\n","date":"July 28, 2012 at 9:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-14285","author":"corneliotel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"Thank you very much !!!

You buy it online here : http://holyshroudguild.org/orphaned-manuscript.html\nIn it, you’ll find a very good description of Adler’s work and analyses concerning the blood and the serum stains.  To answer your question, Adler was able to show that when the blood and even the serum stains were removed from the surface of a fiber coming from the body image area (with the help of strong reducing chemical agents), it left a nice fiber free of any body image coloration, showing that the most probable explanation for this observation was that the blood and serum stained the cloth first and only after that, the body image formation begins to be active and this coloring process (I should say oxydizing and/or dehydrating process) was completely blocked by these biological stains on the fibers.  When we consider the profesionnalism of Adler concerning the question of the blood on the Shroud, it’s pretty easy to think that this conclusion is solid (scientifically speaking), but it’s sure that it would be a very good thing if another independent researcher could do the same kind of analysis and come up with the same result…\n\n","date":"July 29, 2012 at 4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-14310","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"I also want to say 2 observations about this discovery made by Adler concerning the absence of a body image coloration under the blood and serum stains :\n1- As Ray Rogers said, this observation is one good indicator of a mild process that is responsible for the image formation on the Shroud (because even a very thin layer of serum seem to have been enough to prevent any image formation on the cloth).\n2- The fact that Adler found a clean linen fiber free of any body image color after the used of a strong reducing chemical agent to remove the blood and serum on the fiber remembered me of the fact that the same Adler also found a clean linen fiber free of any body image color after the used of a strong reducing chemical agent (the diimide is the most known but there’s a few other agents capable of a similar result) to remove the body image color on the fiber.  My personal feeling about this similarity in the results obstained by Adler is this :  I think this point toward the fact that both the blood and serum stains AND the body image on the Shroud are “coating” substances that rest OVER the linen fibers and that has no direct effect on the linen fiber itself (including the primary cell wall).  In the case of the blood and serum stains, the coating is biological (no doubt about that) and it affected the fibers all over the cloth (whether it be a top-most fiber or a fiber present deep inside the cloth), and in the case of the body image, the coating is made of carbohydrates impurities (if we believe Rogers opinion) that have been deposited only on the top-most fibers of the cloth during his manufacture (with probably a very ancient method of making linen cloths).\nReflect upon that folks !!!

But anyway, the sweat itself (without blood in it, just normal sweat) has been proven by Pellicori of STURP to produce a coloration on a linen cloth that is very close to the body image on the Shroud.

Thanks for your comment !  \nConcerning your comment about the quote of mine, I’m not aware of any recent lab experiments either that would have been made to analyze this most intriguing aspect of the bloodstains on the Shroud.  I know Vignon made extensive tests of blood transfer during the first half of the 20th century and never was able to reproduce this aspect of the stains.  I’m also aware of another experiment done during the 80s by Gilbert Lavoie concerning the question of the transfer of the blood from the body to the cloth, but his purpose was not to analyze this particular and bizarre aspect of the bloodstains but to see the maximum range of time that was available after the cloting of blood on the skin in order to produce a good quality of stain on a linen cloth.  Depending on many conditions and factors, Lavoie came to the conclusion that the maximum rang was no more than 2 hours and most probably 1 hour in normal condition.  To me, this is a very good clue that the bloodstains on the Shroud were transferred on the cloth by a re-humidification of their surface instead of being transferred before they were completely dry, because in all logic, if this is really the Shroud of Jesus, we know that the body was probably not put in the Shroud before 2 or more hours after death (we can estimate this easily from the Gospel accounts and also, if the Sudarium was really in contact with the same head, we know that this cloth was in contact with the head during 2 hours or so before being removed for the deposit of the body in the Shroud).  If my estimation about that is good, that would mean that Pierre Barbet’s hypothesis of a re-humidification of the blood clots once the body was trapped INSIDE the Shroud is also correct.\nAnd concerning your comment about the quote from Matt, I should say that I don’t remember any experiment done by Adler, Baima Bollone or other experts that would have been done to “scrapped away” the bloodstains on small samples.  Can you give me the reference of this experiment ?  Does it come from the book of Adler or elsewhere ?  Adler said that someone on the STURP team (I think it was Pellicori) used very delicately a probing needle while in Turin in order to see if there was some material (blood of body image or something else) trapped inside the weave of the cloth and inside the threads in order to determine if there was clear signs of fibers cemented together and/or signs of capillarity and/or signs of abrasion, but I’m not sure at all (in fact, I don’t think so) if that’s what you mean.  For the record, with this on-site experiment, the STURP team was able to determine that these signs were only present for the “blood” material and not for the body image coloration, which clearly show that these 2 features on the Shroud are very different in nature.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2012 at 5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-14313","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"Ok.

I think sincerely that it is the best one I ever wrote concerning the Shroud.  I think anybody that is interested by the subject should read it to know (or to remember again) the real hard facts concerning the relic (especially the blood and serum stains)and where those facts leads us…  There’s so much misinformation and incorrect things that have been said in the secular media (and even in the Shroud world) about the reality of the Shroud that a paper like that has definately is place.  I’m sure about that.\n\n","date":"August 1, 2012 at 10:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-14385","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper","post":"Yannick,\nAs I know you to be a French native speaker, I have read your French version.
