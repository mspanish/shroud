Concerning this last and important point, you must remember, as Barbet told us in his book, that a dead body can emit water vapor a long time after death…\nSo, honestly Max, I really think you misjudge the expertise of Adler and Barbet when it come to recognize what is a bloodstained that come from exudates of humid blood clots…\n\n","date":"May 29, 2013 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35203","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Methinks Yannick you totally missed my point.

They are carmin, a little bit mauve.  More or less intense and dark depending of the wounds…”\nI think this particular quote proves that Barbet was well aware of the fact that the blood on the Shroud showed a somewhat unusual color (particularly in daylight or under another source of UV light) but, at the same time, this particular color did not seemed to have bothered him at all when he saw it in sunlight in Turin and immediately conclude that these stains could not have been made by anything else than real blood!  I think this is enough to conclude that, for Barbet, this particular color (when the blood is seen in sunlight or under another form of UV lighting) did not represented any problem at all regarding the question of the authenticity of the blood on the Shroud, which seems to indicate that he probably had a perfectly natural explanation for it.  Effectively, even though he was a real devout Catholic and he cleverly noted that the bloodstains and the body image do not seemed to have been disturbed by the extraction of the body before he could decay inside the cloth (which he saw as a great sign of the Resurrection on the Shroud), Barbet always thought that the bloodstains and the body image had been formed on the cloth by totally natural mechanisms… So, concerning the “special coloration” (Barbet’s words) of the blood, what was the natural explanation of Barbet?  No one knows since he never, as I known, talked publicly about that.  But one thing’s for sure: The simple fact that he didn’t talked about that in his writings is a good clue that this color never was an issue for him.  Or else, it is evident that he would have described the problem in his book and, knowing Barbet, he would have tried to give it a proper scientific explanation.  \nPersonally, I think the most rational explanation for this carmin mauve (other authors said carmin red) color of the blood (when it is seen in sunlight or under another form of UV lighting) remains the one described by Alan Alder concerning the presence of a level of bilirubin much higher than normal in the traumatised blood of the Shroud man, because, as jesterof told us recently on this blog, it is a proven fact that bilirubin in blood act like a “brightening agent” when it is put under sunlight or another source of UV light.  Note that if this explanation for the color of the blood is the correct one, it fits perfectly in the context of the Shroud of Turin, which is the real burial cloth of a highly traumatized and crucified man (note: this is the main scientific conclusion of the STURP team)…\n\n","date":"May 29, 2013 at 8:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35202","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Yannick,\nNice post, nice summary-enjoyed reading this\n\n","date":"May 29, 2013 at 8:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35206","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Thank you Mr. Kearse!\nMy goal was only to set the record straight versus what matter the most versus the blood issue.

This either means that as a ‘brightening agent’ bilirubin is not present, or that bilirubin, if present, is not a ‘brightening agent.’\nBarbet, Yannick’s blood expert, immediately identified the bloodstains as blood, but of a very special colour. This suggests that although the colour was not distinctive enough to outweigh the other evidence leading to a conclusion of blood, it was not ‘normal.’ This may have been because centuries old blood doesn’t look like the ‘normal’ blood he was used to, or that the blood has had something else added to it. Barbet, I am sure, had he been pressed to say what the cause was of the distinctive colour, would have been happy with a vague hope that under some circumstances blood can stay red for longer than ‘normal.’ Subsequent investigation has yet to demonstrate that that is the case for blood which is hundreds of years old.\n\n","date":"May 29, 2013 at 10:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35222","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Kelly and Jesterof, I appreciate the interest and dedication both of you have shown in studying the characteristics of the Shroud, however allow me to make a suggestion.

Unfortunately the idea of the Shroud being one reason for the belief in Jesus’ resurrection circulating among the first disciples arose in the realm of Shroud studies and the art historian went even further by claiming that it was displayed in the Temple! It only demonstrates absolute ignorance about Jewish customs, particularly during that period, and you can sure that Josephus would have something to say about that and we would know that it was not only James the Just but many others were  thrown down from that building’s high walls.

And on this question, I think that this can be due to a combination of many biological factors, like these: 1- the fact that these stains are dry. 2- the fact that they were made of exudates of blood clots instead of whole blood. 3- the historical fact that the Shroud has almost always been kept in some kinds of containers, which prevent the stains to be exposed to open-air and sunlight, which could have seriously degraded the bilirubin over time.\n\n","date":"May 31, 2013 at 10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35455","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"It is your personal assimption.

So, can we agree to say that these stains are much redder than normal under the sun and still a bit redder than normal when they are seen away from sunlight?  And also, can we agree that the way these bloodstains changes color under the sun can well be due to the presence of a very high level of bilirubin in the blood that was able to be preserved until now because of an unknown factor (or factors)?

It kept me wondering how many of these you smoke every day, whether you are like Churchill or John Kennedy, but my guess is that you are like your countryman,the great statesman, when it comes to smoking.\nIt is always good to also read some Shroud history and Wesselow has written a good book arguing why the image can not be a painting, exception taken when he comes to reconstructing New Testament history. Unfortunately the idea of the Shroud being one reason for the belief in Jesus’ resurrection circulating among the first disciples arose in the realm of Shroud studies and the art historian went even further by claiming that it was displayed in the Temple! It only demonstrates absolute ignorance about Jewish customs, particularly during that period, and you can sure that Josephus would have something to say about that and we would know that it was not only James the Just but many others were  thrown down from that building’s high walls.

CO associated with hemoglobin maintains a red color-this is one of the indicators of CO poisoning. CO-containing blood can stay red for over a year if teh tube remains covered (see below comment)\nThe spectra data of Adler suggests primarily methemoglobin (deoxygenated hemoglobin) although he does mention that other species may exist-carboxyhemoglobin has a different absorbance than methemoglobin and doesn’t appear to be there to any major extent, although I am by no means very experienced with spectroscopy. Also, in communicating with those who study hemoglobin binding, they estimate that even though CO binding has a much higher affinity than oxygen, such blood would exchange out within a few days at the most when exposed to the atmosphere.\nAlthough not mentioned by Bollone, CO binding to the free heme group (separated from the hemoglobin polypeptide) has an affinity 20,000x greater than oxygen-it is unknown by me (or several whom I have contacted) if this is superglued in or given in would exchange as well. I do not know, but believe it is not permanently affixed. There would also be the problem of just how many hemoglobin molecules/heme groups would have to be saturated to result in an overall reddish appearance of the blood relative to oxidized species. Just a thought.\nRelated to this, I had also considered that a functional group on the cloth may interact with the porphyrin ring, a CO group, such as a carbonyl group, which are prevalent in carbohydrates (glycan coating as a result of Saponaria), but the structural biologists tell me the electron imprint would appear much different to the hemoglobin molecule than carbon monoxide.

Reminder: the Hebrew word taharah means “purification” in terms of “dressing/wrapping in shrouds”, “washing”, “drying” and “anointing” as core procedures. \nReminder in the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s:  Because the women had to abide by the Halakha (Judean religious law), anointing was not performed though as they were not allowed to grind solid/granulised spices to make spicy oily perfumes after sunset on Sabbath (even had the grinding been initiated before sunset). Hence Yeshua’s body was not anointed on his burial.\nBecause the TS man’s shed innocent blood was to be buried with his body, the latter was not washed as carefully as a non bloodied corpse, thus implying the very long burial (inner) sheet (known today as the TS) could have been used as part and parcel of the speedy purifying and drying ritual to save time and funeral items.\nThe only snag here is no matter how talented the forensic medical examiners are/were (from Bucklin to Zugibe or Baima-Bollone or Cameron), they are neither palaeopathologists nor forensic archaeologists familiar with ancient Judean funerary customs, practices and rites or archaeological bloodstained pattern analysts and just could not reach a consensus when it came to the “washing or no washing issue”. Besides they were only working from  lifesize Turin Shroud negative/positive photographs not from a real corpse.\nIn the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s, both archaeologically and forensically speaking, it is most likely though the body was speedily but ritually “purified” and dried out in a most specific way (that of the Second Temple period Judeans) so as to bury “the shed (innocent) blood” with the corpse and abide by the Halakha. \nIn order to achieve this and “purify” flies’s eggs/larvae, dust, dirt, blood and other body fluids, the Judean buriers could have soaked the long (inner) burial linen sheet in an alkaline solution.\nOn March 16, 2013 at 11:40 a.m. (#5 Reply) and 7:35 p.m. (#21 Reply): I wrote:\n“As far as the archaeological bloodstain pattern analysis is concerned:\n– Natural mordanting of dry blood remoistened with aqueous alkaline solution along with drying through myrrhic-aloetic (wood aloe) fumigation could account for:\n– The aged bloodstains still “looking fresh” today when seen in full day on the long inner burial cloth as if the blood had just been shed the day before. Mordant is known to be used for INTENSIFYING STAINS e.g. in cell or tissue preparations\n– Potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now it is well known gelatine is a breakdown product of collagen. The true fact is low temperature (55°-85° C) alkali gelatinisation of starch residuals present in the ancient linen cloth could be a possible factor as bubbling very fine printing paste to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process.\n– Bilirubin is neither the problem nor the solution, just probably one part of the whole equation as it could have been trapped (along with carbon monoxide?) during the image formation process.\n– Most likely dust, dirt and body fluids should be found in the very impurity layer that makes up the body image.”\n  Jesterof, you also wrote: “Your remark about the lighter head part due to the Oviedo head scarf is very interesting.

Adler proved that the bloodstains are not made of the kind of oozing post-mortem blood described by Zugibe but from exudates of blood clots, which explain why there is no smudge of blood on the cloth and why all the bloodstains shows a very good mirror image of the blood clots that were on the skin of the Shroud man.

In fact, I know by experience that this is a false problem!  Effectively, some years ago, I cut myself on the forearm with a tree branch and the wound looked pretty much like on the scourge wounds on the Shroud for the shape and the dimension.  I let it dry completely without putting any bandage on it.  Then, I forgot about it for approximately 5 hours.  And then, I had the nice idea to verify Barbet’s hypothesis concerning the transfer of the blood on the Shroud, i.e. coming in many cases from exudates of dried blood clots, whom surfaces had become humid again, most probably because of the water vapor released by the corpse.  For such an experiment, I simulated the moistening action of the water vapor on the dried clots by putting some saliva on-top of the dry wound and then, I placed a kleenex over it and applied a weak pressure on the wound.  Guess what?  I obtained a nice mirror imprint of my wound on the kleenex with absolutely no smudge, very much like the scourge marks we can see on the Shroud!  From that day on, I knew that Barbet was right on everything that is related to the blood transfer that occurred on the Shroud.  Then, I knew that every bloodstains on the Shroud were not caused by some post-mortem bleeding in liquid form after a vigorous washing, as proposed by Zugibe, but by exudates of still humid blood clots or exudates of dried blood clots that were able to get moistened again, probably because of the water vapor released by the dead body (except maybe, as Barbet told us, for a probable post-mortem bleeding in the feet area because there was probably an oozing of blood from the holes in the feet that never closed on a dead body – and not because of a washing of the feet).\n\n","date":"May 31, 2013 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35460","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Most important conclusion to draw from my personal experiment:  It is still possible to produce a nice mirror imprint of a dry wound on a fabric, even more than 5 hours after the drying has been completed, as long as there is enough moistening at the surface of the wound.

And the fact is that Adler’s findings are totally consistent with Barbet’s hypothesis.\n2- Barbet though he could seen some very pale halos of serum with his own eyes but cannot prove this.  But in his mind, this was totally logical in the context of the Shroud man, since halos of that nature were normally formed around dried blood clots during what is called the clot retraction process that happen during the drying of the clot with expulsion of serum around the clot.  Pellicori and Miller of STURP have showed that Barbet was right about the presence of these serum halos and Adler also confirmed this with his analyses.\n3- Barbet was very specific about the FACT that the bloodstains on the Shroud, because of their particularly precise shapes, could not have been formed by liquid blood, except maybe for some stains in the region of the feet.  He said that any drop of liquid blood inside the Shroud would have produced preferential direction in the new formed stain that would have been easy to noticed on a linen cloth with an herringbone weave like the Shroud, while there are none.  It’s also easy to assume that many smudges of blood would have been formed.  There’s no doubt that this is what would have happened if Zugibe’s hypothesis was correct.\nFor all these reasons, I think we can forget the idea of Zugibe and understand that Barbet’s hypothesis concerning the particular form of blood transfer on the Shroud is most probably right. \nIn the end, is it possible that there was a gentle washing of the corpse that didn’t removed the blood clots and help these clots to get re-moistened so they could be able to left mirror images of themselves on the Shroud?  I think this is a possibility but I prefer by far the one proposed by Barbet because it’s more simple and rational in the context of an hasty burial…\n\n","date":"May 31, 2013 at 3:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35509","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"\nYannick Clément :\nAdler had already an answer for this lack of potassium and it was because most of it would have been stayed inside the clot and have not been released in the exudates that have stained the cloth…\n\nthat’s mot an answer.

Here’s the paper in which he describe his hypothesis: http://shroud.com/zugibe2.htm  (important note:  Zugibe published his paper in 1989, well after Adler had released his findings about the very particular nature of the blood, i.e. that most of it came not from a post-mortem bleeding in liquid form but from exudates of blood clots, just like it was described by Barbet, which is very different than what Zugibe thought).\nI also think you should read carefully the part of Barbet’s book in which he described the particular kind of blood transfer that, in his mind, occurred on the Shroud in order to cause the vast majority of the bloodstains we see on the cloth.  Note that, for Barbet, there are only some bloodstains in the feet area that could have been formed by a drop of post-mortem blood in liquid form inside the cloth after the body had been placed there.  For Barbet, all other bloodstains came from the same particular transfer mechanism, i.e. from exudates of still moistened or, in other cases, of re-moistened blood clots.  Note also that, for Barbet, these last ones got probably re-moistened by the water vapor that is normally released for some time by a dead body…\nAfter this reading of Zugibe and Barbet’s writings, I think you should read again carefully my long new post: https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/#comment-35754\nOnly after this, I dare you to say to me that Adler’s conclusions were not an independent confirmation of Barbet’s conclusions and a challenge against Zugibe’s own hypothesis of the washing of the body…\n\n","date":"June 2, 2013 at 4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35760","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Max, I am still waiting for your comments in reply to what I posted on 30 May, # 104.\n\n","date":"June 1, 2013 at 9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35611","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Ok Louis,\nthe fact is I am professionally very busy at the moment and the thread was sort of spoiled by YC’s received and most biased ideas (as the latter does seem totally enable to discriminate between: 1/nearly 2000 years’ old archaeological blood vs. dry stains of relatively fresh one; 2/a biochemist and an archaeological bloodstain pattern analyst; 3/a surgeon and a forensic palaeopahtologist) to say nothing of his pathologically irrelevant  “hypergraphic” comments on Zugibe’s opinion (as the latter’s voice as forensic expert was just one among several others) and his shameless knack for distorting or ignoring others’ interpretation while having  the dead speak (e.g. Adler, Rogers and Barbet) through recurring ad nauseam to “the silence argument”.\nSo back to your post # 104.

I think I have been able to demonstrate a certain number of facts. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN SUCH BEAUTIFUL IMAGES, WITH BORDERS AS PRECISE AS THOSE ON THE SHROUD, WITH ANY COLORING LIQUID, NOT EVEN LIQUID BLOOD.”  \nNote: I think Zugibe should have read this part of Barbet’s book more carefully.  By doing so, he would never have proposed the hypothesis of a vigorous washing of the corpse being able to remove the clots in order to produce an oozing of fresh post-mortem blood in liquid form that would have caused the formation of the scourge marks on the cloth.\nOk, here’s the rest of Barbet’s quote: “There are on the Shroud almost no images of blood flows, like it is represented by painters.  On the other hand, there’s no need to think that the corpse, emptied during the transfer of the body (note: from the place of execution to the tomb), could have emitted notable quantities (of blood) in the Shroud. Every bloody images of the Shroud are then decals of fresh clots (note: like the most recent blood flows from the feet and wrists and the post-mortem blood flow from the side wound) or clots that have been softened by the water vapor (note: like all the scourge marks, which were most probably completely dried for a long time when the Shroud man died), which is normally released by a corpse during a pretty long period of time. These portraits of clots are very natural, of a startling truth, up to their most tiny details (note: the UV fluorescence analysis done by Miller and Pellicori of STURP proved that Barbet was right about that when they noticed the very precise details, invisible to the naked eye, present in the scourge marks).  These can only have been caused by nature, which has formed them on the skin and then, transferred them on the sheet.  These are perfect reprints of natural clots.  No artist could have been able to imagine them in all their meticulousness, before back off in front of insurmountable difficulties of execution.”\nComment from me: I can say honestly that I’m more convinced than ever that what Barbet said in this part of his book is right on the target versus the reality of the bloodstains on the Shroud.  And why do I am so much convinced that Barbet was right?  Simply because this come from an honest medical expert who knew what he was talking about and, more importantly, because most of his most crucial conclusions about the bloodstains (especially the conclusion that the vast majority of these stains have not been formed by liquid blood but by exudates of moistened or re-moistened blood clots) have later been scientifically and independently confirmed by Adler and Baima Bollone.  \nOn this subject, here’s a very important quote from Adler’s book “The Orphaned Manuscript”: “Although they sometimes differ on certain matters, all of the medical forensic examinations of the blood images are in agreement that they were EXUDATES FROM CLOTTED WOUNDS transferred to the cloth by contact with a wounded human male body consistent with the historic descriptions given for the Crucifixion of Christ.  This conclusion is also consistent with the computer imaging evidence (note: from a study done by Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline of STURP)…  Enzymatic removal of the blood from a blood coated fiber reveals that the blood got on the cloth first and therefore protected the blood covered areas of the cloth from the image forming process.  ALL THE MICROSCOPIC, CHEMICAL, SPECTROSCOPIC, AND IMMUNOLOGICAL EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THESE IMAGES, NOT ONLY BEING EXUDATES FROM CLOTTED WOUNDS, BUT THOSE OF A MAN WHO SUFFERED SEVERE TRAUMA PRIOR TO DEATH, EXPLAINING THE RED COLOR OF THE BLOOD AT THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL.”  Note:  Again, if Zugibe could have taken good note of this part of Adler’s book, he would never have proposed his hypothesis about a vigorous washing of the body that have removed the dried clots on the skin of the Shroud man producing an oozing of post-mortem liquid blood…  The sum of scientific evidences reported here by Adler (along with the fact that it is impossible for liquid blood to produce the very precise shape of the bloodstains we see on the Shroud) is not at all consistent with Zugibe’s hypothesis.  \nNow, let’s get back to Adler’s quote: “Proposed mineral compositions simulating blood are not consistent with these various measured chemical and physical parameters.  That these are CLOTTED WOUND EXUDATES is clearly seen in the ultraviolet photographs where every single blood wound SHOWS A DISTINCT SERUM CLOT RETRACTION RING (note: this is not at all the same thing as an oozing of post-mortem liquid blood and serum from an open wound) agreeing with the earlier observations of the pioneers (note: Adler talks about Vignon and Barbet) on the major blood wounds as seen directly on the cloth.  It is clear that we can explain the presence of the blood images on the cloth consistent with their alleged origin.”\nI hope everyone is able to realize now that Barbet and Adler’s conclusion concerning the bloodstains are different and irreconcilable versus Zugibe’s hypothesis of a vigorous washing of the corpse that would have been the primary cause of the formation of the scourge marks on the cloth!  It’s one or the other.  We cannot hold both conclusions together…  Personally, I am totally convinced that Zugibe’s idea was incorrect and that it is Barbet and Adler who were right about the particular kind of blood transfer that lead to the formation of most of the bloodstains we can see on the Shroud, including the numerous scourge marks.  I’m also more and more convinced that Adler’s explanation for the reddish aspect of the bloodstains is the most probable that exist.  And as jesterof said the other day (and I agree with him): the only question that remains unanswered for the moment concerning the particular color of those stains is why the bilirubin, which is normally an unstable compound, have been preserved inside the bloodstains for so long, up until now, thus producing a redder (brighter) color than normal, especially these stains are seen in sunlight.  \nConcerning this question, as jesterof also said on the blog, there are tons of natural causes that can be potentially good to explain the preservation of the bilirubin until this day, starting with the simple fact that the bloodstains on the cloth are dry and that they were caused by exudates of humid blood clots instead of liquid blood, along with the possible presence of saponaria residues on the cloth that could also have played an important role in this preservation of the bilirubin, etc., etc…  I hope this will help some people around here to see more clearly what is the real truth concerning the blood on the Shroud!  And please, don’t forget my own little experiment of blood transfer, which proved that it is very easy to produce a mirror image of a wound that has been dry for several hours on a piece of fabric, as long as enough moisture is present on its surface and a small pressure is put on the fabric.  I really hope this observation of mine (I which I could have taken pictures of this, but I swear to God I only tell the truth) can help some people to understand that there is nothing strange or supernatural about the fact that the scourge marks are those of wounds that were probably dried for a pretty long time when the Shroud man died on the cross…\n\n","date":"June 2, 2013 at 4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35754","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Yannick here you go again.\nThe whole point of my remarks ( not in hostile manner, btw, I do not expect everybody to grasp immediately on something I know professionally, or see it in a different light, because that’s why there is so much training ) were that your point of proving by quotes from one research that the other was wrong is a mistake because you do not take into account that that particular person was referring just to one aspect, not touching the other knowingly, because he is talking ONLY about something he addressed, and he knows the others also know that untouched matters are untouched because they did not address it.\nMay I cal this approach of yours corpuscular, whereas it should be continuous?\nWe already agreed on the issue of bilirubin/UV exposure and why the amount of bilirubin will be increased.\nI believe you on your experiment.

Even if the clots from these wounds satisfied the time and moisture criteria postulated by Lavoie’s group, the shape of the scourge wounds including the bloody areas around the wounds would be indistinct and extremely variable in size and shape depending on the depth of the wound, the angle of the wound, the amount of blood flow, the flow pattern and whether or not clothing was adherent to the wounds. Moreover, even if the dripping sweat of the crucified softened some of the dried blood in areas just outside these wounds, only indistinct and variable-shaped impressions would result. ”\nBut the pattern of the wounds is almost exactly the same – this will never happen if the wounds are inflicted and left alone with blood,m dust, plasma, sweat for a long time prior to death.\n“A forensic evaluation of the crucifixion reveals that every movement during the entire time the crucified was on the cross would have restarted bleeding in the hand and foot wounds. The body unquestionably would have been literally covered with blood because the heart pumps about 4500 gallons of blood through more than 60,000 miles of large and small blood vessels throughout the whole body each day. Instead of the very exact imprints of the wounds, the Shroud would instead bear large indistinct masses of blood over the entire image including the face, arms, hands, feet and trunk.

The concept that the crucified man was not washed prior to being placed on the Shroud would not be readily acceptable by the forensic pathologist whose expertise also includes studies of antemortem and postmortem bloodflow patterns on fabrics in forensic reconstructions. Acceptance of the hypothesis that the victim was not washed would therefore place the authenticity of the TS in serious doubts”.\n“It is also of importance to note that scourge markings were made many hours prior to removal from the cross, so that incrusted clots would have formed in the wounds, therefore making it difficult to understand how the scourge marks could have left such precise imprints. Every forensic pathologist I have consulted has agreed that the wounds would have caused a large ammount of bleeding and that the body had to be washed, to account for the preciseness of the wounds on the Shroud. On the december 1980 issue of Medical World News, dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist and a former Chief Medical Examiner of New-York City, agreed that if the Shroud is genuine, the body must have been washed. He also added that if the body was washed, there might be some oozing from the wounds”.\n“Therefore, if the body was not washed, there would have been an absence of most of the body image in patchy distribution all over the Shroud because there would have been large amounts of blood all over the Shroud, preventing the image-production mechanism”.\n“During my observations of rabbinic washings in trauma cases, especially in circumstances with sundown rapidly approaching, the rabbis would quickly wash the body, sometimes washing the front of the body and sitting up the body to do the back, initiating blood flows in wounds that were present on the face and the torso. Anything that flowed after the washing was considered unclean blood, and they ould not wash again”. \nHope that this can help.\nThibault.\n\n","date":"June 5, 2013 at 3:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36220","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Jesterof, if you don’t want to answer my simple question (or if you’re affraid to answer), here’s what Barbet would answer:  An oozing of post-mortem liquid blood the way it was described by Zugibe following a washing that would remove the dried blood clots of the scourge wounds would NEVER be able to cause precise mirror imprints in the form of small dumbbells the way we see them on the Shroud.

It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. As a victim of a violent death, his body should be buried with his shed innocent blood. Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking-gradual-unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner burial sheet soaked in a watery solution was compressed widthwise (with shorter dry clean outer shrouds) while taut lengthwise back and front as all parts of the body should be wrapped-up (Naḥmanides, Torat ha-Adam; Inyan ha-hoẓa’ah) and then the tightly wrapped-up bloody corpse was subjected to fumigation (and the long inner burial sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up).

First of all, most of the blood within the scourge wounds of the victim would have been clotted and the blood located both at the periphery and outside of the wounds would have dried long before the victim was placed on the cross.\nAccording to the experiments of Lavoie et al., a cloth would have to be placed on a moist clot no later than 2 ½ hours after bleeding stopped ( 5 ). In addition, these authors indicate that moistened clots have to be transferred within an hour for a good mirror image transfer to take place.\nForgetting all of the other wounds, no one would argue that the scourge wounds were made and clotting begun several hours prior to death. Moreover, most forensic experts agree that the Man of the Shroud shows evidence of rigor mortis because of the bent knees and absence of a neck, therefore indicating that the crucified was dead for some time before being taken down from the cross. Thus, according to the studies of Lavoie’s group, these perfectly defined wounds should not have transferred at all. Yet many of the scourge wounds on the Shroud of Turin are extremely distinct corresponding to dumbbell shaped wounds. Even if the clots from these wounds satisfied the time and moisture criteria postulated by Lavoie’s group, the shape of the scourge wounds including the bloody areas around the wounds would be indistinct and extremely variable in size and shape depending on the depth of the wound, the angle of the wound, the amount of blood flow, the flow pattern and whether or not clothing was adherent to the wounds. Moreover, even if the dripping sweat of the crucified softened some of the dried blood in areas just outside these wounds, only indistinct and variable-shaped impressions would result. However, if the body was washed, the dried blood around the wounds would be removed causing an oozing of bloody material within the wounds resulting in the production of relatively good impressions of the wound. In order to test this hypothesis, pieces of linen and paper towels were gently touched (not pressed) against wounds from accident victims who lived for several hours following the accident. Relatively no impressions were made. This was repeated after the wounds were rinsed with water and allowed to soak on the wounds for several minutes. Only indistinct bloody impressions were made. The wounds were then washed and this procedure tried again. This resulted in reasonably good impressions of the wounds ( Fig. 1 ). “\n\n","date":"June 5, 2013 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-36217","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood","post":"Can you read carefully please this quote from the article of Zugibe : “if the body was washed, the dried blood around the wounds would be removed causing an oozing of bloody material within the wounds resulting in the production of relatively good impressions of the wound.”\nNow, can you go in his paper again and look at the Figure 1 please?
