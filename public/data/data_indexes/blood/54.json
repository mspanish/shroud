[{"title":"Reader: Has Jackson come to realize this?","post":"Interesting points. I am currently interested in the idea that some or all of the most prominent blood stains were a medieval ‘add on’. Under this theory the scourge marks might be authentic, as might the trickles  of blood across the lower back, which I theorise were not produced by direct contact between body and cloth, but rather were the product of some post mortem blood flowing down fron the wrist wounds, running off rhe hups and hitting the cloth below, creating a small pool, then trickling back in towards the area of the cloth belo the middle of the lower back.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2013 at 12:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/06/reader-has-jackson-come-to-realize-this/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-38680","author":"matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Reader: Has Jackson come to realize this?","post":"Sorry smart phone typos, ‘rhe hups’ should read ‘the hips’\n\n","date":"July 7, 2013 at 12:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/06/reader-has-jackson-come-to-realize-this/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-38681","author":"matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Reader: Has Jackson come to realize this?","post":"Wouldn’t the possibility of blood being added on later be precluded by the fact that it’s not whole blood but blood from exudated blood clots?
