[{"title":"How much bilirubin?","post":"The suggestion that the bloodstains on the Shroud contained a high amount of bilirubin (relative to normal blood) originated from Adler’s spectral analysis using FTIR & UV-VIS techniques.  Such analysis measures absorbance at specific wavelengths of light and generates a graph, or profile, which is compared to those of various (known) blood clot controls.  The Shroud spectrum did not completely match the control spectrum of old blood (which typically turns brown).  Rather, certain peaks on the graph corresponded to another known group of compounds-the high-spin (high-iron) porphyrins: breakdown products of hemoglobin-bilirubin & biverdin.  By creating simulated mixtures of blood exudates with additional bilirubin, Adler was able to create samples whose profiles matched those of the Shroud, hence the suggestion that elevated bilirubin was present.  The spectral techniques that were used are semi-quantitative; they really only demonstrate that a particular compound (peak) is enhanced or decreased relative to a normal profile-the studies were not extended to a more quantitative analysis. \nRegarding “Adler’s advising the Shroud’s custodians to install extra light protection for the Shroud on the grounds that bilirubin was unstable to light”, this is only one of several factors that was mentioned, together with photochemical damage to the cloth and the images.  A little context might help alleviate (Yup) some of the confusion…\n\n","date":"October 24, 2012 at 7:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/how-much-bilirubin/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-18245","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"How much bilirubin?","post":"“Rather”, “suggestion”, “semi-quantitative”… All this seems a little vague.

The intention was to be objective, not to play dodge ball.  It is my understanding that the primary intent of the spectral analyses by Adler & colleagues was to determine if the samples were, in fact, blood as opposed to paint or pigments.  These data along with numerous other chemical & immunological tests indicated that the samples consisted of real blood.  In the course of these studies, certain regions of the spectral profiles became of interest.  I used the phrase “semi-quantitative” because for the existing data, I don’t know if you can really take it much past that.  Such spectral techniques could be relatively quantitative for fresh whole blood where protein concentration could be normalized to a particular blood volume as in the paper you referenced.-with tape lift samples of dried bloodstains, it might prove more challenging.  It is possible to tell if a certain peak in the profile is increased/ decreased relative to a control (normal) profile, but I believe that generating a hard number in terms of specific amounts of blood proteins present would require further analysis.  \nI don’t know why the studies weren’t extended and followed up on, but reason suggests that a limited amount of sample to work with would be a contributing factor.  I never knew Alan Adler personally, but my guess is that he was not the type to shy away from a challenge.  If solid quantitative analysis were possible with the samples in hand, I believe he would have mentioned it.\nA few references for Adler’s published findings, including spectral data are:\nApplied Optics, 19 (16) 1980.\nCanadian Society of Forensic Sciences Journal 14 (3), 1981.\nArchaeological Chemistry: Organic, Inorganic, and Biochemical Analysis, American Chemical Society Symposium Series, 625, Washington DC, 1996.\nProceedings of 1998 Dallas Shroud Symposium, Michael Minor, ed.
