[{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"A brief comment on this post:  I realize that some may find the idea itself a little ludicrous, perhaps even insulting.  I, myself, have never seriously thought it might be ape or monkey blood.  Then, why go there?  Because I think it’s important to critically analyze the data from as many different scientific disciplines as possible.  This analysis is from the perspective of immunology, in which specificity is the cornerstone.  The issue is isolated to examine “What does the data really tell us about the species origin of the blood?”\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 6:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23028","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"What are we to think about the observation reported by Lucotte (“Vérités sur le Saint Suaire”, p.147 ff) on erythrocytes found on the Shroud (microscopic material collected by Giovanni Riggi di Numana) with diameters of 12.5-13 micrometer – much too large a value for human blood, according to this author.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 6:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23030","author":"Jos Verhulst","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"Some might argue that red blood cell membranes may reseal/fuse during the fixation procedure using for microscopic preparation; also, I believe the same author might have also reported that certain mineral particles may mimic the appearance of red blood cells.  I think it would important to verify microscopic (visual) identification of red blood cells with some biochemical data, using microscopy together with (gold-conjugaed) antibodies directed against specific membrane markers, for example, to ensure that you are really looking at (reconstituted) red blood cells in the field.  Baima Bollone has published a picture of what appear to be red blood cells on Shroud fibers in several of his books, but also includes a photograph of a silica particle in an adjacent panel to illustrate the similarities.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 7:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23033","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"Gérard Lucotte claims to have observed, in the micro debris aspired from the Shroud, 9 smaller erythrocytes that could be of primate/human origin (“Il s’agit sûrement d’hématies humaines” – p.150), and 55 larger ones that are not of primate origin (“elles proviennent probablement d’un grand mammifère domestique” p.179).

Note:  Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with water can gelatinized starch. Then the moistened/in-soaked burial cloth could have been subjected to a low temperature accidental/providential thermal imprinting process (e.g. ritual fumigation and/or corpse hyperthermia).\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 8:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23036","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"Typo: gelatinize\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23037","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"Re “a silica particle”, reminder: adhesion of water insoluble (e.g. iron oxyde and/or other “opaques” present in the desert of Judea dust) onto the body skin and/or receiving flax surface could have resulted from the Sharaf (the biblical RuHa Qâdim or East Wind), an Israel wind more commonly known as Khamsin or the Dark Breath of the desert of Judea.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 8:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23040","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"Does anyone know of any old bloodstain, of any age, in any artifact, anywhere, that is coloured red, apart from those on the shroud?

A single Hemastix test was made which returned a reaction of 1+. The surface was very hydrophobic and comparisons made before and after the test indicate that very likely residue was actually removed and tested. When removing residue from the basal thick deposits (Sample #24) more liquid was used and a longer soaking time was allowed. The subsequent liquid sample was viscous and reddish brown, consistent with experience removing thick blood residues from other archaeological tools (for example see Loy 1993)”.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23055","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"Hugh, why don’t you try just to mix fresh human oxygenated/non oxygenated blood with an aqueous alkaline solution, moisten or soak a piece of linen in it and have the moistened/soaked cloth dry out via low temperature fumigation and see what happens?\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 12:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/30/guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-distinguishing-human-blood-from-that-of-other-species/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-23052","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse:  Distinguishing human blood from that of other species","post":"I believe Ian Wilson mentioned in one of his books that Thomas Loy had told him he had seen a similarly colored blood on prehistoric artifacts-I believe that was in a conversation, don’t recall a specific reference for it.
