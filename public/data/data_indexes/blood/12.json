Hugh Farey gives a very good explanation of why this is so. See the posting “Top of Head Puzzle” of 16 January and his Comment #15 there. Hugh writes: \n“Assuming that the bottom edges of the line of bloodstains along the back of the head correspond roughly to the level of the inion of the external occipital protuberance, there is a distance of about 38cm between there and the bridge of the nose, which corresponds well to the same distance on my own head. In other words, the image which is visible is consistent with a cloth wrapped tightly over the head from nose to occipital protuberance, and possibly a cloth about 15cm wide underneath the shroud and tied around the top of the head to account for the lack of image all the way.” \nI calculate that for there to be a gap of at least 3.7cm, the ventral and dorsal images must be separated by not less than an additional 6cm, which would be easily detected on the Shroudscope images.  The measurements and calculations would be well within cartographer Yannick’s ability to confirm. Hint: Assume the path over the head approximates to a semi-ellipse. Then for an additional gap of distance ‘h’ at the top of the head, the formula for the additional separation approximates to pi x h / 2.  Additional hint: Two bands encircle the globe at the equator; the second band is placed at a distance 1m above the first. What is the difference in length of the two bands? Answer – 6.28m. \nThe absence of an image at the top of the head can only be explained by an intervening cloth such as a type of cap – check Cap of Cahors!\n\n","date":"March 5, 2014 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-85219","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"Read again more carefully this part of my text please: “But here, we must be prudent (about the idea that the cloth must have been located at 3.7 cm or more from the top of the head in order that no image could get formed) since we still don’t know the exact mechanism that lead to the image formation and it is still possible that such a process was not able to work laterally (or if it was, it is possible that it was only working if there would have been a direct-contact between the cloth and the lateral parts of the body, including the top of the head).”\nAlong with this other part: “To learn more about this, I think Mario Latendresse or someone else should try some cloth’s configuration experiments that would consider the most probable position of the Shroud man’s head, which appears to have been bent toward the chest, and see if some loose configuration of the cloth over such a head bent toward the chest can force it to be located at some distance from the top of the head (which is not necessarily 4 cm or more if the image formation process was mainly working in a radial way (mainly straight up and down from the body)). Note: In my opinion, I don’t think if that was the case, this would necessarily discard any natural process for image formation, especially if the energy transfer was not 100% radial.”\nSummary of what I said: We still don’t know the exact image formation mechanism and because of this, we still don’t know if such process was able to work laterally, especially in areas where there were no direct cloth-body contact.  And if this unknown mechanism was not able to produce an image when the cloth was located away from the lateral parts of the body (even by just maybe 1 cm or less – who knows?), then the hypothesis of Mr. Latendresse is still plausible in regard of the dimension of the gap that exist between the 2 head images on the Shroud.\nI would like to comment this quote: “The absence of an image at the top of the head can only be explained by an intervening cloth such as a type of cap – check Cap of Cahors!”\nComment:  This is a conclusion way too drastic in the present case…  We’re dealing here with a complex question and, because of what I said about the fact that we still don’t know for sure what was the mechanism that formed the image, there’s still some possibilities left open, such as the one proposed by Mario Latendresse that I exposed in my post (who studied that question much more in deep than me or you and, unlike you and me, is qualified to do so).\nAnyway, those things are not what was at the heart of my post.  Here’s the most important thing to note:  “In sum, the two important factors I would like those researchers to keep in mind (which are two things that are rarely consider, so it seem) when it’s time to evaluate what was the most probable configuration of the Shroud over the dead body are 1- The possibility that the original cloth was somewhat stiff.

The distance between the ventral and dorsal head images demonstrates that there was no gap between the cloth and the top of the head, they were virtually in contact (unless there was an intervening cloth) with the burial cloth quite tight at the top of the head. As other body parts produced an image when in close proximity to the burial cloth, there has to be a reason why this did not happen at the top of the head.  An intervening cloth seems the most likely explanation – your Occam’s razor! The only other possible explanation is that whatever caused the image did not, for some unknown reason, act through the top of the head. Perhaps whatever emanations caused this were constrained to act vertically, but I’m not entirely happy with that explanation.\n\n","date":"March 5, 2014 at 8:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-85279","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"How can you be certain that there was no gap?

And 2- The most probable fact that the Shroud man’s head was bend toward the chest at the time of the image formation.”\nThose two possible factors in link with the image formation is what I wanted to underline the most and this concern the future research that could be made (by Mr. Latendresse or someone else) in order to estimate the most probable configuration of the Shroud at the time of the image formation.\nNow, for the particular problem of the gap between the 2 head images, as I said, I think the most likely explanations that we got for the moment are:\n– There was a gap (which could have been maybe smaller than 4 cm) between the top of the head of the Shroud man and the Shroud, which was enough to prevent the formation of this lateral part of the body,\n– There was a small cloth (or some other thin object) that was placed between the top of the head and the Shroud, which acted like a shield and prevent the formation of this lateral part of the body.\nSome people talk also about the possibility of a Jaw band brought around the top of the head and tied in order to keep the mouth close, but it is very difficult for me to agree with such a hypothesis because of what we see on the Shroud and especially the image of the side of the face (there is an image there but very faint) and the loose hair.  I don’t think there would have been an image of both sides of the face that would have been formed if a jaw band would have been placed in those areas.  In all logic, this band would have completely prevent any image formation of the sides of the face…\n\n","date":"March 6, 2014 at 11:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-85547","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"Yannick your last point is a good one.\nRe the idea of a small cloth on top of the head.

There was no gap! For there to have been a gap of 4cm as he proposes, the ventral and dorsal images had to be separated by at least an additional 6cm. I have explained how he can check this for himself. He is a cartographer and should be able to exercise this skill to confirm what others here have also found. A cloth on the top of the head is the most likely explanation for the lack of image there. Any tilting of the head does not affect this conclusion. He can measure the distance nose to occipital protrusion on his own head and make the same comparison on Shroudscope. \nConcerning the lack of side imaging, it is my understanding that Mr Latendresse believes the cloth was loosely draped as a temporary measure and the sides of the cloth were too distant there for imaging to occur. On the other hand MPH insists that the burial rite was completed and the cloth fully wrapped the body. In that case it seems to me that the only tenable explanation was that the sides of the body were packed with some of the 100 pound package brought by Nicodemus which masked the sides from the cloth. \nIt is still a mystery to me why the image should be a near orthogonal projection (similar to a photograph) particularly if the body was fully wrapped.

But there’s one problem with this assumption and that’s where the most probable bending of the Shroud man’s head toward his chest become important!  \nEffectively, if this was the way the image was formed (i.e. a totally vertical burst of energy acting only straight up and down), we should expect to see an image of the frontal head that would be much longer than the image of the back of the head because of this most probable bending of the head toward the chest, which would have forced the frontal side of the cloth (the one that was located over the Shroud man’s body) to be in direct-contact with not only the whole upper part of the face but also most of the frontal part of the top of the head because of gravity (which would not have been the case for a good portion of the back part of the top of the head).  THIS IS NOT WHAT WE SEE ON THE SHROUD where both images of the head have more or less the same dimension…  I hope people will understand the reasoning I just expressed here.  This is, for me, another good clue to believe the image was not created by a sudden burst of energetic radiation, and so, no matter if there was a smaller cloth placed over the head or not. \nIn other words, because of the most probable bending of the head toward the chest (this kind of bending as been described by experts like Barbet), if the image was caused by a burst of energy from the Resurrection that would have acted straight up and down, we should expect to see a longer portion of the head on the front part of the Shroud and an image of the backside of the head much smaller in length and so, no matter if there was a small cloth over the head or not.

Effectively, this probable bending is very important because, if it is the case and the Shroud man had his head bent forward in direction of his chest when his body was placed inside the Shroud, it is much harder to accept the idea of Mario Latendresse that the cloth would not have been in direct with a very good portion of the top of his head (especially the “frontal” portion) because of gravity UNLESS the cloth was somewhat stiff as it was considered by some members of STURP as a true possibility.  \nWith this explanation, I hope you understand now the potentially huge implication a possible stiffness of the cloth could have had on the absence of an image between the 2 heads on the Shroud.  In sum, if (the “if” is important here) no small cloth was present on top of the head of the Shroud when his body was placed inside the Shroud, the most likely explanation that would remain to explain the absence of an image between the 2 heads on the Shroud would be to think like Mr. Latendresse that the cloth was not in direct-contact with the top of the Shroud man’s head after his enshrouded body was laid in his final resting place inside the tomb.  But because of the most probable bending of his head toward his chest linked with the law of gravity, we have to assume that the Shroud would have been somewhat stiff, which would have made it possible for the cloth to remain at some distance (maybe less than 4 cm, who knows?) from the major portion of the top of the Shroud man’s head (the part of the head that has not produced any image on the Shroud).  In other words, what I say is this:  If Mario Latendresse’s hypothesis (the one he described here on the blog recently) is correct, then we must assume that the cloth was somewhat stiff, because if not, the bending of the head would have force it to come down in direct-contact with the top of the head because of gravity.  \nImportant note: The hypothesis of Mr. Latendresse (which is the one I still consider as the most probable but only if we think the cloth was somewhat stiff at the time of the burial of the Shroud man) can also be apply for the absence of an image of the other lateral parts of the Shroud man’s body and, once again, the possible stiffness of the cloth would certainly make such a hypothesis more realistic.  And finally, if it’s true that the original Shroud was somewhat stiff, this must have been due to a remain of starch on the threads after the washing of the final cloth (most probably concentrated on the top surface of the cloth because of the final drying in open air), which would have certainly been the major substance that would have composed the thin layer of impurities proposed by Ray Rogers that would have coated most of the top surface fibers, making it possible for those fibers (and only those) to get colored by the very mild image formation process (most probably natural).  In other words, the confirmation of a certain stiffness of the Shroud at the time of the image formation (I don’t know if this will ever happen) would certainly represent a good reason to think Rogers was right concerning the image chromophore\nFinal note: All I’ve said here is of course only hypothetical and theoretical.  More researches need to be done, not only by experts like Mr. Latendresse to evaluate the most probable configuration of the Shroud at the time of the image formation, but also eventually by a chemist who could be allowed to analyze properly some non-image fibers of the Shroud in order to confirm or reject the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the image chromophore (i.e. the image would be located only in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities mainly composed of starch, which would be concentrated on the topmost fibers of the cloth and, because of this, the entire structure of the linen fibers (including the primary cell wall of the fibers) would be free of any image color).\nWith all those precisions, I hope people (including Daveb) will understand better my reasoning, which lead me to write the guess posting you can read on-top of this page.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2014 at 9:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-85871","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"No, Yannick, daveb is correct.

Also, because of this probable bending of the head toward the chest, I think the gap between the 2 head images would have been much thinner than what we see on the Shroud, if Carlos scenario was right.

It is possible that gravity may have had a part in this but it is a weak force in respect of vapours.

Here’s what he wrote on this blog on January 16, 2014: “I would also add that the lack of side images do not need a complex explanation. IT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISTANCE OF THE CLOTH TO THE SIDES OF THE BODY. That is, from the assumption that the imprinted image has recorded the cloth/body distance, and the body is loosely covered by the cloth, the distance of the sides of the body are too far away to be recorded at all on the Shroud. This does not preclude the possible existence of a cap (Cahors?) to be on the head, but THAT WOULD NOT BE NEEDED TO EXPLAIN THE LACK OF IMAGE COMING FROM THE TOP OF THE HEAD.” (link: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/#comment-73414)\nAnd here’s another comment he wrote the same day: “Why would the cloth be necessarily in contact with the top of the head? The cloth could simply have extended a few cms away because the distance of about 23cms between the back and front images would allow it. We would need to have a very accurate knowledge of the size of the head to conclude otherwise.” (link: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/#comment-73420)\nNote:  Can’t you see that my conclusion is pretty much the same as the one expressed by Mr. Latendresse, who is an expert in mathematics who analyzed the question of the configuration of the Shroud in deep since many years.  Consequently, does this mean he’s also a “dogmatic” person?  This is ludicrous…\nBy the way, I think people didn’t read my guess posting carefully because if they would have done so, they would not consider me “dogmatic” as Matthias, Daveb and others think.  Read again my guess posting: “Of course, other potentially good solutions other than the one proposed by Mr. Latendresse the other day exists to explain this absence of an image there (like the idea of a second smaller cloth that could have been placed on top of the head of the Shroud man and inside the main Shroud during the burial procedure), but I still prefer the hypothesis of Mr. Latendresse, at least for the moment.”\nSometimes, the most dogmatic people are not the one who are accused by the one who accused…  Please look at yourself in the mirror guys!  Take Daveb’s post for example:  I’ve never seen him agree to let the door open for other possible solutions than his own!  Not once!  Come on!  This is a complex problem and sure enough, there are more than one possible solution…\nIt’s the same thing concerning the question of the image formation process.  People think I consider only the hypotheses involving a natural phenomenon but it’s completely wrong.  Read again my paper about the bloodstains evidence (link: http://shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf) and you’ll see that I present 4 very different scenarios to explain the image formation and only one of those 4 scenarios involve some kind of natural phenomenon!  Of course, this is the one I favored the most (in face of all the known data coming from the Shroud) but, nevertheless, I am honest enough to let the door open to other possibilities.

I really believe Mario Latendresse would agree with me that this is a pretty good reading of what we see on the Shroud…  And to me, this is a good clue to believe that if there is a missing part of the top of the head on the Shroud, it is probably because the cloth was located away enough from the extreme part of the top of the head to prevent any image formation of this area of the body.

If the radiation is now downwards, then a second image of the front of the body is formed on the cloth below the body, and we would end with two frontal images, not one frontal and one dorsal.\nThe body lay in the shroud for a maximum time of about 36 hours; “three days” only includes a few hours of Friday afternoon and a few hours of Sunday morning.\nAs for the “surely Jesus could defy science” idea, this is, of course, true. In which case no scientific exploration of the image-forming mechanism is meaningful.\n\n","date":"March 12, 2014 at 4:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-87673","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"Here, I just intend to summarize my thoughts about the question of the absence of an image of the extreme part of the top of the head of the Shroud man and, by extension, concerning also the most probable configuration of the cloth around the body at the time of the image formation:\n1- Because of the fact we see a lot of hair on both images of the head, including some hair on the upper parts of both heads, I think this represent the best clue to conclude the presence of a gap between the 2 head images was not caused by the presence of a cap or a small cloth that would have been applied on-top of the head of the Shroud man before his corpse was placed inside the Shroud but more likely because there was a certain gap between the extreme part of the top of the head and the Shroud after the burial procedure and at the time of the image formation.\n2- The absence of an image of both lateral parts of the body can also have been caused by the same reason.\n3- These two probable conclusions strongly suggest that no linen strips were used to tied-up the cloth firmly around the body and that the Shroud was simply placed in a pretty loose way over the corpse, which is the kind of configuration that fit the most with the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ incomplete burial.  Effectively, because those who did the burial procedure on Friday knew perfectly well they had to come back on Sunday (after the Jewish Sabbath) to finish the job (which included probably a washing and an ointment of the corpse), there was no need to tied up the cloth around the body, since they knew they had to remove the corpse from inside the Shroud on Sunday to wash it and anoint it.  This use of linen strips to tied-up the cloth around the body was probably in their plan, but only after the completion of the whole burial procedure on Sunday.  Note: the bloodstains in the feet region can suggest that maybe some form of strapping (probably with a linen strip) have been used in that region to maintain the cloth in place around the body.\n4- The absence of an image of the back of the knees on the dorsal part of the Shroud (which was confirmed by Miller and Pellicori’s analysis of their UV fluorescent photos and most probably caused by the distance existing between the still bended knees of the Shroud man and the dorsal part of the Shroud) is another data that, along with the two I just mentioned, should be enough to conclude beyond any reasonable doubt that no linen strips were used to tied-up the cloth firmly around the body (with the possible exception of the feet region),that the Shroud was simply placed in a pretty loose way over the corpse and that the dorsal part of the cloth was most probably simply resting horizontally on-top of the place were the enshrouded corpse was placed (probably a stone bench), which means the cloth was not in direct-contact with many parts of the backside of the Shroud man’s body.  Note: the presence of an image of a good portion of the backside of the head (including a portion of the upper part of the top of the head) strongly suggest that, for this particular region of the body, the Shroud was not resting on the ground (i.e. stone bench) after the burial procedure and at the time of the image formation, but that it was most probably following more or less the contours of the backside of the head, which is natural in the sense that it is there that the second half of the Shroud was folded in order to cover also the frontal part of the corpse.  Note: the absence of scourge marks in the upper region of the thighs in the dorsal image can also be taken as another good clue to back-up the conclusion that no linen strips were used to tied-up the cloth firmly around the body (with the possible exception of the feet region),that the Shroud was simply placed in a pretty loose way over the corpse and that the dorsal part of the cloth was most probably simply resting horizontally on-top of the place were the enshrouded corpse was placed.\n5- Because of the most probable bending of the head of the Shroud toward his chest (which is, sadly, a data that doesn’t appear to have been considered by Mario Latendresse in his paper about the most probable configuration of the frontal part of the Shroud at the time of image formation), which would normally have caused the Shroud, because of gravity, to fall directly on-top of a good portion of the extreme part of the top of the head, thus causing the formation of an image (which would have logically produced a longer image of the frontal head versus the image of the back of the head), we can assume (like German of STURP, who’s idea was accepted by Rogers and Schwalbe as a real possibility) that the cloth was somewhat stiff at the time of the image formation.\n6- This stiffness would have been the primary reason why there was still a certain gap between the extreme part of the top of the head and the Shroud after the burial procedure and at the time of the image formation and we can also assume the same thing concerning the probable gap that was existing between the lateral parts of the Shroud man’s body and the cloth at that moment.\nThose are my personal conclusions on this subject, which came from a long reflection and lots of reading.  Of course, if other data come in my way and/or if some experts on the subject show me some good clue that suggests something else, I’ll be willing to reconsider some of my conclusions.  I see this as a work-in-progress…  Also, I acknowledge of course that other hypotheses and conclusions can be (and have been) put forward by other people and I still left the door open to some of those (like the presence of a possible very small cap or, more probably, very small cloth resting on the extreme part of the top of the head), even though such opening is not very wide for the moment.  I just wanted to summarize my own conclusions here, so that it can maybe start a new reflection in some people’s heads.  \nThank you in advance to all of those (I hope this will include some Shroud researchers) who will read this summary with an OPEN-MIND!\n\n","date":"March 9, 2014 at 6:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-86682","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"Additional note:  My conclusion about the loose configuration of the Shroud at the time of image formation (see the long comment above) means that I reject completely the hypothesis of a tight configuration, which was described by John Jackson in this BBC documentary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj_pxnzDLsE and also showed in other Shroud documentaries over the years.\nAt the same time, that means I also reject Jackson’s hypothesis concerning the possible use of the side strip to tied-up the Shroud around the corpse… \nI really think there are well enough solid clues on the Shroud to reject both hypotheses.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2014 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-86708","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"And how do you explain the absence of a body image in the right elbow when clearly a contact blood stain is there?\n\n","date":"March 9, 2014 at 10:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-86747","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"I explain this by the same hypothesis I have to explain why there are some scourge marks at the back of the knees on the dorsal image while there are no body image there (this fact also come from the important study done by Miller and Pellicori of STURP concerning their UV fluorescent photos), which can be summarized like this: A change of configuration of the Shroud during the burial procedure (probably during a short transfer of the enshrouded body between a central place inside the tomb and the final resting place, which was probably a stone bench carved inside a wall of the tomb), which caused some temporary direct-contacts that were removed after the enshrouded body had been placed in his final resting place.  Those temporary direct-contacts between the bloodstained corpse and some parts of the Shroud would have caused the transfer of some bloodstains on the cloth (because most if not all blood clots were humid enough to transfer on the cloth when the body reached the tomb). Finally, when the body was placed in his final resting place at the end of the burial procedure, the Shroud was probably replaced in a looser way with the result of taking the cloth away from the corpse in many places, including the back of the knees and the lateral part of the elbows, among other places like both sides of the face (i.e. removal of some manual compression that was applied during the short transfer of the enshrouded body).  In those particular areas (i.e. back of the knees and the lateral part of the elbows), we can assume that the cloth was enough far of the body (possibly at 4 or more cm of distance) to prevent any image formation.  \nNote: Most people who studied the Shroud over the years have seemed to assume the body was placed inside the cloth directly in his final resting place, but that doesn’t make much sense since the kind of resting places that were existing inside 1st Century tombs in Jerusalem were not big enough to allow this kind of enshrouding.  In all logic, the corpse must have been placed inside this long shroud elsewhere, in a place where there was enough room to operate, which can well have been a central place inside the tomb or even a clean place outside the tomb.  Consequently, it is most probable that they moved this enshrouded body afterward to laid him in his final resting place, which was probably a stone bench carved inside one of the tomb walls.  Such a transfer of the body, even if the distance was short, surely caused some manual compression in many places and it’s logical that some of those were later removed at the end of the burial procedure…\n\n","date":"March 10, 2014 at 10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-86945","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"I’ve just had a good look on Shroudscope on a full screen rather than my mobile.\nI think image / blood stains on the back of the head are evident close to the middle of the top of the head.

Do I count as an elder statesman? I’m flattered!\nAnyway, I do have problems with all these measurements, as in spite of being told that the shroud has a resolution of half a centimetre or so, it is really very difficult to decide where exactly we are measuring from and to. Your own “the middle of the back of the head or probably a bit higher” is as good as one can get, in most cases, and it’s not at all obvious where that is.\nEven on ones own head, the middle of the back of it is pretty difficult to define, so I’m going for a little bump called the inion, which is different for everybody, but on my head is a well defined little bump on the back of my skull. My other point of reference will be the space between my eyebrows. This distance is about 35cm, although different heads will no doubt vary by a centimetre or two. The question is, where is the inion on the shroud? If I use shroudscope to measure 35cm from the space between the eyebrows I reach aproximately the upper edges of the ring of blood trickles, where, one might suppose, the thorns of the crown jammed against the skull. If I measure to the lower edges of the trickles – another 4cm or so, then I am assuming that the ring of piercings was much higher up the crown of the head, and, perhaps oddly, that no blood flowed down the hair below the inion, which seems odd. That’s why I think the inion was in the former place, and the eyebrow-inion distance does not admit of a substantial extra flap of cloth between the two heads, although, as I have consistently maintained, it does admit of a bit of separation due to cloths, caps or something similar.\n\n","date":"March 11, 2014 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-87302","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"I am happy to defer the title of resident G.O.M. to Dan if that’s his preference. \nHowever when it is others’ time in due course to become grumpy old men, I hope that they are able to find more pressing commitments and interesting topics to occupy their minds than reading interminable, incessant verbiage of self-inflated weakly-argued opinion from those with considerably less life-experience than themselves, the happy situation which I now enjoy.\n\n","date":"March 11, 2014 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-87430","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"Re YC’s Turin Sindon (TS)man body’s wrapping alleged ‘reconstruction’, most obviously YC is neither  an archaeo(cryptoo)logist, nor an ancient bloodstain pattern analyst not even a linguist.\nMost likely, shortly prior to the stiff rigid body image formation, the TS, used as moistened long inner shroud, was FIRST tightly wrapped up lengthwise around the body all covered in freshly dried blood to account for such accurate front and back haematic cartography. In other words, the TS was FIRST moulding the body front and back (even the back of the kees!), no question!\nBesides,this would be totally consistent with the 3 koiné Greek words used in the Gospels to descruibe Yeshu’s body as encircled/wrapped – compressed/tightly wrapped – fastened/bound in shrouds along with spices, which could include fresh flower heads used as insect repellent.\nThe TS man’s dressing in shrouds needed 5-6 buriers on hasty burial (i.e. within 2 hours – 2 hours and a half with only four out of five of the core burial procedures performed: \n0/the long inner buial shroud is in-soaked/moistened with (warm?)\nalkaline waters\n1/then it is taut in extra height on two raised stones or piles of bags of spices\n2/then the in-soaked/moistened inner burial cloth is tautly wrapped lengthwise around the body stiff rigid as a wooden board\n3/the latter’s ‘hills’ and ‘valleys’ front and back are  manally moulded while compressed widhwise with other (dry) burial shrouds (along with spices and objects)\n4/then the tightly wrapped up stiff rigid body, once placed on its right side and in extra height on the 2 raised stones or piles of bags of spices, is subjected to a ritual (myrrhic aloetic) fumigation (acting in conjunction with body hyperthermia?)in order to dry out the long inner burial shroud moulding the body front and back\n5/then the compressed long inner burial shroud gradually and slightly comes unstuck from skin till it gets sort of taut again through drying out and shrinking (only first close contact AND then gradual loss of cloth-to-body contact through gradual pressure release can account for such a high definition/volumetric recording front and back of the stiff rigid body image on the TS inner side since basically the physical-chemical reaction shall have been anaerobic back and front and collimated thanks to ‘opaques’ present in desert and/or limestone dust)\n6/ as a result the dried out long inner shroud is no longer tightly compressed widthwise but sort of taut again through shrinking, which implies two cloth-to-body configurations: one to account for the TS neat blood imprint and another for the high definition/volumetric body image (a fact that is curently and most curiously overlooked by both ‘fraudulists’ and ‘supernaturalists’ and even most ‘naturalists’) \n7/ most likely the body, once tightly wrapped up in the shrouds (= koiné Gr. othonia), is finally encircled in a all-envelopping shroud (Heb. sovev, Jerusalem Heb.-Aram. sudara, koiné Greek soudarion, see the Kornelimunster “Sudarium” as representative or genuine relic of Yeshua’s burial)\n8/ thus most likely the reaction of Maillard was interrupted via corpse fumigation.

The answer to your question is very simple : In Jerusalem, at the time of Christ, there were many rich families of Jews (often associated with the Saducees) who were hellenised (i.e. living in the Greak way).  The Pagan coins you mentioned that were found in Jewish tombs of that period must have been found in Hellenistic Jewish tombs.  \nHaving said that, I just want to add :  Jesus was NOT an hellenistic Jew.  He was a Galilean Jew from the crowd.  Because of this (including the fact that his preaching was completely opposed to the Saducees philosophy), it is highly unlikely that Pagan coins were used during his hasty burial.  Of course, some (like you probably) could think that Joseph of Arimatea and/or Nicodemus could have been hellenistic Jews and, therefore, could have used Pagan coins for the burial of Jesus, but this is a pretty wild assumption that, to me, should not considered as probable.  We must remember that other people were present at Jesus’ burial (like John and his mother) and those people were NOT hellenistic Jews.  I just don’t see those good faithful Jews allowing Joseph and/or Nicodemus to place Pagan coins over the eyes of the man they considered as the Jewish Christ…\n\n","date":"March 14, 2014 at 10:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-88718","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"I would like to add that studying history of mankind is very important to understand our present world because, it is a proven fact that history constantly repeats itself!

If present it would not be due to “seepage” but to some other cause associated with whatever the image process mechanism was. Barrie Schwortz and other authors wrote a paper, I think during the last 12 months dismissing the claim. I haven’t been able to find the reference in my files but it is probably on Barrie’s shroud.com site.  Dan gave it a posting and there was much discussion debating it at the time. The authors dismissed the allegation claiming it was a form of pareidolia. The human mind has evolved so that it quickly tends to see faces which in fact might not be there.  I personally felt that I could see such an image and I thought it precipitate to dismiss it so readily. Unfortunately there seems to be no reliable technical means at present to confirm whether such images have a reality or are merely pareidolia. The authors had attempted such an approach but I was personally unconvinced by it.  My personal view remains that there may in fact be such an image, but it remains uncertain.

In other words, they are not “superficial images” but in the thickness of the linen fabric and do completely run through the material (capillary action). They  are dried fluid images. This is pretty obvious ONLY when the said areas are observed in transmtted light or from photograph taken in transmitted light (see 1988 Riggi photographs). French Shroud scholar Marcel Alonso noticed it well before me:\n“L’hypothèse de la double superficialité de l’image (Fanti, Rogers, 2005) est démentie par l’image en transmission prise par Riggi en 1988, qui montre qu’elle existe bien dans l’épaisseur du tissu.” and “les images par transmission laissent voir un léger épaississement des fils, dans les mailles (pourtant lâches), confirmant la présence de l’image dans la profondeur du tissage. En effet, les fils dont le diamètre est 100 fois plus grand que les fibres n’ont pu piéger un surcroît de liquides, colloïdes et particules associées, qu’aux points de contacts entre eux. Ce seront les zones ayant retenu dans leurs mailles le plus de fluides qui apparaîtront après séchage les plus sombres (celles au contact des cheveux, moustache, barbe, sourcils…). C’est une preuve supplémentaire en faveur du principe d’image capillaire, opposé au à celui d’image radiative.”\n(the above-mentioned observations are extracted from a paper entitled “Le Linceul est-il Surnaturel ?” Alonso wrote in 2005).\nOn February , 2012, I quoted French Shroud scientist Marcel Alonso: “The hypothesis of the double superficiality of the [face Shroud] image (Fanti, Rogers, 2005) is belied by the image in transmitted light taken by Riggi in 1988. [To the sole exception of the right side of the Shroud man’s long flowing hair], the image shows that it does exist in the thickness of the fabric.” \nIn spite of image enhancement, most of the left side of the face actually does not even clearly appear on the backside of the long\nlinen cloth.

If the image was formed on the carbohydrate coating produced as a result of evaporation, it would seem that there might be a few areas where the carbohydrates did not entirely migrate to the surface, but there were a few places where it was left in the body of the cloth, allowing the image to form therein.  On the obverse side of the cloth there should be a coating, some of the body vapours would penetrate between the fibres and allow an image to form on the obverse.

However, it is directly contradicted by a number of books whose authors claim that the reverse was the case. Jewish coins were only permitted to be of bronze or copper (and were all aniconic), and only silver coins were allowed in the temple. Tyrian coins fitted the bill, as they were not minted by Romans directly, and had a high and stable silver content. The money changers therefore changed Jewish bronze coins into Tyrian silver ones, not the other way round. Curiously, perhaps, Tyrian coins were not aniconic at all, but apparently gave no offence.\nSimilarly, there seems considerable dispute about the archaeological evidence for coins in Jewish burials. Jason’s Tomb (excavated by Prof. Rahmani in 1967), as mentioned by Max above, was indeed littered with coins, and Prof. Rahmani’s categorical statement from 1980: “No coins of the period 50 BC to 70 AD were found in any tomb,” is a curious contradiction.

I had somehow in my mind associated Matt 22:17-21 as a sort of temple tax paid as a tribute to Caesar, which was way off the mark. One of the sources I’ve now checked explains the rabbinic rationalisation of using the Baal inscribed Tyrian silver piece for the temple tax that it was 97% silver whereas the Roman coinage was only 80%; They apparently considered it more important that the correct amount of silver be paid to the temple rather than the prohibition of such an image as Baal. When the Romans closed the Tyrian mint, it was a Jewish mint near Jerusalem that then minted these coins. The Romans did not want to allow an impression of Jewish independence to be created by lettng them mint specifically Jewish coins, and as the Baal coins were acceptable before, that design had to stand. \nThe purpose of the money changers was for the exchange of common coinage for the temple coins.

However I’m also open to the likelihood that practices which had originated with some religious or even a more practical purpose in mind, can also have a tendency to survive long after the original  purpose has been forgotten so that they become more of a cultural practice or social habit.  \nPalestine had at the time a cosmopolitan population, so that there would even be cross-exchanges of practices.  I see it in NZ all the time, with various ethnic practices migrating into other cultures. I know families of European ethnicity who after the birth of a child will imitate the Maori practice of burying the after-birth sac and plant a tree over it; the tree becomes the child’s own special tree. \nHere’s a variation which you may have come across when in the Middle East.  A lady acquaintance with family working in Arabia, claims that the original purpose in wearing the burkha was to protect the eyes from desert sand-storms. The practice was retained even when families migrated away from desert environments, so that it became a cultural practice.  Finally, of course it became a religious obligation. I have no idea whether her story has factual substance or not, or whether you are able to corroborate it, but it certainly seems plausible. Back in the 1970s, the psychologist Eric Berne was asserting that many such social rituals, frequently had once served a useful practical purpose, but subsequently had merely become ritualised.  \nWe have 3rd and 4th century sources that asserted that the spreading of altar cloths were intended to represent Christ’s burial cloths.  As a eucharistic minister I am required to lay out a corporal cloth on the altar before Mass.  I am sure that I would be one of the very few ministers aware of the alleged origins of this practice. All such practices have a tendency to survive long after their original intent has been forgotten. However they may be rationalised in other ways.\n\n","date":"March 19, 2014 at 4:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-90704","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"Dave, \nI do agree with you for most of what you wrote. Methinks The placing of coins over the deceased eyes is sort of an original recycling of the Hellenistic custom of placing a coin or two in the deceased’s mouth. \nMost likely, there were specific circumstances in which (rich?) Judean buriers or mourners recurred to placing coins over eyes not only to prevent the deceased’s eyelids to lift up or to hide his/her open/half open eyes but also to honour the deceased’s memory and abide by the Halakha(Judean religious law)when the eulogy was not allowed to be pronounced. \nIn the years 2003-2004, my personal investigation of the issue led me to seriously consider the possibility of coins central devices and/or legend to be used (within Second Temple period Judean context) in a manner of  puzzle or rebus (i.e. via image and word plays in Hebrew, Aramaic and even Greek) to have silent eulogy. Reminder: no eulogy for instance should be pronounced during burials occuring in the month of Nissan. Now in the hypothesis the TS man is Yeshua, he was put to death in the very month of Nissan at a time when most definitely a eulogy just could not be pronounced over his body (today it is allowed/\ntolerated to pronounce a eulogy only over great Torah Teachers’ bodies though).\nI even went as far as reconstructing both a short and long version of the TS man’s silent eulogy by means of Pilate coins symbols and legends (see my 2005 unpublished paper “Linceul de Turin : L’Eloge Funèbre du Christ Retrouvée ? ou Tentative de décrytptage d’un très singulier rebus monétaire”).\n\n","date":"March 19, 2014 at 9:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-90756","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"The idea that the coins on eyes, on Jesus, were a rebus is novel.

Everything we can see (that we all agree that we see) on that image is organic based: blood, human flesh, hair. However the image was formed (gases, light, heat) it appears to be connected to the body itself. How then did the coins, which are metal and not organic, leave an image? If anything they should have blocked image formation over the eyes or wherever they fell.\nFlowers…maybe…as they are organic might have allowed for image transfer.\nBut here’s another question, as long as we are musing. I think of how microwave radiation can cook meat yet leave the paper towel covering it unaltered. Could some form of exterior light or radiation discharge have altered the body inside the linen, leaving the image without affecting the linen itself. I suppose this is merely a reverse idea to Fanti’s corona discharge hypothesis – where (if I’m correct) the thought is that the energy started inside and progressed outward.\n\n","date":"March 21, 2014 at 3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-91649","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area","post":"To David,\nOn March 13, 2014 at 6:51 pm | #100 Reply I wrote:  “Actually the body image resolution is 0.5cm while the blood image (and thus any blood smeared object images) resolution is 0.4-0.5mm.
