In my opinion, it’s not just a matter of blood being on the Shroud, but it is forensically accurate with characteristics of correct gravity flow, clotting with properties of serum halos at the edges, only visible under uv light.   Also, from an artistic standpoint alone, I think it would be difficult to first create the bloodstains, then construct the image around them.\nThe issue of human versus animal blood is a very interesting one.  This would probably best be addressed in a separate post as there are several important points here.  The blood does appear to be human, although certain of the original studies stretched the interpretation, in my opinion.  Adler & colleagues were always (appropriately) cautious in concluding that their immunological tests only demonstrated that the blood was of primate origin.  The problem is that although a test reagent may be labeled as anti-human (meaning it was made against human albumin or human immunoglobulin, for example), it doesn’t mean that it reacts exclusively with human blood products.  Proteins in other species that are similar will also react.  Chimp albumin differs from human albumin by only 6 out of 580 amino acids.  Unless the antibody is specific for a region involving those 6, it will most likely react react with chimp (and likely other similar species).  In fact, certain antibody subclasses were discovered in chimpanzees using anti-human reagents.  \nThe AB blood typing results help somewhat here, chimps don’t express the B molecule, gorillas show poor reactivity with most ABO reagents, especially the A molecule.  Orangutans & gibbons express ABO similar to humans.  \nABO is just one of about 30 different classes of blood group molecules expressed on red blood cells.  Bollone & colleagues examined the MNS group in 1985, primarily I believe for ethnicity correlations of blood type.  These molecules were also examined in the serological studies of King Tut.  Anyway, all primates express M,N molecules, but S expression is restricted to humans.  No S counterpart is present in other species.  The blood on the Shroud is positive for MNS.  In my opinion, the blood typing (AB & MNS characterization) is really the most definite evidence that the blood is of human origin.  Together, the data lead to the conclusion that the blood is human blood.  Potential cross-reactivity is too much of an issue in much of the earlier work to conclusively make the claim that the blood is human, although these are the experiments that are typically believed to support this claim.\nCertain bloodstains on the Oviedo look similarly red to me, although much of the stains around the face appear to be mixed/diluted with pulmonary fluid, issued from the nose & mouth.  I don’t believe that the bloodstains on the Oviedo cloth have been as extensively characterized chemically as those on the Shroud, but everything that has been reported seems to be consistent.\nThanks very much for your questions-very interesting thoughts.   \nKelly\n\n","date":"February 16, 2012 at 10:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8377","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Bravo Dr Kelly Kearse\nMy husband who is a medical doctor and a Shroud researcher commented that at last someone from the medical field shed some light on the AB controversy of the blood on the Shroud.\nThus this is a very important independent statement on red stains on the Shroud concluding on the basis of Dr John Heller,Dr Alan Adler and Professor Pierluigi Baima Bollone’s studies that red stains are indeed blood and Dr. McCrone’s theory of red ochre and vermillion is to be dismissed once more.\nI congratulate with all previous comments, this blog is really awesome!\nShroudies gotta praise Dr. Kelly Kearse’s amazing work, my husband said it’s excellent and crystal clear there is nothing more to add on this matter and this is one of the best posts ever published on this blog\n                                          regards\n                                     Maria da Glória\n                               Centro Português de Sindonologia\n\n","date":"February 17, 2012 at 5:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8387","author":"Maria da Glória Gonçalves Barroso","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Thank you again, Kelly for your balanced and clear answers. You mentioned the fact that the blood appears to be on the cloth before the image,  hence ruling out (or at least making it highly difficult to get proper registration between blood marks and body). Just to drill down a bit into this bit of information:\n1)how do we know for sure that the blood was there before the body image – I saw mention of blood being scraped off in one place to reveal no image underneath. Do you know if this was done in a number of places or just the one? \n2)and how do we know that the blood didnt dissolve the image material underneath it? To answer my own last question, I think I saw Ray Rodgers tried various solvents unsuccessfully  on this outer coating material, but did he try blood as a solvent? \n3)do you know if the whip marks are a combination of welt marks (eg dumbell shapes etc) and blood marks. If whip marks are such a combination, they make a good study to whether it was likely that blood was painted onto the cloth separate to the body image.\n There was a method (certainly known during the Renaissance if not earlier) called pouncing by means of which a flat drawing could be transferred to another surface (by pricking holes along the outline and important contour lines on the original drawing, placing the drawing on top of final surface and pouncing with charcoal dust in a bag through the holes), so it is theoretically possible that a forger could know where a flat 2d body image would eventually lay, and hence put blood at the appropriate places before the image is transferred. This however would only work accurately for a flat image transfer, whereas a 3d or bas-relief would pull linen away from those originally sketched positions….Not to mention that it would be a very awkward way for any artist to work.\nSorry if I appear to have a sceptical mind, but its more to determine how much wiggle room there is for doubt.

Several examples that illustrate flows in the vertical position are the wound in the side (Feature B), trickles along the forearms (Feature D), puncture wounds on the head (Feature E) and the wrist wound (Feature C). Conversely, the bloodstain across the small of the back (Feature F) and the trickle at the dorsal foot (Feature G-1) correspond to a body oriented in the horizontal position. The latter set of bloodstains depict liquid and, therefore, presumably late time post-mortem flows.

In my opinion, science can never prove the Shroud’s authenticity, it can only disauthenticate it.  In kind, I believe that the totality of the evidence is what must be considered when in forming an opinion about the Shroud.  Science is driven by an innate desire to know and objectivity is the name of the game.  I believe that skepticism is healthy and the amount of wiggle room that’s there will vary individually.  Whether one believes the Shroud is the real deal or a grand fake, anyone interested wants to know/understand how the image got there.\nIn the Heller & Adler experiments, the blood was digested off by proteolytic enzymes, revealing colorless fibers underneath.  I’m not sure exactly how many different samples bloodstained areas were tested.  Treatment of image fibers with proteases had no effect on color.  I don’t know if Rogers ever directly examined the effect of blood on the image.  If a negative result were obtained, it could always be argued that in the case of the Shroud, the incubation time was much longer (weeks? months? etc?).\nRegarding the whip marks, some of the ultraviolet light studies reveal additional skin abrasions/markings that aren’t as apparent in normal, visible light.

Part of me says Jesus would have a LOT of blood on him after the scourging and crucifixion but there doesn’t seem to be a corresponding amount of blood on the shroud as I would theorize there would be. In this sense I can agree with Zugibe but I am not a forensic expert in this regard and therefore don’t really know. But then there seems to be some blood left over from the crucifixion like the blood on the face, head and the arms. Part of me wonders if there was a quick wash with a wet cloth over most of the body along with a hasty wrapping in the shroud with the intent to finish the job on Sunday. The Gospels are not clear about when the spices were to be applied despite Max’s assertions. I tend to think what generally happened was Jesus had a hasty burial that was to be completed after the Sabbath on Sunday. I also wonder if that strip down the side of the shroud was used like John Jackson supposes which is to say it tied up the whole body or if in the case of a hasty burial where the ritual spices were to be used later it was used just to tie the arms in place to hold them down. It could then be easily untied and the burial ritual could be continued and completed fairly easy.\nOne thing I’m coming away from this discussion is that it’s definitely real blood on the shroud regardless of the color of it. It’s really just a matter of determining what mechanisms make for the color. \nTruthfully, I was never really swayed about the bright red color objection from skeptics because anecdotally I’ve had plenty of bandaids come off my own body and the blood has remained bright red even after days.

Hense the reason not much dirt has been found on the body! Dirt has only been found on the sole of the feet, tip of the nose and I think the chin and one knee.

Yeah, I’m starting to think we’re closer to the truth than not. One thing I thought was a really interesting detail that Jackson pointed out in his video was the bloodstain off the right elbow and how it corresponded with the shroud being tucked under the arm during wrapping. Not a detail that speaks to forgery is it? But it certainly is indicative that the shroud was wrapped in some way instead of just loosely laid over the body. \nAlso, there not being any traces of spices seems to negate Max’s assumptions though I respect that it was probably the intended burial ritual. I don’t think they had time to execute it and it seems very involved. I would also think that there would be more capillary evidence on the shroud with the blood spanning out had it been soaked. The blood on the hair doesn’t really bother me as I think Jackson is right when he supposes that it was not really on the hair but on the sides of the face and the cloth came away before the image was made. If the strip was used only to tie the arms to keep them from spanning out during rigor mortis then someone may have smoothed the shroud over the head and it eventually moved away or collapsed due to not being tensioned or tied.

Both shall be put in the right perspective.\n  In the light of the Judean ethnic miileu of the Second Temple period, the inference is Yeshua’s buriers used a mixture of pulverized aloes wood and myrrh (i.e. a blend of one perfume and one spice) to fumigate his corpse (purifying & drying-up ritual) and perfumed his “tomb-bed”. On the 3rd day of Yeshua’s death, the aromatic/spicy ointment the women brought was intended to ONLY anoint Yeshua’s burial linen cloths/sheets as women would not have been entitled to anoint a male naked body! Only a small quantity of ointment was required which any of the women could easily carry in alabaster vases.\n  The post-entombment ointement was meant to prevent bad odours as the Judean custom of the time was to pay visits to the deceased’s cave tomb the week that follows his death.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2012 at 10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8431","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Correction: “and perfume his tomb-bed”\n\n","date":"February 18, 2012 at 10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8432","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Chris you wrote: “there not being any traces of spices seems to negate Max’s assumptions though I respect that it was probably the intended burial ritual”.\nThere are myrrhic-aloetic particles in the threads not on the surface (Baima-Bollone) of the Shroud and on the surface of the Sudariumf of Oviedo!\nAccording to Danim, they are also plan & floral images e.g. Crown Daisy fresh heads which are medical flowers to wit in Greek “aromaton”, spices.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2012 at 2:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8441","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Correction: “According to Danin, there also are plant & floral images such as those of crown daisy fresh heads which, as medical flowers (and fly repellent) can be rendered by the Greek word “aromaton”, spices.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2012 at 2:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8443","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"In two previous post I wrote:\n1/ “Rabbi Yeshua was laid on the stone bench of the tomb’s unique (Heb. aHad) funerary niche (Heb. kokh, maqôm).

For one thing, not all the ‘blood’ material is red, for its color ranges from yellow to orange to red to brown. Also, the ‘blood’ is not whole blood, but exudate from a blood clot (when a blood clot dries, it contracts, exuding liquid blood material). The ‘blood’ moreover is blood clot exudate from a beaten, traumatized individual.A traumatic beating would destroy red blood cells, and the red cell debris would go to the liver, which in turn would take the debris’s hemoglobin and convert it to the bile pigment bilirubin.\nBilirubin levels in the blood would rapidly rise, meaning that should a cut form, the resulting blood clot’s exudate will contain serum albumin (a protein found in blood serum), and that albumin will bring with it bilirubin. The clot exudate’s hemoglobin oxidizes to become “methemoglobin,” which is reddish-brown/ brown; this reddish-brown/ brown + the yellow-orange bilirubin = red.”\nIn other words, many of the various puzzles regarding the blood are actually further evidence of authenticity. In this case, we have evidence that it’s not just any human blood, but blood from a heavily traumatized individual, and furthermore that it’s partial blood exuded from already drying blood clots, rather than whole liquid blood painted on.\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8481","author":"The Deuce","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"“There is always a well-known solution to every human problem–neat, plausible, and wrong.”\nH.L.Mencken\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 7:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8486","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"The last time that was famously used it didn’t work out too well for the person who quoted it.\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 11:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8495","author":"Chris","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"It is but one step from healthy scepticism to downright cycnicism!\n   “I am too much of a sceptic to deny the possibility of anything.”  T H Huxley\n   “cynic: a blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be.”        Ambrose Bierce: ‘The Devil’s Dictionary’ \n   “Cynicism is intellectual dandyism without the coxcomb’s feathers” Gerge Meredith: ‘The Egoist’\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 10:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8492","author":"Daveb of Wellington NZ","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Alan D Adler (RIP) was a bombastic blowhard, someone who couldn’t admit when he was wrong, a surly curmudgeon, a right b*stard (not to put too fine a point on it) a large man who bullied, ranted, and argued about everything, He was, above all, LOUD, but a loveable maniac all the same   ;-).\n\n","date":"February 20, 2012 at 2:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-8501","author":"colinsberry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"And who is speaking here?

I would like to call this the “primeval fold” as it belongs to the very first folding after the Shroud had been finished. Those folds are due to the production process of the fabric, they are not the result of using the fabric.” Now if we rely on Flury-Lemberg’s observation and since the primeval fold is 6.2cm±0.5cm off-centred, one can easily deduce the Shroud originally was 6.2cm±0.5cm wider than it is to-day. The re-sewn side-strip being 9cm wide (7cm wide as it appears at first sight), then it would mean a second side-strip 4-2cm±0.5cm might well have been cut off for burial purpose. Archaeologically speaking, it could then be an ALTERNATIVE to the “side-strip hypothesis.

Thank you.\n\n","date":"September 9, 2012 at 8:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-16074","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Actually, I calculated back and Ian Wilson’s book was released in 1978 or 1979 and the conferences I attended given by Dr. Alan Adler were about 1985 and he was associated with STURP.\n\n","date":"September 9, 2012 at 9:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-16075","author":"Angel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"Collinsberry  could you please stop the annoying sarcastic sophomoric comments- they dont add any useful info otherwise I’m thoroughly enjoying this discussion!\nThanks\n\n","date":"September 29, 2012 at 1:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-17059","author":"Peter LoGiudice","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly","post":"\nDennis Goller :\nScience knows ABSOLUTELY for sure that the blood was spilled on the cloth prior to the image appearing. There is NO WAY an artist could have spilled blood on the Shroud perfectly both Anatomically and Forensically speaking, AND THEN created an image around it. NO WAY. The image is only 2 MICROMETERS deep on the MICROFIBERS of the shroud. THERE IS NOTHING that science is aware of that could of done this. Please read up. Skepticism is perfectly normal, however you must realize what the Shroud IS NOT. Please people, if you want to know the FACTS research anything that BARRIE SCHWORTZ has written and visit http://www.theshroud.com. Scientific Fact. These findings on this site are legit and have stood before scientific peer review. These findings are not to persuade people. It is what it is, SCIENTIFIC FACT. Opinions only matter when you have armed yourself with the correct and factual information. Barrie was on the original STURP team that studied the shroud in 1978 and has committed his life, non-profit, to the findings and research of the Turin Shroud. He is the leading spokesperson on the subject, period. If you go to youtube.com you can listen to an excellent non-biased interview with him on Coast to Coast radio. An EXCELLENT interview that will answer many questions and remove many of the “what if’s”. Thank you, this wasn’t intended as an insult to anyone.\n\nScience knows ABSOLUTELY for sure…\nExactly which experiment/set of experiments is this?\nJust asking.\nHypothetically speaking, could an artist have placed a bloodied body in the canvas as a starting point?\nJust asking.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2013 at 4:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-59519","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"}]
