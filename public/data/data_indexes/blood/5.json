Didias, gladiator is using a two or three thonged flagrum against an opponent.  Vignon claimed that taller man stood on the right and that shorter man stood on left and had a tendency to whip the legs;  they could also aim their flagra to whip around to the front of the body and leave scourge marks there.  I’m not aware that Vignon ever identified marks left by the fascia typically used by lictors, as do F & F.  \n I see a difficulty in interpreting the results as F & F have used Photoshop type imaging enhancement techniques to obtain their images, even to the extent of eiiminating the background herring-bone (fishbone sic) weave – the pixels have moved!  Question has to be “Are we seeing fascia type marks, or are we seeing an unsought byproduct of the claimed image enhancements?”  I suspect it may need some further corroboration, before conceding that F&F have definitely identified previously unrecognised injuries.\n\n","date":"June 20, 2012 at 6:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/20/berry-shroud-was-scourged-not-the-man-a-critical-look-at-faccini-and-fanti/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-12763","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Berry: Shroud was Scourged, Not the Man.

Instead, he proposed a theory that the permanent red colour of “blood” on the Shroud had amazingly survived despite centuries of exposure to light, air etc, and was the result of his novel hypothesis involving complexation between a trauma-induced novel oxidation state of oxidised haemoglobin AND a trauma-induced outpouring of bilirubin.

I spent the first two years of my research career in Philadelphia studying the mechanism of phototherapy of neonatal jaundice, in particular the way in which bilirubin degrades when exposed to light and oxygen.

Is it entirely blood, in which case it is a subset of “bloodstains” and presumably imprinted on the cloth at the same time as bloodstains, while having a distinctive morphology (dumbbells etc), OR is it an acquired detail of body morphology that is imprinted along with the rest of the body features, which just happens to have also acquired a thin film of blood to make it a hybrid marking on the Shroud – part image/part blood? \n Methinks there is a growing credibility gap where those “scourge marks” are concerned. But then some of us have been growing increasingly incredulous about “bloodstains” too from seeing how they look remarkably “image-like” under the Shroud Scope, i.e. confined to the ribs of the weave, with no penetration worth speaking of into the furrows.

Its an interesting observation but easily explained by Newton’s physics. The momentum of the lead weights makes them travel deep into the flesh, dragging the leather between them inspite of the leather having too little momentum by itself to penetrate the flesh. However the bit of leather attaching to the handle and near the point of attachment to the lead though dragged with the weight will flex back on hitting the flesh as it hasn’t got sufficient momentum to penetrate (in contrast to the leather between the weights which is constrained to be between the lead weights and so cant flex back).
