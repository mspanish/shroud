Unfortunately, that database does not exist and so far, we only have a few unconnected studies here and there corresponding to different moments of history.\nIn the absence of such an extensive database, the most important difficulty about AB being old is that until now, the oldest evidences of mixtures between European and Asian population dated back to 9th-10th century in Hungary.\nThe relevance of this paper is that this indirect argument and -the most important difficulty I have come through so far- can now be ruled out and at least, we have here an important example dating back to the Iron Age.\nSo now, we cannot say how old is the AB blood group, but certainly other arguments -not put forward so far- should be used  because, certainly there were mixtures of lineages before 900 AD in Hungary and after this paper, nothing is against dating back AB blood type (or any group like O)  to at least 1st century or before.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2012 at 1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/early-evidence-of-ab-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-19047","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Early Evidence of AB Blood","post":"The possibility is there but in the present state of knowledge the presumption is that an AB blood sample dates from after AD 900, That  presumption may,of course, be overthrown,\n\n","date":"November 15, 2012 at 2:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/early-evidence-of-ab-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-19051","author":"Charles Freeman","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Early Evidence of AB Blood","post":"Which are the foundations for this presumption?

He should discard it, but it seems to be the one thing that enables him to doubt the Shroud’s authenticity, so that is a problem for him,    \nAn inspection of any reputable table of distribution of blood groups reveals how tenuous a basis this myth has.  Although A group is dominant in Europe, both A and B groups are found throughout Asia in comparable proportions, and AB is significant.  Also even populations that have long been isolated have AB occurring (Ainu and Kalmuks).  \nIf the Shroud is authentic, then it originated in the Middle East, and mid-European.blood group distributions are irrelevant.  Percentage distributions of O, A, B, AB, groups are as follows: Arabs – 34, 31, 29, 6;  Hindus – 32, 29, 28, 11;  Tartars – 28, 30, 29, 13.  One could go on, but check the figures on web-site:  http://www.bloodbook.com/world-abo.html \nCuriously, NZ Maoris and other Polynesian races are believed to have originated in China, where there are now significant percentages of all blood groups, with significant differences between Cantonese and Pekingese, yet NZ Maori remain dominantly O and A.     \nI would remind readers that Alexander the Great arrived in the Indus Valley in 327 BC, and it would not be surprising then if AB blood group was common in the Middle East in New Testament times.  \nPresent blood group classification orignates in 1901, and there could have been little interest in typing  of blood groups before then.\n\n","date":"November 15, 2012 at 8:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/early-evidence-of-ab-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-19089","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"}]
