[{"title":"The Big 3 Issue or  “Jesus simply misspoke”","post":"Georges Ifrah discusses the origins and forms of Hindu-Arabic numerals comprehensively in Ch 29 of his “From One to Zero”. The essential features are that it is a denary system, with 10 separate symbols including a zero place-holder. The only other system that came anywhere near to it in sophistication, was the Babylonian base-60 system of about 1000 BCE. It found its way into the West, through the Moors in Spain and North Africa, initially by Pope Sylvester around 1000AD, and subsequently by Leonardo Fibonacci around 1200AD.  It had earlier spread through South-East Asia, but with symbols particular to local ethnic scripts, and their writing implements. Very likely it entered China through Indian Buddhism, but this is debated.    \nSyrian bishop Severus Sebokht refers to the superiority of the system in the 7th century, in chastising the mathematical arrogance of the Greeks.  The earliest alleged known examples are Sanskrit copper plate deeds from the 6th to 10th centuries concerning properties granted to Brahman religious authorities. Other examples are stone inscriptions, including a date corresponding to 875AD, and numbered verses of a poem. \nThe ‘3’ symbol on the forehead of the TSM, is the result of a blood-flow across a furrowed brow.  Those with a penchant for number mysticism will want to make something of it, but essentially it is merely pareidolia, an accidental pattern. If a Trinity symbol is to be sought, then the Nicene Creed has the Holy Spirit as No.3, not God incarnate. \nThe book of Jonah is neither an historical nor prophetic book, there are no oracles as in all other prophetic books.  Essentially it is a post-exilic satire about a reluctant prophet, the only character in the work, a Jew, who comes out of it badly. It was directed against the exclusiveness of a post-exilic Judaism, with its policy of a pure blood race of Jews that the reformers Ezra and Nehemiah had implemented in the 5th century. \nAnd it’s a fish, not a whale.  This should say something to us about the non-literal nature of the work.  It is interesting that all other characters in the story (non-Jewish) are made to look good, all except poor old Jonah! Jonah eventually comes to the realization that God was a universal God, and not the sole property of Israel, the essential intent of the story. \nI’m no great fan of Marcus Borg, but his solution of the “three days” in the tomb is on the money as far as I’m concerned. \nJesus might well have appreciated the essentially fictional nature of the Jonah story, after all most of what he had to say was expressed in parables. I see no problem in his using it to express its close analogy with his being in the tomb.\n\n","date":"December 4, 2013 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/04/the-big-3-issue-or-jesus-simply-misspoke/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-56288","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Big 3 Issue or  “Jesus simply misspoke”","post":"I always found Mat.12:40 so remarkably precise, because of the very specific conjunction between the two specifications ‘three days and three nights’ & ‘at the heart of the earth’. Indeed, with a time span of one and a half days at some point on the surface of the earth, will correspond a total of  ‘three days and three nights’, as seen from the ‘heart’ of the earth. As seen from the center of the earth, day and night always occur together, in a completely equivalent way. From that very special vantage point, a time span of 12 hours corresponds to ‘one day and one night’. In 24 hours, you wil have a day followed by a night at one side of the earth, together with a night followed by  day at the opposite side; so 24 hours  2 days + 2 nights. And so on.\n\n","date":"December 4, 2013 at 6:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/04/the-big-3-issue-or-jesus-simply-misspoke/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-56291","author":"Jos Verhulst","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Big 3 Issue or  “Jesus simply misspoke”","post":"Dan, I know Devanagari (Hindi) and it is a long time that I have not used it. Hindi is derived from Sanskrit, which is said to have come from the Indo-Iranian (Indo-European) group of languages.

He believed that there was some link with the Sumerian-Egyptian civilisation and wrote a masterpiece. He also speculated that the “three kings” were from India, having found people in North West India taking gifts such as gold and frankincense when a child was born.\nSee:\nhttp://indianpost.com/viewstamp.php/Color/Purple/HENRY%20HERAS%20&%20INDUS%20VALLEY%20SEAL\nNumber 3 can also be holy in Hinduism because of the “Trimurthi”, the deity as creator, preserver and destroyer. The cosmology in that country interested J. Robert Oppenheimer and Carl Sagan, both Jewish atheists, the latter believing that the ancient Hindus had dated the creation of the universe correctly. But surely all this has nothing to do with the 3 seen on the Shroud?\n\n","date":"December 4, 2013 at 11:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/04/the-big-3-issue-or-jesus-simply-misspoke/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-56325","author":"Louis","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Big 3 Issue or  “Jesus simply misspoke”","post":"Interesting comments on the numbers, Louis. Not only Dravidian Tamil, but Ifrah tabulates several other examples extending as far as Cambodia, Sumatra and Tibet. On the pronunciation of the numbers, a Linguistics expert would see a few connections with other Indo-European languages, 2 – duo, 4 – quattuor, 8 – octo, acht; etc. The Sankrit examples shown in Ifrah, even more so. I’d maintain the forehead “3” has no numerical significance, a pareidolia resulting from a blood flow over a furrowed brow. Even if David Goulet below finds it a “fun game”.\n\n","date":"December 4, 2013 at 3:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/04/the-big-3-issue-or-jesus-simply-misspoke/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-56344","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Big 3 Issue or  “Jesus simply misspoke”","post":"That’s right, David.

The body would have been viewed not straight on and from above, but from the side. So clearly it is either a lower case cursive ‘m’ or a ‘w’ – depending on which side you are viewing from.
