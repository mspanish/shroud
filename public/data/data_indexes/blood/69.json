Final sentence of his pdf:\n“In summary, DNA studies have the potential to distinguish if the bloodstains are  representative of a single or multiple individual(s) at the molecular level. Additionally, a molecular biology approach could potentially be used to demonstrate that a DNA signal is present on the Shroud that originates from blood cells.” \nNote the use of the terms “potential” and “potentially”. If reliable data existed to support your assertion for TS blood samples all having “the same DNA”, one might have expected Kelly’s summary to have been somewhat less guarded, dare one say more positive.\nRemember: only a minority of blood cells (the white nucleated ones) have DNA. The vast majority are mature red cells which lack a nucleus. Add to that the fact that TS blood seems largely free of cellular debris (prompting no doubt that Adler/Heller description of TS ‘blood’  as a ‘serum exudate of retracted blood clots’), plus extensive DNA degradation plus adventitious contaminating DNA then it’s unlikely there’ are going to be hard and fast answers for the origins of Shroud DNA, such as it is, any time soon.\n\n","date":"January 29, 2015 at 6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-187172","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"What was your rationale for the monks using leeches theory?

Maybe. But what are the alternatives, given that none of us are free to walk into a certain Turin repository, and ask that a certain case be opened to allow us to probe with our hand lens?\nBut here’s a thing: Alan Adler and John Heller, may they both RIP, despite being billed as members of STURP, did not do that either. They never travelled to Turin with the STURP team. They stayed at home and were content to work on sticky tape samples provided by Ray Rogers, having never seen the sampling sites in situ with their own eyes. So one is fully entitles in my view to view many of their observations and certainly conclusions with a degree of circumspection.\nThe idea that the TS blood is a “serum exudate of retracted blood clots” is one that should be treated with a great deal of scepticism. It appears to be based partly on a failure to see the “formed elements’ of blood, notably red blood cells or even remnants thereof. More importantly, there was a persistent current of narrative-driven comment, what with speculation as to how dried (post-crucifixion) blot clots could leave an imprint, to say nothing of “trauma” bilirubin, and relying on non-specific chemical tests for bilrubin, The latter was almost certainly NOT present!  Adler himslef admitted as much in 2000 in his conservation paper. Bilirubin is far too photosensitive to survive more than a few years, even in dim light, never mind centuries.The phototherapy of neonatal jaundice (which I researched in Philadelphia with the late Don Ostrow for two years) depends on the  marked photo-sensitivity and resulting chemical breakdown of bilirubin.\nIt’s time to stop taking things on trust (Royal Society motto: Nullius in verba– take nobody’s word for it). We have the splendid Shroud Scope that allows us to see things with our own eyes, though it helps to adjust contrast, brightness, midtone settings etc to differentiate one thing from another.\nI’ve just this minute done that with the image that heads this posting.\n\nNote the heterogeneity, hardly what one would expect of a “serum exudate of retracted blood clots”. As I (and Hugh Farey) have consistently maintained for some 2 years or more,  what you see is probably a partially detached blood stain, with some parts more intense than others. The fluorescent halo of the stain above (wrist blood) is not around the entire stain. It’s restricted to the small limb you see top left, where the image is most strong. What price a “serum halo” when it is so localized?\nI repeat: Nullius in verba.  It’s time to shelve most if not all the received wisdom where TS imagery is concerned. Much was written before we had access to the Durante 2002 images, and there are almost certainly new insights to be gained from the Halta 2008 high-definition images, once the Vatican sees fit to release them to the public domain and/or bona fide researchers.\n\n","date":"January 29, 2015 at 1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-187264","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Colin:\nThe idea that the TS blood is a “serum exudate of retracted blood clots” is one that should be treated with a great deal of scepticism.

It’s a posting about blood, so I shan’t labour the point, but here are key sentences:\n” We used a previously aged (3h at 215C) linen cloth for the development (sic)of the image”\nand earlier:\nAn absolutely weighed amount of a suitable chemical sensitizer (ed. finally settling on an approx 1% solution of sulphuric acid)can then be added to the neutral pigment (ed. cobalt blue) for precise results.The artificial ageing (sic) that followed consisted of air heating of the linen in an oven for 3h at 140-145 C).\nAs I said earlier, I don’t consider that second heating step should be  be seen or described as an “ageing” process, given that has already occurred, and at a much higher temperature. It’s more to assist with the evaporation of water from the dilute sulphuric acid to make hot viscous concentrated sulphuric acid – a potent chemical dehydrating agent, one that gently pyrolyses linen carbohydrates, leading to chemical changes and yellowing probably not dissimilar from that obtainable by heating without the acid albeit at a much higher temperature. So there’s a sense in which Luigi’s procedure is in essence a process of scorching, the difference being that he can use a live human volunteer and cold acidified pigment for initial imprinting, and then do the oven-baking of the imprinted linen while the volunteer heads off to the shower.\nIf the aim of the exercise in the 14th century was (as I now maintain) to simulate a sweat imprint, then my simple contact scorching off a heated metal  template is just an entry-level model, one that is fine for modelling 3D properties but not much else. Luigi’s model is more sophisticated in terms of dual-stage technology, but the end-result – a negative imprint comprising superficially-pyrolysed linen fibres – is essentially the same chemistry, but achievable at a much lower temperature using dil.sulphuric acid as a sensitizer, and substituting (if desired) a real person for a bronze statue.\n\n","date":"January 31, 2015 at 3:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-187826","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Colin:\nEl “quid” del tema, la ESENCIA, es que la Sábana muestra la impronta de un cuerpo humano REAL.\nTodo lo demás, siendo importante e interesante, tiene un valor muy relativo y secundario.\nPor ello, la casi total mayoría de los médicos que la estudian (y me incluyo) tienen la certeza de su AUTENTICIDAD.\nPero los cuerpos humanos reales NO (negación) dejan esas improntas sobre las “sábanas”……\nPor ello, la casi total mayoría de los médicos que la estudian (y me incluyo) tienen la certeza de su carácter EXCEPCIONAL.\nLa sangre, siendo importante, es secundaria en importancia respecto de la impronta de un cuerpo REAL porque existen INFINIDAD de factores que pueden modificar la forma en que se presenta.\nCualquier teoría de formación de la impronta, incluida la falsificación, tiene que partir de la presencia de un cuerpo humano real.\nCarlos\n\n","date":"January 31, 2015 at 6:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-187865","author":"Carlos","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"As stated earlier, Carlos, the two-step Garlaschelli technology allows one to imprint off a real human being.

That’s not to say that’s any more or less authoritative than Wilson’s ‘blood belt’ description, or the one here (‘chain imprint’). It may simply be the way the badge maker chose to represent unclear features of the Shroud that even he did not fully understand, and that’s before the added complication of the 1532 fire (see below).\nHere’s another thought, maybe out of the box. That Hungarian picture in my previous comment was painted 18 years before the Chambery fire. Maybe the artist had seen the TS, or been given a reasonably accurate description. Maybe the “chain” on the pre-fire TS was  seen to be definitely confined to the body image only, not extending sideways. Maybe what we see today as ‘chain’ extending out onto the linen, erroneously reinforced by the Lirey representation, is just a false impression created by fire damage, water stain or a combination of the two.\nMaybe Leonardo da Vinci took a good photograph of the TS prior to the fire.

Surely a crown of thorns digging into the scalp under the hair would not create the kind of rivulets we see on the surface of the hair on the shroud.\nSurely? Surely it has has made physicians very impressed by the accuracy of those wounds, allowing them to make very detailed descriptions of injuries suffered by Shroud Man.\nThe article of Sebastiono Rodante on this topic is a must read:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi01part5.pdf\nSome interesting quotes:\n“It is necessary to differentiate between puncture wounds caused by a thorn which was implanted in a blood vessel of the head and afterwards removed; and a wound from a thorn injuring a vessel and remaining in situ for a certain period of time. In the first case, there is the issue of blood (arterial or venous, according to the type of vessel injured) until, by the coagulative process at the point of the injury (inside the vessel and in its walls, as well as in the injured cutaneous capillaries)—until a clot forms and therefore the bleeding toward the exterior ceases. In a healthy organism, in which the coagulative factors are normal, this process takes place in a few minutes. Instead, in the Crucified of the Shroud, the crown of thorns must have remained implanted on the head for a certain period of time, either before the crucifixion or during the hours in which he remained on the cross right up until death. In this case, each thorn remaining in situ blocked the issue of blood onto the skin to some extent, depending on the calibre of the perforated vessel. But the spasms of the forehead muscle, contracting because of the pain provoked by the injurystimulus on the sensitive nerve-endings and making the infixed thorn move, kept the thornwound open. If the injured vessel was a vein, there was a determination of blood in a slow and continuous flow, helped in its course by the movements of the wrinkling forehead. However, the perforation of an artery of a certain calibre (such as the frontal branch of the R superficial temple artery), by its own arterial pulsation caused movement at the point of perforation.”\nI would still like to know the basis for your earlier claim that the blood wounds are homogeneous.

In the liver, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronyl transferase converts bilirubin to a mixture of monoglucuronides and diglucuronides, referred to as conjugated bilirubin, which is then secreted into the bile by an ATP-dependent transporter. This process is highly efficient under normal conditions, so plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentrations remain low. \n>A large number of disease states lead to bilirubin accumulation in plasma.

Stability is a relative term, but these are certainly stable relative to the parent tetrapyrroles, bilirubin especially.\nBut there are intermediate products that are less extensively degraded. There’s the isomeric bilirubins with cis-trans transformations involving the vinyl side chain. There are the dioxetanes formed by addition of singlet oxygen across the conjugated double bond systems, and the dihydroxyl derivatives (rhodins etc) that Don Ostrow, John Zarembo and I identified and reported in 1972.\n– What is the color of these products ?\nDipyrroles and mono pyrroles are generally yellow or colourless. Intact oxidised tetrapyrroles and tripyrroles can be green, red, purple or yellow!\n– Do you think that these products could nevertheless give positive tests for “bilirubin” (the tests used by Adler and Heller)?\nNo. It’s the central CH2 bridge of bilirubin that separates the two dipyrrole halves of the molecule that confers the chemical reactivity that enables it to form purple or red products in the Van den Berg reaction with diazotized sulphanilic acid.\nThat central CH2 group is generally the first thing to go when bilirubin is photoxidized, resulting in rapid loss in diazo-reactivity.\n what do you mean by “… and does not store well.”\nOne would find progressively less “bilirubin” if one stored the pigment without proper protection from light and oxygen. One could monitor the oxidation by loss of diazo-reactivity, or by watching the loss of the high Rf orange spot on thin layer chromatography. \nIn other words, can you please explain us why the yellow-green fibers, shards etc. found by Heller and Adler in the blood and serum areas have nothing to do with bilirubin decomposition products?\nRemind me please. Did Heller and Adler identify those yellow-green fibres as being biliverdin or bilirubin photoproducts? If so, what did they deduce from that as regards parent bilirubin, which I say could not possibly have been present after so many centuries exposure to light and oxygen.\nIncidentally, you wrote: ” Adler’s claims are refuted by his own later acknowledgement that bilirubin is photosensitive, being converted, as we’ve said, by light and oxygen to water-soluble degradation products.”\nDo you have the link or the reference?\nhttps://www.shroud.com/adler1.htm\nSee section on non-ionizing radiation.\nI trust that helps.

Nor should  he have made references to “trauma” causing his claimed ‘extraordinary’ levels of bilirubin. In so doing he betrayed a pro-authenticity bias. STURP was there to collect the evidence for or against authenticity – not to go preempting debate with airy-fairy pro-authenticity hypothesizing.\n\n","date":"February 5, 2015 at 1:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-189417","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Sorry Colin, but I have a completely different understanding of this paper.\nYou wrote: “Adler used that section under “Non-ionizing radiation” in his 1993 paper essentially to retract his bilirubin hypothesis.”\nHow can you say that?\nThis title of the paper is  “CONSERVATION of the Shroud of Turin”.\nIt is obvious that Adler never used this paper to “retract” his bilirubin hypothesis.\nHe simply forewarned that, in the context of the conservation of the TS, “OVEREXPOSURE to ultraviolet and/or visible radiation could modify this color,(2) as bilirubin can be readily and quickly photodecomposed under a variety of conditions”.\nThe best evidence is found in the following sentence: “Alternatively, if the red color of the blood is due to the presence of vermilion, i.e., mercuric oxide, light exposure will blacken the image, as has been evidenced in many older paintings.(l2)”\nAs you know, Adler knew that vermilion had nothing to do with the blood stains.\nNevertheless, he wrote that.\nYou failed to consider the context.\nAdler (and Schwalbe) wrote this paper about the conservation of the TS, taking into account  ALL of the hypotheses.\nSeven years later (2000), Adler wrote in “Chemical and physical characteristics of the bloodstains”:\n” .. it was demonstrated that the observed spectra of the blood particles contained both met hemoglobin and albumin bound bilirubin.”\nYou can challenge Adler’ hypothesis but you can’t say that Adler used this paper to retract his bilirubin hypothesis.\n\n","date":"February 6, 2015 at 5:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-189792","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"When Adler put forward his idea that bilirubin was responsible for the permanently red colour of Shroud blood, there was no mention of bilirubin’s fragile nature. One has to assume that he was untutored in bilirubin chemistry, the latter  being entirely different from that of the chemically more stable porphyrins in which he specialized. But come 1993 he suddenly changed his tune. Now he was recognizing that bilirubin is unstable towards light and oxygen, and that instability might then also de-stabilize linen.\nWhat is that if not a late de facto retraction of his initially misguided thinking? How could bilirubin possibly be held to stabilise the red colour of ancient  blood, while simultaneously breaking down and damaging linen in the process? The two positions were entirely at odds with each other. No, he didn’t say “I retract”, but his volte face made it abundantly clear that he had abandoned his initial position, which amounts to the same thing – an admission of error,  an oversight, a retraction. Adler got it wrong -seriously wrong- but his “trauma bilirubin’ narrative continues to be proselytized to this day. Science is supposed to be self-correcting.

We have seen on another thread the recent restoration of what is clearly a beautiful depiction of a Savoy display of the Shroud with Cardinal Borromeo, together with a Savoy saint who happened to have died some hundred years or so previously, and many questions were raised about the artist’s depicted impressions of the Shroud which could not be answered satisfactorily.  \nIn two art works posted on this thread above, we see artists’ depictions of the flagellation, both comparatively modern works.  In both cases we see Christ’s arms bound at waist level.  There are apparently no scourge wounds on the image of the TSM’s arms, and the conclusion would have to be that the arms were actually bound above the head.  This was apparently the usual practice of Roman flagellation, is noted by Barbet, and there are clearly good executioner reasons why this should be so, particularly if the prisoner should happen to faint during the flagellation. \nSome clues may be taken from art works, there are small tokens of realism which the artist may be aware of and has attempted to depict, but clearly also much that they are ignorant of.  The watchword is caution when it comes to attempting to read too much into what is shown in such works.  Realism is often a secondary objective in art, the primary objective being more frequently to inspire empathetic or a devotional state of mind in the observer.  It very much depends on the skill, knowledge and intentions of the artist.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188495","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Actually the face most curiously added up/hidden in the first Mary’s sleeve, gives “the steganographic/cryptographic A” to the whole composition alike the pair of pliars most curiously used at that low level just above the feet in de Brito’s Scourging of Christ, steganographically/cryptically most likely refer to O S(udário de) T(urim), “The Turin Shroud”.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 2:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188497","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"For instance, the very initials of O S(udário de) T(urim) in Portuguese, hidden in full view — under the shape of the pair of pliars– is the anagram of SOT, which in Hebrew means “SECRET”.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 2:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188504","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Martinho de Brito made here a secret reference to the Turin Shroud.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 3:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188506","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"The Portuguese sculptor thus appeals to the initiated eye.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188509","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"…which Colin has not yet.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 3:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188510","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"To Colin: As far as image analysis and/or cryptanalysis is concerned, I have no lesson of authority to receive from a Chemist who cannot even discriminate a chain from a rope in a sculpture.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188525","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Actually, as I’ve had to remind Max many times previously I am not a chemist by training, but a biochemist, which is something entirely different, A biochemist  is less concerned with the details of particular atoms and molecules, and more with the way that living cells function at the molecular level  (enzymes, metabolic pathways, biomembranes, subcellular organelles, energy transduction etc).

The only useful purpose I can think of in flagellation is for cutting binding ropes or shackles, therefore I would presume essentially symbolic.\n\n","date":"February 3, 2015 at 5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188745","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Seems we see eye-to-eye on on thing at any rate, daveb, namely that the pincers are there for symbolic value only – maybe to make flesh creep at the mere sight of them (victim’s and viewers alike). However, they  do seem a curious feature to include so prominently, given at first sight they appear out-of-context (pincers being a standard item in the checklist of crucifixion hardware in Western art, along with nails, lance, sponge etc etc).\nApologies btw for my misspelling of pliers.\nThe key distinction between pincers and pliers, according to my Collins’ dictionary, is that pincers have those curbed bevelled ends that are good for making close contact with embedded object (nails etc) with a view to pulling them out. Pliers tend to have serrated jaws and are intended more for squeezing, though quite what it doesn’t say.\nI note your earlier comment re not placing too much reliance on art if wishing to fill in the gaps re the biblical record or be better informed as to Roman punishment and crucifixion. That I take as read. But time and again on this site we see interest and puzzlement from both pro- and anti-authenticity positions re the curious blood imprint across the small of the back, one that looks chain-like, or maybe a twisted double coil of rope. (Yes Max, I agree it’s a rope in your close-up,  but that does not undermine my case).\nFor my part, I once proffered the view that the imprint was evidence for thinking the man on the Lirey badge had not been the victim of crucifixion, but of roasting at the stake, a view that was supported by the de Charny/de Charney link, allegedly nephew and executed Templar uncle respectively. It had not occurred to me at the time that the “blood belt” (Wilson’s term) could be a visual cue to the treatment that had taken place before crucifixion, i.e. scourging, with a chain or rope restraint. The only role I could see for the chain was as a restraint for burning at the stake (again, supported by art).\nA blood imprint that is not (or need not necessarily) have been from a wound, but merely from contact imprinting from a bloodied chain or rope must have implications for the debate as to whether the body would have needed to have been washed to produce the entire set of blood stains, via assorted mechanisms including new seepage of blood etc. So there’s still a valid place methinks for finding time to scan image files of western art to get new ideas that might otherwise not have occurred to one, while accepting that no one artist holds a monopoly of wisdom and insight. Indeed, some like the bas reliefartist above with those mysterious pincers, probably like nothing better than to tease the first cohorts of viewers, it being a  means of getting his or her work better known and talked about. Theirs is a competitive environment with keen rivalries. The same might be said about shroudology, for better or for worse.\n\n","date":"February 3, 2015 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-188749","author":"Colin Berry","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Most DIY Kiwis (we are famous for using No. 8 wire  technology here) would understand the distinction between pliers and pincers well.

It specialised in making or upgrading railway wagons, and had furnaces for smelting.  The various molds had been prepared for couplings, buffers brake-shoes and the like.  I was privileged to see the pour of the molten cast iron.  It was indeed a form of engineering magic to see the results of the pour as the various components were formed in all their detail.  Forging has always been seen as a form of arcane mystery and wonder from ancient times. \nBarbet of course had his own explanation for the blood-belt across the small of the back.  He envisaged a type of twisted sheet for support during transport of the body, and hence creating the blood-belt and the impression it left therefore resembled a twisted rope or chain.

Of course they must have had some reasons, but I don’t think Max necessarily gets any closer to them than anybody else.\nApart from a general cultural awareness by 1950 of the pathological details of the image on the shroud, I agree with Colin that there are no grounds for supposing that de Brito had the Shroud in mind at all when he created his sculptures for Fatima.\n\n","date":"February 5, 2015 at 5:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-189307","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Hugh, you wrote: “there are NO GROUNDS (upper cases mine) for supposing that de Brito had the Shroud in mind at all when he created his sculptures for Fatima.” \nOh, really? \nThis is what I would call a desperate case of “most dramatic tunnel vision” (with blind spots behind and even ahead!). The true fact is YOUR opinion has NO GROUNDS at all (not even half a leg to stand on!). What are you hard arguments and facts to oppose to mine? Mine have sindonological, iconographical and cryptological grounds! You only can reason by mere negative assertion (“there are no grouds”) but without hard facts and relevant conter-arguments. Are you kidding? \nUnless one considers de Brito was a really G-od-inspired genius, can you tell me how come, without having the Shroud in mind, he could have depicted details that not only do look like free interpretations of several of  the Shroud image characterictics but are also unmistakenly shroudlike (to the initiated sight-and-brain coordination system) in several of his bas-relief scenes (flogging scene included)? For instance, do you really think de Brito just dreamed of a Christ with nails in the wrists and not in the palms, dressed himation/sindon fashion-like?\n\n","date":"February 5, 2015 at 7:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-189326","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"Hugh, you wrote: APART (upper cases mine) from a GENERAL CULTURAL AWARENESS (upper cases mine) by 1950 of the pathological details of the image on the shroud, I agree with Colin that there are no grounds for supposing that de Brito had the Shroud in mind at all when he created his sculptures for Fatima.” \nDo you really read what you wrote.

I can help you if you want. After performing some experiments I came to some important conclusions about 3D effect on the Shroud. I think we should reconsider it a little bit, particularly in the face area. It seems that banding effects  play there much more important role than most people think.\nI am planning to make some presentation about it. I have a lot of material but no final document yet.\n\n","date":"February 5, 2015 at 3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-189432","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?","post":"OK\nIt should be interesting to work together about this subject.\nAnd yes you can help me…\nIf you want you can ask my private email to Dan\n\n","date":"February 6, 2015 at 4:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-189780","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"}]
