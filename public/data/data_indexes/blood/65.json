They just happen to be from the same body but the processes creating the  “blood” stains are well documented.\nNot so the image. We have the result and we have the subject but the process that transferred the body image to the cloth is simply unkown and perhaps, for the time being, unknowable.\n(By the way, I first saw that dichotomy between the iamage and the “transfer” mechanism in John Heller’s memoir.

Any affect that such compounds may have on the system (positive or negative) is unknown.  One cannot simply dismiss this by saying that because Rogers did not find any evidence for such compounds (aloe & myrrh) on the Shroud, this must be irrelevant.  Is it just bilirubin or bilirubin plus?  Experimentally, one does not know.\nThere is also the report that neutron bombardment followed by subsequent exposure to uv results in the persistence of red coloration, irregardless of amount of additional bilirubin.\nThis is an experimental observation-just as supernatural beliefs should be fastened in the back pocket, so should any preconceived bias against certain investigators or theories-It works both ways-focus on the data at hand.  Neutron bombardment could disrupt association of certain inhibitory substances or facilitate the aggregation of certain proteins, mimicking what’s observed in other systems.  Or it could be totally unrelated.       \nIn the saponin system, there is the reported result that the red color persists.  The molecular basis for this observation remains to be determined.  As jesterof (Mahoney thread, comment # 184) and myself (Mahoney thread, comment #119), have questioned, it is unknown if this effect is unique to saponin or is also observed under other lysis conditions.  This would require further experimentation.  As mentioned in comments #163,169 of the same thread, relative to certain other detergents, saponin is quite efficient at disrupting cell membranes and perhaps increasing aggregation of specific proteins that could be important in such observations.  An additional variable is the method used for saponin extraction-different conditions yield different results.  To effectively evaluate these effects, such conditions would have to be normalized.\nTogether with Adler’s results, this could all be a case of true, true, and unrelated.  Or it could be that there is some cross-talk/application between the results.  It is too early to tell-there is no one size fits all here-more experimentation would be needed, variables would have to be experimentally defined & controlled .  Otherwise, it’s too easy for it to turn into an apples & oranges game.  Be careful about oversimplifying things by blurring the line between observation & proof.\n\n","date":"June 1, 2013 at 6:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35652","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood","post":"Bare with me folks, I haven’t been keeping up lately and may mention thoughts here that have been mentioned before.

The most straightforward test to determine the relationship of the two cloths, if doable, is DNA analysis, especially mitochondrial DNA.  Even though the blood on both cloths appear to be the same blood type, AB,  this is still circumstantial, it doesn’t prove they wrapped the same person.  The only solid conclusion that could be made in such tests is if the blood types were different.  It’s an interesting point to be raised, but in my opinion, I don’t think you can go by just the coloring-the appearance of the blood is not just a function of the blood composition in of itself, but also the physical & chemical properties of the cloth before/after the blood stained it.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2013 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35709","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood","post":"Typo!  is not as straightforward\n\n","date":"June 2, 2013 at 7:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35711","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood","post":"\nYannick Clément :\nIt’s not because I don’t have all your diplomas that I’m dumb…  And since I follow closely Adler and Barbet’s conclusions about the bloodstains, I think this comment of you (which is based on another comment of jesterof) can be seen as a critic against these 2 great researchers that are much greater and important than you will probably ever be my friend.

And I think you forget one important facts:  the Roman flagrum were made of dumbell metal balls and were not used to caused an important bleeding (like the common flogging instruments used by other people) but to inflict a maximum pain in order to remove the strength of the victim so that he cannot offered any resistance to his crucifixion.  Since my experience, I’m more convinced than ever that the scourging of the Shroud man did not produced a lot of bleeding but instead, they produced a lot of contused wounds with some superficial bleeding (pretty much like the wound I get from the tree branch) and this superficial bleeding eventually clotted and dried.  Then these clots were re-moistened and left a Mirror imprint on the cloth.  That’s Barbet’s conclusion and I agree totally with him.

Now these two signals tend to prove the body could have been purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial custom/practice (see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum and my TS man’s burial reconstruction).\nIn the case here under study, Second Temple period speedy tahara in terms of wrapping in shrouds, purifying & drying out was an act of ultimate kindness to honor the deceased who died a violent death.

All other hits that only produced a bruise did not left any traces on the Shroud.  EVERY WOUNDS HAVE THE SAME SHAPE, which is like a little dumbbell of 3 centimeters.  The two circles represent the tin balls; the intermediary bar is the trace of the tongue.”\nHere’s another one about the bloodstains: “On the Shroud, there is no blood flow; there are only imprints of clots; these clots represent the portion of the blood that clotted on the skin…”\nAnd another one: “Every blood images of the Shroud are imprints of fresh clots or clots that have been soften by the water vapor that is normally released by a corpse for a pretty long time.” \nI think these short quotes from Barbet’s book, along with the observation reported by Miller and Pellicori that the scourge marks shows very fine scratch-like marks that are not visible to the naked eye and that almost every scourge marks are surrounded by a halo of serum (which, in the mind of Barbet, cannot have been caused by anything else than a clot retraction), gave us some clues about the way many scourge wounds have been able to left a mirror imprint on the cloth…  Effectively, all these observations and conclusions show that, in order to leave the kind of very precise imprints we see on the Shroud, the scourge wounds must have been filled with clotted blood which became humid again well after their drying (or, less probably, which were able to stay humid all along the crucifixion).  \nI think there are two very compelling pieces of evidence that exist on the cloth which strongly suggest that Barbet was correct about the fact that the scourge marks on the Shroud were all caused by exudates of humid blood clots.  Here they are: 1- ALL the imprints show the SAME PRECISE SHAPE. 2- Almost every scourge wounds are SURROUNDED BY A HALO OF SERUM.  \nConclusion: These wounds must have been formed by the same process (it’s impossible that two different processes could have produced stains with the same very precise shape) and, in order to left an imprint on the cloth, some blood must have come at the surface of these wounds and must have clotted there.  All this strongly suggest that the process known as a transfer from exudates of blood clots, as described by Barbet and confirmed by Adler, is the one that can explain the best the presence of the scourge marks on the cloth.  It’s pretty evident that any other transfer process (like the one described by Zugibe of an oozing of post-morten liquid blood or the other one described by jesterof related to hematomas) would never have been able to form bloodstains with the same kind of very precise shape and borders as we can see on the Shroud and Miller and Pellicori would not have been able to detect the kind of halos of serum on their UV fluorescence photos. \nQuestion: What have caused bloody wounds like that?  Did a round metal ball the way we assume there was at the end of the tongue could have caused such wounds?  Or is it due to the fact that the surface of these tin balls was somewhat irregular?  Or is it due to the fact that there were no metal balls at all at the end of the leather tongues of the flagrum but only animal bones (this is an historical fact that such animal bones could have been used at the end of these tongues)?  It’s hard to say, but one thing’s for sure:  A lot of scourge hits have been able to cause an abrasion of the skin that was important enough that small portions of the skin were surely cut open and filled with blood.  Or else, as Barbet said, there would only be some kind of bruises on the skin that would not have been able to leave any imprint on the cloth…  In the abstract of the paper about injuries by blunt objects that was given by jesterof yesterday, there is one forensic term in there that, I think, is the best to describe the kind of wounds that were present on the skin of the Shroud man when his corpse was placed inside the Shroud and this term is “Contused lacerated wounds”.  I really think this kind of wound is what was present on the skin of the Shroud man after his scourging and such a bloody wound was showing the same kind of precise dumbbell shape that we can see on the Shroud…  The small bloody wounds have eventually clotted and, because of a re-moistening of their surface, they were able to leave a very good mirror imprint on the cloth.  I really think Barbet and Adler would think the same…\n\n","date":"June 3, 2013 at 8:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35865","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood","post":"Just a correction for my previous comment:  I used the term “tin balls” two times while you should read “lead balls” instead.

E.g. re the off-elbow bloodstain. Forensically the latter may be described as a passive pattern or, to be more accurate, an altered gravity trail drop pattern left by free falling drop produced from stationary source: most probably stiff rigid body resting in extra height (on two raised stones within the cave-tomb funerary ante-chamber?) and laid on its right side, which implies the body had been prepared for burial (taharah or “ritual purification”). The off-elbow bloodstain is archaeological blood to be studied first and foremost in the light of a Second Temple period Judean burial ritual. This is not mere pathological blood. Barbet totally missed it.\n\n","date":"June 3, 2013 at 10:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-35886","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood","post":"\nYannick Clément :\nI think there are two very compelling pieces of evidence that exist on the cloth which strongly suggest that Barbet was correct about the fact that the scourge marks on the Shroud were all caused by exudates of humid blood clots.

It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. As a victim of a violent death, his body should be buried with his shed innocent blood. Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking-gradual-unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner burial sheet soaked in a watery solution was compressed widthwise (with shorter dry clean shrouds) while taut lengthwise back and front as all parts of the body should be wrapped-up (Naḥmanides, Torat ha-Adam; Inyan ha-hoẓa’ah) and  then the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse was subjected to fumigation (and somehow get taut again back and front through shrinkung up).
