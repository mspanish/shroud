This means that the conclusion that the bloodstains on the Shroud are real bloodstains is the strongest evidence that this cloth is a real burial shroud of a real crucified man that was tortured in the same way as Jesus of the Gospel.  The implications that come from the solid conclusion that the bloodstains on the Shroud are real bloodstains are very important regarding the question of whether or not this is Jesus’ authentic burial cloth.  Because of this, it is pretty evident to me that it is truly is real burial cloth.

Rinaldi with Ian Wilson, David Rolfe and thus Silent Witness, part of the proceeds of which helped finance STURP. (The money may have been “washed” in part through the Holy Shroud Guild.) And it was an American heir to a fortune that also provided financing to both. Riggi was adopted by STURP during the Turin examination.\nIn the ensuing years there were conferences and interchanges among the STURP veterans and European scientists. Information was freely shared. Perhaps the epitome of that occured at the 2008 Ohio conference when Giulio Fanti shared presnted an American scientist from Los Alamos Shroud threads that Fanti had received from Riggi,\nI do not have definitive information from the individuals but I would make an educated guess that the yenta (marriage broker)   between Kelly and Thibault was a STURP veteran with the inappropriate initials of BS.  \nThe politics of Turin, the Vatican and the rest of the world were quite complex. It would behoove everybody to celebrate the joint efforts now becoming the norm.  It would also be behoove everybody to celebrate the accomplishments of STURP rather than engage in unnecessary attacks on it just because it was predominantly American.\nIn 1978, at that time and place, the science that STURP applied was in fact miles ahead of any other place on Earth. The fact that the science was developed by the US nuclear and space programs, each unparalleled, is either high irony, or perhaps Divine Providence.

I simply cannot agree that the absorbance spectrum obtained by the Gilberts correlates to the spectra obtained by Cameron and George (1969), or Afromowitz and Callis (1992), or any of the others one can find on the internet.\nThe spectrum of methemoglobin is characterised by three distinct peaks, at 400nm, 500nm and 630nm. Only two of these are shown on the Cameron and George diagram (500nm and 630nm), and also, albeit oddly shifted, on the Afromowitz and Callis diagram (520nm and 650nm). The Gilberts’ Shroud spectrum not only does not have a peak at 630nm, nor a peak at 500nm, but most importantly of all no peak at all at 400nm. This is wholly characterisitic of all types of hemoglobin, and it’s missing. The Gilberts’ spectrum is definitely not typical of methemoglobin, nor of blood of any description, and its very partial resemblance to a blood spectrum over a small range of wavelengths is entirely coincidental.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2013 at 12:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-60957","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger","post":"Hugh,\nYour observation is true but your conclusions are false.\nIn Gilbert’s paper it is true that there is no peak at about 400 nm. There is only a flat graph between 350 and about 520 nm.\nBut you forget 2 important facts:\n1) Heller and Adler published in “Blood on the Shroud of Turin” the transmission spectrum of a brownish red stained fibril from one of the blood areas of the Shroud (in the Orphaned manuscript, p. 31). The peak at about 410 nm. is obvious. This peak is simply the famous Soret band (400-450 nm.) indicative of regular porphyrinic material. In addition a very small peak at about 520 nm. is also visible in their spectra.\n2) Pellicori ( in “Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin”, Applied optics, Vol;19, N)12, 15 June 1980, Fig.4, p. 1916) have shown the results of several experiments. On a 4 days-old bloodstain on linen the Soret band is clearly visible. But after artificially aging (60°C, 7.5 hours) this bands become much less obvious. Pellicori thought that the lack of the Soret band [in Gilbert’s spectra] was probably due to the poor Signal to Background ratio.\nI completely disagree with your sentence: ” The Gilberts’ spectrum is definitely not typical of methemoglobin, nor of blood of any description, and its very partial resemblance to a blood spectrum over a small range of wavelengths is entirely coincidental.”\nCoincidental? Really ? The Gilbert’s spectrum is typical of methemoglobin in the range 500-700 nm including the band at about 630-650 nm. (Don’t you see it ?)\nThe fact that the 400-450 nm. strong Soret band is not seen in Gilbert’s spectra is not truly significant because Pellicori has shown that ageing of blood on linen strongly lowers the Soret band and because of the poor Signal to background ratio.\nMore generally, what Kelly and myself tried to show is that if we have to think about TS blood, we have to take into account all the data from Heller and Adler, STURP data, Bollone, Pellicori etc..and not from a single source.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2013 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-61105","author":"Thibault HEIMBURGER","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger","post":"Can someone please post the peer reviewed research which confirms blood on Shroud.

I only wish to further echo, as Thibault again pointed out, that it is the collective data which must be considered.  In my own opinion, as a general comment, I believe that objectivity can become clouded over to various degrees whenever data relative to the Shroud is presented.  Take the Shroud out of it and consider the same (collective) data in the analysis of a toga or metal blade suspected to be 700-2,000 years old, containing what could possibly be bloodstains-would the conclusion be the same or different?  Would the age and/or condition of the sample be taken into consideration?  And all of the collective data dismissed as invalid or inconclusive?  Surely, of the numerous people doing numerous tests, some of them must have done some of them correctly.  And as has been pointed out in the past, it wasn’t just if blood was present that was evaluated-both sides of the coin were examined-if it’s not blood, collective data considered, then what is it?  This is just a rhetorical question, it is not meant for anyone specifically.\nTo John,\nI have known Thibault (by correspondence) for several years since I first became interested in the blood aspects of the Shroud.  We actually met independently of Barrie, although he would have made a fine yenta, I’m sure.  As anyone who is acquainted with Thibault knows, he is completely professional, truly an honor and a pleasure to communicate and work with.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2013 at 6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-61138","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger","post":"Well I certainly agree that Baima Bollone’s findings should be considered in conjunction with the STURP team, but I guess I’ll have to continue to plough my own furrow regarding the Soret band.\nHeller & Adler in “Blood on the Shroud of Turin” clearly say “All these fibrils showed intense Soret (400-450nm) absorption indicative of a regular porphyrinic material.” Pellicori in “Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin” clearly says “The Shroud curve shows […] no suggestion of a Soret band.” These two statements are directly contradictory.\nFurthermore, Heller & Adler (Figure 2) show spectra from two blood samples that are totally different, and Pellicori (Figure 4, comparing only ‘Mean Blood Stain on Shroud’ and ‘Linen after 7.5h @ 60°C’) also shows two spectra which do not resemble each other at all.\nI’ve even discovered another discrepancy (http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/EP2220249B1/imgf0001.png). Notice the steep absorption trough at 700nm, followed by an equally steep rise. This is very different from the Gilberts’ spectrum, which continues to drop towards 750nm.\nIf we compare the Gilberts’ spectrum, from 0nm to 759nm, to the spectrum of methemoglobin over the same range, the conclusion that the two are the same cannot, in my opinion, be sustained, even allowing for convenient hypothesised distortion due to age.\nI do take Kelly’s point about other old blood. Sadly, although blood seems to have been found on Aztec sacrificial knives, Utzi the Iceman, and on paleolithic stone tools I cannot find a spectral analysis of it. The blood seems to have been chiefly identified because of the survival of erythrocytes – which are sadly lacking on the Shroud.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2013 at 6:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-61169","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger","post":"Hugh,\nIn the composite spectrum above, the acid-methemoglobin plot appears distinct from the others-I’m not seeing this included on the google pics you provided.  That is the species under comparison relative to Gilberts’ spectrum.\nThere is no “convenient hypothesized distortion due to age” These are your words, not mine.  Sustain your own opinion, but don’t twist mine by using petty words like “convenient”.  I pointed this out in relation to a collective evaluation of the data, that it’s incorrect to expect a direct comparison with results one would obtain with relatively fresh blood.  This is true no matter what aged object is in question that is being evaluated.  It is irrelevant of the Shroud. \nAztec knives, paleolithic stone tools-were those cleaned in between kills?  A one and done or was it a cumulative effect, blood drying upon blood?  I think it’s a tough comparison-too many variables, too many unknowns, too many differences.  BB shows a photo of what may be a red blood cell from the Shroud in several of his books.  It can also be seen on the Shroud iPad app.  I don’t know how many were in the magnification field or how many threads he had to look through to find it.  I would like to see microscopy done in conjunction with a gold-tagged antibody (or something similar) to show RBC specificity.  And for more bloodstains to be evaluated.  If the object in the photo was just a silica particle I would be okay with that.  I’m not wanting to make a conclusion first, then working backwards to find things that support it.  In all science, all experiments, all theories, there are grey areas.  In my experience, when it’s all crystal clear, when everything stinks (all of the data is useless) or is in total, perfect harmony (the data is all perfect, absolutely perfect, nothing is even slightly off), look out: Objectivity has left the building.   BTW, there is a huge difference between the Utzi the iceman and the Shroud.  Red blood cells were taken from tissue of the iceman because there is a body to take it from, preserved in the ice.  The Shroud contains only the image of a body, either real or intentionally fabricated.  \nI think everyone has to form their own opinion of whether bloodstains are present or not.  I would find it odd that everyone who has tested for this was biased or didn’t know what they were doing, or was inept at evaluating results.  I believe the best conclusion is based on a consideration of the collective data. That’s a main point of the article we put together.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2013 at 8:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-61201","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger","post":"Well I think I agree with most of that.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2013 at 8:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-61203","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger","post":"\nHugh Farey :\nWell I think I agree with most of that.\n\nMe, too!

The first was rubbing with dry powder. This produced a good image with the requisite 3-D and negative characteristics, but was a flop microscopically, as it depended entirely on the powder, which easily washed off, leaving an unmarked cloth. The second was rubbing with a dry powder mixed with 1% sulphuric acid into a paste. The powder washed off, as before, and the acid left a superficial degradation of the cloth which was enhanced by heating. However the marks produced by this method lacked the 3-D and negative quality of the Shroud. It is not clear to me the proportions in which the powder and the acid were combined (pastes can be thick or thin), and think that further investigation of this method, using different thicknesses of paste, would be worth carrying out.\nPiero, the “bioplastic coating hypothesis” of Leoncio Garza-Valdez was largely discredited when it was recognised that the coating would have to be twice the weight of the shroud itself in order to affect a 1st century cloth so much that it appeared 13th century when carbondated.

The method you mentioned for whole blood would disrupt (release) the cellular portion, allowing everything (the total) to be effectively measured.  In a bloodstain, as the blood dries any cells present will dehydrate and die.  In speaking to a forensic scientist about this once, he explained it to me as similar to a flat tire having a slow leak and collapsing. The membrane is still “relatively” intact (i.e. not blown to bits), which allows RBCs to reseal & rehydrate during preparation for microscopy, resuming a somewhat normal morphology.  I do not known if  conventional SEM, as used by Dixon (or others) would necessarily detect potassium that may still remain within dried RBCs in a bloodstain.  This might contribute to the difference between a measurement of whole blood relative to a bloodstain.  Or maybe much of it (potassium) would still be expected to leak out of the RBCs as it collapses and dies during drying, I am not really sure.

In my opinion, it is a big leap to go from analysis of a few fibers to “95 percent of the blood areas on the Shroud have been taken over and continue to diminish with time.”  Certainly the Shroud is not pristine with a history of being stored under aseptic conditions, of course there will be bacteria present, but in my own opinion this is extrapolation/exaggeration.  Again, my own opinion, but the “DNA of God” on the Shroud has yet to be demonstrated that it actually originated from a blood cell, and is not the result of contamination (by humans-not bacteria!).  None of the genes examined in this study are specific in that regard-I would also caution exaggeration here as well, the reported DNA sequences could have originated from blood cells, but there has been no demonstration that blood specific DNA products exist on the cloth.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2013 at 7:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-61907","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger","post":"Dear Kelly,\nThank your for your answer.\n— —-\nIn any case I think that ancient DNA (etc.) seems to be\na difficult field of investigations !!!\n— —\nI have read some studies on that argument.\nHere a title :\nBiomolecular Archaeology: An Introduction\nby  T.
