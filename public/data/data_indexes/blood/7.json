They always reconfigure into a bilayer or micelle. They cannot “solubilize” unless a detergent or detergent-like species, e.g. lysophosphatidylcholine is present. The self-association of water via hydrogen bonding sees to that, forcing fatty acyl side chains to self-associate via Van der Waals interactions (hopefully a more accurate description than referring loosely to ‘hydrophobic’ forces, seeing as how the forces between electrically uncharged molecules are ALWAYS attractive. (The zwitterionic phosphocholine moiety aiding bilayer or micelle formation).\nSo unless there were a mild non-denaturing detergent in the aqueous buffers used for blood groiup testing, e.g. one of the Lubrols, then I cannot see how there would be true solubilization of membrane-associated antigens. Without solubilization, there is always the (theoretical) possibility of lysed RBC membranes being reduced to tiny vesicles/liposomes, at least some of which could be inside out. Given the impermeability of typical biological membranes even to small molecules (ATP, sugars, etc) except those that are specifically carrier-mediated then it is difficult to be certain that an antibody is able to access all of the cell-surface associated antigens that were initially on the “outside”. In any case, some intact RBC are need as agglutination-detectors,large enough to see aggregation under the microscope. In short, age-related haemolysis is bad news, is it not,  in an assay system based on RBC agglutination, even if there is some resealing and formation of miniature liposomes with correctly-oriented glycoproteins.\n","date":"July 15, 2012 at 6:25 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/blood-grouping-the-shroud-of-turin-like-trying-to-sort-apples-from-oranges-in-the-dark-wearing-boxing-gloves/","cat":"ab_blood_group","id":"comment-364","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Blood-grouping the Shroud of Turin – like trying to sort apples from oranges in the dark wearing boxing gloves.","post":"And now this one has appeared on the Other Site, from Dr. Kelly Kearse no less.\nFor the custodians of the Shroud, cutting from even a far corner may be considered too invasive. It’s hard to imagine that removing a portion from a bloodstained region would even be considered. Is the sensitivity of radiocarbon dating sufficient to evaluate a scraping or several blood flakes, particularly when divided up among several laboratories? Not my area, but it seems to be pushing the limit of detection.\nColin, regarding study of AB antigens in aged bloodstains (as discussed on your website), I’m not certain that intactness or correct sidedness of any resealed red blood cells is really an issue in immunochemical evaluation of ABO antigens. True, reconstituted, resealed cells may be detected microscopically in ancient samples under certain conditions prepared for fixed staining, but it is unclear to what percentage of the total this may represent. Moreover, for immunochemical evaluation of ABO molecules, such experiments are typically performed in buffer systems that would (purposely) lyse and solubilize cell membranes, maximizing exposure and detection of any antigens present.\nFinally, a comment on the suggestion that [“ There could have been blood residues initially at the time of Shroud’s genesis, that have been ‘touched up’ by surreptitious additions of real blood, possibly blood of a carefully chosen group that best fits with ‘authenticity’-and what better group than AB, an overzealous custodian might have imagined…]\nThe existence of ABO blood groups was unknown until approximately 100 years ago (Landsteiner reported their existence in 1900). Accordingly, any such “surreptitious addition” would had to have taken place relatively recently in the Shroud’s history, by a 20th century custodian…”might have imagined” is a good phrase to use.\nNope, I don’t propose snipping any more rectangles from the the Shroud. What I propose is the taking of blood scrapings, pooling samples if necessary from different sites. Samples could be taken in the first instance from the less photogenic dorsal view – e.g. the back of the head, the small of the back, the feet etc. It would be nice to replicate the precision of the 3-lab dating (even if the accuracy is in doubt due to alleged ‘invisible reweaving’ – which frankly I regard as complete tosh) but I personally would be content with assay precision and accuracy that distinguished clearly between 1st century AD and a medieval/post medieval date for the blood, basically to distinguish between authenticity and forgery for the blood. (The evidence that the Man in the Shroud was crucified would appear to rest almost totally if not exclusively on the alleged bloodstains, the latter including scourge marks).\nI’ll post this separately, and return to some other points as and when the spirit moves me to mount a defence – which I know few will bother to read on my own site.\n","date":"July 15, 2012 at 6:02 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/blood-grouping-the-shroud-of-turin-like-trying-to-sort-apples-from-oranges-in-the-dark-wearing-boxing-gloves/","cat":"ab_blood_group","id":"comment-363","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"},{"title":"Blood-grouping the Shroud of Turin – like trying to sort apples from oranges in the dark wearing boxing gloves.","post":"This comment has appeared in Spanish on the other site (shown here in Google translation):\n“If Colin can reproduce bloodstains, a halo of serum, similar to those in the shroud, shall have completed the BEST WORK done so far on the Shroud.\nTry it, Colin!.

The simplest way to duplicate them is to paint on blood while still fresh and leave it to clot and dry. Blood was an easily obtainable commodity in medieval times (physician- administered bleeding from nicked veins being a standard cure-all).\nIf there is any mystery about the Shroud and its supposed bloodstains, it is in understanding how blood on a cadaver that had already had ample time to clot could somehow reliquefy to produce such artistic free-flowing effects, like those blood trails on the forearms and small of back especially. Cue the mantra (aka pulling a white rabbit from the hat) re post mortem external “fibrinolysis”, which has to be up there among the more mind-boggling  clack ever to emerge from STURP pie-in-the-sky theorising…  Was there not there a real doctor in the house (medically-qualified as distinct from chemistry PhD) to put a lid on all that tendentious self-serving nonsense?\n","date":"July 15, 2012 at 3:46 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/blood-grouping-the-shroud-of-turin-like-trying-to-sort-apples-from-oranges-in-the-dark-wearing-boxing-gloves/","cat":"ab_blood_group","id":"comment-362","author":"colinsberry","site":"colinberry"}]
