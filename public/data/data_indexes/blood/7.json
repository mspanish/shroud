[{"title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”","post":"Congratulations on producing your paper Yannick and getting it onto the web. \nI notice that you include cartography, geography and astronomy in your activities.\nDepending on how far you may have taken these interests, I suggest these might be adequate qualifications for you to attempt this litte project.  I should like to see any attempts to map the surface of a human body frontal and dorsal, say a mannequin, on to a cloth.  You can try the mappings with the cloth tightly wrapped around the body, or else merely draped over the body.  I think the results may well illuminate what credible processes might be involved in producing the Shroud image.  Clearly tightly wrapped will produce a different image from loosely draped.  \nIf the cloth is tightly wrapped and if the process is some kind of chemical contact process, then I think you might find that the mapping produces too wide an image for it to confirm that this was the process involved.  On the other hand, if the cloth is loosely draped, it might produce the near-orthogonal image that we see on the Shroud.  but then we have to decide what might be a credible process that would produce the image.  If it is a gaseous flow process, this would seem to contrain the paths of the molecules in some peculiar way.  However if it was some kind of radiation or atomic particle process, then this might do it, but then we would have to ask what could the driving mechanism be that would enable this process?  \nI hope that you will be able to find time to give this project some little thought.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-15565","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”","post":"Thanks Dave for your kind word.  \nOn the question of whether the cloth was very tight around the body or loose at the moment of the image formation, I think science have a pretty good idea of the correct answer, after the work of Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline of STURP that was independently confirmed quite well by Mario Latendresse in 2005.  After having read these papers and reflect a long time on the subject, I think the most reasonable and rational way to answer the question is to say that unlike the blood and serum stains (that are a complete produce of a direct contact transfer process between the corpse and the cloth, which indicate that at some point, the Shroud MUST have been tightly wrapped or compressed over most parts of the body), the body image process operate in a different way and was most probably active only when the cloth had changed his configuration and wasn’t so tight around the body anymore.  It’s only with a cloth loosely draped over the corpse that it is possible to obtain (with the help of a process of projection of the image) a body image like we see on the Shroud that don’t possess big distorsion (but that possess some minor distorsions nevertheless).  In fact, to summarize my opinion, I would say that the blood and serum stains were caused uniquely by a direct contact process when the cloth was, during a time (that could have been short) in direct contact with most parts of the corpse, while the body image was caused by a process acting in direct contact AND at short distance (that could be 4 cm but that could well be less than that in reality).  I think this is the most rational way to explain both the blood and serum stains and the body image on the Shroud.  Now, for the eternal question of the image formation process, you already know my answer :  All the data coming from the Shroud cannot discard the possibility of a natural process (chemical in nature) and I think science should keep looking in that direction to find a definitive answer.  Rogers (and Vignon before him) has carved the road and I think others should follow this path…\nAnd here’s a note for anyone who want to know more about me :  If you click on the first link provided by Dan entitled “The Holy Shroud Guild”, you’ll be able to read my little autobiography entirely.  Dan wrote that it is another paper but in fact, this is the same paper I published here and on the website of Pete Schumacher (shroudnm.com) last month.  I’m just glad Giorgio of the Holy Shroud Guild loved so much my paper that he decided to put it online on his website !  I have to say a big thank you to him for his help to diffuse this paper to the world.  I have put so much effort and so many hours (in the writting but more on the thinking) that it’s fun to know that I didn’t do all this for nothing…  Have a good reading (if it’s not already done) !!!\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-15569","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”","post":"Footnote:  Yannick, I stil think the mapping of a mannequin body surface on to a cloth is quite important.  It has serious geometrical implications.  Also, think about the leg calves, ankles and feet.  How was the Shroud wrapped around these, to produce the images we see.  They’re so narrow, it would seem that the cloth would even have to be doubled over itself if they were wrapped at all.  This suggests to me that the cloth may only have been draped.

NOBODY HAS EVER DONE THE SAME KIND OF STUDY FOR THE PROBABLE CONFIGURATION OF THE PART OF THE SHROUD THAT WAS RESTING ON THE FUNERAL TABLET IN THE TOMB AND THE DORSAL PART OF THE BODY.  This kind of precise study is waiting to be done and I don’t understand that nobody ever done it since 1978 !!!\nOne thing’s for sure: this dorsal image on the Shroud never seem to pose problem for Rogers versus his hypothesis of image formation !!!  Here’s what he said about that (found in the recent paper published by Thibault) : “Evaporation concentration at the surface of a cloth limits the depth of penetration of reactions into the cloth: The dorsal image is NOT a problem.”\nI think what Rogers mean by that is that his own hypothesis concerning the chromophore of the image can easily explain why the dorsal image as roughly the same characteristics than the frontal (especially concerning the fact that it didn’t penetrate the cloth more deeply than the frontal image).  Of course, explaining the formation of this dorsal image is ANOTHER STORY !!!!  He he !  It’s not at all evident and personally, this is the most problematic aspect of the Shroud’s image versus the idea of a natural image formation process.  I don’t say that science will never be able to find a natural process that can explain this dorsal image (note : a dorsal image that we know was not caused only by a direct contact process, no matter what John Jackson might think about that) but I’m very curious to learn what natural process can act at some distance from the dorsal part of a body.  Maybe the Maillard reaction hypothesis of Rogers could work, but I’m not sure about that.  It should be note that Rogers never wrote that much too about this particular aspect of the question…  MORE RESEARCHES ARE NEEDED !!!!\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 7:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-15583","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”","post":"As far as the Sindon image formation process is concerned, why is it so easy for a miraculist as Dave or an archmiraculist as Ron for instance, to think the body was “suspended into space” and/or dematerialised in a supine position and SO DIFFICULT for both of them (and a Yannick Clément too) to imagine the same body could just have been laid on its side in extra height (e.g. on two stones) to be subjected to a fumigation (as purifying and drying up ritual)?\n   Most obviously they STILL did not quite get the idea of pressure release (cloth to body, front and back) and mechanic return force, as the long inner burial sheet (in-soaked with alkaline waters, encircling the corpse lengthwise and compressed widthwise in dry linen strips) gradually shrank, got taut again and separated front and back from the deceased’s skin by applying an external heating source (+ body hyperthermia as an internal source?).\n  Most obviously, they also STILL didn’t get the whole idea of a stiff rigid corpse tightly\nwrapped up to counteract rigor mortis and thus abide by the Judean Religious Law (to wrap up a corpse in rigor mortis so that it shall not be left in an awkward position but rest as flat as possible in a composed and serene countenance expressing dignity).\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 7:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-15578","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”","post":"YC wrote “at some point, the Shroud MUST have been tightly wrapped or compressed over most parts of the body”.

I am glad he finally started buying in some of my ideas…as if it were his own!

In fact, they mostly come from exudates of blood clots and this kind of exudate can only be transferred to a cloth by direct contact (with some pressure applied on it).  So, there’s no question that the Shroud MUST have been compressed or tighly wrapped over the body for a time.   BUT…  The studies of STURP and Latendresse showed that it was probably NOT the same configuration when the body image formation started to be active inside the Shroud.  At the moment, if the Shroud would still have been tightly wrapped or compressed over the body, we would have get big distorsions, especially in more rounded parts of the body, like the face, the arms, the legs, etc.  Conclusion : the configuration of the Shroud MUST have changed between the time of the blood transfer and the time of the image formation process.  And unlike Gilbert Lavoie, I don’t think we should call for any miraculous event to explain this probable change of configuration !  I think the participants of the burial rite were good enough to do this kind of change of configuration MANUALLY (with a great care not to disturb too much the fresh bloodstains).  By the way, this probably great care not to disturb anything is truly consistent with the meticulous way pious Jews of that era were acting during a burial (Lavoie talked about this particular aspect in one of his paper on the subject that he published for Shroud Spectrum International).\n\n","date":"August 29, 2012 at 8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-15587","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”","post":"Yannick Clément, you wrote: “I didn’t changed my mind about that [= the Shroud MUST have been tightly wrapped or compressed over most parts of the body]… The fact that the Shroud was tightly wrapped against the body is easy to note [… ]\nThe FACT is on December 19, 2011 at 4:29 pm | #20\nYOU wrote: \n“STURP (Jackson and Al.) and Mario Latendresse’s articles tend more to a NON WRAPPED shroud put loosely over the body… And I BELIEVE there’s enough evidences on the Shroud to say that there’s a good probability that effectively, the Shroud was NEVER TIED UP WITH LINEN STRIPS during the “partial” burial rite on friday.

As Rogers said, he was not aware of even one single energetic radiation (remember that it’s a true expert who speak and not just an engeneer like Fanti) that could uniquely colored a very thin layer of impurities without producing any easily visible defects (at least easy to detect for an expert like him) on the primary cell wall of the linen fiber that is present under the impurities.

If so, he should check out the requirements of the Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints, current prefect Cardinal Angelo Amato.  Adequate attestation for the occurrence of miracles is rigorously demanded in each of the steps towards the process of canonisation.  \nExtract: “The miracle may go beyond the possibilities of nature either in the substance of the fact or in the subject, or only in the way it occurs. So three degrees of miracle are to be distinguished. The first degree is represented by resurrection from the dead (quoad substantiam). The second concerns the subject (quoad subiectum): the sickness of a person is judged incurable, in its course it can even have destroyed bones or vital organs; in this case not only is complete recovery noticed, but even wholesale reconstitution of the organs (restitutio in integrum). There is then a third degree (quoad modum): recovery from an illness, that treatment could only have achieved after a long period, happens instantaneously.”  \nI understand that the medical team assessing the alleged miracle frequently comprises or includes non-Catholic medical specialists. \nA genuine Christian certitude on any matter of faith, including the Resurrection must at least start from some rational basis, otherwise it might be classified as fanatacism.\n\n","date":"August 30, 2012 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-15632","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”","post":"Dave, you just don’t.
