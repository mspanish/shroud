As an EMS worker, Paulette’s experience could be very informative. This is one of those rather few occasions when the term ‘expert,’ in terms of having experience that others have not have, may be meaningful and valuable, and I would love to know more about Paulette’s experiences.\nI quite understand that blood flows, gushes, squirts and sprays – but would that be from a living body with a pumping heart? Although blood in bulk can remain liquid for a while after death, it would not be expected to do a lot more than trickle (albeit copiously!) from, say, a spear wound in the side of the chest. In the case of puncture wounds in living people in general (and obviously I’m thinking specifically of a hand or wrist being fixed to a beam with a nail), how good is the implement at preventing blood loss while it is still in the wound? Those people who volunteer to be crucified every Easter in the Philippines or Mexico do not appear to bleed at all while they are being nailed, or while they are on the cross. I have not seen what happens when the nail is removed – being alive, I can imagine there is some blood loss then. But if the victim were dead, nearly all the blood in the arm would drain by gravitation, no? Also, volunteer crucifixees appear to keep quite still – perhaps the pain of being punctured is minimised like that. They certainly do not flail about or jerk or spasm. They are standing on a platform, so a hanging weight is not a problem, but some are nailed to it, so I can imagine there is a lot of pain in the feet as well as the hands. \nYour experiences in this field would be most informative, I’m sure.\n\n","date":"April 7, 2014 at 7:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-97364","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"I’m not an expert.

A relatively thin nail through a hand is not, usually, a catastrophic injury. Painful, I’m sure, and there could be nerve damage and the danger of wrecking veins. There are side-show folks who pierce themselves to a similar degree.\nWhen one knows the pain is temporary and the experience controlled there is none of the psychological trauma that a truly condemned person experiences. Look at professional wrestlers who have themselves thrown into barb wire, have staples fired into their flesh, or fall from great heights. They experience great pain but they maintain control of the situation, brutal though it be. Take those same wrestlers and have them experience this involuntarily, at the hands of a sadist, and they would know a very different level of trauma.\nRoman crucifixion is not something any modern doctor would sign-off on for reenactment.\n\n","date":"April 8, 2014 at 9:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-97625","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"“When one knows the pain is temporary…” Who was this Jesus character again?

The nail could pass through the radial (thumb) side of the wrist through a space created by four other carpal bones; the NAVICULAR, LUNATE, GREATER MULTANGULAR and CAPITATE bones, emerging where the Shroud depicts it. This is a very strong area and the trunk of the median nerve would most likely be damaged by this path.\nTWO: The upper part of the palm of the hand … NOT THE MIDDLE OF THE PALM. This area is equally as sturdy as either Destot’s Space or the radial area indicated above and would emerge at the site depicted on the Shroud. This area is located as follows; touch your thumb to the tip of your little finger. A deep furrow called the thenar furrow is seen at the base of the bulky prominence extending from the base of the thumb. This area was first pointed out by Monsignor Alfonso Paleotto, Archbishop of Bologna, who accompanied St. Charles Borromeo to Turin in 1598. It may be of interest that he postulated that the nail would have entered the upper part of the palm obliquely, and pointing toward the arm, it would have emerged where the Shroud depicts it. It is of interest that Barbet severely criticized Paleotto’s hypothesis as “anatomically impossible.” Monsignor Paleotto was indeed correct. If a nail is driven into this furrow, a few centimeters from where the furrow begins at the wrist, with the point of the nail angled at ten to fifteen degrees toward the wrist and slightly toward the thumb, there is a natural inclination of the nail to an area created by the METACARPAL bone of the index finger and the CAPITATE and LESSER MULTANGULAR bones of the wrist which we have coined the “Z” area (Fig. 5)\n\n","date":"April 11, 2014 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-98353","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"This diagram shows even more clearly the proposed sites of nail-holes and the position of the main blood supply to the hands. http://i.imgur.com/Fy36t8B.png.

(See the crucifixion video above)\n3) At any elevation, blood tends to drain from the arm, even when the heart is beating. (Hold one hand out at an upwards angle for a minute or two and then compare it with the other, as specified above)\n4) After death, blood continues to drain from the arm under gravity, until it is substantially depleted.\n5) After death, the cessation of the pumping heart, and the removal of the nail, there is insufficient blood in the hand to drip down the arm. (There may be sufficient blood to come out if the arm is held hand-downward, but that would not drip back up towards the elbow).\nIf the four statements above are accurate, then the apparent blood flows depicted on the shroud arms are inconsistent with a crucifixion.

I would be interested to hear what experiments you carried out.\n\nA few comments-in a real crucifixion, it is doubtful the executioners would be so gentle as those posing as villains in the video, the nails would be larger, and would surely be ponded in with much more force.  Is it necessary a major artery be severed?  What about a vein?\nCould the body have been transported to the burial site with the patibulum still attached?  If removed at the crucifixion site, rigor established, the body transported by grasping a portion of the arms, would this have an effect?  Insufficient amounts of blood in the hand-how many mls do you estimate are represented on the wrist, forearm bloodstains?  How were the nails removed, gently or with pressure-any affect on blood seepage?   Washing, gentle cleansing of the body?  Nail several persons with a forceful mallet through the wrists and crucify them, would they all bleed exactly the same way?  I think such comparisons are difficult.\n\n","date":"April 11, 2014 at 7:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-98466","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"I agree with Hugh the blood could have been added.

If an artery or vein was pierced then the arms would be covered in gore, and with three hours suspension the victim would have bled to death. Has Hugh ever attended an accident where a main blood vessel was severed or ever attempted to stem blood loss with a tourniquet?  Perhaps he should leave his forensic analysis to those with some knowledge and experience of it. We’re seeing trickles of blood on the arms not extensive gore.  Roman nails were either square or sometimes triangular section, and unlikely to create a seal at their edges so some leakage at least might be expected over a three hour period.  I’d recommend a close re-reading of Barbet so he may become better informed. \nIf the Shroud is authentic, why would anyone bother adding blood flows that accurately matches gravity, assuming they had sufficient understanding to do so.  The fellow in the video standing on a pedestal with near-horizontal arms, is hardly an accurate enactment. \nFor Kelly: It is Barbet’s contention that the patibulum was removed from the stipes, and the patibulum with body attached was then transported to the burial site where the nails would have been removed. Four men would have been sufficient to carry the patibulum with the body.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 12:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-98554","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"I’m sorry if I’m giving the impression that I’ve made up my mind about any of this.

I thought the nail went through the hands while Jesus was on the ground ( horizontal plain). I personally don’t believe the Nail should sever a main artery or vein to produce the blood on the shroud. Any cut to the skin ( let alone a 9mm diameter hole from one side to the other) would bleed. The skin is covered with blood capillaries and we see this bleeding with any unfortunate knife accident in the kitchen ( without severing a main vein or artery). Sorry, I couldn’t see the video you posted (I’am squeamish).\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-98660","author":"Mike M","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"If blood came out of a wrist-wound while the arm was on the ground it still wouldn’t flow along the arm.

You must take also in the account that he weights 70-80 kg, while hanging on the cross. Much of this weight is pressed on the nails. It is completely different situation than what you describe.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 8:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-98668","author":"O.K.","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"\nHugh Farey :\nIf blood came out of a wrist-wound while the arm was on the ground it still wouldn’t flow along the arm.

Perhaps the victim’s hands were cut from falling. Could blood be splattering onto the arms from the head (crowned with thorns) as the head lolls back and forth in pain? However, I don’t imagine the nail wounds would remain plugged for long, not with the spasms of the victim and gravity putting tearing force on the wound. Stick a nail in your thigh and it may not bleed much if you remain fairly calm and still. But yank back and forth on the nail while jumping up and down…\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 9:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-98670","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"All reasonable questions and suggestions, I agree.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2014 at 9:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-98675","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed","post":"\nThomas :\nI agree with Hugh the blood could have been added.
