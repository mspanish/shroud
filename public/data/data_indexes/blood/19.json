This would no doubt help preserve the fabric and the blood stains.  Myrrh resin is not unlike tree sap.   This clear thin coating however is surprisingly not present on the fabric with myrrh resin only?  (at least not to the same degree as the #3)  The #3 sample fabric is  hardened and smooth where the myrrh and aloes were applied, but not present with myrrh resin only.   Very little change to the feel of the fabric other than darkening to some degree.  I believe the thin layer of starch fractions and pectin that Ray Rodgers identified on the Shroud is the remnant of the myrrh and aloes put over the body of Jesus almost 2000 years ago. My theory at this time only.  Cellulose acetate is used to coat holographic film plates.  Myrrh and aloes together have a very similar chemical make up. What the catalyst would be to create a chemical reaction to make cellulose acetate is the thing I am not sure of.  Possibly sulfuric acid in the sweat of Jesus,.\nHowever there are many different acids in myrrh resin any of which could be a catalyst that could convert myrrh and aloes into cellulose acetate.    I a jumping way ahead of myself, blood stains 1st.   We now know blood will stay red on pure linen fabric after 72 hours.\nCovered in myrrh and aloes would it stay red  up to 2000 years?

I just have not flattened the cloth out yet. I did not want to ruin my linen statues. One of the main purposes of doing this was to find out if a 3D figure could be replicated with linen covered in myrrh and aloes.  To make a “3D linen statue”\n I did not know if a watered down version of myrrh resin would be enough to make a 3D linen mold.   Last time I did this I used 70 to 80% myrrh and less aloes.\nIt is always said,  “the color on Shroud fibers is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen”\nHow would myrrh and aloes coming in contact with linen accelerate the aging process of the linen?\nAnswer: It would not.\nLike I said I am not proposing a contact image of myrrh and aloes being responsible for the image.  I am more interested in the clear thin coating it leaves behind on the fabric which would contain\n1. Glucose      (A reducing sugar)\n2. Galactose   (A reducing sugar)\n3. Xylose         ( A reducing sugar)\n4. Arabinose\n5. Rhamnose\n6. Gluceronic Acid\n Something  that does cause accelerated aging is UV Light.  We all know what happens when we get to much sun, the result is an accelerated aging of the skin.\nI believe the thin coating of myrrh and aloes on the Shroud came in contact with UV Light. \nRay Rogers believes the image is within the micro thin coating and not on the fabric.  Any thoughts on that?\nMy final question is how would paint applied to the fabric cause accelerated aging of the linen fibers?\nWe all know what happens when a defendant goes  into court and his or her alternative theory explanation  does not match the forensic evidence.\nIt does not end well for the defendant.\nI am not going to try and change your mind on the paint theory. i fully understand how locked in you are into thinking that.

We measured about 35 cm from the bridge of our noses to the occipital bump on the back of our heads.  From where we could guess the bump on the back of the head of the TSM, this seemed to require the cloth to be drawn firmly over the head.  Problem is that there is no top of head image on the TS, so there had to be a cloth or cap on the top of the head masking it.  Mario disagreed with our analysis and had another explanation.

I really want you to think about it/pray about it before responding.   There is no urgency.\nWhen I say it,  I think you will disagree, but I would like for you to at least consider this possibility and do your best to gain the deepest possible empathy with Nicodemus and picture yourself in his position knowing the events that occurred on the day  Jesus/Yeshua was scourged and crucified.  BOTH?!\nThink about the scenario as if YOU are Nicodemus and what you would do,  You are rich and in a high enough  position.to where you were likely present when Jesus was scourged.\nI would also like you to look into how wounds were treated in this time, often done with sugars.  Myrrh and aloes contain multiple sugars.  \nHere is my theory\n  The Myrrh and Aloes mentioned in the Gospel of John were not purchased for a burial but to treat scourge wounds on a LIVING Jesus not a dead one.\n For whatever this is worth, The Spirit of God confirmed with me I am right on this.  That is of course here say evidence and holds ZERO weight.  \nThink about this. \nNicodemus may have been present at the scourging or at the very  least knew that the scourging took place and was extremely brutal. \nHis thinking at that time must have been,\n“THAT WILL BE HIS PUNISHMENT.  IT’S OVER”\nSo he purchases the myrrh and aloes to treat the scourge wounds, to prevent them from getting infected. full well  knowing multiple applications would be necessary over a period of weeks to prevent infection, and purchases the excessive amount.  Full body applications would be necessary over many weeks if proper healing was to occur. \nMyrrh resin was used in war to cover battle wounds.  It is a antiseptic.   Man In The Shroud had a lot of “battle wounds” \nMyrrh and aloes are more of the kind of thing you would use on a living person, not a dead one. \nTo crucify a person after nearly brutally scourging a person to death is extremely abnormal. .\nThis is very out of order.  \nNicodemus did not anticipate Jesus being crucified after, to be punished TWICE.\nScourged and Crucified!?   \nThe myrrh and aloes ends up being used in the burial,\nBut was not originally intended that way. \nSomething to think/pray about it. \nThe starch fractions and pectin on The Shroud.  I believe that is the remnant of the myrrh and aloes applied to Jesus and cloth .   A liquid form, not a ground up in a powder.  Mostly water weight. \nI also believe the image resides in that thin layer.

This is consistent with the use of flashing gold mosaic tiles to feature the Christ’s pallium in the Pudenziana apse mosaic.”\n 2. Reminder: the pallium is the Roman evolved form of the Greek himation, a word used in conjunction with the Image of Edessa\n3.Actually BOTH Greek and Hebrew (the latter as his mother tongue) could have been natural to Shaul/Paulus. Paulus had Mark as his amenuensis so he could have used him. 4.In Hebrew sovev mawr = “large shining wrap”\n 5.In the Second letter of Timothy there are many words and phrases that do NOT exist in natural Greek. The non natural Greek word phailonen “naturally” translates Hebrew sovev mawr.\n6.Reminder: the old French word Graal plays on/can be derived from the Hebrew phrase Gar El, “G.od dwells/shines (in it)”\n7.Now the Greek Word φαιλόνην (phailonen) is derived from the ancient Greek word phao, “to shine”, “give light” (e.g. a heavenly light such as surrounds angels when they appear on earth) or “make manifest”.Thus philologically speaking, the word phailonen most accurately denotes “a very large wrap that shines \nThe Wrap In This Video  “Shines”     Just another coincidence. \n1.Image of Edessa was known as “the image not made my human hands”\n2.Shroud of Turin is known as “image that cannot be made with human hands”\n3. Coincidence?   I don’t think so. \nClosing note:  Max you really should have a book written documenting everything you know about the Shroud.   If not, all your research and knowledge could be forever lost when you leave this world.  I think it is important you have a book written.   I would suggest the same to Daveb Of Wellington,  a very good writer.\n\n","date":"June 9, 2015 at 1:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-201417","author":"Dave Hines","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines","post":"Thank you Dave Hines for quoting me and all the best for your future investigations of the TS image.\n\n","date":"June 9, 2015 at 2:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-201421","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines","post":"Reminder for Dave Hines and Daveb: the Sindon bloodied dorsal and ventral imprint imply at least TWO different body-to-inner cloth configurations, not just one: first the body tightly wrapped up in shroudS then the body less tightly wrapped up in shroudS (not just one shroud).\n\n","date":"June 8, 2015 at 9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-201327","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines","post":"The initial and final configurations account for the 3D/volumetric recording of the bloodied body image.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2015 at 10:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-201332","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines","post":"Reminder for Max!  With the greatest respect to your detailed knowledge of ancient burial practices, the Sindon imprint implies no such thing.  Whether or not what was supposed to have been done, was done in fact, is entirely a matter of conjecture, John 19:40 notwithstanding.  We only have the Shroud and its image, we don’t know how the image was formed, and it can only speak for itself as best we can interpret it.  Concerning the disposition of the imaged cloth at the time of burial, the model proposed by Mario Latendresse which he discusses in detail is the one that to date best fits the geometry of the image, with minor modification only.  Anything else remains as pure conjecture, until proven otherwise! The near-adjacent text John 19:42 deliberately makes the point that it was the Jewish Day of Preparation, giving the hint that whatever was done was likely done somewhat hurriedly.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2015 at 4:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-201351","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines","post":"Daveb, \nIn the hypothesis the TS man is Yeshua’s, the latter was buried according to the JUDEAN burial custom, which implies to abide by a series of specific procedures. In the Second\nTemple period any corpse should be purified, dried out,\ndressed up/wrapped up in clean shrouds/burial cloths and speedily buried to abide by the halakha. Those were the core procedures. If some may fall in your most curious ‘take-and-leave’ interpretative line, here are a few additional reminders and questions for you:\nReminder one: The actual maximum time-frame (between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath) for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30-45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30-45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near-by, we are left with a minimum time-frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time-frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th-21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. His burial was NOT dispatched in less than half an hour as it is currently yet wrongly claimed. Yossef Ha-Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), DID NOT wait until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him at the risk of not abiding by the halakha and dishonouring his master’s memory! Just bear in mind too Yeshua was buried in the memorial tomb of Yosseph, a rich man, and not just thrown into a pit as a criminal. The rich man and secret disciple used the sindon/hemation he HAD bought for his own burial and used his newly hewn own garden-tomb near-by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus both did abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to the burial and honour his master’s memory. Speedy burials’ is the norm as far as Jewish/Judean funerary customs, practice and rites are concerned NOT the other. \nReminder two:  The 3 different conjugated koine Greek verbs used by the 4 evangelists meaning bind/fasten – compress/wrap up – wind/encircle and the koine Greek word for ‘shorter shrouds/pieces of linen’ (othonia) do imply Yeshua’s body was tightly wrapped up in shrouds not just draped over or loosely bound for the women to wash, anoint and tightly wrap up his naked body in shrouds at the first morning hour of the first day of the Hebrew week, that is just after the Shabbat, on the third day of Yeshua’s death. Most likely the stiff rigid body tightly wrapped up in shrouds (along with flower heads, ferocious thorns –used as stitches to hold the shrouds together– and even objects and tokens?) was encircled widthwise in a much larger “all-enveloping shroud” or sovev in Hebrew, sudara in Aramaic (the Korneilmünster Shroud = the Johannine “soudarion”?).\nReminder three:  Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking-gradual-unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner burial sheet soaked in an aqueous alkali solution (made of living or rainwater + ashes and/or limestone dust) and tautly drawn lenthgwise back and front from  head to toes, was compressed widthwise with shorter dry clean shrouds (othonia) as ALL PARTS of the body should be wrapped up (see Naḥmanides, Torat ha-Adam; Inyan ha-hoẓa’ah) and then, most likely, the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse was subjected to fumigation (see see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum) and the long inner burial sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up.To his likley five-six buriers and (secret) disciples Yeshua was no am ha-arets (“average citizen) but a prophet (and even the Messiah) whose freshly dried innocent blood had been shed, and should be kept with his body and purify. In the case here under study, Second Temple period speedy tahara in terms of wrapping in shrouds, purifying & drying out was an act of ultimate kindness to honor the deceased who died a violent death. It shall not be mistaken with careful physical cleansing Jewish/Judean ritual of a NON-bloody body.The (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation rite temporarily made up too for the anointing procedure that could not have been performed on burial since grinding spices was not allowed on shabbat to prepare spicy oils. Actually the women came back to Yeshua’s tomb after shabbath JUST TO ANOINT/apply the  spicy oil perfumes to his wrapping shrouds (NOT TO WASH, ANOINT AND  tightly WRAP up his naked body in shrouds as it is currently misthought). \nIn the koine Greek Gospels, do you really read Yeshua’s shroud was just draped over or loosely bound? And, besides anointing, do you really read the women were to wash and tightly wrap up Yeshua’s body in shrouds/linens clothes on Sunday morning? Why the wrapping in shrouds/linen clothes SHOULD be read as ONLY metaphoric in the Gospels while the anointing procedure the women were about to perform on Sunday Morning SHOULD be read as referring not only to FACTUAL anointing to be but also to FACTUAL washing and wrapping to be (had Yeshua’s body be still in the tomb)? This implicit interpretative line makes no sense a tall.\nReminder four: As a victim of a violent death, Yeshua’s body should be buried with his shed innocent blood and his post-mortem blood could not be DIRECTLY cleansed. The use of alkaline solution along with (myrrhic-)aloetic fumigation) could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now these two signals precisely tend to prove the body could have been purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial custom/practice. The true archaeological fact is there is more than one way by which blood could have become depleted of key ingredients if one considers the bloody body purifying & drying ritual scenario, which Adler clearly did not (crucifixion being an implicit assumption in all his discussion at the expense of specific burial practices, rites and customs).\nIt is light-years’ far from proven yet the burial cloth was just draped about or loosely bound the TS man’s body and the image recording implies JUST ONE body-to-cloth configuration. \nYOUR interpretation is plain conjecture not mine. \nMine is substantiated as far as forensic archaeological textile imprint and bloodstain pattern analyses, Judean/ancient Jewish burial practices and Biblical and Gospel accounts are concerned.\nNow you’re totally in denial the TS bloodied body front and back image recording calls for at least TWO DIFFERENT cloth-to-body CONFIGURATIONS (one resulting from tightly moulding/compressing the relief of the corresponding area with the linen cloth –in-soaked most likely with a watery solution– and another resulting from the gradual shrinking of the cloth while getting somewhat taut again front and back and unsticking –through a drying procedure and a resulting pressure release front and back), how then could you account for only one body-to-cloth configuration or in other words how could you account for:\n1/-  the correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3-D structure of a human body?\n2/-  the discrepancy between the apparent location of some bloodstains on the cloth versus the body image and their real location on the corpse, e.g. the oozing APPEARING to be in the hair image when actually it was first recorded at cheek level?\n3/- the fact that, to the sole exception of the bony areas of the eye-sockets and nasal septum, all the rest of the face shows irregular features and displacements.\nReminder:\n– most likely the TS man’s face was compressed by a sindon, sweat veil and skull cap (not to mention the possible use of a smal “jaw-box” made of three wooden pieces to keep the mouth closed, see my reconstruction).Now a forensic examination of the nose area reveals that in this operation the cartilaginous or fleshy rounded part of the nose would have been squashed. Actually the Sindon face tells us this area is not only squashed but also turned to the left with the TS man’s face right profile appearing as if embedded in his facial image.\n3/- the very fact the small of the back is recorded (despite lordosis) while the image at buttock level (upper thigh area) is not, which is not consistent at all with Mario’s explanation\n4/- the left thigh image being LARGER than expected compared to the right thigh one? \n5/- neither the backside image nor the calve images (of the anatomical left leg bent a little more than the right leg) appearing flattened but round AS IF these areas were ‘elevated’ AWAY FROM underlying shroud? Do you really advocate levitation?  Reminder: The very fact the buriers took great care not to disturb the blood is totally consistent with an ancient Judean/Jewish burial custom in terms of corpse-covered-in-blood tahara (purification ritual). It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. Re the backside gap, the latter JUST CANNOT be explained “by either the distance of the cloth from the body, […] or possibly by packing with flora or spices.” There is a visual body image discontinuity most likely due to a “S ease fold”.\n6/- the presence of some scourge marks at popliteal fossae (back of the knees) level while there is no back-of-the (partially flexed)-knee images? \nReminder: Miller and Pellicori UV photos do show that there are scourge marks and yet no (or next to no) body image (this in conjunction with an air gap). The eye-brain coordination system has somehow “to fill the anatomical/air gap” (see Fanti’s most circumlocutive prose misleadingly describing the scourge marks “in correspondence to lower luminance levels of the body image”, A69 in Evidences for Testing Hypotheses about the Body … )\nIn the light of the general economy of the TS man HD bloody body image, such paradoxical visual evidence is consistent with:\na/a blood comes first-body image second scenario\nb/creation of an air gap as the (watery solution in-soaked) long inner burial sheet (TS) first stuck to the body (hence the mirror image of blood transfer by direct contact) and then somehow got taut (too rapidly for the popliteal fossae to be correctly\n recorded and 3D encoded).\n7/-  the unusually long arms and seemingly long fingers on the right hand image imply both dislocation ( and uneven sindon stretching at arm level? During the image formation process, the tightly pulled and compressed in-soaked long inner burial sheet didn’t quite return to its natural size and shape as it got sort of taut again lengthwise through shrinking (through drying out). The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from adduction to abduction thus creating sort of a stiff rigid arm counter-pressure to shrouds’ wrapping-up pressure. Through drying out and slight cloth-to-body pressure release as the Shroud got somewhat taut again through shrinking, the arms mechanically tended to slightly raised again above body. It resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint.\nYes indeed, in the light of the TS bloodied dorsal and ventral  body imprints and the three other Gospel accounts, John 19: 40 can read: “Then they took the body of Yeshua, and wound and compressed and fastened it in linen shrouds with the spices, as the manner of the Judeans is to bury”.\n\n","date":"June 9, 2015 at 9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-201398","author":"Max patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines","post":"On another thread, I wrote:\n(on June 8, 2015 at 11:33 am)\nMost likely, the sindon/himation was in-soaked with an alkaline solution prior to be used as inner burial winding sheet.
