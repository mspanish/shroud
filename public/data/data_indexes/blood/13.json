Or was he misquoted?","post":"I have what may be an ignorant question, but a question none the less. It is accepted that the image did not form where here was blood stains.\nThe image on the Shroud is most pronounced on one side of the Shroud. My assumption is that the image appears on the side of he Shroud that was touching or adjacent to the body. I do not think here is really any question of that. That means that exterior of the Shroud in the tomb would be that part which was exterior as it wrapped (was lain across?) the body.\nThere are some very faint markings of a few parts of the image on the exterior which for most of the Shroud’s recorded history was hidden behind the Holland lining.\nBut what about evidence of blood stains? Has here been any identification of blood seepage through the cloth, interior to exterior?\n\n","date":"April 18, 2012 at 11:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/18/did-he-say-blood-underneath-the-hands-or-was-he-misquoted/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10539","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Did he say blood underneath the hands?

They found this when they unstitched parts of the Shroud from the backing cloth and ran light probes under the cloth. This was also confirmed during the 2002 restoration when the backing cloth was completely removed. As for the image; again in 2002 they also believe what they found was a ‘partial’ face image on the back side of the ventral image, coinciding, with the ventral face image. Apparently no other part of the cloth; ventral or dorsal showed any image except as mentioned above. \nAs for image under the blood, I believe this was confirmed by a couple of researchers in that when a blood flake was lifted or broke away from the threads the linen was completely white underneath. It escapes me right now who these researchers were, sorry.\nR\n\n","date":"April 18, 2012 at 3:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/18/did-he-say-blood-underneath-the-hands-or-was-he-misquoted/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-10546","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"}]
