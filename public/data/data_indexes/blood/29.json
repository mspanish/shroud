Certainly, those in the immediate discussion are familiar with them.]  \nA specific comment to Thibault: Have the bloodstains in non-image areas been evaluated in similar photographs, i.e. off-elbow, off-foot?

That’s why I was careful to add qualifying words like “mostly.” However, looking at, for example, Fig.8-2, I do not agree that any of the fibres themselves are reddish-brown. I think that is due to a coating of particles, possibly blood derivatives. The fibres themselves, I think, are yellow. The whitish patches are due to the overexposure of the reflective sheen of true shroud material.\nHowever, you may have a point if the yellow threads are coloured thanks to “serum” rather than “image.” They just look the same in photographs. I think if the protease tests had been carried out on threads rather than fibrils, and if, indeed, yellow blood threads had turned white, while yellow image threads remained the same colour, I would find Adler’s findings more convincing. As it is, I do not think the matter is settled.\n\n","date":"November 23, 2013 at 6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/23/hugh-farey-on-the-possibility-of-image-color-under-bloodstains/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-52565","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Hugh Farey on the possibility of image color under bloodstains","post":"\nHugh Farey :\nThanks Kelly.
