[{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Yannick scores again.\nThis is an excellent post by Yannick who has made many excellent contributions. I am not sure this “debate” among the experts (Zugibe vs. everybody else) is determinative of the essential issue: the authenticity of he Shroud, and beyond that the reality of the Resurrection.\nOccam’s razor is not a scientific principle but a philosophical one. For example, there is no simplest explanation of quantum mechanics. It does have its application in science. For example, the triumph of the Galileo-Newton view over the Ptolemaic view of planetary and solar orbits. \nPtolemy began with the view point that the Earth was the center of the Universe which was really a philosophical-religious theory- revelation. Thus the planets and the sun had to do a little loop in their orbits around the earth. Actually, the mathematics worked pretty well in making predictions of eclipses and such. However, it was simply wrong and it was simply wrong for more than a millennia. However, it was not wrong enough to spare Galileo the Inquisition and the danger of death at the stake.\nNewtonian physics became a philosophical position as well as a scientific one despite the questions it could not answer correctly. In fact that the duality of light as both wave and particle was demonstrated a century before the advent of quantum mechanics. Newtonians were aghast.\nI am not so concerned about how the lash marks were preserved as to when the body parted company with the Shroud. Does this debate have anything to offer on that issue? Although   it is subject to some deviations, to me the most important thing about the image is this: the body of the Man in the Shroud shows signs of rigor mortis and no signs of putrefaction. Rigor mortis begins upon death and is released approximately 48 hours later. The evidence of putrefaction bi-products emerge from the body approximately 48 hours later (there is a relationship between putrefaction of the muscle tisue and the release of rigor mortis.) \nThe time of Christ’s death was Three PM Friday. 48 hours after Christ’s death would have been Three PM Sunday afternoon. Does anybody have any idea what might have happened to Christ’s body during that period of time? I do, and more than a billion people since that time have had the same idea.\nApplying Occam’s Razor to the mystery of the Shroud’s image and the evidence of the blood residue there is one simple explanation: the Resurrection. To paraphrase Rabbi Hillel: Every thing else is commentary.\n\n","date":"July 28, 2013 at 7:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-39941","author":"John Klotz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"I VERY MUCH SO AGREE WITH YOU I DONT THINK THE BODY WAS WASHED EITHER  THERE WOULD BE NO DIRT ON THE SHROUD IF IT WAS WASHED THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR VIEW POINT I DO AGREE\n\n","date":"July 28, 2013 at 9:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-39951","author":"darla mann","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"to “score again” one has to understand what he is talking about.

No reference is made of fluorescence around the scourge marks is made until the third photo (the back), when they say “Many scourges have fluorescing bordering areas.” That’s all.\nNext, “almost all the scourge marks are showing the same precise dumbbell-like shape, the same presence of halos of serum around them, the same color, etc.” This is another generalisation clearly not borne out by observation. There are at least two different marks that might be described as dumbbell shaped, and a large proportion of the ‘striated’ kind. The presence and extent of the serum haloes is even more various.\nNext, Yannick finds an irreconcilable difference between “Barbet, Adler, Lavoie and others” who think that the scourge marks were caused by a transfer of exudates from still moist or remoistened blod clots, and Zugibe, who thinks that the clots were dry and were re-activated by washing. I don’t understand the difference. \nHowever, Yannick’s main point is that it is impossible to wash a body with an accuracy finer than 2cm. “How in the world does the person who did this rapid washing (remember that it if the Shroud man is Jesus, this would have been an hasty burial) could have dared to wash the immediate region surrounding the post-mortem blood flow (including the area located at less than 2 cm.” Well, I would. In fact, if I wanted to wipe away an overall smear of blood across the entire back (as we see in those photos of Philippine flagellants), but leave a specific mass of blood in place for religious reasons, I think I could do it with an accuracy of about half a centimetre. Would I use a sponge? Probably not. I’d use damp cloths.\n“Seriously, does that sound credible and rational to you in the context of a Jewish burial that would have been done in a way to prevent any disturbance of the post-mortem blood that was still present on the corpse because it was considered impure by the Jewish Law? One thing’s for sure: Not for me! This idea of a very precise (almost surgical) washing in this zone is quite simply ludicrous to me.” Well, that’s fine for Yannick, but it seems both possible and perfectly normal to me.\n“I prefer by far my own hypothesis.” Well that’s fine too, but I don’t think it’s credible. Basically you seem to accept that the image was formed from emanation from the body, through a coating of dried blood, without the blood affecting the image formation. You go to the most elaborate details in trying to find a difference between dried blood on the body, the cloth, the hair and so on, without any evidence that the image shows any such difference.\nNext, the discovery of a few minute fragments of stone in some parts of the shroud is given as evidence that the body wasn’t washed, whereas it could be equally good evidence, given that so little has been found, that in fact it was washed, but not very thoroughly.\nOverall, the bloodstains are a complex part of the mystery of the shroud, and I think any explanation for them is likely to be fairly complex itself. Even Occam would have had some difficulty in knowing exactly how to wield his razor. For me though, given the choice, Zugibe beats Clement hands down.\n\n","date":"July 28, 2013 at 10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-39955","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Well said Hugh!

I post it earlier directly to Dan Porter via his email address and, finally, I thought that it could be a good thing also to post it here:\nI know the value of my hypothesis, I know the strength of my arguments against Zugibe, and unlike what jesterof can think, I know that Zugibe’s hypothesis cannot fit with Barbet’s own hypothesis for the good and simple reason that, in Zugibe’s scenario, the outcome of a washing of the body would be a removal of the dried blood clots over the scourge wounds, which would produce an oozing of post-mortem blood in a LIQUID FORM (you just have to read carefully Zugibe’s paper on the subject and to watch closely the pictures of an experiment he did, especially the one called “figure 2”, to understand this) and that’s completely different than the kind of transfer described by Barbet from exudates of re-moistened blood clots.  \nIn Zugibe’s mind, after the supposed washing, there would have been no more blood clots over the wounds and this would have caused an oozing of post-mortem blood in liquid form.  It’s only in the case they would not have placed the body Inside the Shroud right or soon after the washing that the oozing of post-mortem blood would have started to produce a blood clot again that could eventually have stained the cloth in the way described by Barbet in his book, but seriously, such an idea is not rational at all, especially in the context of an hasty burial…  \nJust think about it:  What would have been the most rational thing to do after the washing?  To place the body Inside the Shroud of course!  Or to rub the body with some burial products and then, placed it Inside the Shroud.  And in both scenarios, it is liquid blood that would have stained the cloth in all the places where there were scourge wounds because, in both cases, there is no way the oozing of liquid post-mortem blood could have had the opportunity to produce a blood clot that would have been “solid” enough to cause a very good mirror imprint on the fabric…  \nNevertheless, Zugibe thinks such a liquid transfer from an oozing of post-mortem blood (see “figure 1” in his paper to see the result of a transfer experiment he did and see “figure 2” to be convinced the oozing in question would be in LIQUID FORM) can produce a pretty good and precise imprint of the wound.  I agree with him that if the oozing of liquid post-mortem blood is not too huge and if it stays in the vicinity of the wound and if the piece of fabric is not pressed hard at all on it (very gently in fact), then yes, you can obtain a pretty good imprint of the wound in question.  But nevertheless, as Barbet said very clearly in his book, for any blood transfer that happen in a liquid form on a piece of fabric, inevitably, you will see some preferential directions in the blood stain that will tend to follow the weaving of the fabric that has been stained.  And if you check closely “figure 1” in Zugibe’s paper, it’s pretty easy to notice just that: there are some little lines of blood that are going away from the central stain because they the oozing of blood from the wound had a tendency to follow the pattern of the paper towel used by Zugibe for his experiment…  As Barbet said: this is what always happen when a blood transfer on a fabric is done with a blood in a liquid form.  Zugibe’s experiment proved that Barbet was right about that and sorry but it is not what we see on the Shroud concerning the scourge marks, which have no tendency at all to follow the direction of the weave herringbone pattern.  This is a clear indication that these stains were produced by exudates of humid blood clots and not from a transfer that would have been made with liquid blood (like it was the case in Zugibe’s experiment).\nAnd even if I agree with Zugibe that, in the context of a very gentle contact between the oozing of blood and the fabric, you can obtain a pretty good imprint, I ask you the question: what would have been the result if his experiment would have been done to simulate the high body weight pressure that would have been present on the back side of the corpse when it was laid into the Shroud???   The answer is easy to determine:  SMUDGES ALL OVER THE PLACE !  And there is absolutely none on the Shroud, not even on the back region!  This is a sure proof that the scourge wounds came from exudates of humid blood clots as described by Barbet, Adler, Lavoie and others and not from a transfer from an oozing of liquid post-mortem blood as described by Zugibe.  Again, you must remember that the body should have stayed untouched for several minutes if you want to believe that the oozing of liquid post-mortem blood had enough time to produce a humid clot prior to the deposit of the corpse inside the Shroud and such a scenario seem pretty ridiculous in the case of an hasty AND INCOMPLETE burial, while those who were there knew full well they had to come back anyway on Sunday morning to complete the burial rite correctly.\nAll this just don’t sound right to me. It much easier for me to believe the scourge wounds get infected while the Shroud man was still alive on the cross, thus producing some oozing of lymph with maybe other bloody material, which would have kept these wounds (and probably others like some puncture wounds in the scalp) humid enough for a long time, and this would have cause a great delay in the clotting process, with the result that when the body was laid Inside the Shroud, these particular blood clots were 1- still humid enough to stain the cloth at the very moment the body was laid Inside it or 2- dried after death but they became re-moistened before or, more probably, after the body had been laid Inside the Shroud.  Such a scenario, on the contrary to the one proposed by Zugibe, would have no problem at all to explain the presence of precise scourge marks located less than 2cm away from a post-mortem blood flow, which could not have been washed.  \nOn this subject, it’s fun to note that Hugh, who desperately wants to defend at all cost Zugibe’s hypothesis, don’t seem to have any problem believing such an irrational scenario, while, in the very same comment, he dare to state this truth: “…that in fact it (the body) was washed, but not very thoroughly.”  Sorry Hugh but if the washing was not done very thoroughly (note: this is by far the most rational scenario in the case of the Shroud man), how in the world such a rapid washing was able to completely remove the blood clot of some scourge marks located at less than 2 cm from a post-mortem blood flow in order to produce an oozing of post-mortem blood in a liquid form (such an oozing was necessary to produce the scouge marks on the cloth if we believe Zugibe), while at the same time not touching at all the nearby post-mortem blood flow!  Imagine the precision that would have been necessary to accomplish such a feat very rapidly!!!  Sorry, but to believe such a scenario is more probable than mine (which is pretty much the same than the one described by Barbet), you must still believe in Santa Claus…  Seriously, if we stay honnest here, don’t you see that such a scenario is very improbable in the context I described in my challenge (especially in the light of all the facts, data and observation I brought in, particularly the presence of some precise and well-defined scourge mark in the immediate vicinity of a big post-mortem blood flow)?\n\n","date":"July 28, 2013 at 7:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-39981","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"I am not sure.

I would suggest this is due to the fact that the small of the back region would not have pressed down onto the shroud unlike the central back region and buttocks, hence the scourge marks which would have also been on Jesus’s body on the lower back did not transfer onto the shroud.\nNow if the scourge marks on the small of the back did not transfer, because there was no contact between the small of the back and the shroud, then where does that leave the horizontal trickle of blood running along the lower back? This would mean that either this trickle somehow flowed down from the dead man’s ribs and dripped down and ran along  the shroud AFTER he was placed in the shroud, or it is a later fabrication (it wouldn’t make sense that the body was washed first, except for a post mortem trickle of blood across the lower back, then the flow we see on the lower back region on the shroud was transferred by contact between body and shroud when the absence of scourge marks strongly indicate there was no contact – if you get my drift!) .\nIf it was the former, then that could explain why the trickle is so close in one or two spots to the scourge marks, getting around Yannick’s questions around the precision of the clean up.\nThink about it, only really (impossibly?) thick blood might run down the ribs of a horizontally laid out corpse and run all the way along the small of the back. More likely is the blood fell off the side of the body and trickled along the shroud, carried by the momentum and velocity  of a flow across the ribs and the fall of the blood, and presumably more fluid blood (possibly with water?)\nI don’t know, there’s something odd about the lower back trickle relative to scourge marks.\nBut question for people more biology-literate than me… if Jesus was hours dead by the time he was placed in the shroud, what chance there might be of more trickling out of blood that far after the death event??? it seems quite unlikely that there would be post mortem blood flows maybe 2-3 hours after Jesus had died on the cross…\nThoughts????\n\n","date":"July 29, 2013 at 4:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40010","author":"Matthias","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"In one of his papers, Zugibe states ‘clearly’ that corpse’s can still bleed, even many hours after death, as he witnessed this many times during his numerable autopsies.

He finds it difficult to understand how, from a body literally matted with blood from head to foot, only a few pre-mortem trickles have managed to transfer images of themselves, very neatly and without smudging or smearing in spite of the handling the body received both pre- and post-mortem. Yannick hopes that some very special circumstance arose in which this was exactly the case. It is, I think, precisely this problem which led Barbet and others to suppose that the body was indeed more or less dry until shortly before being enshrouded, when, by another special circumstance, the dried blood was sufficiently moistened to permit exudations to transfer an exact pattern onto the cloth. The supposed serum rings were, to Barbet, a verification of that, although serum exudes from whole blood as well. The only real finding in favour of the exudation hypothesis is the lack of potassium in the minerals of the ‘blood,’ which Adler attributes, not very convincingly, to the retention of erythrocytes in the body.\nYannick dismisses the possibility that the post-washing blood may have been allowed to semi-clot again before the body was enshrouded, which I think is fair. It is clear that Zugibe thinks whole blood, not serum clot retraction exudate, is on the shroud. In that case, says, Barbet, the blood would have seeped outwards across the cloth (by capillary action), and not leave those very neat-edged shapes that in fact we see. I don’t think this is necessarily true. The viscosity of blood seems very variable, as evidenced by the different shapes of the wrist-wound (very slow) and the arm-trickles (very runny).\nYannick does not seem to notice that Zugibe differentiates between the blood-flows and the scourge-marks, although, to be fair, the point is not really clearly made. Zugibe says that having washed and re-opened the scourge wounds (which are more like contusions than cuts) there would be “an oozing of bloody material” which I think is intended to be different from a liquid blood flow.\nThe whole subject of exudates, while apparently solving some of the problems with the blood images, is mired in complications which neither Barbet nor Yannick clarify at all well. The fact that they clearly contain a good deal more red colour (hemolysed erythrocytes) than serum is a serious objection, the neat way in which even long-dried trickles suddenly produce neat images of themselves, the attempt to keep the wounds moist by bacterial infection – none of these have any basis in reality. Googling “wound dressing removal” shows what real exudates look like!\nFinally, I see that I “desperately want to defend at all cost Zugibe’s hypothesis.” Not only is this nonsense, but it illustrates Yannick’s mindset much better than it illustrates mine. Scientists do not desperately defend things, not become so convinced of their own hypotheses that they do not admit of any problem with them that needs refinement. As it stands, the serum clot retraction hypothesis, while possibly useful as an explanation for the scourge wounds, makes little or no sense for the blood-trickles, and is directly refuted by the marks over the purported holes in the wrist, chest and feet, which look nothing like clot retractions at all.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2013 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40015","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"\nRon :\nIn one of his papers, Zugibe states ‘clearly’ that corpse’s can still bleed, even many hours after death, as he witnessed this many times during his numerable autopsies.

And if you want to be convinced that the removal of a dried blood clot over a wound will produce an oozing of post-mortem blood in a liquid form, please check again “figure 2” in Zugibe’s paper…  Even a close look at “figure 1” is enough to see that this kind of post-mortem oozing is in liquid form because this picture surely don’t present a solid blood clot!!!\nIt’s also truly important to note that Zugibe developed his hypothesis on a probable false premise, which is that if there was a lot of dried blood flows on the body of the Shroud man when he was placed in the Shroud, there would not have been any body image formed on the cloth because it is a fact that the bloodstains on the cloth were able to prevent the formation of a body image on the cloth.  I already addressed that point in a previous post (https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/#comment-39120) and I said that if the body image was caused (at least partially) by the natural released of post-mortem gases and molecules that were left on the skin, the hair and the dried blood clots after the drying of the sweat, there would be no reason at all to think that the presence of such dried blood flows on the skin of the Shroud man would have been enough to prevent the formation of a body image in these areas, since the « active agent » (i.e. the biological products left on-top of these dried clots by the drying sweat) would have been present OVER these blood clots and not UNDER them, with the result of being able to react directly with the surface of the cloth without the dried clots being able to act as a shield between these biological products and the cloth.  In such a truly possible context (sorry for those who are members of the supernatural fringe), there is no way to categorically state something like Zugibe said, i.e. that the presence of dried blood flows on the skin of the Shroud man would have surely prevent the formation of a body image.  THIS IS FAR FROM BEING A SCIENTIFIC FACT and, nevertheless, Zugibe base is whole hypothesis on this shaky premise…\n\n","date":"July 29, 2013 at 11:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40040","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Another important thing to understand and to consider before someone wants to answer the four questions I asked in my previous post (especially questions #1 and #2), is the fact that Zugibe never tried to reproduce the important body weight pressure that was surely present in the back region when the blood transfer occurred in this area…  What a MISTAKE!

It is a post-mortem blood in LIQUID FORM and that’s what Zugibe thinks was responsible for the scourge marks on the cloth.  See is picture 1 and you will clearly see that it is not at all a solid blood clot from an oozing of liquid blood but that it is truly an oozing of liquid post-mortem blood.  It is from this oozing that Zugibe tried to reproduce the scourge marks on the Shroud by very gently touching this liquid blood with a paper towel.  As I said, that produce a pretty good imprint in this context but what would have been the result if he would have reproduced the high pressure in the back region due to the body weight?  Of course, there would have been evident smudges with no precise serum halo around the stain and the main stain would have had a clear tendency to follow the pattern of his paper towel.  Look, even with the gently touch he used for his experiment, you can see some tiny parts of the stain that tend to follow the pattern of the paper towel!  And that’s exactly what Barbet said in his book versus a blood transfer that would imply liquid blood…  \nYou said: “The more or less exact markings of the scourge wounds on the back actually are the proof that the body was washed, otherwise the edges would be smeared.”\nRead my hypothesis again (based on Barbet’s ideas) and you will see that the blood transfer I proposed, that would come from exudates of re-moistened blood clots, would not produce any smudges on the cloth, but on the contrary, would produce a very precise Mirror imprint just like we see on the Shroud.  And I know this by experience!  Remember the experience I’ve done with a dried blood clot that had formed on my arms about 5 hours before?  I just had to put some saliva over it and it was enough to produce a very precise Mirror imprint of the wound on a paper without any smear or smudge!  This is a good proof that the kind of blood transfer proposed by Barbet (which is totally different than the one proposed by Zugibe, unless they would have leave the body alone for several minutes after the washing) is able to explain the precise scourge wounds on the Shroud.\nI think your opinion on the subject is somewhat biased by the idea that the metal balls or the bones at the end of the flagrum would not have produced any superfical cuts on the skin, which I think it’s false, just by looking at the scourge marks.  If there would have not been any superficial cutting of the skin there, there would not have been any blood clots over the contusions wounds and consequently, there would not have been any blood markings on the cloth.  I think it’s fair to conclude that some superficial cuttings in the form of a dumbbell must have been produced by the flagrum, which would have caused some bleeding and eventually many blood clots over these wounds later on…  If we don’t agree on this, it’s evident that we would never be able to agree on the kind of blood transfer that occurred on the cloth.\n\n","date":"July 30, 2013 at 8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40118","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Last note to jesterof:  I hope you can agree with me that the idea that the body would have been left alone without anyone touching it for several minutes after a potential washing is far from being probable in the context of the hasty burial of Jesus…  That’s important because, if Zugibe was right, this is the only way the after-washing oozing of post-mortem blood he proposed could have produced a precise mirror imprint on the cloth.  Effectively, it’s only if the body would have been left alone for a quite long time (left completely alone…  not rub with burial products or any other action that would have produced some touching of the body) that the liquid oozing of blood could have clot enough to become enough “solid” to produce the kind of mirror imprints we see for the scourge marks.

I don’t think pressure in itself will produce smudges, if the body is not moved. If the scourge marks are not deep cuts, but contusions or grazes (even if some of the skin has been scoured off), then the surfaces would exude not liquid blood, but, as Zugibe describes it “an oozing of bloody material,” which I take to mean the seepage that you find on a healing wound after pulling off a scab. It could be quite viscous, and it may be the clarity of the marks is because of, not in spite of, the pressure. Zugibe’s wound photos are not particularly relevant here, but his upper photo does not show blood flow, only transfer from the wound to paper towel. I don’t think the scourge wounds would have been as bloody myself. His lower photos are of actual holes, and they are the ones oozing blood.\n2- If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain that there appeared to be no scourge stain that tend to follow the herringbone weave pattern of the cloth?\nThis depends on the viscosity of the liquid, which depends primarily on its water content. Barbet was, I suppose, dripping fresh blood directly onto a cloth. The Lavoies’ experiments on the transfer of blood from plastic to cloth after half an hour showed remarkably that the blood clots did not spread out at all, unless it was specifically moistened beforehand. Having said that, since the plasma part of the blood is invisible to the naked eye, we do not know that it has not spread out along the fibres by capillary action.\n3- If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain the presence of distinct halos of serum around much of the scourge marks?\nI wish you could see Miller and Pellicori’s photos. There are NO “distinct haloes of serum” around the scourge marks. There are some indistinct fluorescent bordering areas, which are entirely consistent with some serum seeping out into the fibres by capillary action.\n4- If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain the presence of some precise scourge marks at less than 2 cm of an evident post-mortem blood flow, while you know that it was against Jewish law to remove or disturb such a post-mortem blood and while you also know that if there was a washing, it would have been done rapidly (you even mention in a previous post that the washing was most probably “not done very thoroughly”)?\nJust for you, I have laid a trail of ketchup on my kitchen table, and then smeared more ketchup onto the table close to it. I can confirm that I can remove the entire smear, without disturbing the original trail, with a few pieces of absorbent paper towel. If there happened to scourge marks under the smear, they would have been exposed by my wiping.\n\n","date":"July 30, 2013 at 7:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40117","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Hugh, I will answer your points one by one :\n1- You said that you don’t think the pressure in itself would produce smudges if the body was not moved.  Ok, but here’s the truth: the body WAS moved!  It had to!  Seriously, do you think they placed the body inside the Shroud right on the little stone bench that was carved in the rock of the tomb?  Of course not!  First, they must have placed the body inside the Shroud in a central place in the tomb where there was enough space to do that (especially the covering of the frontal part of body) and then, they must have moved the enshrouded body to his final resting place, which was most probably, as I said, a stone bench carved inside one of the wall of the tomb.  That’s you first bad understanding of the burial context.  Just with this moving of the enshrouded body, if the scourge marks would have been caused by an oozing of bloody material in liquid form instead of exudates of moistened blood clots, it’s evident that some smears and smudges would have been produced on the cloth.  There is absolutely none on the Shroud!  Using Occam’s razor, the most probable way for this to happen is still the kind of transfer described by Barbet, Adler, Lavoie, etc., which is a transfer coming from still moistened or, more probably, from re-moistened blood clots.  Also, in your comment, you completely disregard how Zugibe did his transfer experiment, i.e. with only a gentle touch of the oozing of bloody material in liquid form (look again at figure 1 in his paper and you’ll clearly see that the bloody oozing was not solid and was not looking like a blood clot, but instead, was looking like an small oozing of liquid post-mortem blood).  As I said, of course, with that kind of gentle touch that exclude high pressure, you can obtain a pretty good imprint on a piece of fabric!  BUT…  That’s not at all the situation that would have been present on the back region when they would have placed the body that would have been recently washed on one part of the Shroud!  NOT AT ALL!  Zugibe completely failed to reproduce this very particular condition and that’s one of the biggest mistake he made.  You just can’t pretend having obtain a very good result that look like the scourge wounds on the Shroud if your transfer experiment doesn’t account for the high pressure that was present on all the back region, due to the body weight!  Sorry but only exudates from moistened blood clots can produce a precise mirror imprint with no smears or smudges in such a context.  This fact, alone, should be enough for you to rethink your conclusion and start thinking that Barbet et al. were maybe right after all…\n2- Barbet never pretend that the bloodstains made from pre-mortem blood clots were obtained with some liquid blood but with an exudates of re-moistened blood clots, probably due to the damp atmosphere inside the tomb and inside the Shroud, as well as a very probable released of water vapor by the dead body.  This is the only way, in my mind, you can obtain such precise mirror imprints, especially in areas like the buttocks and the back region, where there was a high pressure due to the body weight.  Concerning the Lavoie experiment, the simple fact that some moisture was needed on the clots in order to produce a good imprint is a good confirmation of the validity and the strength of Barbet’s hypothesis (which is pretty much the same as mine).  Again, if Zugibe was correct about the oozing of liquid post-mortem blood, it’s evident that there would have been a tendency for the scourge marks to follow the weave pattern of the cloth, while we don’t see that on the Shroud.  And again, let me ask you to check another look at the result of Zugibe with a paper towel…  Don’t you see some clear lines going off the central stain because the blood material had some tendency to follow the pattern of the paper towel, even though he touched it very gently?  I see it easily and you must see it also…  The stain look a bit like a little star with those small lines of blood going away from the central stain.  We don’t see that on the Shroud concerning the scourge wounds (and also concerning any other bloodstains coming from pre-mortem blood, like the blood flows in the hair or on the forearms).\nOk, that’s all for today.  I don’t have enough time to answer your 2 other points.

By the way, to my knowledge, Barbet, Lavoie, Adler and others medical or blood experts have never considered the possibility that the pre-mortem bloodstains on the Shroud could have come from more than a single transfer mode, unlike what jesterof and Hugh seem to believe…  And the presence of a serum halo around a vast majority of all these pre-mortem bloodstains (sorry for Hugh but Pellicori and Miller were clear about that fact, even though it’s truly possible that in many cases, you don’t see a perfectly round serum halo) in the best clue we have to think that, effectively, all these bloodstains were transferred to the cloth with the same exact transfer mode.\n\n","date":"July 30, 2013 at 2:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40129","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"I write again my last sentence because there was a typing mistake:  And the presence of a serum halo around a vast majority of all these pre-mortem bloodstains (sorry for Hugh but Pellicori and Miller were clear about that fact, even though it’s truly possible that in many cases, you don’t see a perfectly round serum halo) IS the best clue we have to think that, effectively, all these bloodstains were transferred to the cloth with the same exact transfer mode (exudates of still moistened or re-moistened blood clots).\n\n","date":"July 30, 2013 at 2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40130","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Hugh, I got some time to answer your point #3:\nAs I said to David, even though it’s truly possible that in many cases, you don’t see a perfectly round serum halo around many scourge marks, this cannot be taken as a fact that goes against the hypothesis of Barbet, Adler and Lavoie of a transfer from exudates of still moistened or re-moistened blood clots…  Not at all in fact.  Look… It’s evident that, in the case of tiny blood clots such as the dumbbell-shape scourge wounds, you have evidently more chance that not a lot of the serum was able to transfer and stain the cloth around the stains of blood exudates. So, if it’s true (I don’t know for sure about that but I assume you’re right) that, around many scourge marks, you cannot see a perfectly rounded serum halo, that surely not mean that these stains do not come from exudates of still moistened or re-moistened blood clots.\nAnd here’s the main point versus this subject:  To my knowledge, no Shroud researcher (not even Zugibe!) has ever been able to produce a bloodstain on a piece of fabric (linen or something else) that would be made of post-mortem blood and that would present the same kind of serum halo than those that were clearly seen around a vast majority of pre-mortem bloodstains (including most of the scourge marks) by Miller and Pellicori on their UV fluorescent photos.  \nHave you noticed how Zugibe kept a dead silence concerning the fact that there really is an halo of serum around most of the scourge marks on the Shroud, as well as he kept a dead silence versus the fact that he was probably not able to reproduce such serum halos with the oozing of post-mortem blood he used for his transfer experiments?  This dead silence speak very loud to me!  And if I’m wrong about that, then explain to me why he do not said a damn word concerning this crucial question!!!  To me, it’s evident he wasn’t able to reproduced these clear stains that surround most of the scourge marks because if he would have been able to achieve that feat with post-mortem blood (I really don’t think this is scientifically possible anyway), he would surely have talked about that in his paper.\n\n","date":"July 30, 2013 at 3:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40139","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"\nYannick Clément :\nLast note to jesterof:  I hope you can agree with me that the idea that the body would have been left alone without anyone touching it for several minutes after a potential washing is far from being probable in the context of the hasty burial of Jesus…  That’s\nimportant because, if Zugibe was right, this is the only way the after-washing oozing of post-mortem blood he proposed could have produced a precise mirror imprint on the cloth.

Just by trying to put yourself in this Jew’s shoes (or sandals if you prefer) and you will surely come up with the conclusion that it was a very dangerous and quite unnecessary move to make, especially when you try to beat the clock before the coming of the Sabbath and you do this while you were totally unprepared to do so, because prior to the night before (less than 24 hours), nobody (except Jesus himself and maybe Judas) knew that Jesus would end up on a cross!  Seriously and honestly, in such an hasty and unprepared burial context, it’s truly improbable that this anonymous person would have dare to make such a precise washing…  This just doesn’t fit right with the context!  And I’m not even talking about the true possibility that such a partial washing was not even allowed by the Jewish Law when it come to the dead body of a crucified criminal or the other true possibility reported by Lavoie in a paper he wrote years ago (in 1982 exactly) about the fact (he did a pretty good historical research in order to write down this conclusion) that “if a man dies a violent death and blood his shed, the blood is not washed from the body.”\nSeriously, the presence of some precise scourge marks in the immediate vicinity of one evident post-mortem blood flow should be enough to understand that the body of the Shroud man, if he was Jesus of course, was most probably not washed at all…  It’s true that it is possible to make such a precise washing, but it is simply not rational in the particular context of Jesus’ burial, especially when you consider that he had been condemned to the cross as a public criminal.  Note that this is precisely the kind of problem that can be better resolved with the use of Occam’s razor and in this case, Occam say that a surgical type of washing could have been performed in the vicinity of the post-mortem blood flows in the lower back region is far from being the most rational and probable scenario in the context of Jesus’ burial…\nFinally, here’s another problematic fact for Zugibe’s hypothesis that we must consider:  The surgical washing that would have been needed to remove the dried blood clots over the 2 scourge wounds that are located at 1.7 and 1.3 cm from an evident post-mortem blood flow would have been performed in the lower back region of a man of 5’10” and 175 pounds (more or less), which is an area that would not have been easy to reach!  This fact is often forgotten when people discuss the probability level of such a precise washing in this particular place!  Obviously, when we consider this additional problem, it’s easy to conclude that such a surgical washing in this zone is very far from being probable.\n\n","date":"July 31, 2013 at 8:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40187","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Here, I would like to give my thoughts concerning the 2 major arguments that are constantly brought in to support Zugibe’s hypothesis of a partial washing of the body:\nArgument #1: Logically, we must assume that there was much more clotted blood on the skin of the Shroud man when he died than what is seen on the Shroud (especially in the regions where there were some scourge hits that should have cause some important blood flows coming from the leather tongues) and because we know for a fact that the blood that is on the cloth was able to prevent the formation of a body image on its surface, we have to conclude that if the Shroud man’s body would not have been washed, in a lot of places, no body image would have been imprinted on the cloth because of all the assumed dried blood clots on the skin.  \nMy answer:  I already wrote about that, saying that the idea that clotted blood on the skin could act like a shield during the image formation process, just like the bloodstains on the cloth did, is a shaky premise that is far from being proven, for the simple and good reason that we still don’t know what was the exact image formation mechanism.  As I said, if this mechanism involved (even just partially) the released of post-mortem gases (like ammonia) and/or reactive molecules (like lactic acid) that would have come from the presence of some reactive biological substances that would have been left over the skin, the hair and the drying of the intense sweat of the crucified man, then we must conclude that such a mechanism would NOT have been disturbed by the presence of a lot of dried blood clots on the skin.  In such a scenario, the release of post-mortem gases and/or reactive molecules would not have encountered any obstacle (except where there would have been already some bloodstains on the cloth) between the surface of the skin, hair or dried blood clots and the surface of the cloth.  The outcome of this would have been the formation of a body image even in the places where there would have been some dried blood clots.  Logically, in such an image formation process, there would have been no noticeable difference between the coloration of the linen fibers in areas where the skin was free from any blood clots and in areas where there would have been some, since the reactive substances would have been exactly the same.  That would explain that we see the entire body of the Shroud man on the cloth, despite the probable fact that there was much more blood (clotted and dry) on his skin than what appears on the Shroud.  Also, we must consider this other true possibility:  In the kind of image formation process I just described (completely natural by the way), it is truly possible that a portion (hard to quantify) of the assumed post-mortem gases and/or reactive molecules could have come directly from these clots of dry blood that would have been present on the skin of the Shroud man and that would have stayed that way (dry) all along, thus preventing any noticeable bloody imprints on the cloth in these areas, but contributing (a lot?) to the formation of a body image in all these places where they were still stuck to the skin (or the hair).  Last note on the subject:  If it would be true that any clotted blood present on the body would have acted like a shield during the image formation process, thus preventing the formation of a body image in these areas, then you must explain to me why most of the hair of the Shroud man was able to “produce” an image on the cloth, while it is pretty evident that there was much more blood (dry) that was present there than what appeared on the Shroud and while it is also pretty evident that the hair WAS NOT WASHED since all the bloodstains in the area of the head (both on the frontal and on the dorsal side of the cloth) are showing all the characteristics of blood that was shed while the Shroud man was still in a vertical position of crucifixion!!!  The simple fact that the image of the hair was able to be imprinted on the Shroud while it’s evident that no washing of the hair occurred prior the deposit of the body inside the Shroud should be enough for you to understand that the argument #1 is most certainly wrong.  Note that the same exact reflection is also true for the region of the forearms where we can also see pre-mortem blood flows, even though it’s evident that no washing was performed there, because of the direction of these blood flows that are all consistent with a vertical position of crucifixion… But despite these very strong arguments that are going against the argument #1, it is mainly on this particular premise that Zugibe based his whole partial washing hypothesis!!!  I hope now you will understand better why this argument and the whole partial washing hypothesis doesn’t satisfy me at all…\nArgument #2: There was surely a lot of dirt covering a good portion of the body of the Shroud man when he get to the tomb and this would have prevent any precise blood transfer on the cloth if no washing of the body would have been done.\nMy answer: Again, to contradict this argument, we can firstly reflect upon the blood transfer that occurred in the regions of the head and the forearms!  Since it’s evident that no washing was performed there (for the reason I gave you in the previous point), we must then assume that there were most probably not a lot of dirt stains in these whole areas when the body was laid in the Shroud.  Or else, it’s evident that a lot of dirt would have prevents a major part (if not all) of the blood transfer that occurred there.  So, if we can conclude with some insurance that the head and the forearms were probably mostly free from dirt stains, why would we have to think otherwise for the rest of the body?  I truly think that the assumption that the body would have been covered with dirt stains all over it when the corpse would have reached the tomb is a very special assumption that can be logically contradict (or at least challenged) by these historical and archaeological facts related to the Passion of Jesus:  1- Jesus was probably scourged and beaten in the Roman Antonia fortress or in the palace of Pilate, and it’s fair to assume that this was not done in a dirty and sandy place but on a stone paving.  Then, Jesus had to carried his cross all the way to the place of crucifixion and probably felt to the ground a few times.  That’s when many people assume that his body could have become very dirty…  But these people forget one important historical fact:  Jesus’ body was covered during this walk to Golgotha by a long tunic!  Because of this, it is not so sure that his body could have become very dirty during this walk, even if we consider as very probable that he could have fall to the ground a few times.  And even if we still think that his body would have become dirty anyway during that walk, we must consider another very probable medical fact:  Especially in the minutes prior to his death on the cross, the body of a crucified man produced a very intense sweating that was literally like a shower!  Such an intense sweating would certainly have been enough to remove a good portion of the supposed dirt stains that could have been left on the body after the walk to Golgotha.  Of course, we must assume that no important dirt staining occurred while the crucified man was on the cross, since all his body was placed over the ground.  Finally, some persons think that a new dirt staining occurred when the body was removed from the cross and probably laid on the ground.  But again, these persons forget another important archaeological fact:  The place of execution known as the Golgotha was not a hill of sand but a rocky elevation outside the walls of Jerusalem!  We know this from the archaeological finding of this place, which is located nearby the Holy Sepulchre Basilica in Jerusalem.  So, even if the body would really have been placed on the ground for some time before it was carried to the tomb, we must assume that this ground was in fact a rock!  On such a rocky surface, it’s not very hard to presume that no important dirt staining of the body would have occurred.  Then, for the moving of the body to the tomb, it’s not hard to believe that this was done by a few men and maybe with the help of a cloth that would have been twisted under the lower back region in order to facilité le déplacement of the body.  Again, in such a context, we must assume that no important dirt staining of the corpse would have been done prior to its arrival to the rock tomb.  So, if this reflection of mine is correct (note: this reflection is mainly based on historical and archaeological facts and not just my imagination), then we can conclude that the corpse that reached the tomb was not very dirty, except for the 3 areas where STURP have found some evident traces of dirt, i.e. the region of the ankle, the region of the left knee and the nose areas.  This kind of minor dirt staining would not have been enough to prevent most of the blood transfer and most of the image formation process that eventually occurred on the Shroud.  Final note:  if you don’t agree with this reflection, that’s ok.  But I still hope you will seriously consider the first argument I gave you at the beginning of this point, which shows that there was most probably not a great quantity of dirt in the regions of the forearms and on the head…  Concerning this argument of mine, let me ask you again this crucial question:  Since it’s very probable that the areas of the head and the forearms were mostly free of dirt stains when the body was laid in the Shroud, even though it’s evident that no washing was done there, then why thinking that it was different for the rest of the body?\nImportant note:  Even though I’m still truly convinced that there was no partial washing performed on the body of the Shroud man before he was placed in the Shroud (because of the probable fact that it was an hasty burial, the probable fact that it was against Jewish Law to wash even partially the blood stained body of someone who died a violent death, and also the fact that there are some scourge marks in the immediate vicinity of an evident post-mortem blood flow in the lower back region), I have to admit that after reflecting upon jesterof comment of yesterday, the hypothesis of blood transfer he described is truly interesting!  And I wonder if there would be a way that we could make an unwashed body fit with that kind of transfer… For example, is it possible that the most probable intense sweating of the Shroud man just before his death on the cross could have been enough to “wash” the areas where these contusion wounds were located, so that an oozing of blood could have occurred later on, while the body was placed inside the Shroud, and cause, with the help of some natural and/or manual pressure, the very precise dumbbel shape imprints we can see?   \nNevertheless, because it’s very hard for me to believe that a contusion that would have only provoke some under-the-skin bleeding with no superficial cutting and bleeding of the skin could have eventually caused an oozing of blood on the skin, along with an oozing of clear serum on its fringes, I still think the hypothesis proposed by Barbet and me concerning the scourge marks on the Shroud is the most rational and probable…  Having said this, I still admit that jesterof’ hypothesis is truly interesting but he would need to show me some proofs of this by making (or showing me) a blood transfer experiment that would give the same result has we see on the Shroud, INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF A SERUM HALO around most of the scourge wounds.  I can believe quite easily that the transfer process he described could eventually cause a precise bloody imprint on a cloth if there is enough pressure put on the contusion and on the cloth, but, as I said, I doubt that such a transfer could also cause some oozing of clear serum almost each time and that this serum would not be mixed with the oozing of blood, thus making it impossible to distinguish from the bloodstain on the cloth.  It’s very important to understand that Pellicori and Miller had no problem to distinguish these two very different stains on their UV fluorescence photos…\nHonestly, the observation reported by Miller and Pellicori that “many scourges have fluorescing bordering areas” (this was reported for the back region) is seen by me (and also by Lavoie and Adler) as a clear sign of a blood transfer done with exudates of moistened blood clots because such an evident separation of the blood and the serum on the cloth must have come from the clot retraction process that could only have been active on the skin.  Even though it is maybe possible that there could be a separation of blood and serum for a bleeding under the skin, I seriously doubt that an oozing of these two substances could form the kind of stains observed by Miller and Pellicori, which shows a bloodstain surrounded by a serum stain that is easy to distinguish from the bloodstain…  If I’m wrong about that, then jesterof must show me some images where we can see a bloodstain on a piece of fabric that would have been formed the way he described and that would show a clear serum stain on its fringes (a stain that we can easily distinguish from the central bloodstains).\nLast thing:  The absence of potassium in the blood from the Shroud could be seen, as Adler said, as another good clue to think the bloodstains on the cloth came from exudates of moistened blood clots and not from the kind of transfer proposed by jesterof.  But having said this, I still wonder if this absence of potassium is a proven fact for the blood that caused the scourge marks or if it is just a proven fact for some other bloodstains (like the pre-mortem blood flows of the arms or the post-mortem blood flows in the lower back region)…  I would like to get a precise information about that.  On that question, it would be nice to know where exactly came the blood sample (or samples) that was (were) analyzed by Adler.  If someone got the answer, please share it with us!\nOne thing’s for sure:  I hope jesterof will answer this previous question of mine: I wonder if there would be a way that we could make an unwashed body fit with that kind of transfer… For example, is it possible that the most probable intense sweating of the Shroud man just before his death on the cross could have been enough to “wash” the areas where these contusion wounds were located, so that an oozing of blood could have occurred later on, while the body was placed inside the Shroud, and cause, with the help of some natural and/or manual pressure, the very precise dumbbel shape imprints we can see?\n\n","date":"July 31, 2013 at 8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40188","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Excellent analysis, Yannick. Some of it made me reflect again on the idea of rain being involved. One of the reasons I’d felt rain wasn’t a good theory is because it would have created mud at the foot of the cross and this mess would likely have found its way onto the body and Shroud. But if it was mostly rocky, as you point out, this is another matter.\nThe rain may have been short-lived, just enough to ‘wash’ the body to some degree (the rain’s angle, intensity and position of the body relative to it are the unknown variables). It dries up again by the time Jesus is removed from the cross.\nI don’t think your sweat-wash idea works. I have lived in very humid countries and played sports in them. I would sweat like crazy. But the sweat never acted the same as a ‘wash’. If it anything it merely further cakes any dirt on your body. I also wonder if a severely dehydrated body, as Jesus’ surely was, would have been able to produce that much sweat anyway.\nBy the way, I’m not convinced the reference to a storm is a literary device. We accept so many other details of the Gospel Passion accounts as mostly factual. The detail about there being an earthquake is considered a possible fact by some (including the damage to the veil in the Temple), so I don’t see why the storm detail couldn’t be factual as well.\nPerhaps I should apply Occam’s Razor to my rain theory? :)\n\n","date":"July 31, 2013 at 9:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40190","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"First, let me remind you that the reference to a storm in the Bible is very often related to a manifestation of God!  When you’re aware of this, it is not difficult to assume that Matthew add such a thing in his Passion account as a pictorial way to state that the death of Jesus was another kind of manifestation of God…  Seriously, I doubt that the storm was truly an historical fact, mainly because of the literrary context of the Gospel account in which we found this mention.\nNow, concerning my idea of an intense sweating being able to “wash” the zones where the dumbbel shape wounds were located, I have to say that by doing that, I was playing the game of jesterof (very willingly I must admit, because I think his hypothesis for blood transfer is interesting).  But here’s the fact:  Barbet in his book reports that, in the concentration camp of Dashau during WWII, the Nazi tortured and killed some prisonners by strapping their hands with cords and by lifting them off the ground.  He said that near the moment of death by suffocation (which is the most probable cause of death for the Shroud man), a very intense sweating occurred which was so intense that it was very much like a shower and was able to cause a small puddle of water on the ground!  Look, even myself, I almost experimented this when I had some form of a shock after having receive a vaccination when I was Young.  I remember that I almost get unconscious and while I was seeing dark, a very intense sweating occurred that wet my cloths in an incredible manner.  So, I have no problem to believe Barbet on this point…\nSo, along with the true possibility that the body was much less dirty after the crucifixion than many persons think, I believe this kind of “shower of sweat” that could well have occurred at the time of death could have been enough to “wash” the regions where the scourge marks are located, thus contributing to help these wounds to stained the Shroud later on (and I believe this even in the case jesterof’s hypothesis would be correct instead of mine).  In sum:  I don’t think a partial washing was essential for the transfer of the scourge wounds, no matter if the best hypothesis is the one proposed by jesterof or mine.\n\n","date":"July 31, 2013 at 11:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40192","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Additional note :  The opinion I just expressed in the previous comment is mainly based on my personal conclusion that the body of the Shroud man was probably not very dirty when he reached the tomb, before his enshrouding (and this is true in my mind no matter if there was or not an intense sweating).

I’m pretty sure all these dirt stains only happened when the Shroud man felt on his way to Golgotha and no other important staining came after that.\n3- I’m more convinced than ever that the whole hypothesis described by Zugibe is incorrect.\n4- I’m still unsure about who is correct between me and jesterof, but I tend to still favored mine, mainly because of the presence of serum halos around many scourge marks (on the back region as well as on the frontal region, if we trust Pellicori and Miller observations), which are very characteristic of external blood clots that had time to become solid enough through a clot retraction process.  Reminder: jesterof’ hypothesis involved a post-mortem oozing of blood material through a skin that would have only been contused (and not cut) by the metal balls or animal bones located at the end of the leather tongues of the flagrum.  In such a context that would not have involved a clot retraction process, it is hard for me to believe that a transfer through the skin like that could have produce the same kind of very distinguishable serum stains on the Shroud that are located at the vicinity of the bloodstains instead of being mixed within the blood. On the contrary, I have no difficulty to believe such a transfer process could produce very precise blood imprints…  But I have a strong tendency to believe such bloodstains would not show the same kind of very distinguishable serum stains around the scourge marks like it is visible on the UV photos.  And if I’m wrong about that, then please show me some pictures of that kind of blood transfer that would show the same kind of resulting imprint as we see on the Shroud.  Note that Lavoie et al. have been able to reproduce with good success some bloodstains very similar to what we can see on the Shroud with an exudates of moistened blood clots and also made one very important finding: it is much easier to produce a bloodstains with some distinguishable serum stains on their borders while the clot retraction process occurred in a vertical position (which is very coherent with the idea that most (if not all) of the clotting of pre-mortem blood on the Shroud man (including the scourge wounds) occurred while he was still in a vertical position of crucifixion (and this could have happened before death for some stains as well as after death for others, because it’s truly possible that the dead body was kept on the cross for some time after the death of the Shroud man).  This finding is another fact that tends to support my hypothesis (which is mainly based on Barbet’s hypothesis).\n5- Since it’s probable that there was no washing, I still wonder what exactly have caused the imprint of most of these scourge wounds on the cloth, even though they were inflicted several hours before the enshrouding of the Shroud man’s body.  On this enigma, I still favored the idea of Barbet, who conclude that these wounds could well have stayed somewhat humid a very long time after the scourging because they probably get infected, which would have caused an oozing of lymph (along with maybe other liquids) in the vicinity of these wounds.  If Barbet was right about that, there is still one question to resolve: Why the assumed blood flows resulting from the cuttings made by the leather tongues of the flagrum have not been able to completely covered the dumbbell shape wounds after the scourging?  Note that if this would have happened and if part of this free blood would have clotted over these wounds, it’s highly probable that none of them would have been able to leave a distinguishable mark on the cloth…  I think the most rational way to explain this “mystery” is to think that the probable very intense sweating of the Shroud man prior death was able to wash enough these areas, thus leaving these wounds free of blood flows over them.  And if they remained infected for some time after that, I think it’s truly possible that the eventually clotting of these wounds only concerned the wounds and their immediate vicinity, thus producing blood clots over most of them in the shape of a dumbbell. Then, later on, when the body was placed inside the Shroud, these clotted dumbbell shape wounds were able to get re-moistened again on their surfaces and then left a good mirror imprint on the cloth.  I still think this is the more probable scenario in the case of the scourge marks, but it’s evident that this represent only a possible explanation, which could only be confirmed one day if an expert could do some more blood transfer experiments, while pushing the work of Lavoie et al. even further…  On this subject, I have to say that I found it very sad to note that no one these days seem to care about making such interesting experiments under proper lab control.  I’m sure we could get some surprise out of an experiment like that, if it could be done the right way versus the most probable context in which the burial of the Shroud man occurred.  Finally, it’s also important to note, as David pointed out the other day, that, along with the 2 probable factors I just described (infection of the wounds with a release of lymph for a long time and a very intense sweating of the Shroud man during his crucifixion that was related to his state of slow and gradual asphyxia, which acted like a shower on his body and his hair), there can be some other unknown factors (not related at all with an improbable partial washing of the body) that could have played an huge part in the fact that these scourge wounds were able to leave a distinct mirror imprint on the cloth…  Again, to find them, this would need some experiments under proper lab control done by a CSI or a medical expert.\nIf  had to summarize my thoughts in one sentence, I would say:  I’m still not completely sure what was the most important factor that lead to the bloody imprint of the scourge wounds on the Shroud, but one thing’s for sure: I know it wasn’t due to a partial washing of the body…\nOf course, this is only my ideas on the subject and every one can think otherwise.\n\n","date":"August 1, 2013 at 8:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40242","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Yes, they are your ‘ideas’ and others can and will think otherwise.

In such a context of a high Sabbath that is coming fast, why would they have wanted to lose precious time in order to do a surgical washing of the body (see the picture again on top of this page to be convinced) while they knew full well they had to come back on Sunday morning anyway (i.e. after the Sabbath that they didn’t break by the way, proving that yes, they were all pious Jews who were following the Jewish Law)?\nSince they knew they had to come back and since they wanted to get home before the coming of the high Sabbath (Sabbath during Passover), the most logical move for them would have been to simply laid down the crucified body that was still covered with blood clots (dried and moistened) and some dirt (not much) in the Shroud without tying the cloth with linen strips (because they knew they had to open it again on Sunday morning) and leave it there still naked Inside the Shroud.  That’s the most logical scenario in the context of Jesus hasty burial.  You can think what you want but that will never change anything about this truth.\nBy the way, have you noticed that the Shroud man’s body was still naked at the time of the body image formation?

In the theology of St John, these events (the death and Resurrection of Christ) were seen as a new creation (a re-creation if you prefer).

I simply say that since these kind of catastrophic events are often found in the Old Testament to symbolically show a manifestation of God, it’s truly possible that the Gospel writers have add these things as a symbolic way to describe the most important of all manifestation of God in Jesus’ death and Resurrection.  Because of the importance of this probability, it’s far from being sure that there really was an earthquake and darkness in the middle of the day in Jérusalem 2000 years ago.  In a pure scientific sense, using things like that to back up some hypothesis is truly walking on a very thin ice my friend…  Of course, we can think that yes, these events are historic and the writers of the Gospels used them because they were real, but be sure that this is not the most rational and probable conclusion…   Since I know you don’t believe me, go ahead and ask a true bible expert about that!!!\n\n","date":"August 2, 2013 at 4:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40325","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Concerning the hypothesis proposed by Max and Ron about a possible re-opening of most scourge wounds at the foot of the cross when they took the tunic off of Jesus’ body, which could have played a major role in the imprint of these wounds on the Shroud later on, I would ask you to tell me what you think of this alternative hypothesis:  What about the possibility that these wounds never closed (and dried) completely during a very long time after the scourging (and maybe for a good part of the crucifixion) because they would have become infected and such an infection would have produced an oozing of lymph, as proposed by Barbet (along with maybe some small oozing of blood)???\nI think such a scenario is truly possible in the context of the Passion of Jesus and would account much better for the fact that not only the scourge wounds located in areas that were most probably stuck to the tunic (like the back and the torso regions) were able to leave a good and precise mirror imprint on the cloth but also those who were located in areas that were most certainly free from being stuck to the tunic (like the legs, and particularly the calves).  I hope you will consider this hypothesis seriously, without too much preconceived notions…\nIn sum, I think that an important delay in the blood clotting for the scourge wounds is much more able to explain the fact that most of them have been able to leave a mirror imprint on the cloth than the idea that some of them, being completely dried at the foot of the cross, were then re-opened when the tunic was taken off of Jesus…  Having said that, I have to admit that it’s truly possible that this removal of the tunic could have help some scourge wounds to stay humid for even a longer period of time, but I doubt that this was the main factor that eventually lead to the imprint of all the scourge wounds on the Shroud (mainly because of the very good imprints of scourge wounds that are located in the region of the legs).\n\n","date":"August 2, 2013 at 8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40305","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"\nYannick Clément :\nIn order to buried someone, Jewish or not, you MUST touch his dead body Ron!

But I think the best explanation remains the one I already described on this blog:  First, they probably did a compression of the burial cloth on the corpse (for whatever reason; maybe because they had put some burial product on the cloth and wanted to make sure these products touched the body; who knows?).  Such a direct contact of the cloth on the corpse would account for the transfer of all the bloodstains we see on the cloth (including the scourge marks).  And then, after the transfer of the enshrouded corpse from a central place Inside the tomb to a stone bench carved Inside one of the walls of the tomb, they probably manually replaced the cloth much more loosely over the body (but not in a very taut configuration like you seem to think).  The reason for this was most probably because they knew they had to come back on Sunday morning to finish the burial rite, so there was no reason to tight up the enshrouded body with linen strips or just to keep the cloth very compressed around the body.  Note that my hypothesis is good to explain the few bloodstains that are located outside the body image (like the one outside the right elbow or the few scourge marks that are located outside the dorsal image of the legs) and can account also for the slight lateral distortion in some parts of the image (especially in the regions of the head and the thighs, as it was find out by STURP), as well as the fact that there is no important distortion of the image anywhere…\n\n","date":"August 3, 2013 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40373","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Reminder for Yannick: \nOn June 1, 2013 at 2:20 pm | #18 Reply |, I wrote:\n“As far as the TS image is concerned, on one hand, the bloody body image is first and foremost readable as old archaeological bloodstain patterns and thus shall be studied in the light of a specific burial by an archaeological\nbloodstain pattern analyst, a Second Temple period archaeologist and/or a forensic archaeologist.”\nOn June 1, 2013 at 11:54 am | #9 Reply |, I also wrote:\n“the thread (on the TS man blood issue) was sort of spoiled by YC’s received and most biased ideas (as the latter does seem totally enable to discriminate between: 1/nearly 2000 years’ old archaeological blood vs. dry stains of relatively fresh one; 2/a biochemist and an archaeological bloodstain pattern analyst; 3/a surgeon and a forensic palaeopathologist/archeaologist) to say nothing of his pathologically irrelevant “hypergraphic” comments on Zugibe’s opinion (as the latter’s voice as forensic expert was just one among several others) and YC’s shameless knack for distorting or ignoring others’ interpretation while having misleadingly the dead speak (e.g. Adler, Rogers and Barbet) through recurring ad nauseam to “the silence argument.”\n“Adler’s finding (that still needs to be independently confirmed) doesn’t prove beyond the shadow of a rational doubt the TS man’s bloody body was not purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial practice.

It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. As a victim of a violent death, his body should be buried with his shed innocent blood and his post-mortem shed blood could not be DIRECTLY cleansed.”\n“Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking-gradual-unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner burial sheet soaked in a watery (alkaline) solution was compressed widthwise with shorter dry clean shrouds (othonia) while taut lengthwise back and front as all parts of the body should be wrapped-up (see Naḥmanides, Torat ha-Adam; Inyan ha-hoẓa’ah) and then the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse was subjected to fumigation (see see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum) and the long inner burial sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up.To his buriers and (secret) disciples Yeshua was no am ha-arets (“average citizen) but a prominent figure.”\nShall I endlessly repeat: \n“MOST LIKELY (and to the sole exception of anointing that was postponed), the Judean burial core procedures namely speedy burial, wrapping in shrouds, specific PURIFYING and DRYING were performed to abide by the Halakha (especially when it came not to wash a post-mortem shed blood-covered body) and honor the deceased.”\n“It is TOTALLY ludicrous is to think (as YC does) the shrouds tightly wrapping a body cannot be soaked in/anointed with spicy oil perfumes to prevent bad smells as in the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three or seven days immediately following death.” In other words a body all wrapped-up in shrouds could be anointed without having it to be unwrapped at all.\nOn June 3, 2013 at 6:29 am | #57 Reply |, I also wrote: \n“Adler NEVER considered a Second period Temple puriyfing & drying ritual scenario (implying the use of alkaline solution coupled with (myrrhic-)aloetic fumigation) could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now these two signals precisely tend to prove the body could have been purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial custom/practice (see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum and my TS man’s burial reconstruction).\nIn the case here under study, Second Temple period speedy tahara in terms of wrapping in shrouds, purifying & drying out was an act of ultimate kindness to honor the deceased who died a violent death. It shall not be mistaken with careful physical cleansing Jewish/Judean ritual of a NON-bloody body.\nThe true archaeological fact is there is more than one way by which blood could have become depleted of key ingredients if one considers the bloody body purifying & drying ritual scenario, which Adler clearly did not (crucifixion being an implicit assumption in all his discussion at the expense of specific burial practices, rites and customs). His shortcomings and partial view do show as far as archaeological bloodstain pattern analysis is concerned.”\nAnd on March 18, 2013 at 4:44 pm | #23 Reply |, I already wrote: \n“Nope with YC, his mind is set the wrong way around. When there is compelling evidence the Turin Sindon hematic cartography is clean and neat, he just cannot care less and just dismisses the idea of even a speedy purification/washing ritual.\nAnd what does YC make of the 3 different conjugated koine Greek verbs used by the 4 evangelists meaning bound/fastened – compressed/wrapped up – wound/encircled and the koine Greek word for ‘shorter shrouds/pieces of linen’ (othonia)? Nothing. He just cannot care less and still claim the body was just draped over (before the image formation), which the Gospels NEVER say, quite to the contrary! What does he make of the fact it is written Yeshua was buried according to the JUDEAN burial custom, which implies to abide by a series of procedures? Nothing again. He just cannot care less. The mximum burial time frame between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath is 4 hours and the minimum burial time-frame 2 hours. No problem, he keeps claiming Yeshua’s burial was dispatched in less than half an hour implying Joseph of Arimathea waited to the very last minute to buy a burial cloth and then ask Pilate for his master’s body just before sunset? Nope.”\nAdditional reminders for YC:\nOn March 17, 2012 (that is more than one year ago) I wrote: “(YC) currently keeps rehashing Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was made in haste after sunset (that is within about half an hour or so) and his shroud just draped about his body or loosely bound for the women to wash and anoint his body at the first morning hour of the first day of the Hebrew week, that is just after the Shabbat, on the third day of Yeshua’s death. Such a view (or should I better say “preaching”) presupposes:\n1/Yossef Ha-Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), waited until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him. Are you serious? Do you really think Yossef Ha-Ramatayim would have also run the risk not to abide by Deuteronomy 21: 22-23 and wait to the very last minute for taking down himself or having Rabbi Yeshua’s body be taken down from the cross and buried?\nIt does seem you totally overlook “one little circumstantial fact”: in the Second Temple period, any working activity was to stop at midday “on preparation day” that is on the very eve of the great Shabbat of PessaH/Passover (PessaH 4, V). How then could possibly Joseph of Aramathia have bought a shroud after sunset and before dusk on that specific day when Jerusalem weavers’ workshops, stores and shops had all been closed for more than 6-6½ hours? This is a total exegetical non sense.\nUnless one is ignorant of the ethnic milieu and thinks a Judean of the Second Temple period would have waited until sunset on “preparation day” and go and buy a shroud long after all the weaver’s workshops and linen shops had closed, this reconstruction of the event chronology is most unlikely. In all likelihood, Yossef Ha-Ramathaym had already bought a fine linen shroud for himself in anticipation of his own death and used it to wrap Yeshua’s body “with his shed innocent blood”. As a disciple of Yeshua, didn’t Yossef go as far as using his own recently hewn garden-tomb near-by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus to both abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to his burial?\n[Precision: the women bought the spices not just BEFORE but just AFTER the sabbatical rest. Mark (16: 1) raises the ambiguity which could result from the chronologically biased relation/presentation of the same fact in Luke (23: 56).]\n2/ Modern time markers such as ‘evening’, ‘sunset’, ‘twilight dusk’ philologically cover the same realities for a Judean of the Second Temple period. Far from it!\nWith respect to the time frame for Yeshua’s burial, here are the ancient biblical Hebrew words & expressions for the time markers from noon to night used in the Second Temple period yet currently overlooked by Shroud researchers/old students and exegetes:\n1/Tsot ha-yom (or “midday”) refers to that time of the day at equal distance between sunset and sunrise.\n2/Tsohorayim (dual form of Tsohar, “dazzling light” or “zenith”) literally means “two dazzling lights” or “two zeniths” and refers to ‘both morning and evening lights’ merging into ‘noon’.\n3/Erev (“evening”) may indifferently refer to the 1st or the 2nd evening. Rabbi Yeshua died exactly between the first and the second evening (at the 9th hour).\n4/Beyn ha-arbayim literally means “between the two evenings,” —- arbayim being the dual form of erev, “evening.” The afternoon was divided into two halves: from noon to mid afternoon and from mid afternoon to sunset or put in other words from early to late evening (See Exodus 29:38-41, “They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha-arbayim”). For the covenant people, the entire day revolved around the offering of the two Tamid lambs: that of the morning and that of the evening. “In a paper entitled « En Vue de la Solution Archéologique de l’Énigme » I presented in Turin in 1998, I wrote: « Le deuxième sacrifice quotidien du Temple (Numbers 28: 4-8) dit sacrifice du “soir” (evening sacrifice) se déroulait vers le milieu de l’après-midi (mid afternoon) et pouvait être avancé d’une heure (une veille de Pâque) voire même de deux heures (lorsque cette grande fête tombait un Shabbat) (PessaH 5:1). le premier sacrifice avait lieu le matin. Ainsi “le premier soir” allait-il du milieu du jour (from midday) jusqu’à la deuxième immolation en milieu d’après-midi (until mid afternoon) et, « le deuxième soir », de la deuxième immolation du milieu d’après-midi (from mid afternoon) jusqu’au crépuscule du soir (until twilight/dusk)».”.\n5/Shqiya, “sunset”; the sun set at 18:38 p.m. on April 7th 30CE and 18:08 p.m. on April 3rd 33 CE.\n6/Beyn ha-shemashot which literally means “between the suns” is an expression for “dusk” or “twilight” between the setting sun and the rising moon (which reflects the light of the sun).\n7/Layla, “night”; typically layla is taken to be when you can see three stars in the sky in reference to tset ha-kokhavim, the first “three stars coming out” to announce a new day (here the great Shabbat of PessaH). The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. on April 7th 30CE and19:08 p.m. on April 3rd 33 CE. Owing to a lunar eclipse or the Ruah Qadīm, “east wind” (Khamsin/Sharav); a wind blowing from the desert of Judea, the whole city of Jerusalem was plunged into darkness from tsohorayim (“noon”) to beyn ha-arbayim (“between the two evenings” that is the 9th hour of the day; 15.34 p.m. on April 7 30 CE/ 15.04 p.m. on April 3 33 CE). In other words, for 3h34/3h04, on the very day Rabbi Yeshua died on the cross, it was also night, “layla” on that very day in the eye of a Judean of the Second Temple period.\nHence, the actual maximum time-frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30-45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30-45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near-by, we are left with a minimum time-frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time-frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th-21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period.\nWithin a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s buriers had enough time to pre-wash his body (i.e. to re-dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. sindôn/Heb. sadin) soaked with a watery solution (ashes of the Red Heifer?) and tightly wrap it up, with fresh aromatic medical insect repellent plants, in linen clothes and strips.\nIn the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three days immediately following his burial. Anointment was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite as it allowed preventing bad smells on those subsequent visits. Because this part of the rite was not done, the women had to buy and prepare spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the third day. They definitely had not to wash the deceased’s naked body at all but just to anoint his linen wrappings. Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period might well have been duly completed within a minimum of a two-hours-and-a-half time-frame.”\nOn March 24, 2012, I also wrote: “Both historically and archaeoastronomically speaking, here is the best alternative to account for the darkening of the sun on Yeshua’s death on the cross:\n-Either it did actually happen one “April 7th of 30 CE” and if so, the “black breath” of the Ruah qâdim (“east wind”, also called Sharav/Khamsin), blowing from the desert of Judea, is the most likely phenomenon to have occurred to account for the darkening of the sun.\n-Or it did actually happen one “April 3rd of 33 CE” and if so, the same “black breath” or dust tempest has been followed by the rising of a moon already bloody/in eclipse that evening/second evening, thus fulfilling Joel’s prophetical “blood moon” vision (Joel 2:31).”\nThis is my hypergraphic answer to YC hypergraphic prose.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2013 at 6:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40419","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Typo: (too rapidly for the popliteal fossae to be correctly recorded and 3D encoded).\n\n","date":"August 3, 2013 at 11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40344","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"I have two questions about the article’s refutation & Zugibe’s theory.\n1) If the body wasn’t washed, I would expect just about the entire body would have been coated with blood.

And what could explain that only some of it get on the Shroud (including the scourge marks) : Probably because the only dried blood clots that were able to become re-moistened again were the last ones that get dried on the skin of the Shroud man.  For all the others dried blood clots that we can assume where still present on the skin and on the hair, we must assume that they became completely dried much too soon, so they were dried for too long when the moisture came on the clots and, because they were dried for too long, these clots never were able to leave a noticeable Mirror image on the cloth.\n2- NOT AT ALL.  A washing of the body would have produce oozing of liquid post-mortem blood (see again Zugibe’s pictures 1 and 2 in his paper: http://www.shroud.com/zugibe2.htm; the oozing are clearly no blood clots but oozing of liquid blood material).  Barbet was clear about the fact that such a liquid blood would tend to follow the weave pattern of the cloth (which is not what happened on the Shroud) and, for the back region, because of the high pressure due to the body weight, there would surely have been many smudges of blood produced on the cloth (there are none on the Shroud).  And by the way, Barbet was clear about the fact that all the pre-mortem bloodstains on the Shroud are clear Mirror images of the real blood clots that was present on the skin of the Shroud man when his body was placed Inside the Shroud (as I said in point #1, these stains probably concern only the blood that was last to dry on the skin of the Shroud man) and such bloodstains can only come from exudates of still moistened or, more probably, re-moistened blood clots, and not from some oozing of liquid post-mortem blood material that would have be produced by the removal of these clots by a washing of the body, as proposed by Zugibe.\nBut please, read again my post on top of this page and the other post which I give you the link…  You will have more explanation in details…\n\n","date":"August 3, 2013 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40375","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"\nAndy Weiss :\nI have two questions about the article’s refutation & Zugibe’s theory.\n1) If the body wasn’t washed, I would expect just about the entire body would have been\ncoated with blood.

Here’s a medical definition I have found: “A skin wound that FAILS TO HEAL, HEALS SLOWLY or heals but tends to recur is known as a chronic wound. Some of the MANY CAUSES of chronic skin wounds CAN INCLUDE TRAUMA, burns, skin cancers or underlying medical conditions such as diabetes. Chronic wounds need special care.”\nI’m not a medical expert but, in my mind, this kind of biological problem concerning the natural healing of skin wounds (and, in all logic, their clotting process) seem to be truly possible in the case of someone like the Shroud man who was punched in the face and then scourged, crowned with thorns, and finally crucified…  Can this kind of biological problem could have been the main cause of an important delay in the clotting process of most of the scourge wounds, which could account for the fact that these wounds have been able to get re-moistened enough after the Shroud man’s death, so that they could leave a precise mirror imprint on the cloth later on?  I wonder what jesterof think about this possibility…\nAnd in the end, I say to myself that if someone as profesional and careful as Doctor Pierre Barbet specifically refers in his book to the possibility that the wounds of the Shroud man could have become infected during his Passion, with the result of delayed their clotting, it is surely because he knew that this kind of problem was truly possible in the traumatic context of the Shroud man…  Seriously, I just don’t see Barbet writting something of that nature and importance in his book (which could have been a major factor in the imprint of the scourge wounds later on) without making sure that this kind of problem was totally possible for someone like the Shroud man.\nP.S. to jesterof:  Can you please stop your recurrent insults toward me.

In the context of a probable hasty burial like the one of the Shroud man, this scenario is far from being probable…  As I said before (maybe you didn’t read it?), the most logical thing they would have done with the corpse right after the washing would have been to place it in the cloth immediately after or to rub his washed body with some burial substances and then, place it in the cloth.  In both cases, there would have been no way for the liquid oozing of blood material to clot well in order to leave a precise Mirror imprint.  On the contrary, in both cases, you should expect the resulting bloodstains to have a strong tendency to follow the weave pattern of the cloth and to see some smudges on the cloth, which are two things that are not present at all on the Shroud.  Also, if Zugibe was right, there would not be a lot of serum halos around the scourge wounds that are easy to distinguish from the blood under UV light (as it was described by Miller and Pellicori).  \nBy the way, nevermind what you can think, the serum halos that have been found around most of the scourge marks (as well as around all the other pre-mortem bloodstains) are truly a sign that all these particular stains came from exudates of blood clots that had become in their clotted form for long enough so that the clot retraction phenomenon had time to come up.  Barbet, Adler and Lavoie talked about that but you don’t seem to understand at all what they had to say about that.  And that’s very telling because this is the most important clue that exist on the Shroud to understand that your own personal hypothesis involving intradermal hematomas (as you call them) is most probably wrong.\nI’m sorry for you but the halos of serum which are clearly distinct from the bloodstains, never mind the fact that they are all located in the immediate vicinity of these stains, are clearly coming from moistened blood clots (external blood clots located on the skin) that were clotted for enough time so that the blood retraction phenomenon could become active and left some serum stains around the retracting blood clot.  That’s not me who said that, that’s Barbet, Lavoie, Adler, Baima Bollone, etc.  Sorry but I seriously doubt that your hypothesis or the one proposed by Zugibe (in which by the way he never address the question of the serum halos found around most of the scourge marks) can account for the presence of these serum stains that are clearly distincts and easy to distinguish for the central bloodstains.  On the contrary, in your hypothesis or in the one proposed by Zugibe, we should expect this serum to get mixed up with the bloodstains on the cloth, because there would not have been enough time for the clot retraction phenomenon to become active while the blood was on the skin…  Make the experiment of placing some drops of liquid blood on a linen cloth with an herringbone pattern and let it dry completely.  I ensure you that the resulting bloodstain you would get would NOT show any distinct serum stain around the central bloodstain in the way it was seen by Miller and Pellicori of STURP on their UV photos.  \nIn all logic, all you would get on the cloth is a bloodstain, period.  And this is proven by the fact that the post-mortem blood flows in the lower back region on the Shroud are one of the few bloodstains on the cloth that doesn’t show any distinct serum stains around them (this is a proven fact that come from the STURP investigation and you can find it in Ray Rogers’ paper for STURP).  In their case (as it would also be the case for the bloodstains produced with jesterof or Zugibe’s hypothèses), it’s normal to not show any distinct serum stain around them because these post-mortem blood flows were probably still in a liquid form or in a very early clotted form (that’s what Barbet was thinking in their case), which would have been very humid and would not have been clotted for enough time to allow the start of the blood retraction phenomenon…  Note that would also be like this for the oozing of blood material proposed by jesterof or Zugibe).  And that means that the post-mortem blood that stained the cloth in the lower back region was a blood that had no time to see his serum get separated from it.  That’s why absolutely no serum ring have been seen by Miller and Pellicori in their UV photos for this particular area of the cloth.  So, in all logic, if the scourge marks would also have been produced by some liquid oozing of post-mortem blood, as proposed by jesterof or Zugibe (in 2 distincts hypotheses), these marks would never have shown any distinct serum halos around them, unlike what was observed by STURP concerning a majority of scourge marks (on the dorsal side of the body image as well as on the frontal side).\nSorry jesterof but the very distinct serum halos that are located around most of the scouge wounds and around all the other pre-mortem wounds and blood flows on the cloth are the most compelling piece of evidence that your own hypothesis is probably incorrect, as well as the one proposed by Zugibe cause in both cases, we should not expect to see the presence of these distinct serum stains around most of the blood marks.\nAnd if you think I’m wrong here (that would mean you also think Barbet, Lavoie and Adler were wrong), then show me a proof that your own hypothesis or the one proposed by Zugibe can produced on a piece of linen cloth like the Shroud, a clear and distinct serum stains (under UV light) that would surround the central bloodstains.  Show me some pictures of this please because Zugibe never address this important issue in his paper and thus, never showed the bloodstains he got during his transfer experiments under UV light!  I can bet my house that if he did this, absolutely no distinct serum stain would have been present around his resulting bloodstains…  Again, if I’m wrong here, please show me some pictures to prove that I’m wrong!  Show me some pictures of bloodstains produced on linen with your method of transfer or with Zugibe’s method that would show clear and distinct serum halos around them under UV light.  I wait impatiently for you to show me some pictures like that.\n\n","date":"August 3, 2013 at 6:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40381","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Message for Dave (and also for David Goulet):  Note that this is a comment that follow some comments made by Dave and David right here on this page (see their comments above) in which they refers to the possible presence of a real earthquake and/or a real storm (or darkness) in Jerusalem, at the time of Jesus’ Passion, death and Resurrection. \nIn order that you understand better the use of catastrophic terms in the Bible (in the Old Testament as well as the New), I made a little research in two biblical dictionary I have at home.\nI the most recent one that was written by Father Xavier Léon-Dufour, a well-known Jesuit from France, here’s a portion of what he wrote concerning the use of the word “earthquake” in the bible (personal translation): “The Bible see in earthquakes an eschatological manifestation of the almighty power of the Creator who come to help or to judge his people.”\nYou can see that his definition is pretty close to what I said to you in last few days!!!  Of course, that doesn’t mean it is 100% sure that all the references in the Bible to an earthquake are only symbolic, but that mean that this kind of “imagery” is very common throughout the Bible (in the Old as well as in the New Testament) and, because of its very strong symbolical power, it’s pretty evident that all these references about an earthquake (including the ones we can found at the time of Jesus’ death and Resurrection) cannot be taken for granted as being a sure and real historical event that really happened at the time it is describe by these authors…  In fact, I think any good and honest biblical scholar will agree that it’s much more probable that the use of such a strong and “biblical” imagery at the precise moment of the death and Resurrection of Jesus has to be seen as a “literary construction” of the Gospel writers who wanted to materially “translate” the great and spiritual intervention of God for all humanity that was happening then.\nBy the way, on the subject of earthquakes, you always seems to think that because earthquakes are more frequent in New Zealand than here in Quebec (that’s a chance for us!!!), that makes you an expert on the subject and, because of this, your opinion that there really had been, historically speaking, a real earthquake in Jerusalem around the time of the death and Resurrection of Christ must be the best that exist!  Sorry but this is completely ludicrous.  I have no problem admitting that you know more than me about earthquakes my friend, but that doesn’t mean for one second that your idea about a real earthquake in Jerusalem around the year 30 or 33 must be understand as very solid and that it is shared by a vast majority of biblical scholars.  In fact, the reality is precisely the opposite concerning the vast majority of those experts who are aware of the fact that the “earthquake imagery” (if I can use this term) is often used by Bible writers (again, in the Old as well as in the New Testament) as a metaphoric way to materially describe a spiritual intervention of God in our universe.  I don’t see any good reason to think otherwise when it comes to the earthquakes that supposedly came at the time of Jesus death and Resurrection.  In fact, this was most probably a literary tool used by the Gospel writers to make a link with the well-known imagery of the Old Testament in order to describe in strong terms that God was truly “at work” for all humanity at the time of Jesus’ death and Resurrection…  No matter what you can think, this is by far the most probable explanation that exists for the presence of these supposed earthquakes at that particular time in the Gospels. \nAnd concerning the use of the term “darkness” in the Bible, I got a pretty good explanation for it in an old “Universal Biblical dictionary” that was written in 1984 by two biblical scholars from France (one was a Sulpician and the other was a Dominican).  Here’s a portion of what they wrote concerning the word “darkness” that we can find throughout the Bible (in the Old Testament as well as in the New): “(In the Bible) the darkness are the IMAGE of men’s ignorance; God send his light to enlighten them (Jb 29,3) and, for the prophets of the Old Testament, the Messiah would come to change them into light (Is 9,1; 29,18; 60,2)…  The fourth Gospel considers Jesus and his action throughout the IMAGERY of light and darkness, engaged in a fight…  A sizing image of God’s action, the light tells also what we can perceive of God though this action.  There is in Him no darkness because He is light.  Getting away from Him, by acting differently than he acts, for example by rejecting love (God is love), it is walking in darkness, it is also being associated with the powers of darkness and it is falling into external darkness.  The theme of the opposition light/darkness that we find in the fourth Gospel can also be found in the later letters written by Paul.”\nThis definition of the term “darkness”, which shows with great evidence how this imagery was often used in the Bible to express an opposition to God’s action, should be enough for anyone to understand that its use during the Passion and death of Christ (which is called by Jesus “the hour of darkness” when he encounters Judas in the Garden of Gethsemane) is most certainly symbolic ratter than being historical and is very useful to the Gospel writers to express with a strong image how the most of Israël rejected his Son during his Passion.  With this in mind, how can we claim that there really was for sure a total darkness (which can be understand as a big storm by some) in Jerusalem in the middle of the day during Jesus’ Passion and death?  In other words, knowing that this imagery of darkness was very often used throughout the whole Bible in a symbolical way, how can someone dare to base a hypothesis concerning the Shroud on such a fragile ground (historically speaking)?  The probability that the darkness imagery during Jesus’ Passion and death was only symbolic is much too high to do so…  Note that this is the same thing for the earthquake imagery concerning Jesus’ death and Resurrection.\nNow it’s up to you to continue to base some of your hypotheses versus the Shroud on such a fragile historical ground…  Personally, I would certainly not do that.  In sum, I’m too much aware of the fact that these catastrophic things were very often used in a symbolical way throughout the Bible instead of being truly based on real historical events.  It’s important to be aware of the fact that this was very common for people of the Middle East to create and use some strong images to materially described a spiritual reality.  Unfortunately, such a reality has been lost and/or forgotten by many modern Christians who tend to take for granted and at the very first level everything that is written in the Bible and, truly, that’s a very big mistake and a shame.\nLast useful note for all of you: If you want to know what were the most common IMAGES used by the authors of the Bible to describe God or his action for his people, just read the well-known part of the First book of Kings in the Old Testament, in which Elijah is standing on the Horeb, while waiting to see God.  In this part of the text, all the most common images concerning God are used, i.e. the hurricane, the earthquake and the fire (and along with these images, we can also had the light).  All these symbolical images are very often used throughout the Bible (including the New Testament: remember what supposedly happened at the Pentecost after the Resurrection?)…  It’s very important to understand this biblical reality (we can even say that it is an ancient Middle Eastern reality) because, if you did, you will never dare to use again such symbolic images to back-up a hypothesis versus the Shroud of Turin (note that this include the very improbable idea that Jesus’ dead body really emitted a burst of light at the time of his Resurrection, which would have been the primary cause for the body image on the cloth).  When you got a true scientific and rational mind (one always goes with the other!), you understand that the probability of being off-track versus the true historical facts is simply too high to take such a risk…  That’s my opinion, which is certainly shared by most biblical scholars and good historians.\n\n","date":"August 3, 2013 at 5:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40379","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"If I read one more time “washing of the body could not happen because it would remove all the clots and cause oozing of post-mortem blood (and it could not occur because what Barbet said)” with attribution it to Zugibe ( which is a total LIE) I will puke.\nThis phrase is a concentration of what you don’t understand and do not want to understand.\nIt’s nonsense.\n\n","date":"August 3, 2013 at 7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40386","author":"jesterof","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Here’s a quote taken directly from Zugibe’s paper : “However, if the body was WASHED, the DRIED BLOOD (note that this is not at all in sync with your own hypothesis) around the wounds would be REMOVED causing an OOZING OF BLOODY MATERIAL within the wounds (note: here, Zugibe doesn’t mean within the closed and contused skin like you pretend; he talk about liquid post-mortem blood that would fill in the wound that just get re-open from the washing that removed the dried clot over it) resulting in the production of relatively good impressions of the wound.”\nNote that this is ONLY true in the case there is not a high pressure that his present on the wound and on the cloth; in the case there would be a high pressure due to the body weight, like in the back and buttocks régions, the resulting impression would be much worse than what Zugibe show in figure 1 of his paper and there would certainly have been many smudges and smears on the Shroud in these areas, along with bloodstains that would have had the strong tendency of following the weave pattern of the cloth.

In this case, I think pressure on the wound is a good way of absorbing this fluid, which might not otherwise flow at all.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2013 at 12:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40430","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Hugh, by definition, an oozing refers to a liquid!

It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. As a victim of a violent death, his body should be buried with his shed innocent blood and his post-mortem shed blood could not be DIRECTLY cleansed.”\n“Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking-gradual-unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner burial sheet soaked in a watery (alkaline) solution was compressed widthwise with shorter dry clean shrouds (othonia) while taut lengthwise back and front as all parts of the body should be wrapped-up (see Naḥmanides, Torat ha-Adam; Inyan ha-hoẓa’ah) and then the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse was subjected to fumigation (see see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum) and the long inner burial sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up.To his buriers and (secret) disciples Yeshua was no am ha-arets (“average citizen) but a prominent figure.”\nShall I endlessly repeat:\n“MOST LIKELY (and to the sole exception of anointing that was postponed), the Judean burial core procedures namely speedy burial, wrapping in shrouds, specific PURIFYING and DRYING were performed to abide by the Halakha (especially when it came not to wash a post-mortem shed blood-covered body) and honor the deceased.”?\n“It is TOTALLY ludicrous is to think (as YC does) the shrouds tightly wrapping a body cannot be soaked in/anointed with spicy oil perfumes to prevent bad smells as in the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three or seven days immediately following death.”? In other words a body all wrapped-up in shrouds could be anointed without having it to be unwrapped at all.\nOn June 3, 2013 at 6:29 am | #57 Reply |, I also wrote:\n“Adler NEVER considered a Second period Temple purifying & drying ritual scenario (implying the use of alkaline solution coupled with (myrrhic) aloetic fumigation) could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now these two signals precisely tend to prove the body could have been purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial custom/practice (see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum and my TS man’s burial reconstruction).\nIn the case here under study, Second Temple period speedy tahara in terms of wrapping in shrouds, purifying & drying out was an act of ultimate kindness to honor the deceased who died a violent death. It shall not be mistaken with careful physical cleansing Jewish/Judean ritual of a NON-bloody body.\nThe true archaeological fact is there is more than one way by which blood could have become depleted of key ingredients if one considers the bloody body purifying & drying ritual scenario, which Adler clearly did not (crucifixion being an implicit assumption in all his discussion at the expense of specific burial practices, rites and customs). His shortcomings and partial view do show as far as archaeological bloodstain pattern analysis is concerned.”\nAnd on March 18, 2013 at 4:44 pm | #23 Reply |, I already wrote:\n“Nope with YC, his mind is set the wrong way around. When there is compelling evidence the Turin Sindon hematic cartography is clean and neat, he just cannot care less and just dismisses the idea of even a speedy purification/washing ritual.\nAnd what does YC make of the 3 different conjugated koine Greek verbs used by the 4 evangelists meaning bound/fastened – compressed/wrapped up – wound/encircled and the koine Greek word for ‘shorter shrouds/pieces of linen’ (othonia)? Nothing. He just cannot care less and still claim the body was just draped over (before the image formation), which the Gospels NEVER say, quite to the contrary! What does he make of the fact it is written Yeshua was buried according to the JUDEAN burial custom, which implies to abide by a series of procedures? Nothing again. He just cannot care less. The mximum burial time frame between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath is 4 hours and the minimum burial time-frame 2 hours. No problem, he keeps claiming Yeshua’s burial was dispatched in less than half an hour implying Joseph of Arimathea waited to the very last minute to buy a burial cloth and then ask Pilate for his master’s body just before sunset? Nope.”\nAdditional reminders for YC:\nOn March 17, 2012 (that is more than one year ago) I wrote: \n“(YC) currently keeps rehashing Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was made in haste after sunset (that is within about half an hour or so) and his shroud just draped about his body or loosely bound for the women to wash and anoint his body at the first morning hour of the first day of the Hebrew week, that is just after the Shabbat, on the third day of Yeshua’s death. Such a view (or should I better say “preaching”) presupposes:\n1/Yossef Ha-Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), waited until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him. Are you serious? Do you really think Yossef Ha-Ramatayim would have also run the risk not to abide by Deuteronomy 21: 22-23 and wait to the very last minute for taking down himself or having Rabbi Yeshua’s body be taken down from the cross and buried?\nIt does seem you totally overlook “one little circumstantial fact”: in the Second Temple period, any working activity was to stop at midday “on preparation day” that is on the very eve of the great Shabbat of PessaH/Passover (PessaH 4, V). How then could possibly Joseph of Aramathia have bought a shroud after sunset and before dusk on that specific day when Jerusalem weavers’ workshops, stores and shops had all been closed for more than 6-6½ hours? This is a total exegetical non sense.\nUnless one is ignorant of the ethnic milieu and thinks a Judean of the Second Temple period would have waited until sunset on “preparation day” and go and buy a shroud long after all the weaver’s workshops and linen shops had closed, this reconstruction of the event chronology is most unlikely. In all likelihood, Yossef Ha-Ramathaym had already bought (“had bought” is an alternative translation) a fine linen shroud for himself in anticipation of his own death and used it to wrap Yeshua’s body “with his shed innocent blood”. As a disciple of Yeshua, didn’t Yossef go as far as using his own recently hewn garden-tomb near-by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus to both abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to his burial?\n[Precision: the women bought the spices not just BEFORE but just AFTER the sabbatical rest. Mark (16: 1) raises the ambiguity which could result from the chronologically biased relation/presentation of the same fact in Luke (23: 56).]\n2/ Modern time markers such as ‘evening’, ‘sunset’, ‘twilight dusk’ philologically cover the same realities for a Judean of the Second Temple period. Far from it!\nWith respect to the time frame for Yeshua’s burial, here are the ancient biblical Hebrew words & expressions for the time markers from noon to night used in the Second Temple period yet currently overlooked by Shroud researchers/old students and exegetes:\n1/Tsot ha-yom (or “midday”) refers to that time of the day at equal distance between sunset and sunrise.\n2/Tsohorayim (dual form of Tsohar, “dazzling light” or “zenith”) literally means “two dazzling lights” or “two zeniths” and refers to ‘both morning and evening lights’ merging into ‘noon’.\n3/Erev (“evening”) may indifferently refer to the 1st or the 2nd evening. Rabbi Yeshua died exactly between the first and the second evening (at the 9th hour).\n4/Beyn ha-arbayim literally means “between the two evenings,” —- arbayim being the dual form of erev, “evening.” The afternoon was divided into two halves: from noon to mid afternoon and from mid afternoon to sunset or put in other words from early to late evening (See Exodus 29:38-41, “They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha-arbayim”). For the covenant people, the entire day revolved around the offering of the two Tamid lambs: that of the morning and that of the evening. “In a paper entitled « En Vue de la Solution Archéologique de l’Énigme » I presented in Turin in 1998, I wrote: « Le deuxième sacrifice quotidien du Temple (Numbers 28: 4-8) dit sacrifice du “soir” (evening sacrifice) se déroulait vers le milieu de l’après-midi (mid afternoon) et pouvait être avancé d’une heure (une veille de Pâque) voire même de deux heures (lorsque cette grande fête tombait un Shabbat) (PessaH 5:1). le premier sacrifice avait lieu le matin. Ainsi “le premier soir” allait-il du milieu du jour (from midday) jusqu’à la deuxième immolation en milieu d’après-midi (until mid afternoon) et, « le deuxième soir », de la deuxième immolation du milieu d’après-midi (from mid afternoon) jusqu’au crépuscule du soir (until twilight/dusk)».”.\n5/Shqiya, “sunset”; the sun set at 18:38 p.m. on April 7th 30CE and 18:08 p.m. on April 3rd 33 CE.\n6/Beyn ha-shemashot which literally means “between the suns” is an expression for “dusk” or “twilight” between the setting sun and the rising moon (which reflects the light of the sun).\n7/Layla, “night”; typically layla is taken to be when you can see three stars in the sky in reference to tset ha-kokhavim, the first “three stars coming out” to announce a new day (here the great Shabbat of PessaH). The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. on April 7th 30CE and19:08 p.m. on April 3rd 33 CE. Owing to a lunar eclipse or the Ruah Qadīm, “east wind” (Khamsin/Sharav); a wind blowing from the desert of Judea, the whole city of Jerusalem was plunged into darkness from tsohorayim (“noon”) to beyn ha-arbayim (“between the two evenings” that is the 9th hour of the day; 15.34 p.m. on April 7 30 CE/ 15.04 p.m. on April 3 33 CE). In other words, for 3h34/3h04, on the very day Rabbi Yeshua died on the cross, it was also night, “layla” on that very day in the eye of a Judean of the Second Temple period.\nHence, the actual maximum time-frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30-45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30-45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near-by, we are left with a minimum time-frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time-frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th-21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period.\nWithin a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s buriers had enough time to pre-wash his body (i.e. to re-dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. sindôn/Heb. sadin) soaked with a watery solution (ashes of the Red Heifer?) and tightly wrap it up, with fresh aromatic medical insect repellent plants, in linen clothes and strips.\nIn the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three days immediately following his burial. Anointment was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite as it allowed preventing bad smells on those subsequent visits. Because this part of the rite was not done, the women had to buy and prepare spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the third day. They definitely had not to wash the deceased’s naked body at all but just to anoint his linen wrappings. Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period might well have been duly completed within a minimum of a two-hours-and-a-half time-frame.”\nOn March 24, 2012, I also wrote: \n“Both historically and archaeoastronomically speaking, here is the best alternative to account for the darkening of the sun on Yeshua’s death on the cross:\n-Either it did actually happen one “April 7th of 30 CE” and if so, the “black breath” of the Ruah qâdim (“east wind”, also called Sharav/Khamsin), blowing from the desert of Judea, is the most likely phenomenon to have occurred to account for the darkening of the sun.\n-Or it did actually happen one “April 3rd of 33 CE” and if so, the same “black breath” or dust tempest has been followed by the rising of a moon already bloody/in eclipse that evening/second evening, thus fulfilling Joel’s prophetical “blood moon” vision (Joel 2:31).”\nThis is my hypergraphic answer to YC hypergraphic prose. Will finally YC get the idea? Nope.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2013 at 7:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40420","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Important message to jesterof  (and others interested): Concerning Barbet’s idea about an oozing of lymph for the wounds, I read again the part of his book in which he refers to that and discovered that my understanding of it was not completely correct.  In fact, what Barbet meant was that, in his mind, it is truly possible that all the wounds and all the excoriations of the skin (this certainly include the scourge wounds), even though they clotted normally (that include the clot retraction phenomenon that leave a distinct serum stain around the central bloodstain), have keep on oozing a lymph that was more or less infected BEFORE AND EVEN AFTER the Shroud man’s death, which contributed, in his mind, to keep all these clotted wounds more or less humid, at least at their surfaces.  So, I admit having misread Barbet about that…  On the contrary to what I thought and said on this blog, in Barbet’s mind, the wounds (including the scourge wounds) didn’t really get infected, so that their clotting process was delayed for a long time, but instead, the normal blood clots were maintained more or less humid because of a more or less constant oozing of lymph that kept on even after death, thus making it possible for them to eventually leave a good mirror imprint on the cloth later on. Along with this possible oozing of lymph in the vicinity of the clotted wounds, Barbet estimated that there was most probably a release of water vapor by the corpse (and we can also think of a possible release of post-mortem gases such a ammonia), which could also have played a huge role in the mirror imprints of all the wounds (including the scourge wounds) and all the pre-mortem blood flows (such as the ones in the head and forearms regions) that we can see on the Shroud.\nSo, I admit having partially misread what Barbet thought concerning a release of lymph from the wounds: it wasn’t the wounds that got infected in his mind, but the lymph that was probably oozing from these clotted wounds…  But even then, I was nevertheless correct about the fact that he thought that an oozing of lymph was at least partially responsible for the presence of all those precise imprints of dumbbell shaped scourge wounds on the cloth.  And if Barbet’s idea about the oozing of lymph is correct, it should be noted that this phenomenon could have played a very huge role in the fact that a lot of scourge wounds have been able to leave a mirror imprint of themselves on the Shroud, while at the same time, not even one of the ancient blood flows coming from the scourging were not able to do the same, even though it is very probable that many of these clotted blood flows were still stuck on the skin of the Shroud man at the time of his burial. If Barbet is correct on this issue, this absence of presumed blood flows that were caused by the scourging was due to the fact that they would not have been kept humid for a long time by this possible oozing of lymph that came from the scourge wounds. In other words, this kind of small oozing of lymph would have been pretty much restricted to the area of the clots that were formed over these wounds and also possibly to their immediate vicinity (with no effect on the clotted blood flows).  \nI think this kind of more or less constant oozing of lymph from the wounds and excoriations (even after death) can really offer a good, simple and rational explanation for why all the scourge wounds (which all produced, in Barbet, Lavoie, Adler and also in Zugibe’s mind, an external blood clot coming from a superficial cutting or excoriation of the skin) were able to stay moistened enough to leave a good mirror imprint of themselves on the cloth later on, while the ancient blood flows that also came from the same scourging were not able to do so, even though it’s very probable that most of them were still present (but in a completely dried state) on the skin of the Shroud man when his body was laid in the Shroud.  The very probable fact that these ancient blood flows had been completely dried for a long time prior to the Shroud man’s death (on the contrary to the scourge wounds, if Barbet’s oozing of lymph hypothesis is correct) can really explain why all these particular blood flows were not able to get re-moistened enough to leave a visible imprint of themselves on the cloth…  Even if some moisture could have covered them inside the Shroud (coming from a probable release of water vapor and post-mortem gases from the corpse), these ancient blood flows would have been simply dry for too long, on the contrary to all the clotted wounds (including the scourge wounds), which were able to stay more or less humid during all the crucifixion and even after the death of the Shroud man.  \nI honestly think that this is the most probable explanation for the presence of all the scourge wounds on the Shroud and the absence of all the assumed blood flows that most probably came from the leather tongues of the flagrum, along with maybe some help coming from a re-opening of many scourge wounds when the tunic would have been removed from Jesus body at the foot of the cross and with also some help from the very intense sweating, which was certainly present on the body and hair of the Shroud man, especially just before he died.  Also, we cannot exclude that the natural clotting of these wounds could have been delayed by some biological syndrom or disorder that could have been caused by the highly traumatic state of the Shroud man after his scourging.  On this subject, even jesterof seem to agree that a delay in the clotting process of all the wounds could have really happened due to the traumatic state of the Shroud man…  \nPersonally, I would leave this possibility as a possible secondary cause for the imprint of the scourge wounds and prefer to favored Barbet’s hypothesis concerning a more or less constant oozing of lymph from all the wounds (including the scourge wounds) before and even after death that would have greatly helped all of them to leave a mirror imprint on the Shroud when the body was laid in it later on.  One thing’s for sure: there really are many rational possibilities that can explain the presence of these scourge wounds on the cloth, along with the absence of the ancient blood flows coming from the same scourging, but a partial washing of the body is most probably not among them…  \nAnd if you still want to ask me why the idea of Zugibe is most probably not relevant here, just read my guess posting on-top of this page, along with all the post I wrote after that and you will find tons of good reasons to reject such an idea (or at the very least, consider it as being highly improbable in the context of the hasty burial of a crucified criminal like the Shroud man).  Among those reasons, the most important remains in my mind the presence of clear and distinct serum stains around most of the scourge marks, which is a very solid clue to think that these marks really came from exudates of moistened blood clots (external blood clots I might add) that had been clotted for a pretty long period of time, so that the clot retraction phenomenon (which cause an expulsion of serum from the clot) could become active (just like Barbet, Adler, Lavoie, Baima Bollone and others specialists thought).  And along with this solid argument, you can also consider seriously the fact that, on the Shroud, there is absolutely no smudge or smear of blood and absolutely no pre-mortem bloodstain have a tendency to follow the weave pattern of the cloth, which is a very strong indicator that all these bloodstains (including all the scourge marks) came not from an oozing of liquid post-mortem blood that would follow a partial washing of the body that would have removed all the dried blood clots, as proposed by Zugibe, but from exudates of moistened blood clots, as proposed by Barbet, Lavoie, Adler, etc., which exclude any idea of washing of the body. On this point, you must absolutely note that this absence of smudges and smears of blood and this absence of bloodstains that tend to follow the weave pattern of the cloth are even real on the back region of the Shroud, where there was for sure a very intense pressure present on the cloth due to the weight of the body.  This simple fact has to be seen as a very solid piece of evidence against the hypothesis of an oozing of liquid post-mortem blood that would have caused all the scourge wounds after a partial washing of the body, as proposed by Zugibe.  Also, there is also the very strong argument I gave you in my guess posting concerning the presence of precise scourge marks in the immediate vicinity (as close as 1.3 cm!) of a post-mortem blood flow in the lower back region, which could not be disturb at all by any washing.  The idea that this particular area (which would not have been so easy to reach) could have been washed in such a surgical manner is quite simply ludicrous in the context of the hasty burial of a crucified criminal like the Shroud man.  Also, the fact that the forearms and head regions have been able to produce a good body image on the cloth, while they have clearly not been washed at all prior to the enshrouding of the body is another circumstantial evidence that support the idea that even if there were still many dried blood flows that would have been present on the skin of the Shroud man in the regions affected by the scourging because the body would have remained unwashed, this would not have been a factor that could have prevent the formation of a body image in these areas. Also, we must consider the historical research done by Lavoie et al. in the 1980s, in which they found out that washing the dead body was a normal part (along with anointing and dressing the body, among other things) of the whole Jewish burial procedure, at the exception of one case: when the dead body in question suffered a violent death that would have caused some bleeding at the time of death. In such a particular case, Lavoie et al. informs us that no washing would have been done in order to respect the Jewish Law (and I might add that such a rule was most probably even more respected when the dead body in question was the one of someone who died on the cross as a legally condemned criminal).  Also, another pretty strong argument against Zugibe’s hypothesis of a partial washing of the body comes from the finding of evident traces of dirt in the knee area on the Shroud, which is a place where there are some scourge marks. Finally, here’s another possible evidence against the washing hypothesis that would have produced an oozing of liquid post-mortem blood, as proposed by Zugibe: the possible absence of potassium in the scourge marks (I say “possible” because I’m still unsure if Adler really found no potassium in the particular case of the scourge marks or if this absence was only detected for other bloodstains).  Anyway, if there really is no potassium whatsoever in these bloody marks, it would be another important clue to think that these marks were really made of exudates of moistened blood clots (that shouldn’t contain potassium if we believe Adler) that would have still been present on the skin of the Shroud man because his body would not have been washed prior to his deposit in the Shroud, instead of being made of liquid post-mortem blood (a kind of blood that should contain potassium) that would have oozed from the re-opened wounds (filling them of post-mortem blood in liquid form) after that a washing of the body would have removed the dried clots over these closed and dried wounds (as proposed by Zugibe). \nQuestion to conclude: Isn’t that enough pieces of evidence for you (jesterof and anyone else) to open your mind enough on this subject that you could start to consider other possible avenues than an improbable partial washing of the body, followed by an oozing of liquid post-mortem blood, as proposed by Zugibe? I just hope all my reflection on this subject (with all the strong arguments I bring you; suggestion: try to consider them as a whole) could at least open your mind a bit on the possibility (not a certainty) that Barbet was right after all with his hypothesis that all the scourge marks on the cloth (as well as all the other pre-mortem bloodstains) would have been produced by exudates of moistened blood clots, without the help of a partial washing of the body.  I hope some of you will start to get more critical against Zugibe’s hypothesis, as well as becoming critical also against jesterof’ own hypothesis, which seem to be unable to rationally explain the presence of very distinct serum halos around most of the scourge marks on the cloth, on the contrary to Barbet’s hypothesis…\nFinal and important note: The only way I can change my mind on this whole issue would be for jesterof (or anyone else) to show me (not tell me, but show me with the help of some pictures) a clear proof that the kind of blood transfer he proposed and/or the kind of blood transfer proposed by Zugibe can contradict all the strong arguments I gave you in this long post, especially the presence on the Shroud of distinct halos of serum around most of the pre-mortem bloodstains (including most of the scourge wounds) that are clearly visible and very easy to distinguish from the blood under UV light.  Note also that, for Barbet, Adler, Lavoie, Baima Bollone and other specialists, these serum stains that are located right outside the central bloodstains are a clear sign that a blood retraction phenomenon had time to operate on external blood clots that were in a drying mode… And it’s also important to note that Zugibe, in his paper, never say a word about this important question of the presence of serum halos around most of the pre-mortem bloodstains, which has to be seen as a great mistake on his part. In all logic, the only way he could have produced a bloodstain surrounded by a very distinct serum stains on its edges would have been to let his oozing of liquid post-mortem blood alone for a while, so that the clotting process could enter in the clot retraction phase, which takes a pretty long time that is not at all rational in the context of the hasty burial of Jesus on Good Friday.  Finally, I would like to hear jesterof or others on the question of the possible lack of potassium in the scourge marks. If such a lack of potassium could be be scientifically confirmed for these scourge marks, I really wonder how his own hypothesis of blood transfer or the one proposed by Zugibe could account for it… Note that Adler had a pretty reasonable answer for this lack of potassium, which was related to the probable fact that all the pre-mortem bloodstains (including the scourge wounds) were formed on the cloth not by complete blood (as it would have been the case if Zugibe was right; it’s probably also true for jesterof’s hypothesis), but by exudates of moistened blood clots, as described by Barbet in his book.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2013 at 6:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40450","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Three-hour darkness during Rabbi Yeshua’s crucifixion is documented by the Gospel writers Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They read as follows: \n“Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is\nto say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:45-46)\n“And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Mark 15:33-34)\nMy Comment: Opening verse of Psalm 22 stands here for the whole psalm. One shall be reminded the “yet” in verse 3 turns around forsakenness into deliverance. It has the ring of truth as for time immemorial, psalm 22 is one of the psalms pious Jews use TO RECITE DURING THE PROCESS OF DYING or whenever they found themselves in difficult situations.\nAnd it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.\n46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, certainly this was a righteous man. 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. (Luke 23:44-48)\nSHOULD the three passages above to be taken just as metaphors and be pious lies?\nIf we are to fall in YC’s most curious ‘take-and-leave’ interpretative line:\nWhy SHOULD anyone consider too the very fact that Rabbi Yeshua is reported in the Gospels to have died at the ninth hour of the day (i.e. exactly “between the two evenings”, beyn ha-arbayim in Hebrew), be true/an historical reality? Why SHOULD NOT YC or anyone read it just as another literary device/forgery to most artificially have Exodus 29:38-41 (“They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha-arbayim” = at the ninth hour of the day) symbolically fit the event? Why SHOULD YC give more credence to Rabbi Yeshua’s time of death and hold darkness at the resurrection to be a pious lie? Etc.\nAfter committing the fallacy of arguing ad nauseam from silence as far as Adler, Rogers, Barbet are concerned YC now commits the fallacy of arguing ad nauseam from chronic metaphor/pious lie as far as Matthew, Mark and Luke are concerned. The true fact remains though a simply naturalistic explanation, namely a Judean desert dust-storm of great magnitude blowing in Jerusalem (followed or not by the rising of a bloody moon) could rationally account for the darkness at crucifixion. Would YC be unable for once to apply his dearest Occam razor principle when it comes to this specific issue? From his Quebecois viewpoint, would YC be unable to imagine ‘the black breath’ of the Judaean desert darkening the sun over Jerusalem and its vicinity?\n\n","date":"August 5, 2013 at 6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40489","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Question from Max:  SHOULD the three passages above to be taken just as metaphors and be pious lies?\nAnswer from me (and from most biblical scholars that I know):  As metaphors that are directly sending the reader of the time (who knew how to interpret these images) to the creation account at the beginning of the book of Genesis.  This image of darkness at the time Jesus was on the cross is nothing else than a symbolical manner for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers and that God was about to begin a brand new creation (or a re-creation if you prefer), just as we see in Genesis when it is said: “Now the earth was formless and empty, DARKNESS was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.”\nThis image of darkness (as well as the reference to an earthquake) is most probably only symbolic and not really historical (this is not a certainty, but this is highly probable, in the light of the ancient Middle Eastern way to speak and write, especially for the Jews).\nJesus’ crucifixion was a real historical event.

It was only a very ancient way to described a SPIRITUAL REALITY with the help of material realities.  It was a kind of language that we’re not so familiar with today in our modern societies…  This kind of symbolic writing was very common in those days and it was very far from being a lie on the part of these ancient authors.  It was just their way to described things that we can’t see with our eyes!  \nAnd concerning your question about the ninth hour, effectively, I would not be surprise that this too could be more symbolical than really historical, but in this particular case, I would not bet my house the way I would for the earthquake and darkness, because I don’t see any good reason to completely reject the idea that this could be the real hour of Jesus death on the cross.  And it is the same thing for the supposed 3 hours on the cross of Jesus…  Here too, it is truly possible that this number is more symbolic than anything else.  As you sure know, the number 3 in the Bible is often used as a symbol of fullness (and in the case of Christ, we can also see a possible reference to the Trinity), just like the number 40 is often used as a symbol of a time needed to achieve something.  In both cases, it would be very risky to take such numbers for granted and think that they are really historical and not symbolic…\nNow, concerning your demand of reference for a biblical scholar I can know, just give me 24 hours and I’ll bring this to you with pleasure.

Brown, in which he gives his opinion about the darkness that supposedly came when Jesus was on the cross (personal translation of the French edition of this book): “When we read the surprising description of the darkness that covered all the Earth from noon to 3 o’clock (from the sixth to the ninth hour), many possible interpretations come in mind. This can be a factual report, implying possibly a natural phenomenon (eclipse, thunderstorm, etc.) or a miracle without any previous; or this can be a purely metaphoric description related to the eschatological language of the Old Testament or the Hellenistic imagery associated with the death of famous man or even both.”\nAfter this introduction, Brown wrote this: “We have no way to know if, for the Gospel writers, Mark and Matthew, a physical darkness was present at noon at Golgotha. Anyway, this is very probable because they give a schedule like they do for events they report as real.  But we know that both writers have a symbolical and theological orientation.”\nAfter this, Brown gives a lot of possible parallels that can be made between these darkness and various texts of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Jeremiah, Sophonias, Joel, Second book of Enoch, etc.), which can well have had a huge influence on the reference to the darkness in the Gospel accounts of the Passion of Christ.  In a footnote, Brown also wrote this: “While resuming the history of the interpretation of these darkness, Grandez bring attention on the influence of the Pseudo-Areopagite (around 500 A.D.), who underline the analogy with the great miraculous interventions of God in the Old Testament, particularly in Exodus.”\nAnd concerning the reference to an earthquake that we found in Matthiew, Brown reports again many examples of possible parallels that can be made with various texts of the Old Testament and say that the reference to an earthquake (sometimes associated with the darkness!) in the Old Testament is often a sign of God’s judgement or of the last times.\nI think this is a pretty good summary of Brown’s book concerning these “catastrophic” events described in the Gospels and I think you don’t have to be a genius to understand that these kinds of references can well be symbolic instead of being really historic.  Of course, as Brown said, it is impossible to be sure about that.  But nevertheless, the fact that the imagery of the earthquake and the darkness is often found in the Old Testament to describe an intervention of God in this world should be enough to put serious doubts over the possibility that these events really happened at the time of Jesus’ death.  One thing’s for sure:  Personally, I would NEVER base a hypothesis concerning the Shroud (whether it be the image formation or the blood transfer) on things like that because the possibility is way too high that these references can only be symbolic.\nAlong with these quotes from Brown’s book, I encourage anyone to also read another comment I wrote yesterday about the same topic.  Here’s the link: https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/#comment-40379\nNow it’s up to you to take all these things for granted as true historical facts… Note that Brown himself don’t take position.  He presents the facts, give some possible explanations and let his readers decide if they think these things really happened or not.  But in the end, it should be noted that the simple fact that he presents a lot of parallels with the Old Testament should be enough for anyone to become at least a bit suspicious about the possibility that these events can really be historic.  Of course, some of you (like Max for sure) will bring back this quote from Brown : “Anyway, this is very probable because they give a schedule like they do for events they report as real.” But this is far from being a sure proof of anything…  In fact, Brown himself knew that as he immediately said : “But we know that both writers have a symbolical and theological orientation.”  So, again, there’s absolutely no way to be certain if these events really happened on Golgotha or if they were just literary creations used for a symbolical and/or theological purpose.  And because of that, the prudence here would be to keep things like that off of any hypothesis concerning the Shroud.  The risk of error is simply too high.  To conclude, I would ask you two good questions: Do you seriously believe that Jesus was the only Jewish (or even Middle Eastern) man of his time who have used symbolic images to described spiritual realities (like he did with all his parables)?  Don’t you think the Gospel writers could also have been tempted to introduce very strong events like an earthquake and/or darkness that were very telling for their readers in order to symbolically describe a divine intervention and/or the power of darkness forces at the time of the Passion, death and Resurrection of Christ?  I hope you will at least leave the door open for this possibility…\n\n","date":"August 6, 2013 at 8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40566","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"YC,\nIn one of my comments (# 134), I asked: “Could you give me the name of a REALLY INSPIRED biblical scholar, please and tell me what does he say about the darkness at crucifixion (if you know any such Biblical scholar!).\nYou gave me the name of Raymond E  Brown and his quote re  the darkness at resurrection: ““Anyway, this is very probable (a physical darkness was present at noon at Golgotha)”,… \n…which is the exact opposite of your claim: “This image of darkness at the time Jesus was on the cross IS NOTHING ELSE THAN (upper case letters mine) a symbolical manner for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers and that God was about to begin a brand new creation”????????????!!!!!!!!!!

It DOES have NO RHYME NOR REASON at all!\nHe wrote: “(Tight wrapping-up of the body would have been) completely ludicrous in the context of people who knew they had to come back to the tomb on Sunday morning to finish the burial)…”. And in # 68: “…the MOST LOGICAL (LOWER CASE LETTERS ARE MINE) move for them would have been to simply laid down the crucified body that was still covered with blood clots (dried and moistened) and some dirt (not much) in the Shroud WITHOUT TYING THE CLOTH with linen strips (because they knew they HAD TO OPEN IT AGAIN (sic) on Sunday morning) and leave it there still naked Inside the Shroud. That’s THE MOST LOGICAL SCENARIO (sic!) in the context of Jesus hasty burial. YOU CAN THINK WHAT YOU WANT(sic) but that will NEVER CHANGE (sic!) anything about THIS TRUTH (sic!)”.\nThe true fact is this is not what the Gospels say at all! \nCould YC RE-READ John 19:40 in the light of the three Gospels as above (#141), he could read: “Then they took the body of Yeshua, and (WOUN and COMPRESSED and) FASTENED IT in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Judeans is to bury” . Can YC and tell me now if Yeshua’s burial on Good Friday is ONLY METAPHORIC TOO, PLEASE?  \n“What is also TOTALLY ludicrous is to think (as YC does) the shrouds tightly wrapping a body cannot be soaked in/anointed with spicy oil perfumes to prevent bad smells as in the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three or seven days immediately following death.” In other words a body all tightly wrapped-up in shrouds could be anointed without having it to be unwrapped at all.” (see my reply # 101).\n YC also reads, besides anointing, the women were to wash and wrap Yeshua’s body in shrouds/linens clothes on Sunday morning. AGAIN this is NOT what the Gospels say!\nIWere is even the case, can YC explain to me and all, why the wrapping in shrouds/linen clothes SHOULD be read as ONLY METAPHORIC in the Gospels while the anointing procedure the women were about to perform on Sunday Morning SHOULD be read as referring not only to FACTUAL anointing to be but also to FACTUAL washing and wrapping to be (had Yeshua’s body be still in the tomb)? \nStill WAITING for YC to answer my questions above # 134-139-140…\n\n","date":"August 6, 2013 at 12:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40575","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Typo: Were it even the case\n\n","date":"August 6, 2013 at 12:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40576","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Re the use of dramatic emphasis as literary device, THANK YOU, I am perfectly aware.\nAs early as January 7, 2012 at 11:12 am | #12\nReply |,  I wrote (as my personal exegesis of Matthew 27:53):\n“I can also give a more serious explanation to Matthew 27:53 to account for saints coming out of their tombs after Rabbi Yeshua’ resurrection.\nIn the Second Temple period, it was rather usual for both possessed and holy men to live an eremetic live in grottoes or DESUSED TOMBS.

These elements can be totally historical but they can also be totally symbolical.\n\n","date":"August 7, 2013 at 10:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40644","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Re darkness at the crucifixion, through the thread you said it was “NOTHING ELSE THAN (upper case letters mine) a symbolical manner for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers and that God was about to begin a brand new creation”… YOU ARE TOTALLY WRONG!\n\n","date":"August 7, 2013 at 11:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40653","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Why is it 100% sure that I am wrong about that?

Brown in those terms: “We have NO WAY TO KNOW if, for the Gospel writers, Mark and Matthew (you can include Luke also), a physical darkness was present at noon at Golgotha.” And it’s the same thing for the earthquake and, even more, for the supposed resurrection of the Saints at the time of Jesus’ death. All those things can well have been included in the Gospels in a pure symbolical way. THERE’S NO WAY TO KNOW. Because of that conclusion, the use of those things in any hypothesis versus the Shroud is risky as hell.\nI don’t think we should continue this useless debate any long since you can’t understand (or don’t want to understand) the heart of my comments…  Personally, I think those events are symbolical but I also clearly said that it is impossible to be sure, one way or the other.  The most important thing is the fact that, historically speaking, these kind of catastrophic events in the Bible are very hard to prove as having really happened, for the good reason that most authors of the Bible liked to speak with images.

In his eponymic gospel, he reports Peter’s testimony. Now Peter was also a direct witness of the darkness. Most likely Luke (Heb. Yair, mistranslated in Greek by iatros) helped Yeshua to carry his cross (beam) and as such was also a direct witness of the darkness. Matthew  was not only a Roman tax collector but also a Judean and one of Yeshua’s disciples and report there were darkness. We have 3-4 direct witness for the darkness at the crucifixion.\nReminder of YC’s claimed opinion (on this very thread) for YC himself: \nRe darkness at the crucifixion, when YOU CLAIMED as if it were a proven fact it was “NOTHING ELSE THAN (upper case letters mine) A SYMBOLICAL MANNER for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers and that God was about to begin a brand new creation”… YES, I am100% sure you are totally wrong just because YOURSELF claimed “THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW.”! \nReminder AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN for YC:\nI NEVER say, as you most misleadingling infer, I was 100% sure there was darkness at the crucifixion. Don’t you but the words in my mouth. I just said “IT WAS MOST LIKELY”. I would say I am 95% sure if we take into account\n– severeal direct witnesses DID produce valid testimonies in the light of the Judean law system and their testimonies just cannot be as easily overlooked as you most wrongly think.\nJudean law system is part and parcel of the Judean culture.\n– the Judean desert dust-storm is a factual datum. It would account for “a storm” in conjunction with “darkness” as it does blow in Jerusalem and its vicinity and/or ‘lontanicity’ (“all over the land” of Judaea or as far as the eye could reach from the mount Golgotha). Meteorological phenomena is also part and parcel of the Judean culture.\nReminder ACAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN for YC: \nMOST LIKELY (95%), this was BOTH a physical darkness AND a sign as far as Yeshua’s crucifixion are concerned. In other words, MOST LIKELY the darkness at the crucifixion war DRAMATIC AND FACTUAL as it is totally consistent with a Judean desert dust-storm of great magnitude (remember for e.g. March 1998 dust-storm blowing in Jerusalem and its vicinity) and the several direct witnesses’ testimonies are in accordance with legal validity as far as the Judean/Jewish law system is concerned. MOST LIKELY THIS IS MORE THAN A MERE LITERAY DEVICE IN TERMS OF DRAMATIC EMPHASIS.\nOftentimes,  Yeshua’s resurrection itself is also seen by Christians BOTH as A FACT (several direct witnesses bore testimonies they saw Yeshua alive after his death) and a SIGN (as a new covenant between G.od and Manhood). \nYC, if are you 100%, Yeshua resurrected, allow me to be 95% the darkness at crucifixion is both physical/real and was seen as a sign by several direct witness then.\n\n","date":"August 7, 2013 at 2:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40671","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Note: sorry for the one thousand and one typos (writing in haste).\n\n","date":"August 7, 2013 at 2:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-40673","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body","post":"Matthew 27: 53 re holy men getting out of their desused tombs and grottoes and  appearing in Jerusalem after Yeshua’s resurrection, ”could then be read in the light of the darkness all over Jerusalem and its vicinity and/or lontanicity.
