But as Lavoie showed, and Adler agreed with, the bloodstains which appear to be in the Man’s hair alongside His face and temples were actually on the sides of His face and temples. That is, those bloodstains and image are out of stereoregister. So looking at an image under those bloodstains is looking at the wrong place.\nThis is explained by John Jackson’s Cloth Collapse Theory, as being due to the Shroud around Jesus’ head flattening out as it fell into the source of radiation where Jesus’ resurrected body had been. \nNote that Lavoie arrived at his conclusion by experimenting with a cloth around a man’s head with imitation bloodstains copied from the Shroud and daubed on it. It was unexpected by him and he was not trying to make his facts fit Jackson’s theory. In fact he made his discovery in 1983, eight years before Jackson proposed his theory. Read Lavoie’s book, “Resurrected: Tangible Evidence That Jesus Rose from the Dead” (2000) or his “Unlocking the Secrets of the Shroud” (1998).\nCoincidentally, my latest but one post on my The Shroud of Turin blog, “The Shroud of Jesus?: 2.5. The bloodstains” covered this:\n“The blood marks in the hair along the sides of the face (see above) are actually on the sides of the face and temples of the man’s body[50]. That is those blood marks on the cloth are out of stereoregister with the Shroud’s image of the physical face and temples upon which they were[51]. As we shall see in “10. How was the Image Formed?”, this is explained by Dr. John Jackson’s “Cloth Collapse Theory”[52].  …\n50.

Before perhaps? I say this because the cloth had to be touching for the blood transfer on the head to have happened – how long might that take in a humid sepulcher? It would seem to follow that the image formation process had to kick in after the cloth came away from the head perhaps as the bindings came loose? \nDoes it seem possible that they acted simultaneously? If they did wouldn’t the image on the face be more distorted and far less focused because the cloth would necessarily need to be against the sides of the head for a lot of the image forming time? The cloth would also have to be in motion, even if ever so slowly, to allow the blood stains to come away from the head and register in the hair image. I would think that would produce major distortion and lack of focus. Complete speculation of course.\nIf they could not have happened at the same time I wonder how long each process took.

Without contradicting Heller and Adler’s findings, there is another consideration. The image, it must be remembered, is confined to the topmost fibres of the topmost threads. A random collection of fibres from the image areas of the shroud might consist of 5 per cent with “image” on them. The blood (or at least the serum, as most of the red blood has worn off) covered all the surface, has seeped into the cloth and emerged the other side. A random collection of fibres from a bloodstain might consist of 90 per cent with “blood” on them.\nOver the years, it is clear from photos that the upper surfaces of the threads (where the image is) have been almost completely denuded of red blood, which is confined to little crystals and concretions mainly in the interstices between threads, and one might speculate that most of the serum from those locations has also been rubbed or crumbled away.\nIt is thus deduced that, in most of the areas where there is “blood,” there never was any “image,” and in most of the areas where there is “image,” the blood, if it was ever there at all, has been eroded away.\nIn short, whether the blood arrived before or after the image, I would expect hardly any sample tested with protease to reveal any image underneath it. I do not know how many fibres Heller and Adler tested with protease, but unless they had clearly “image free” results from well over 100 samples, their results do not demonstrate that the blood preceded the image.\n\n","date":"February 27, 2013 at 9:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/26/that-is-not-what-one-would-expect-to-see-if-the-blood-first-dogma-were-true/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-25814","author":"Hugh Farey","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"That is not what one would expect to see if the blood-first dogma were true.","post":"I do not understand the problem.\nRemember that almost all the bloodstains are found in image areas.\nThe blood samples available for Heller and Adler came from:\n– 3EF: ” Wrist blood, image area.
