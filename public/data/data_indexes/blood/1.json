Most of any work that has been done since then seems to have been carried out by individual enthusiasts, working in an unconnected way, all going in separate directions.  Whether that is a good thing or not for arriving at scientific conclusions might be debated.  However most of the general work in Science in modern times appears to be best when there is some kind  of corporate structure underpinning it to give it coherence.  However such work also requires heavy investment, and there are limits to what kitchen science can achieve unassisted.  The results will generally appear to be amateurish, and an easy target for pseudo-skeptic criticism.\n\n","date":"December 28, 2012 at 3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/28/colin-berry-hardly-copper-bottomed-evidence-for-so-crucial-a-question/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-21275","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Colin Berry: Hardly copper-bottomed evidence for so crucial a question","post":"“… such work also requires heavy investment, … “:  There is no clear indication of any kind of tangible financial return that such an investment could generate – they would be intangible only; Investors look for rather more, unless they can be written off as a tax break.
