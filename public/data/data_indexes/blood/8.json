[{"title":"Blood Question: Where’s the Salt?","post":"Is the presence of sodium chloride is a forensic test typically used in the characterization of dried bloodstains?  Tests for the presence of specific blood components, such as hemoglobin, immunoglobulin, serum albumin, & ABO molecules are routine as they are more informative and definitive.  \nIrrespective of the Shroud, type salt and bloodstains into your favorite search engine and you’ll get some hints on spot removal or descriptions of buffers used in solubilization, but come up pretty short on diagnostics.\nPass the salt, please, appears to be a straw man\n\n","date":"May 1, 2012 at 6:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/01/blood-question-wheres-the-salt/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-11030","author":"Kelly Kearse","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blood Question: Where’s the Salt?","post":"Colin would know better than any of us that NaCl is highly soluble in water, along with its ions.  Surely only one dowsing would be enough to wash it all away.  Or am I missing something here?  Refer “The Shroud” Wison, 2010, Fig 1a & Fig 12 show two separate incidents of water damage, the first probably from some unknown storage condensation in an earthenware jar, the second from dowsing to extinguish the 1532 fire.  \nAbsence of NaCl may therefore be no kind of indicative argument;  On the other hand any presence of NaCl could hardly be taken as corroborative of anything, I should think.  \nIs there any way that NaCl could be retained on the cloth, particularly the blood stains, if it was dowsed?  Only if that’s possible can Colin’s query then have significance!\n\n","date":"May 1, 2012 at 7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/01/blood-question-wheres-the-salt/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-11031","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blood Question: Where’s the Salt?","post":"Reminds me of a curious detail that I recently noted in Giulio Fanti’s “La Sindone. Una sfida alla scienza moderna” (2009, p.175): “Recentemente, l’autore è stato informato che una crosticina di sangue, prelevata dalle polveri aspirate da G.Riggi di Numana, risulta mescolata al sudore, in quanto è ricca di cloruro di sodio” (‘recently, the author has been informed that a blood crust, found in the powder collected through aspiration by G.Riggi di Numana, turned out to be apparently mixed up with sweat, that contains very much NaCl’). So, apparently salt has been recorded, but there was too much salt for the sample being pure blood, with the most natural explanation being that the blood was mixed up with sweat. Of course, this observation illustrates an important point: NaCl is a very common mineral, that can result from many sources. Besides, it is also very soluble.\n\n","date":"May 1, 2012 at 8:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/01/blood-question-wheres-the-salt/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-11032","author":"Jos Verhulst","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blood Question: Where’s the Salt?","post":"Can you please read this very good paper from the frenchman Thibault Heimburger : http://shroud.com/pdfs/thibault%20final%2001.pdf\nHe analysed both McCrone and Heller-Adler’s papers and findings and show how McCrone conclusion were off-track mainly because of a bad methodology and how much Heller and Adler did their analysis with great care.  Never forget that both were expert in the field of blood analysis, on the contrary to McCrone who was not.\nIf you read this summary paper about the blood analysis from the Shroud, you’ll easily see that Heller and Alder did found Na and Cl as chemical element present in the blood samples.  I think M. Berry should read again (or read for the first time) the papers published by Heller and Adler.  There’s no question about the FACT that the blood on the Shroud is blood.  \nAnd because it is a FACT, I truly recommand you to read again the recent open-letter that was posted here by Dan : https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/please-dont-forget-the-evidence-of-the-bloodstains/\nWhile reading it, I hope you’ll understand that the fact that blood on the Shroud is real blood don’t leave too much space for a forgery hypothesis and surely not for any kind of forgery hypothesis involving any kind of artistic technique…\n\n","date":"May 1, 2012 at 4:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/01/blood-question-wheres-the-salt/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-11040","author":"Yannick Clément","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blood Question: Where’s the Salt?","post":"I must say, I am 100% in agreement with something Yannick has said.\nMcCrone’s analysis of the blood was simply mediocre in comparison to the multiple tests done by Heller and Adler…This is a fact usually and most deceitfully left out by Shroud opponents.\nR\n\n","date":"May 2, 2012 at 1:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/01/blood-question-wheres-the-salt/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-11051","author":"Ron","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Blood Question: Where’s the Salt?","post":"For once Ron !  He he !  And what people has to remember also is one important fact that was confirmed by Adler’s spectroscopic analysis that he did in the later 90s :  The blood on the shroud is not complete blood but exudates from traumatic blood clots !!!  That can explain the absence of potassium in the analysis.

In any case, this salt thing is a non-issue,  ordinary salt being such a common substance. Nobody would accept the presence of NaCl as a valid indication for the stains being real blood – and rightly so.  One could say almost as well  that the researchers had to look for the presence of water in the stains, because blood  contains a lot of water.\n\n","date":"May 2, 2012 at 1:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/01/blood-question-wheres-the-salt/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-11050","author":"Jos Verhulst","site":"shroudstory"}]
