[{"title":"Paper Chase:  DNA Analysis and the Shroud of Turin: Development of a Shroud CODIS","post":"Well done, Dr. Kearse.\nSo for us science-challenged Shroudies, the gist of the paper is: DNA is such a complex element to work with that all existing conclusions (re: the Shroud) should be considered unconfirmed at best. We have new technologies and methodolgies that would allow us to provide much more accurate and confirmable conclusions. It would be nice if these someday could be utilized.\nThis paper is a great audtion for Dr. Kearse to be a member of any STURP II.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2014 at 10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/paper-chase-dna-analysis-and-the-shroud-of-turin-development-of-a-shroud-codis/","cat":"blood_studies","id":"comment-73942","author":"David Goulet","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase:  DNA Analysis and the Shroud of Turin: Development of a Shroud CODIS","post":"Beautiful… Very informative.
