For example, if a small section of 10 pixels by 10 pixels is selected to represent the tip of the nose from the back surface, the very bright spot that is visible can be selected, then a similar section on the front surface can be selected where the nose is. Also, the tendency to increase would apply for one specific photograph that was used to find a maximum match, not necessarily for all of them. This is the case for the first column of Table 1. As I wrote in the previous comment, it depends on the matching process used. But they had lots of freedom in the way to search given several small sections. Obviously, by taking the entire face, you are then quite restricted in your matching process since you can only search once. This is what should have been done, but apparently this was not done that way which is very surprising.  Note that the paper of Fanti and Maggiolo does not explain how the matching was done which opens up all kind of possibilities from which I selected one, namely by independently searching each section.  Not to have explained this process and not providing the locations and sizes of these sections are major missing parts of this study.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2013 at 12:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21709","author":"latendre","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Dan, as far as pareidolia and the coin-on-eye issue is concerned, you wrote on 11th December 2012 (see your post « Coins on Eyes Issue Again »): \nFirstly, “Is the cloth too coarse [to record Pilate coin partial blood decals]? […]Maybe. I don’t know.”\n–There is no ‘maybe’ as the TRUE fact is most definitely, IT IS NOT.\n(Your opinion is biased as long as you ONLY rely on NON-professional numismatists, NON-archaeological/ancient bloodstained pattern analysts, NON-archaeological image analysts/cryptanalysts and NON-palaeographers such as Lynn, Gonella and Schwortz who most obviously confuse NON-body tiny blood images with body images). \n–Rodante’s and Moroni’s experiments DO prove that (via blood transfer) a 3:1 twill linen fabric (soaked with a watery/oily solution) such as the TS is not too coarse to record small/Pilate coin partial patterns. To assert it is too coarse to record such patterns is totally misleading and nothing less than a pseudo-scientific and pseudo-archaeological untruth.\nSecondly, “Is the nature of the film inadequate? Maybe. I don’t know.” \n–Which film/picture of the Sindon face close-up are you referring to? The TRUE fact is the same intriguing tiny patterns do appear (more or less out of focus) whatever the photographic procedure not only in 1931 Enrie’s (orthochromatic) and 1978 Miller’s (traditional silver) but also in 2002 Durante’s (extensive digital). The intriguing tiny patterns may completely or partially disappear only under specific lighting conditions.\n–To assert that the nature of the film is inadequate in se is to ignore the same intriguing tiny patterns DO appear on genuine Sindon face photographs whatever the photographic procedure.\nThen Dan you added: “My problem is perception.” \n–I have no doubt about it since it is a very tricky case we have here. \nAs a final comment you wrote: “I suspect that some of us have different, indeterminable acceptance thresholds where I think I see becomes I see.”\n–When e.g. it comes to “ancient coin PARTIAL TINY pattern recognition”, it is even more tricky for the uninitiated brain-and-eye system as the latter may be not only the victim of ‘I think I sees’ (i.e. falsely positive perceptions) BUT ALSO ‘I think I don’t sees’/‘I don’t think I sees’ (i.e. falsely negative perceptions) AND misreading (fragmented letters, letter-sequences or image) AND even a mixture of falsely positive perceptions, falsely negative perceptions and misreading. So much for the “different, indeterminable acceptance thresholds” where I think I see becomes I see, I don’t think I see/I think I don’t see becomes I don’t see, I think I don’t read becomes I don’t read, I misread becomes I read etc.\n–The TRUE fact is the Pilate coin pattern recognition issue is completely spoiled by such biased approaches by NON-professional numismatists, NON-archaeological/ancient bloodstained pattern analysts, NON-archaeological image/inscription/text analysts/cryptanalysts and NON-palaeographers.\n–Di Lazzaro, Murra & Schwortz’s paper is brilliantly desinformative as it ONLY tackles/sees ‘ONE side of the issue’ as far as pareidolia is concerned. The FACT is It only tackles the ‘I think I see [what is not really there]’ side but most misleadingly overlooks to tackle/see the TWO OTHER sides of the optical illusion issue namely ‘I think I don’t see/I don’t think I see [what is really there] and falsely positive perceptions mixed with falsely negative ones in conjunction or not with misreading.\n–It is now up to the professional numismatist, palaeographer/epigraphist and/or archaeological image analyst/cryptanalyst (ideally working in close association with an optic engineer) to REALLY help the uninitiated eye to see what is really not there and what is really there in terms e.g. of partial tiny coin patterns or inscriptions around and on the TS face.\n\n","date":"January 6, 2013 at 1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21661","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Max I totally agree with your assertion that the work can be a very\npolarizing depending on the image science methodology used to quantify your conclusion.

The last few years I have has as my desktop wallpaper the standard MS picture of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain.  I’ve frequently noticed that under certain conditons of room lighting, or the angle of the sun coming through the window, that unmistakeable faces, sometimes even of recognizable personages, appear on the faces of the standing stones.  I’m also reasonably certain that neither the Stone Age people who carved them, nor a retouching of the picture have intentionally produced this impression.  Other readers might like to check it out.  It is one small piece of evidence why I remain prudently cautious about claims for seeing various images that may or may not be real objects, notwithstanding Max’s insistence, but I fully understand where he is coming from.  \nThere was an earlier discussion some time back concerning Robert De Clari’s claims concerning seeing the various stages of Jesus’s life on the Shroud cloth.  Clearly De Clari would be reporting what he believed he saw.  At the time, Max produced some coarse images which certainly seemed to support De Clari’s perception.  I recall that he mentioned he would endeavour to enhance them with clearer images.  If Max has developed those images further, I for one would like a reference to where they might be viewed   \nAnother example in the importance of lighting angle, are the wrinkles and folds on the Shroud cloth which become clearly visible only under conditions of raking light, as demonstrated in a John Jackson video posted here some months ago.  Clearly the wrinkles and folds are certainly always there, but only become visible under the proper lighting conditions.  There are any number of other examples in the type of light, such as whether it’s visible light, UV, or IR.

No solid evidence has been provided yet and in this sense, the burden of proof relies on those claimining that those images are present. In this blog, I have often mentioned that the  I think I see game is not scientific since, so far, authors and have never released the original images they have used for independent confirmation and verification of their methodology and results. This is no science and currently there is no ground to support the idea of images of any kind.\nHowever, I completely disagree with Dan when he says that this paper provides the scientific explanations, lucidity and focus I could not achieve (to explain paraedolia effects in previous posts) \nThe authors, just like in any ”I think I see” paper do not provide free access to the images they have used. The software they use (Paint Shop Pro X4) is a medium level software and not appropiate for a thorough identification of any tentative letter, coins or flowers. In my view, a very little scientific part of this paper, is comparing Marion’s results using software filters and contrast enhancement when he used a completely different, much more powerful and accepted technique (PCA, just like in the most interesting paper by Morgan of last July) as a way to combine and extract the meaningful information from different wavelengths (red, green, blue, IR) and sources. A scientifically honest approach to reject Marion’s work would require the use of the same technique (PCA, and not a much  more simple one) and see then if the ENEA letters appear. Everything should be done with freely available material for open scrutinization and reproducibility. Sorry to say but, despite the claims, I see no science here.\nHowever, the poorest part of it, is the focus on human perception when state-of-the-art techniques, allows moving to objective probabilities of appearance, something that the authors seem to ignore.\nNevertheless, my Bravo! goes to the public relations department of ENEA for reselling again another paper, in this case presented at Frascati Conference 2010, and as usual, in Christmas or Eastern.\n\n","date":"January 6, 2013 at 4:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21671","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin","post":"I note Gabriel’s comments above, criticism of particular software used, and in particular the comment: “… the focus on human perception when state-of-the-art techniques, allows moving to objective probabilities of appearance…” \nThe ratio ‘S’ Pearson Product-Moment Correlation given in Equation (1) looks very like a Correlation Coefficient most Stat students will be familiar with.  The calculated ratio of ‘S’ = 0.4 is dismissed on basis of the subjective pictorial comparison of the violin and the accordion.  I suggest that there is an objective Test of Significance that ought to have been carried out by the Stats investigator in this case.  In the Standard Correlation test for two variables (x, y), the coefficient of correlation ‘r’ would be transformed into a ‘z’ variable where z = atanh (r) (inverse hyperbolic tangent of ‘r’).  The sample value of ‘z’ will then be normally distributed with standard deviation 1 / sqrt(n – 3) where n is the number of data points.  This then enables confidence levels to be determined for the true value of ‘z’ and hence ‘r’.  If the data are completely uncorrelated, the hypothesis that ‘r’ = 0, can then be tested.  I should think a very similar test can be devised for the two-dimensional Pearson coefficient, but allowing for the appropriate degrees of freedom.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2013 at 1:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21685","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin","post":"\nCazab :\nBonjour Mario, je vous souhaite une très bonne année !

Not always… I see a difference of 13,3% between “nose” (0.80) and probaby smaller “nose tip” (0.86) but almost nothing between “eyes” (0.61) and  probably smaller “eye right” (0.63). And how can you explain that “eye left” is lower to 0.6 if there is a significant “tendency to increase”?\nWhen I look at the comparison between fs 02 and Enrie and I don’t see a significant “tendency to increase”. “Nose” (0.88) and “nose tip” (0.92).”eye right” (0.88) is lower than “eyes” (0.89) and “eye left” (0.96).\n\nOups !Sorry for the wrong % and the bad end!

It yields an objective parameter according to a set formula connecting sets of data.  False conclusions may be made by the inexperienced or inadequately informed amateur who fails to understand what a statistical test is about, and who fails to probe further in not measuring its significance.  I frequently applied it, along with regression analysis during my working life in researching sets of engineering and financial data,.  It is more commonly applied when a linear relationship may be assumed between two variables, but it can be extended to multivariate analysis, and also by means of appropriate transformations to include non-linear situations,  A text-book I still have by Paul G Hoel Professor of Mathematics in California and published as long ago as 1962 validates these applications.      \nKarl Pearson 1857-1936 was one of the key founders of modern statistical theory.  His correlation test was only one of many contributions he made to the science.  \n“Neither regression nor correlation analyses can be interpreted as establishing cause-and-effect relationships. They can indicate only how or to what extent variables are associated with each other. The correlation coefficient measures only the degree of linear association between two variables. Any conclusions about a cause-and-effect relationship must be based on the judgment of the analyst.”  (Encyc Brit)  Despite this EB quote, non-linear and multivariate correlation can still be tested by transforming the data.  A paragraph in my comment at #17, indicates the appropriate method of testing levels of significance.  \nAlthough the paper provides some fascinating observations on optical illusions, referring to Gestalt theory as an explanation, and includes citations and references, it is somewhat devoid of the experimental data.  I feel the authors have leaned a little too heavily on the aspect of illusionary experience as a reason for dismissing pareidolia phenomena.  I dare say that it may well be possible for confirmatory statistical tests to be devised to establish the presence or absence of alleged images, but I suspect that the matter is far more complex than is covered in the paper or even in comments published here.\n\n","date":"January 9, 2013 at 7:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21770","author":"daveb of wellington nz","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Dave, why don’t you ask Michael Tite (C 14 test coordinator) and the Oxford statistician how they manipulated the Pearson test instead?\n\n","date":"January 11, 2013 at 8:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21874","author":"Max Patrick Hamon","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin","post":"The Pearson r works well in the fields Daveb has mentioned but since the works by Willmot its shortcomes and limitations for many other applications are well known. In any case, a plain value of r  does not mean anything at all if it is not given along with its confidance boundaries. Coming to the paper, I think that most probably r, would not pass the test of being different from 0 due to the dramatic decrease in the degrees of freedom.\nHowever, the first thing author  should do is a thorough review  of the scientific literature and see which are the standard indicators used to compare images (certainly not r). This goes to the authors claiming that there is a second face and also to the authors of the current paper. If everything is going to be scientific, all the claims in one sense or another, should be done according to widely accepted methodologies and indicators.\nA further concern is the format used for the images after scanning. JPEG, PNG and many other (typical if Paint Shop has also be used for scanning) should not be used because they distort the pixel values.\nI hope the authors in their new revised version can address all these points, including the use of PCA if they want to refute Marion’s results.\n\n","date":"January 9, 2013 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-21774","author":"Gabriel","site":"shroudstory"},{"title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin","post":"Thank u Gabriel.
