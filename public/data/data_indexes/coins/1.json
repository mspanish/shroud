If we allow people to have the digital files from our archives  we would not be able to keep track who’s accessing these files since people can easily transmit these files via e-mail. Plus the images that are used in the P-paper document are HSG ppf© and can be easily extracted in photoshop. \nThe best we can offer with any of our archives are hard copies.\nGiorgio\n\n","date":"October 31, 2011 at 11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/father-filas-discover-pilates-lepton-coin-paper-available/","cat":"news_&_views","id":"comment-4482","author":"HSGppf","site":"shroudstory"}]
