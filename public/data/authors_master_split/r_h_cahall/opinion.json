Nevertheless, a Pope has a certain responsibility to his office, the exercise of which includes making statements that go well beyond what can be established by scientific evidence. It would be more than a technical mistake, more than overreach with regard to technical competence, for a Pope to subordinate his level of discourse to that of purely evidentiary debates. The problem, of course, is that Christianity as such is based on evidentiary claims. So now we have at least two levels of evidence: the Shroud itself, which might be evidence of the fundamental claims, and the evidence concerning the Shroud’s authenticity. The Pope does well to avoid even the appearance of confusing these, especially since the fundamental claims should never be made to seem subject to a secondary discussion..","date":"2013-11-30","mins":"10:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/a-point-of-view/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"A Point of View"},{"id":"comment-54166","author":"r_h_cahall","post":"“The TOTAL evidence must be weighed to arrive at a successful conclusion.” Exactly! “It is important not to lose sight of the whole picture.” Precisely. “[Experts’] role is advisory only.” Well said. Beyond that, your Venn diagram is the coolest I’ve ever seen. It does perspicuously convey an abstract range of options. However, I think the logical case is better couched in terms of implications and their contraposition. What we have is something like P –> J, where P is a disjunction of negations (negated propositions), any one of which would be dispositive, and J the negative judgment on authenticity. If P –> J, then by contraposition J –> P, where P is a conjunction of the same evidentiary propositions, and J is the positive judgment on authenticity. The logic is brutally simple. What is difficult has to do with gaining a viable consensus regarding which propositions to include in P theoretically, and which of those have been established practically. Your larger point does need to be made though. It is all too possible for people to lose sight of the big picture and focus on details inappropriately, as if every niggling contention had the same weight. This does require the use of common sense reason, the reason of “oh for heaven’s sake be reasonable!”, rather than perpetual rationalization..","date":"2013-11-30","mins":"9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/30/it-may-not-suit-the-scientific-mind-set/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"It may not suit the scientific mind-set"},{"id":"comment-161496","author":"r_h_cahall","post":"OK one last time. I am convinced of the Shroud’s authenticity not because of this or that piece of evidence, but the weight of all the evidence, and all the kinds of evidence, together with the curious fact, for fact it seems to be, that there is no dispositive evidence, or evidence of any sort that I can tell, against it. Certainly anyone who considers the carbon dating fiasco cannot regard those results as evidence. At a minimum a retest would be required to establish any carbon dating evidence whatsoever. So what is the evidence, what is the weight of evidence, against authenticity? Where is it? Have I not been looking in the right places? And if indeed all that counts against the Shroud is one freshly minted conjecture after another, none of which seem to stand up very well, and what counts for it is a body of solid evidence gathered across many disciplines over many years, is it not reasonable to conclude that the relic is authentic? Otherwise you will have made hyperbolic doubt an unbeatable standard, one that nothing but a Cartesian cogito can overcome.

My only reason for making it is certainly not to convince you but the fact that the confusion itself is important enough to address generally. You persist in confusing a trial with a collection of individual expressions of opinion. In any trial, certainly the more notorious ones, there arise thousands of individual opinions based indifferently on reasoned consideration, or inadequate facts, or pure prejudice. The trial itself, on the other hand, is the most comprehensive way we can devise, albeit imperfect in some respects, to ascertain the truth of a given situation and pass a reasoned judgment on it. That is the consensus I refer to. You want there to be a grand separation between some sort of idealized “truth” and a rather tawdry “publicly accepted truth”, both in law and in science. We all know mistakes can be made and, knowing it, do what is humanly possible to avoid them. We also know that, for the sake of the coherence of our civilization, the ability to make certain judgments with truly reasonable confidence is vital. You on the other hand seem to think this is just a perpetual game that we can play merely for the sake of playing it. The game of interminable doubt. The game of hyperbolic scepticism. It really won’t do. A scientific/historical trial, such as the Shroud is being subjected to, differs in many respects from a legal one, but the similarities are sufficient, and sufficiently important, to justify importing the term. We do what we can to arrive at the most solidly reasoned consensus. This is what happens in science as well, and has throughout its history. The original post, and my response to it, had to do with not becoming so fixated on minutiae that the overall shape of the facts is ignored. In science, as in law, that overall picture can be, and often is, dispositive. A legal case based on a well knit pattern of circumstantial evidence is often regarded as much stronger than one based on the single fact of an eyewitness, for instance. No one, including the original post here, is saying that individual facts should not be investigated appropriately: that is part of what a trial is and does. Thus your penultimate paragraph is pure drivel. You have jumped to so many unwarranted conclusions you must be using a trampoline. Absolute certainty in matters of fact is a chimera, but if you wish only to wallow in uncertainty then that becomes your absolute certainty.

Yes. This is the sort of balance that is required, and not only in Shroud studies. I have worked with some of the Cantorian problems myself and can subscribe fully to the statement, and the sentiment, that “there are limits to the pure science approach that not even mathematics can resolve”. (Recall what Russell said, that we are able to mathematize science not because we know so much about Nature but because we know so little.) There is indeed a difference between science and scientism, and to realize it may be the beginning of wisdom for many. Yet there is also, as you say, a deeper wisdom: the “divine spark”. We may err, but what is transcendent within us can know the error as error, either actually or in the common potential of human activity. The Shroud sits at the most profound conjunction of science and religion. All the incomparable brilliance of Brahmanic civilization did not see fit to invent science because it had no need of science. Prophetic Monotheism, most specifically the Catholic Church, invented science due I believe to pressures arising within itself to address an imbalance caused by too great a reliance on the mythological. Prophetic Monotheism is essentially historical, not mythological. The Bible is crucially rooted in history and fact. Jesus again and again emphasized practical issues and practical consequences. While grounded in it, the Church had over centuries begun to lose vital contact with that dimension. The Shroud, and studies related to it, can in my opinion be seen as part of a great spiritual renewal that is not scientific per se, not the sort of heresies Teilhard was peddling for instance, but a revitalization in which the scientific spirit and outlook play a crucial role. Your point of view, as opposed to some others I have encountered in this blog and elsewhere, seems consonant with such an idea. The divine spark is our access to the superintelligible. We are “Lilliputians” only when we choose to restrict ourselves blindly and exclusively to the merely comprehensible..","date":"2013-12-01","mins":"11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/30/it-may-not-suit-the-scientific-mind-set/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"It may not suit the scientific mind-set"},{"id":"comment-55200","author":"r_h_cahall","post":"Seems I’ve inadvertently opened a can of worms here. I don’t quite know what Louis is saying in his first paragraph, since anthropology is a science. So Indian Civilization didn’t need science because they–what?–didn’t already have it? Weren’t already studying it? The caste system was their substitute? No, that civilization did not choose to come up with science for the unexceptionable reason that their entire religious ethos was a form of idealism in light of which scientific objectivity made no real sense. As for “daveb’s” comment, I don’t recall identifying myself as a Catholic conservative (I’m not), nor do I recall characterizing Teilhard as a pantheist. Nor do I recall that the Jesuit order forbade him to publish because he was “innovative”. There had been a number of quite innovative Jesuit scientists who raised not a ripple in that organization. It was because they felt his “innovations” were in an altogether heterodox direction, which they were. That a post conciliar Pope finds such things inspiring is hardly cause for wonderment, and certainly no reason to think Teilhard was not heretical, or let’s say seriously questionable at a minimum. I only tossed in the reference to Teilhard to clarify my own statement, not to inaugurate an inappropriate discussion on a blog devoted to the Shroud. I started out on this thread merely agreeing with what I took to be the main point of the original comment, and adding a bit of logical analysis to it.

Was it cathartic? Since a trial is a kind of legal investigation, merely shuffling terms around to escape the implications of what you said before is merely pathetic. Moreover, the law allows all sorts of judgments, such as “not proved” or reductions of charges. It really depends on whether “probably” rises to the level of beyond reasonable doubt or other lesser sorts of doubt that the law also allows, for instance in civil cases. But that’s more of your word salad. Oh and by the way, contention is what happens in trials. If the verdict, dear you, makes one guilty, then there can by definition be no wrong verdict, can there? No unjust conviction. No innocent man sent to prison. It may surprise you to learn that more than one society has regarded more than one man as guilty who was in fact not guilty. Some such have even been lynched. If the judgment makes you guilty, why bother with evidence? You say yourself, with embarrassing inconsistency, that legal “truths”, whatever they are, can be overturned. On what basis, if they establish guilt? As for “real truths”, what do you mean? Newton’s theory of gravity? I honestly don’t think you have a clue what you mean. No simply reasonable judgment, including those of science, is necessarily true. Necessary truths are matters of logic, not fact. If you think it is “every man for himself” in the case of the Shroud, then perforce you think it is every man for himself in the case of any reasoned judgment. The Shroud isn’t particularly special in that regard. Apparently you hold the possibility of genuine consensus in something like contempt, but that is itself contemptible. “Scientific truths are not collective consensuses of viable facts.” I’m not sure what a “viable fact” is. My phrase was a viable constellation of facts. But if you seriously believe that science does not proceed by collective consensus, you know very little of its history. As for “irrefutable proof”, any proof concerning matters of fact is of its nature potentially refutable.

(Let’s amend that to mind bendingly ‘heterodox’ since there are technical quibbles about what level of condemnation it takes to be a heretic.) I certainly do not want to revisit that discussion, such as it was, but I do find it enlightening given comments about “Catholic wingnuts” and “Beavis and Butthead” monasteries. Apparently Catholic conservatism is not in vogue here. As I am not Catholic, I can hardly take that personally. On the other hand, since Catholicism stands at the epicenter of our civilization, we’re all Catholic in a significant sense and all have a stake in its vicissitudes. Are there Catholic wingnuts? In fairness, yes. I’ve met some. I’ve also met liberal wingnuts. To say the least, many–to put it charitably–questionable claims have been made about certain objects in Mexico, and it does the cause of truth no good to associate them with studies on the Shroud. Fair enough. The case of the brothers Dimond seems to me to be somewhat different. Say what you will, and agree with them or not, they have done a good deal of real homework on the issues they discuss. They only seem radical because the post Vatican II Church has taken such a radically leftward turn. In fact, a lot of what they do is quote pre Vatican II Popes. And Councils. And catechisms. Before being so hard on them it is salutary to read in some detail about the infamous prayer meeting at Assisi, or to gaze upon the photograph of a post Vatican II Pope (“pope”?) kissing a copy of the Koran, in light of the settled doctrines and practices of the Church in centuries past. Examples, non trivial examples, could be multiplied into the hundreds, as the brothers Dimond do. That they, and the pre Vatican II Church run counter to the spirit of the age is obvious. That liberal Catholicism these days is trying to dance as fast as it can to the tune being piped for it by an all too questionable culture can hardly be in serious doubt. (And yes I realize it can always point to certain social teachings on abortion, marriage, and so on–all to the good, but subject to serious erosion by the forces of political correctness within. Indeed a philosophical analysis of its basis for attacking abortion can, and in my opinion does, serve to exemplify Nietzsche’s remark that the best way to attack a position is to defend it with weak arguments. There are whole book length studies by legitimate scholars on how a liberal agenda tends to lurk within the Trojan Horse of conservative phraseology. It is at least an issue.) Granted the Counter Reformation Church, by the nineteenth century, could be seen as becoming a bit sclerotic and self absorbed, there is nonetheless a question of whether the cure has been worse than the disease. One post Vatican II Pope referred to it as the “smoke of Satan”. As characterizations go, things can hardly get much worse. As for the teaching of “outside the Church there is no salvation”, that was never intended or interpreted as excluding any non Catholic specifically, granting that God could work as He will with respect to whomever He will. Indeed, my own experience with the pre Vatican II Church was of tolerance, generosity of spirit, and great spirituality. It was sublime. So while you are, of course, free to disagree with the brothers Dimond, I think it is profoundly misguided to ridicule them, and by implication the deep pain felt by those who do not share what can legitimately be regarded as destructively liberal sentiments. There are real concerns here of great import and they at least deserve respect. A blog devoted to the Shroud should be able to manage that much..","date":"2013-12-15","mins":"2:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/well-no-you-cant-call-him-a-catholic-wingnut-wingnut-yes/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Well, no.
