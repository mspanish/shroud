[{"id":"comment-52940","author":"r_h_cahall","post":"Can someone help me here? I happen to believe the Shroud is authentic, so I discount any explanations of the marks due to statues. However, when I see marks on a piece of cloth that are as symmetric as these, the only sensible explanation that leaps to mind is staining while the cloth was folded–I don’t mean necessarily folded for storage but folded nonetheless for some reason. The circular marks would then not be serum (something in any event not associated with statues) but water. I suppose, at the outside, it could be that one set of marks could have been formed by contact with the other, but this is not likely given the water marks. I discount too the explanation of a sedillis because of the near perfect symmetry and also because it would seem reasonable to expect more tearing or at least scraping in that area. And, while we’re at it, is it too much to expect anyone discussing this to spell out the word “buttocks”, given respect for the person under discussion whatever you may think of the Shroud? So is there any relevant evidence I am not aware of that would argue against my take on this?.","date":"2013-11-27","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/22/first-annual-bertrand-russell-award-in-sindonology/","cat":"image_theory","title":"First Annual Bertrand Russell Award in Sindonology"},{"id":"comment-52963","author":"r_h_cahall","post":"I took Latin in high school, somewhat nearer the time of the Roman Empire, so grammatical niceties are pretty much lost on me now. I just copied the word from the original post. As for the help I want, it is basically to know whether my reasoning holds up in light of facts I may not be taking into account. If you find what I said “very sensible”, then I assume you are apprised of no facts to the contrary.
