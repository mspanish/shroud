[{"id":"comment-28856","author":"sheela_sayer","post":"When the Turin shroud was carbon dated, the removal of just a thread or two was permitted from the border of the Shroud. However, the Shroud had been ‘edged’ during the Middle Ages in order to preserve it and therefore the carbon dating was of that era. It is my understanding that it has since been re examined and verified to the date of the crucifixion. A comment was made that the image seemed to have been seared into the cloth.","date":"2013-03-30","mins":"12:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/27/breaking-news-pope-francis-to-introduce-the-shroud-of-turin-saturday/","cat":"event","title":"Breaking News: Pope Francis to Introduce the Shroud of Turin Saturday"}]
