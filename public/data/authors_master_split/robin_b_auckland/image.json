I’ll remember to pray for you next time I attend Mass.Name calling should be left to five year olds when they can’t think of any thing else…You accuse Dave in one of your rantings of being a coward.This is far from the case.I suggest you look up details on railway via ducts in NZ. One of Dave’s many jobs was to clamber all over them inspecting the trestles for fatigue and check every nut ,bolt stay and any thing else the bridge was constructed of. He has probably inspected in his time every bridge in the North Island and possibly the South.One in particularly the Mohaka 95 m in height 276 m long Highest in Australasia when built and fourth highest in the world. This he has photographic evidence of him being 1/2 way up clinging on the outside. If you don’t know the man ,and you don’t ,Don’t lower your self to name calling. May God bless you and your studies.
