It would be great if our number of supporters could help them realize that importance too, but then again… with the heightened attention, how could you miss a following like this? In the Benford paper, based on weave pattern changes in the sample, the estimated ratio reflected approx 60% 16th century threads and 40% 1st century in origin. IF this remnant is donated in the future, could enough fibers be separated for advanced dating in this particular piece?.","date":"2014-03-16","mins":"8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?"},{"id":"comment-89636","author":"jenx","post":"Amazing. Kudos to Dan, I adore this site. Everyday I learn something I never knew. I’m embarrassed to say this post made me very tense. I can’t imagine what could possibly motivate anyone to withhold something that I believe doesn’t belong to an individual, but to the world. I’m not sure how this happened, but it certainly should have went back to the Vatican. If I took a personal item in for testing, I wouldn’t expect a professional to keep a portion of it for himself. Maybe it was previously arranged and have came to the wrong conclusions, I hope..","date":"2014-03-16","mins":"12:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?"},{"id":"comment-90102","author":"jenx","post":"Didn’t Flurry Lemberg, a textile historian, observe the variation in 02 during the restoration?.","date":"2014-03-17","mins":"1:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?"},{"id":"comment-90105","author":"jenx","post":"Http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p09.pdf.","date":"2014-03-17","mins":"1:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?"},{"id":"comment-89646","author":"jenx","post":"Unbelievable..","date":"2014-03-16","mins":"1:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?"},{"id":"comment-89775","author":"jenx","post":"Would be great to know.

Your professionalism, non biased approach, integrity you present with the media and tenacious work makes every shroud enthusiast proud! I loved the shroud since I was in my early teens and my mother took me to a conference. After the carbon dating, I sadly accepted the numbers for over a decade until I began watching and listening to you. That old spark of excitement and joy has been with me since, I thank you for that! Would a petition on change.org be a possibility to get this to Barrie? Or any type of action? It’s so disheartening to imagine one day this sacred piece of Christian history could end up on ebay to the highest bidder..","date":"2014-03-16","mins":"5:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?"},{"id":"comment-89753","author":"jenx","post":"Ebay = 21st century lot casting..","date":"2014-03-16","mins":"8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/16/so-was-the-small-arizona-piece-in-doug-donahues-custody-ever-made-available-to-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So, was the small Arizona piece in Doug Donahue’s custody ever made available to Barrie Schwortz?"},{"id":"comment-88757","author":"jenx","post":"If you don’t mind me saying so For many shroud researchers who believe it’s authentic, it’s been a long process of gaining respect from the scientific community just based on the sample area and it’s fiber consistency. Adding theories of KGB agents mass hacking computers adds to the eye rolling and appears we are desperately grabbing at straws. I think we need to stick to the credible findings already on the table in order to gain further testing or the doors could be slammed shut..","date":"2014-03-14","mins":"11:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/the-computer-hacker-hypothesis-is-short-on-factual-material/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Computer Hacker Hypothesis is Short on Factual Material"}]
