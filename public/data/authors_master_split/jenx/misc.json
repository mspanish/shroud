Antique or ancient linen, being a plant fiber, can withstand water. However, when water is applied to a targeted area, the fibers swell and “pushes” collected particles to the perimeter of the water mark which darken over time. I’m not a rocket scientist fellas, but as I’ve studied the shroud I’ve gathered the image itself fades over time, while knowing edges of water stains darken. For the Templars, they would’ve seen a darker image + lighter stain, right?.","date":"2014-07-17","mins":"9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/the-man-of-the-shroud-has-horns/","cat":"tinfoil_hats","title":"The Man of the Shroud has Horns?"}]
