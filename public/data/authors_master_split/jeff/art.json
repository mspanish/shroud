I was 2 1/2, and while most people may feel this is far too young to be really “aware” of anything, that’s not how it is when you’re experiencing it. I had the “tunnel” experience, and didn’t see Jesus, but could hear the whispers of many many people who had gone before me, though I couldn’t understand them; somehow I understood this. As I was about to go through I was told that I was free to do so, but if I did I could not come back. I responded, “I’m only 2 1/2, and have a lot of life to live.” Instantly I found myself suffocating; I had become tangled in the blankets at the foot of my bed, and I kicked and tore at them and finally freed myself. Just then my mother came into the room, but she didn’t understand what had happened. I finally told her about ten years ago, and she was shocked. I remember it as if it happened yesterday. If anyone doubts the validity of these experiences, no matter how grand they may seem, don’t underestimate them. There is life after this one, and the Lord’s Book will guide you there..","date":"2011-08-23","mins":"9:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
