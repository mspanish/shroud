No scientist could work from a list (what S Ci ENTIFIC validity has that list got?)as each one item would need to be checked and rechecked with the actual substances from the Shroud. But why should anyone outside the Shroud world be interested? The letter/challenge seems to assume that the fact that the image on the Shroud is not understood makes it somehow unique. Yet there are hundreds of other scientific issues that we still don’t understand e.g. Why some people get cancer and others dont’. There are several other cases of ancient objects only being understood through advances in scientific understanding in the last few years and we must assume such advances will continue. All we can say as that AS YET we don’t understand how the image was made. The only interesting outcome so far as the Shroud is concerned would be if someone could PROVE it was a supernatural event – why not put your £20,000 there? If it cannot be proved a supernatural event, then are you left with nothing else than it is a natural event caused by a process as yet unknown, alongside, of course, many hundreds of other similar scientific mysteries we have not yet got to the bottom of..","date":"2012-06-29","mins":"10:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/three-months-today-the-dawkins-challenge/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Three Months Today: The Dawkins Challenge"},{"id":"comment-13203","author":"menedemus","post":"Steve. I disagree there was once a burial shroud wrapping the body of the historical Jesus. Belief in Christ has nothing to do with that as the Protestant reformers noted five centuries ago. If the biblical evidence is correct, there is also presumably the stone which blocked the tomb, the Crown of Thorns, the Cross, the Lance, bread left over from the last Supper, etc, etc,.So what? Please explain.True Christians are not going to be interested in that lot, non Christians hardly either. I think you believe that there is a community out there which cares about these physical objects. Faith is about something very different. Some people seem to think the Shroud is more important than Jesus himself! If you really want to present a challenge, you have got to get a proper scientific TEAM working on the Shroud and it must include an expert on linen and the way it reacts with various substances and it must work in laboratory conditions. You can hardly expect a serious scientist taking up the challenge working from someone’s else’s’ list of attributes as you provide here. They would need to be retested and in many cases more sophisticated procedures would modify the findings on the list anyway..","date":"2012-06-30","mins":"5:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/three-months-today-the-dawkins-challenge/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Three Months Today: The Dawkins Challenge"},{"id":"comment-13368","author":"menedemus","post":"Steve. I just happen to think that there are many scientific issues which are directly concerned with the well being of humanity which deserve the £20,000 more than the Turin Shroud. Can you not find an issue that ‘encapsulates the frailties and pitfalls of empirical enquiry’ more than the Shroud does it seems an odd choice to select it in this way. Jesus Christ existed, he was crucified, he was buried in a burial shroud having been subject to horrific tortures before this. These physical objects, Cross, whips, Crown of thorns, shrouds, the stone blocking up the tomb, once existed but for many, in the Protestant tradition at least, they have nothing to do with the Christian faith. Some may still exist one cannot rule it out however unlikely it is that a piece of cloth has survived two thousand years let’s keep the question of the authenticity of the Shroud open, the Crown of Thorns might yet be found and the stone that blocked the tomb is probably still around in Jerusalem. Unless one can PROVE a supernatural explanation for the Shroud, which may add to the faith of some for whom belief in Jesus and his Resurrection did not exist before, I am not sure what the point of this exercise is. I wish someone could explain why the issue of not knowing how the Shroud was created is such a big one. It is only very recently with advances in X ray technology that we have begun to understand how the first century BC Antekythera mechanism worked (see Wikipedia). The ingenuity of the mechanism has amazed experts who could not believe that the Greeks were so advanced. The Horses of St. Mark’s in Venice were thought to be undatable but finally analysis on the gilding ( largely undertaken in the British Museum) cracked the problem and dates them to the second /third century AD. There are apparently ( I have only read about this in a review) big advances in understanding fourteenth century painting techniques. This sort of progress is going on all the time. The pro Shroud community write as if science stays still and so the means by which the image was created will remain forever unknown. This is unlikely if the Shroud is allowed to be properly examined and the latest techniques of analysis applied to it. Dawkins can be challenged for his views on religious belief on many different levels. If you want specifically to challenge him on the authenticity of the Shroud, you have got to arrange proper conditions for a scientific examination of the Shroud by a team specialising in ancient textiles. The ‘list ‘is nowhere to start as any scientist would want to check it through, retest some of the results and probably think up a lot more tests to do to test the hypotheses about the making of the image which a team of bright experts would undoubtedly dream up. And if, at this stage in our scientific understanding , we do or do not understand how the image on the Shroud was created, what then? Do tell me..","date":"2012-07-03","mins":"5:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/three-months-today-the-dawkins-challenge/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Three Months Today: The Dawkins Challenge"},{"id":"comment-13488","author":"menedemus","post":"Steve , 1) For me ,the question of how the Shroud image was created is not a important one. The fact we do not yet know simply places the Shroud among many thousands of other similar historical enigmas I don’t see it as standing out as something different. 2)The question of how it was made tells us nothing about its authenticity. Science continually progresses ,as the ‘discovery ‘ of the Higgs Boson shows. We may yet discover a method by which the Shroud was made that dates it to medieval times, or we may find one that dates it to the first century AD. A lot of commentators ,not myself, appear to believe that if the image is as yet inexplicable, then somehow that is more likely to make it authentically the burial cloth of Christ. I don’t follow that argument unless you are arguing that the image can only be explained as a supernatural phenomenon in which case it is, by definition, beyond the normal laws of science. 3) The examination of the Shroud has in scientific terms been a mess. There seems to be no overall coordination by anyone expert in the analysis of ancient cloths, samples are floating about all over the place,there is no proper consensus about what has and has not been found on the cloth. It may be too late to repair the damage but there is no structure in place for a proper scientific examination which would include a radio 14 retesting as well as retesting ,using more sophisticated techniques that are now available, much of the work done twenty or thirty years ago. We urgently need confirmation,for instance, if the blood group is AB as, if it is, it makes it almost certain that the image is medieval..","date":"2012-07-05","mins":"5:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/three-months-today-the-dawkins-challenge/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Three Months Today: The Dawkins Challenge"}]
