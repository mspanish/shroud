[{"id":"comment-12367","author":"menedemus","post":"I think they are clearly separated – you can see the gap on the tomb lid between the two pieces of cloth and the illustrator is depicting the sudarium as separate. The illustrator is taking his cue, as so many others did, from John’s gospel account where the sudarium is described as being apart from the other wrappings. The gospel text would be known to everyone, the Turin Shroud only to a very few indeed. If in doubt with these manuscripts, the gospel accounts should be seen as the main source as actual depictions of relics are very rare. (How many depictions of actual relics can you find in medieval art some shrines certainly, but very seldom any actual relics that is why the Pray Codex is unlikely to show the Turin Shroud it would be completely out of keeping with the mainstream of medieval religious art.).","date":"2012-06-13","mins":"7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12377","author":"menedemus","post":"P.S. To my previous comment.You have to remember that the vast majority of those producing sacred texts were enclosed monks. They would not be able to get out and about to see any relics other than those in their own monastery unless they had special permission from their abbot. So they would rely for their inspiration on what sources there were INSIDE the monastery which would include the gospels, of course, and other recognised texts. So we would assume that the illustrator of the Pray Codex would be using gospel texts and that this would explain why the sudarium is shown separately. He may also have known about burial customs such as placing the hands across the genitalia as was common practice in burials of his time. It is very unlikely that he would have reproduced a relic.Why would he?.","date":"2012-06-13","mins":"9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12390","author":"menedemus","post":"No, so that having made, I hope, my point clearly, I can retire to devote my time to MY professional work without interruption..","date":"2012-06-13","mins":"9:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12384","author":"menedemus","post":"Max would have more credibility if a) he did not waste so much space having to correct his typing errors.

It would be good to have access to the full article if it is on line. It seems( please correct me Corneliotel if I am wrong) that E.Poulle accepts that the Mandylion/ the Image of Edessa and the Shroud of Turin are NOT the same relic, but two distinct relics, one ,of course, of the face of the living Christ, and one the double image of the dead Christ. This is ,of course, what has long been argued here by Yannick and it makes good sense – they are so different that they cannot be the same, contrary to what Ian Wilson argues. It seems that Poulle accepts that texts such as the Gregarius text of 944 do show that the Image was just of a face and it was a later misinterpretation to suggest that this sermon talked of a body on the cloth. Is that correct? But E.Poulle does accept that the Turin Shroud was in Constantinople. Does he argue that it is the separate burial cloth reported by Robert de Clari in the Blachernae Chapel in 1203? I would be interested if Poulle tells us where he thinks this Shroud came from originally – how did it arrive in the Blachaernae Chapel? The Poulle article does seem to be very important in giving a scholarly overview and I hope we can be able to read it in full. Thank you Max and Corneliotel for telling us about it..","date":"2012-06-15","mins":"5:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12583","author":"menedemus","post":"Thanks, David Mo. Yes the article by Nicolotti is pretty devastating to the Ian Wilson case it is a pity there is as yet no English translation as Nicolotti goes through Wilson’s arguments one by one and shows why they are unsustainable. I wonder if anyone in the Shroud community will ever wake up to the dead ends that Wilson leads them into. I am still waiting to hear from Max where he thinks the Shroud of Turin was in 400 AD if it was used for the model for the Santa Pudenziana mosaic. I am not an art historian but Max’s world seems completely removed from any art history that I have ever dealt with. Who are all these people able to understand the cryptic clues in these paintings? So please Max.

I am not criticising you – I am asking you a question. You are making an important claim that the Turin Shroud can be seen in a mosaic dating to 400 AD in Rome. So the mosaicists must have seen the Shroud and so it must have been exposed somewhere. So I masking you where you think it was exposed, If you cannot give an answer no one will take you and your many posts seriously and it is much better that you concentrate on your professional works for clients and do not bother this blog..","date":"2012-06-16","mins":"8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12594","author":"menedemus","post":"Again no answer to a simple question.Can anyone else reading this understand what Max is talking about?

The fullest refutations come from Mark Antonacci and can be found online. There is also the very detailed photographic evidence that failed to show any reweaving. The St URP researchers only saw the Shroud for a very few hours, in very rushed conditions, not even in a laboratory and it is not at all clear how the samples they took back to the USA were conserved and protected from contamination over the years that followed. We know ,of course, that they have been passed around, starting with Mc Crone, and then to others. I assume that many scientists would say that they have become worthless with time because of this once the original context is lost, as when samples are totally removed from the environment which they came from, scientific work on samples becomes very difficult. We have to be absolutely sure that there was no chance of deterioration or contamination when the samples were distributed around the STURP community. How do they monitor this? In addition, and this is Ian Wilson’s view, not one of the STURP scientists had ever dealt with ancient textiles before they visited Turin in 1978. Imagine doing work on the pigments of a famous medieval painting when one had never done a course on art conservation. Certainly Rogers, if Antonacci is right, had no relevant background to work in this field. (N.B. As you can see I am relying on what other people have written about these issues and I am happy to be corrected if I have misrepresented anyone.).","date":"2012-06-21","mins":"4:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"}]
