[{"id":"comment-118971","author":"marilyn_dudek","post":"For the few doubters of Colton Burpo, might I remind you of St. Catherine of Sienna, who at age 6y/o was walking with her brother when she saw an apparition of Jesus…her story is amazing and wonderful…Jesus and Mary have routinely visited children in the past, and those children were very much alive…I believe Colton, when I was in second grade at Catholic grade school, I had a very kind and sweet nun. One day we asked her what did Jesus look like. She said “He was about 6ft tall and light complected”. We didn’t think to ask her how she knew we were too busy trying to envision what she said…most likely it was from people she knew that had NDE…that was almost 50yrs ago and that nun was almost 70y/o…just saying. Remember Colton isn’t asking you to believe him, he’s just sharing his story..","date":"2014-05-14","mins":"12:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"}]
