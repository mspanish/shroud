At the time I did not know if it was my spirit guide, or Jesus until I saw this portrait. This is in fact the man that came to me in my hour of need. I was telling myself how alone I was, and he told me I was never alone. He gave me the strength to lift myself out of the pit I was mentally in. I am so grateful to have watched “Katie” (which I have never done before), and seen the boy and the artist of this portrait. This IS the man I saw!.","date":"2012-10-09","mins":"3:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
