[{"id":"comment-3584","author":"camie_rabon","post":"I have (for as long as I can remember) a running conversation with God in my head. It wasn’t until recently that I realized that other people didn’t pray this way too. Alex Malarkey, another boy who has seen heaven, told his dad that his lips were for talking to people but there was a different part of his brain that was for talking to God. There is nothing great or particularly special about my life…but I know without the peace and strength I get through this kind of prayer and relationship with God, I would never have survived the death of my husband (& best friend) to cancer at age 41. The Bible says “Pray without ceasing…” and I believe that this is how you do just that. It just starts by pouring out your heart and talking time to listen to the voice within that answers. It feels almost imagined because society says it is…but the answers are seldom ones that I would have chosen. If I listen, I find peace (note: God did never promised us happiness or an easy life)..","date":"2011-08-12","mins":"1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]
