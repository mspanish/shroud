[{"id":"comment-204394","author":"aonu","post":"I might add that after Elijah was taken up Elisha tore apart his own clothes, then he took up Elijah’s mantle (2 Ki2.12 4). But after crossing the Jordan with the mantle on himself presumably since he tore his own clothes, the sons of the prophets at Jericho saw him and said that the spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha (v15). Is this a reference to the mantle? If so, why are they associating the spirit of Elijah with his mantle? Could this be another prophetic preview in light of the burial shroud of Christ? Is the image on the shroud an image of Christ’s spirit at the time of his translation? Maybe the reason Elisha rent his clothes after Elijah’s translation was because he thought he missed seeing Elisha taken away thus failing to fulfill the terms needed to gain a double portion of Elijah’s spirit, or so he thought (vv9 10), after all the text says a chariot of fire came between them and took Elijah away (v11). But when the sons of the prophets saw Elisha wearing Elijah’s mantle they understood he had the spirit of Elijah on him seeming to indicate it bore some mark or image of Elijah’s spirit when he was translated, thus fulfilling the terms, just as the shroud of Christ bears the image of his spirit at the time of his translation..","date":"2015-07-02","mins":"6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-204290","author":"aonu","post":"Re: baryon annihilation via electroweak sphaleron tunneling. The bible describes the taking away of Enoch the 7th from Adam as being “translated” — might this be some kind of removing to a different, higher dimension (ie, the 3rd heaven?) here postulated? And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. –Gen 5.24 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony [cf. V3 By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.], that he pleased God. –Heb 11.5, v3 in brackets. An interesting point on the invisible giving substance to the physical world and Enoch being taken to this invisible dimension perhaps. The other time in the New Testament a similar language and theme is used is in Colossians 1.12 17: Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: [his…: Gr. The Son of his love] In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. The translation here is associated with inheriting light. Is there light during the translation process I wonder? Elijah the prophet is also said to have been taken up. We are told he left behind a shroud like cloth from his body at the time, a mantle. Elisha the prophet ‘took up the mantle’ (where this phrase originally alludes to) and used it to strike the Jordan river speaking “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” and then crossed over when the water parted. Read 2 Kings 2.11 14 Is this a prophetic preview of the cloth left behind before Christ ascended? Is the shroud here to help us cross the waters of chaos as we ask where is the Lord God? The last words recorded between Elijah and Elisha in 2 Kings 2.9 10: When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.” He said, “You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.” Do you see Christ when he was taken in the shroud?.","date":"2015-07-01","mins":"7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-204506","author":"aonu","post":"Dave, the difference between my interpretation (which I have not seen put forth before vis a vis the image) and others is that mine helps answer some of the other curious elements of the narrative (why Elisha was so upset when Elijah left after he had already accepted the fact; how the double portion was fulfilled ie, 1. Elijah’s spiritual power over the elements such as parting water and 2. Elijah’s spiritual image) which are otherwise left, well, a curiosity and only guessed at (ie, Passing of the mantle = passing of the office, yet there is no biblical precedence for this and prophets had been carrying on long long before Elijah and Elisha and long after. On the other hand what I’m suggesting sets a precedence which is followed up by Christ and the shroud and this is one thing God seems to always do particularly with important events, that is he sets up foreshadows and patterns fulfilled later to a higher degree so that we will know the certainty of a matter). On its face we have important and rare elements that clearly sync up: Christ’s translation (if you will) and Elijah’s translation as well as leaving behind coverings from their persons at the event and both taken up in some type of powerful meteorological event described as a whirlwind or vortex (the chariot(s) apparently didn’t take Elijah up closer examination of the text (v11) but only really served to separate Elijah and Elisha), Acts 1.9 refers to a cloud and even gives us an important detail that the departure happened out of their sight, which helps us understand that Elijah too must’ve been taken out of the sight of Elisha and so didn’t fulfill the terms for the double portion as most would think without a deeper understanding of the text in view of the shroud Christ left behind. The image on the shroud isn’t made obvious in the text, particularly John’s Gospel, but leaves enough of a hint that isn’t (can’t be?) fully realized until the shroud image is seen just as the proposed image on Elijah’s mantle isn’t made obvious in the text until the shroud image is made known. Now the other elements less obvious in the picture I simply connect the dots to sync it up more clearly, thus providing us some deeper insights when the OT and NT texts are played off against each other. That’s what good interpretations are supposed to do, almost like a science. A parallel example would be Isaiah’s suffering servant which most Christians clearly see as a preview of Jesus because important elements sync up with the narrative in the NT about the Passion of Jesus and his sufferings, once that is established we can learn more about Jesus’ sufferings from Isaiah which are not mentioned in the NT. A similar phenomenon occurs between the narratives surrounding Elijah’s mantle and Christ’s shroud. Joseph was also a typology of Jesus, and he too left behind a special garment bearing bloody marks which was used as evidence of his death though he did live and was enthroned next to the king (Pharaoh) after his brethren rejected him and he ruled over the Gentiles but eventually revealed himself to his brethren and opened their eyes and saved them. This is a prophetic preview of Jesus and still his brethren reject him today..","date":"2015-07-04","mins":"9:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-204516","author":"aonu","post":"Nabber, I understand what you mean, but the authors of the bible saw fit to conceal things only to be revealed when those with eyes to see could see. In that way the bible is progressive and not static. At time the biblical authors wrote things they themselves did not understand and still passed them on faithfully for future generations. There are still many things the bible states that are not sourced outside the bible (yet), but that shouldn’t invalidate them. I’m only using the biblical text to interpret the biblical text, that’s not to discount extra biblical text which I often consult, but I’ve tested the text so many times in so many different ways and have come away so impressed that now it has become my baseline and used rather to test extra biblical texts not the other way round. That was not an easy position to come to for me and it was not earned lightly and I realize that puts me in the extreme minority now and to be scoffed at in today’s world.
