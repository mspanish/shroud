[{"id":"comment-9483","author":"betty_jane_best","post":"I had a horrific car wreck on February 16, 1988. I was dead at the scene, revived by a police officer with CPR, died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and died again on the operating table. I was in a coma for 2 l/2 weeks. I do not have any memories of my near death experiences. Last year, my sister gave me Colton’s book. When I turned to the picture of Christ that Akiane had painted, I recognized Him!! I felt such peace. Overwhelming. Although I still have no memory of Heaven, I KNOW I met Jesus..","date":"2012-03-20","mins":"8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
