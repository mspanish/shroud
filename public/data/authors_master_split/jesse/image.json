But the protocol is rigged, given that it intends to use glucose impregnated cloth. Yes, the Maillard reaction needs a source of reducing sugar. Not even Rogers had the brass neck to suggest glucose, the closest substitute being “starch fractions”. Reminder: starch itself is a polysaccharide, not a sugar, and only becomes reducing if extensively degraded chemically or enzymatically to small fragments with aldehyde functions. It was always hard to conceive of naturally degraded starch ever becoming a realistic source of reducing sugar. To substitute glucose is at best a cop out, or at worst a reprehensible sleight of hand unworthy of anyone who wishes to be taken seriously as a professional chemist..","date":"2012-09-18","mins":"5:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/18/latest-on-david-rolfes-site-on-maillard-reaction/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Latest on David Rolfe’s Site on Maillard Reaction"},{"id":"comment-16452","author":"jesse","post":"Time to go back to the drawing board..","date":"2012-09-18","mins":"7:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/18/latest-on-david-rolfes-site-on-maillard-reaction/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Latest on David Rolfe’s Site on Maillard Reaction"}]
