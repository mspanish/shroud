[{"author":"anonymous","post":"Once more on behalf of Centro Português de Sindonologia I congratulate Dr. Stephen Jones for this excellent new post.If this website did not exist honest Shroud researchers would have an hard time to get such important scientific data.As a medical doctor I understand the importance of such findings because an elevated blood creatinine value means among several pathological situations, either renal failure or severe muscle trauma, two conditions Jesus endured in His ordeal, and besides Ferritin nanoparticles being wrapped by Creatinin means that the «painting theory» is bogus.And besides even if desperate anti authenticity guys state that a clever forger painted the blood on the Shroud that had been taken from a tortured man I recall at least two differences from the real Shroud:Neither Image nor bloodstains could have been painted because Shroud researchers Don Lynn and Jean Lorre studied them with FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and obtained an isotropic pattern which precludes painting as a method of obtaining Image and Bloodstains.The classical FACT: There is no Image under Bloodstain(How would an hypothetical clever forger overtake this difficulty????)I'm eaggerly waiting for your next update warmest regards Antero de Frias Moreira( Centro Português de Sindonologia).","date":"2017-07-26","mins":"4:14 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2017/07/shroud-of-turin-news-june-2017-stephen-e.html","title":"\n\"Atomic resolution studies detect new biologic evidences on the Turin Shroud,\" Shroud of Turin News, June 2017 \n"}]
