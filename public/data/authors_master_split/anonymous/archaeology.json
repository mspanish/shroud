It seems I saw one where they showed a painting on a cave house in Turkey or somewhere showing a nativity with the infant Jesus wrapped in herringbone swaddling clothes. This show was attempting to follow the history of the shroud. Do you know the name of that show?

Two points you make in your blog; the mixture of linen and wool, and the fact Jewish law stated burial linens must be of 'common' make and not elaborate are very important...Plus the fact this man suffered of the so mentioned deceases and these deceases were not common in the Jewish population of the time. I think Gibson as you say should be ashamed of his 'Jumping to Conclusions' method of archaeology.Keep up the good work Stephen!.","date":"2012-01-15","mins":"12:51 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2009/12/burial-shroud-proves-turin-shroud-not.html","title":"\nBurial shroud proves Turin Shroud not from 1st century C.E.
