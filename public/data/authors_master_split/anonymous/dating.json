I read your interesting paper last evening and I was very surprised to note that you did not addressed any of Adler’s findings and conclusions versus the C14 dating of 88… Is it because Adler never officially linked his findings with the idea of an invisible reweaving? In the end, never mind the reason, I think it is a mistake on your part to have completely ignore Adler’s findings and conclusions regarding the C14 corner because it is a fact that he was the very first to scientifically challenge the C14 dating results with any kind of credibility by analysing some threads that came from the area where the C14 sample had been taken. Also, you must know that his findings were often used by the defenders of the invisible reweaving hypothesis to back up their conclusions… Sub question: Is it possible that, based on Rogers and Adler’s findings, there could have been a strong contamination of the C14 zone, without being related to a possible invisible reweaving? In other words, would it be possible to build a different hypothesis that would be based on those findings in order to explain a possible 1300 years shift in the dating result? In the end, is it possible that the C14 corner was highly contaminated (so much that it would have shifted the result from the first to the 13th Century) and that such a high contamination came from something else than a invisible reweaving? Finally, it’s also interesting to note that your own highly suspicious conclusion concerning the reweaving hypothesis is pretty much the same as the one that was draw in 2009 by Pierre de Riedmatten, who is the president of the Montre nous ton visage association in France.

The only thing that really matters (at least in order to scientifically defend and to sell to the public the idea that a new C14 test is truly needed) is the scientific findings of Adler, Rogers and some others that are solid enough to prove that a physico chemical difference truly existed between the C14 corner and the main body of the Shroud.

That’s why it is highly doubtful that, beside Jesus’ cloths (including his burial cloths), his disciples or family could have even thought of keeping any objects related to his Passion and death. David also said: “On the other hand, if you believed that His blood was a lifeforce like no other, then maybe you would be obsessed with retaining anything that blood stained.” My answer: I think David that your assumption here is out of context completely! A theological concept such as the “life’s giving blood of Christ” was surely not in the disciple’s mind right after the death and Resurrection of Jesus! Such theological concepts and dogmas took many centuries and a lot of debates (some of those being very violent and mean) during a lot of councils in order to become accepted by a majority of Christians. So, I think we can forget this kind of wild assumption concerning the immediate disciples of Jesus….","date":"2014-01-22","mins":"5:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/22/titulus-crucis-a-fascinating-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Titulus Crucis:  A Fascinating Guest Posting by O.K."}]
