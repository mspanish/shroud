Freeman: “the earliest representations of Christ with a beard are not in the east but in Rome.” My comment: You’re right about that but if the Shroud has likely been the model (direct or indirect) for the Pantocrator type of icon (early 6th century and possibly a bit before that time), I seriously doubt it if the same thing for the few bearded Christ frescos that have been found in the catacombs of Rome. On that subject, there are 2 things that make me think like this: 1 At that time (3th or 4th century A.D.) in Rome, the most common figure of God was a man with long hair and long beard (like Zeus and other great divine figures), so it is highly probable that those pagan depictions of God have been used to represent Christ at a time when no one knew what he looked like (which make me think the Shroud was still well hidden somewhere at that time). And 2 There is not one of these bearded Christ frescos that show as many points of congruence as we found in most Pantocrator like icons, which make me think the first depictions (the Roman frescos) were not based on the image we see on the Shroud, while it is the contrary for the Pantocrator like icons..","date":"2014-02-08","mins":"9:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/06/touching-on-the-byzantine-legend-that-jesus-had-a-shorter-leg-and-therefore-was-lame/","cat":"art","title":"Touching on the Byzantine legend that Jesus had a shorter leg and therefore was lame"},{"id":"comment-77323","author":"anonymous","post":"No matter what the author of the Acts of Thaddeus must have had in mind when he used the term “tetradiplon” in his text, this cannot have been a “subtle” way for him to talk about a long burial shroud of more than 4 meters long folded in 8 parts for the very simple reason that was already underlined months ago by M. Freeman, i.e. That in a later part of the same manuscript, the author make a specific mention of the burial cloths that were found in the empty tomb and it’s evident that, for him (as well as for St John Damascene and various eye witnesses who saw the Mandylion in the Pharos Chapel in Constantinople and for all the Byzantine artists who saw the Mandylion), those burial cloths had nothing to do with the “tetradiplon” cloth he mentioned earlier in his text and that was used by Jesus to wash his face, thus producing a miraculous imprint on the cloth. This is as much evident as the nose in anyone’s face for anyone with a bit of judgement, unless you’re totally biased in favor of Wilson’s crazy ideas. Really, I don’t know how can someone honest can read the totality of the Acts of Thaddeus and come up with the conclusion that the term “tetradiplon” used by the author was a subtle way to described the cloth as a long burial shroud folded in 8.

If the author of the Acts of Thaddeus had some notion of the true burial nature of the Mandylion, no doubt he would have made some kind of connection between this “tetradiplon” cloth and one of the burial cloth that was found in the empty or with the story of the Passion and/or death and/or entombment of Christ.
