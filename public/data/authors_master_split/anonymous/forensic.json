All I know from the debates are: There’s a barely recognizable image of a crucified man on it. You need to contrast enhance it to see detail. The only way the image can be seen is from a distance; up close it just disappears. In paintings the detail increases the closer you get. There is no pigment used to form the image (the image formed at the top of this website is just an image with no detail whatsoever and it purports to show how the TS image may have been formed perhaps in a MA huge oven). There’s even a website that infers the image was caused by an earthquake: https://www.livescience.com/43276 ancient earthquake shroud of turin.html If the image is supposed to have been produced by some MA artist which then begs the question as to why the nail imprints are in the wrist and not the hand where in all MA paintings/icons from that time forward show the nail prints in the palm of the hand. There are traces of limestone silica on the bottom of the feet and elbow that only can come from the steps on where this man tread on his way to crucifixion. No where else in the world is this type of silica found. Did the person who created the TS in the MA sprinkle some of it there to help authenticate the TS? Was the pollen which is only found in that part of Jerusalem purposely placed there as well? How does one account for the incredible body detail that was medically unknown at that time? There are so many websites out there on both ends of the argument each one showing how the image could have been created so it basically comes down to what you’re convinced of. As for me, the jury is still out.

I’ve only just cottoned onto the exchange above, and would like to drop in a few comments, if I may. Firstly – are the papers presented in Pasco available online yet? I can’t find them, but Colin seems to refer to one by ‘Charles A Rogers’, so maybe they are? They’ll no doubt turn up on Shroud.com eventually. Secondly – from what I can gather of its website, the entire organisation of the the Pasco conference was predicated on two premises – one might almost call them axioms – that the Shroud is the authentic grave cloth of Christ, and that the image was formed by a miraculous process. There was little or no consideration given to the possibility that either of these might be incorrect, and piles of evidence listed in favour of them without any reference to the fact that almost all of it has been, and still is, disputed or rejected by other researchers. Thirdly – to specific points raised by James Bond here. A) I don’t think it is true to say that “The 14 C carbon dating group went into the investigation already determining in their minds that the TS is a fake”. There is little evidence at all for that, and quite a lot to suggest the reverse. One or two of the Oxford team were avowed atheists, but that’s not the same as wanting the Shroud to be a fake. And this: “tossing data that didn’t agree with their preconception of the age” is wholly untrue and without any evidence at all. And later this: “The Arizona data was thrown out because their data was too far outside what they considered the norm to be and just use the other two labs’ data.” This is utterly untrue. Wherever did you get that idea from? I don’t believe that even the most ardent authenticist could have said that – you must have misunderstood. B) This ‘bottom line’ “the image is not a painting or any other medium used to produce a very faint image” is precisely one of those axioms which is hotly disputed. This: “that has to be viewed from a distance to even see any discernible image and the closer you get the image just disappears” is no truer for the shroud than for any other image. Shroud 2.0 is an i Pad app which allows you to investigate the Shroud in huge detail, and distinct features are discernible from a few inches away. “whereas in a painting or photograph the image becomes more distinct the closer you get.” Not at all. It depends very much on the size and style of the painting or the resolution of the photograph. It is very wrong to compare the Shroud’s style to a conventional portrait. Try looking at, say, one of Monet’s waterlily paintings in close up and see if you can guess what it is! “The only reason you can see anything now is that the image is produced with a higher contrast” This is true of most photographs, especially the Enrie ones of 1938. However I have seen the Shroud ‘live’ at the last ostentation, and the image was perfectly visible. C) “All the attempts at copying and trying to reproduce a similar image has failed because paint or some other medium is used not a radiation burn such as is on the cloth.” This is another highly disputable ‘axiom’. It stems from the disagreement between Walter Mc Crone, who claimed to see iron oxide particles on the cloth whose density corresponded to the intensity of the image, and John Heller & Alan Adler, who found almost no iron oxide, and did not attribute what they did find to paint. It is insufficiently realised, especially by those who do not want to realise it, that Mc Crone was examining whole areas of tape, covered with all the debris lifted from the Shroud, including all the pigment particles, whereas Heller and Adler were examining individual fibres extracted from the sticky tape, which had to be washed thoroughly to remove the gum, thereby removing all the paint particles they were subsequently unable to find. It is also not sufficiently realised that the X Ray Fluorescence study of the Shroud carried out in Turin by S Tu RP’s Morris, Schwalbe and London clearly showed a direct correlation between image intensity and iron concentration. D) Next, I’m afraid, is a recitation of another set of axioms, usually touted by authenticists as indisputable facts, but none of which is any such thing. I) The Shroud has some characteristics of a photographic ‘negative’, rather like a wood engraving, or a bas relief rubbing. It is not a true photographic negative unless we assume that Jesus had very blond hair and beard, and that his nose was much lighter in colour than his cheeks. Ii) All images contain 3 D information of one kind or another. When the Shroud is subjected to a computer program which converts intensity to height (such as image J or the infamous VP 8) it looks like a bas relief emerging from a flat base. It does not look like a fully three dimensional body. It only works at all if one makes several assumptions, disputed even among authenticists: the shroud must have been horizontal, the ‘radiation’ must have been vertical and rapidly attenuated in air, and all the different materials of the body (hair, skin, lips, etc.) radiated in exactly the same way. Iii) Anybody who rubs an old fibre tipped pen over a fairly dense cloth will find he makes an image with all the characteristics specified – minimum penetration, no capillarity, only the uppermost surfaces of the threads discoloured, etc. Iiii) It does seem to be true that at least one component of the image, and probably an important one, is a discolouration of the flax fibres themselves, such as caused by a scorch. There is some research being carried out, not least by Colin and myself, as to how these ‘scorches’ can be formed. The two broad avenues are by heat (or radiation), and chemically, such as by acid. Various possibilities were available to medieval artists. However, all attempts to derive such discolouration ‘naturally’ from a dead body seem to have been abandoned in favour of supernatural approach, although a few authenticists still hope that some kind of vaporograph effect, or geological piezo electric effect, are also possible explanations. V) “The conclusion is that an artist or forger could not have produced the bizarre characteristics of the images in any era, either ancient or modern.” That is only the conclusion of those who do not even acknowledge that any research into non supernatural explanations is still being carried out. Vi) On the Shroud the bloodstains from the nail holes are only visible on the back of one hand. Of course they do not show holes in the palms. They are exit wounds. They are, however, consistent with the conventional idea of where the nails went in, although there are several medieval images which are exceptions to the rule. “Where all religious paintings bar none have the nail holes in the hands.” Not quite, there are exceptions. E) Your last comment: “It surely begs the question as to why. No artist has come forth claiming that he/she did it all during the MA era – you would think that one would. There’s no signature on the linen as to who the artist is whereas all painting from that time forward always has the artist’s name or logo or something.” I don’t know where you get that idea from, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. Throughout the Middle Ages individual artists were very rarely recognised, especially ecclesiastical ones. The decoration of a church or palace was largely up to unsung, unrecognised, and now completely unknown ‘craftsmen’ who did a range of things from sculpture to embroidery. Some of the most impressive are now known as by “the Master of…” a place or painting, without any idea of his name. The Shroud was not made for permanent public display, but as part of something else, a ritual, a pilgrimage, a play, or similar, and as such its artist would not have been considered a particularly distinguishable individual. And if, of course, it was made deliberately to be mistaken for the original thing, then of course it wouldn’t be signed!.","date":"2017-07-26","mins":"1:31 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/shroud-scope-8-372-impossible-scourge-marks-surely-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood","title":"Shroud Scope 8: 372 impossible scourge marks (surely?) on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-9834","author":"anonymous","post":"I really thought we could have an adult debate about this; me understanding where you’re coming from and where my ideas lay but what I’ve received lately is just ridicule. In a debate, when personal attacks come you’ve lost the debate. I didn’t ridicule your stance but by your responses (Relics R Us, etc) you’ve turned this transfer of ideas into smarmy attacks. Your scholarship is based purely on ridicule. It takes several weeks if not months to correlate all the information of the Pasco conference to then present it on a website. Your childish responses have no place in a serious technical/scientific debate. I do not know where you get your so called scientific background from and the juvenile website you’re put up in your position on the TS but I think you should take it down and do some real introspection on what scientific debate is all about.

As to one sticking point it’s hard to do. There were so many people with Ph D’s in this and that it was hard to follow at times. There were people from Spain, Italy, France, Australia and a group from China. A lot of it had to do with chemistry and the mathematics. If I had one sticking point it would be image formation and how it could have been done by folks in the MA. The image is not a pigment of any sort nor is there carbonation of the fibers which are microns thick (or thin however you want to look at them) and the discoloration is on the surface of the fibers. The image is barely discernible (again bringing that up) when viewed up close (in fact disappears) and can only be seen from a distance. At the conference they had a replica(?) of the image as it is without contrast enhancement and you simply cannot see it clearly; get close to it like eight inches and the image just becomes a smudge, nothing there. The presenters on Saturday brought up subjects as: Image Formation On The Shroud by Giulio Fanti Chemistry Of The Image Imprinting Process by Jose Carlos Godinez Naturalistic Processes For Image Formation by Mark Antonacci Role Of Information And Radiation In Image Formation by Bob Rucker These plus other papers were presented in an all day seminar on Saturday. By the time 9pm rolled around my brain was like tapioca. There was another presentation by Russ Breault titled: CIS Jerusalem which was more on the theological. If you would like, I have an extra copy of the International Conference on The Shroud of Turin I could send to you. It has all the details of what papers were presented and by whom so if you wanted you could research those presenters.

My point on the R Cdating also goes a little further in that I very rarely hear Shroud defendings using it in defense of the Shroud when it is an important question. That is what bothers me I guess, that it is a good question to ask the skeptics on R Ddating and to hear their response...They seem to believe R Ddating is infallible, and cannot be questioned, even from the more educated of the bunch. Yet 20 some years later it is still being used as 'evidence', truly it is disheartening to see this kind of disillusion.
