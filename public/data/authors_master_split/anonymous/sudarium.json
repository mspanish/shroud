[{"author":"anonymous","post":"Mr. Jones, Thanks so much for your post. I just read your article. I started to study the Shroud after somone found an old article circa 1800's about the Shroud. For the last few weeks I have reviewed many ideas and hope to visit our nations largest store house of info in a few weeks. Having spoke with a research assitant I was told a 20 page document is held at the National Lib. IT's said to be written by an assitant to the pope who did in fact watch while Germans reviewed the shroud during the time of Hitler. I hope to review the document when I visit. However, it's written in German so I have hired somone who speaks german to read the document to me. I'll keep your url link and if I find my info will be helpful I will be happy to send details. God Bless your efforts.","date":"2008-08-25","mins":"10:50 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2007/08/bogus-shroud-of-turin-10-shrouds-blood.html","title":"\nBogus: Shroud of Turin? #10: The Shroud's blood and pollen closely matches the Sudarium of Oviedo's\n"}]
