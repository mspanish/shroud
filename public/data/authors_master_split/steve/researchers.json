[{"id":"comment-197165","author":"steve","post":"A question that has always intrigued me about the Shroud being a painting, is why has no other work by the artist ever surfaced? I mean, what does an artist do all day…and even more so given that this artist was able to paint a perfect photographic negative 100s of years before proof could be established. I wonder how he/she explained that little plus point to their patrons? :).","date":"2015-04-22","mins":"6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/charles-freeman-and-the-huffington-post-caption-writer/","cat":"2015","title":"Charles Freeman and the Huffington Post Caption Writer"}]
