[{"id":"comment-16867","author":"tim_davis","post":"I had asked Mr. P about his efforts here in an email & he posted it above. I went from mildly curious to wildly fascinated. Mostly because I still have no idea why one would invest so much in this area – either way – prove or disprove. Neither can be accomplished and to do would accomplish what? So … this is just a hobby? What is it exactly? Do you hope to try & prove the authenticity? If yes … why? An entire site dedicated to what exactly, regarding the shroud? Honestly, I’m now hung on just trying to grasp the purpose : ) BTW – I would like to point out to Dave B that anything “presumably manufactured” cannot fly in the face of anything. Additionally, the assertion that anything involved here is 100 million yrs old … is literally & can only be “presumed” as any existing science from the geologic timetable to physical dating efforts in a lab cannot prove this; as dating efforts have massive limitations in only going back a couple thousand years & the geo timetable is built completely and necessarily on speculation. I agree in part w/ Shelia that truth & science shall never conflict. Religion & science do so daily. However, I consider myself among the faithful & when God created the earth matters to me & I believe should. You may feel comfortable embracing the earth being a few million years older but it presents massive problems with your ability to gain much (& ultimately possibly anything) from the bible, if you do. If God hung the sun & moon on the 4th day – that established a day as 24 hr increments that remain to this day. It would be completely inconsistent and in fact make no real sense at all if God referred to the first few days in poetic terms of ‘day’ when they were really collections of millennia – only to establish Swiss precision on the 4th day while using the exact same descriptions for his creative process. To Dave B, I share that I am a biblical literalist as scientifically, I must be. There exists no scientific reason to not be so & indeed every reason scientifically to embrace the bible as issued. Meaning, I may dismiss it as nonsense but I am scientifically disallowed buffeting my selections of what truth, I may derive from it. Where clearly conveying literal events … literal. Where analogy … analogy. Poetry … etc. I’m just saying that the coolest aspect of what is purported to be God’s inerrant word, mandates that we recognize it as structured and designed as an information repository. Science determines this. Any other approach to understanding it at all becomes a cloudy virtual pointless exercise in selective literalism, it’s a cool old book w/ religious stuff in it, or similar. Anyway – thoughts? tim.","date":"2012-09-24","mins":"12:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/20/mount-everest-is-only-29000-feet-high/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Mount Everest is only 29,000 feet high"}]
