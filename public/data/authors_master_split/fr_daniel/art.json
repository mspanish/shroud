[{"id":"comment-1520","author":"fr_daniel","post":"The Peter Soons movie (http://vimeo.com/14072737) clearly suggests that an outline was artificially created, perhaps accidentally. The 3 D glasses borrowed from a Shrek DVD makes this obvious. Isabel Piczek, Barrie Schwortz and many others from STURP have made it clear that there are no outlines in the shroud’s image but gradual changes in tone instead. Moreover, John Jackson demonstrated that the image quenches at three to four centimeters depth. That is not so in the 3 D image. If you believe what you see with 3 D glasses on, then Isabel, Barrie and John are wrong. I don’t think so. Thank you for alerting us to this problem..","date":"2010-10-11","mins":"10:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/10/10/troubled-by-the-new-shroud-of-turin-3d-web-site/","cat":"art","title":"Troubled by the New Shroud of Turin 3D Web Site"}]
