There is a mysterious, well documented phenomena in Tibetan Buddhist culture called the Rainbow Body. It is where the bodies of adepts who have achieved a high degree of spiritual awareness simply disappear at death, vanishing in a shower of multi colored light. Hence the name Rainbow Body. Jesus, being fully developed spiritually by following the same ascetic, selfless, compassion laced life style as the Buddhist counterparts, may have attained a Rainbow Body (Resurrection in the Christian tradition.) Typically the Buddhist adept’s body dissolves in seven days. Jesus’ body dissolved in thirty six hours or less. This could point to a higher frequency radiation in the Resurrection than in the Buddhist tradition.
