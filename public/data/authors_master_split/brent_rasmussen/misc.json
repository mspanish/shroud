[{"id":"comment-1768","author":"brent_rasmussen","post":"@Dan Porter – “Atheism, despite how strenuously some Atheists deny it, is a belief about religion; non belief to all except those incapable of logic is belief.” ——— Um, okay. Let’s change things around a bit to illustrate the massive absurdity of your statement: “Baldness, despite how strenuously some bald people deny it, is a color of hair; baldness – to all except those incapable of logic – is exactly the same as having a hair of a certain color.” “Not collecting stamps, despite how strenuously some people who do not collect stamps deny it, is a hobby about stamp collecting; not collecting stamps – to all except those incapable of logic – is exactly the same as collecting stamps.” “The absence of belief in the Loch Ness Monster, despite how strenuously some Nessie deniers deny it, is a belief about a giant, pre historic water dinosaur; The absence of belief in Nessie – to all except those incapable of logic – is exactly the same thing as belief in Nessie.” So, black is white, there is the same as not there, one equals zero, and the absence of a belief is the same as the belief itself. Seriously? And you wonder why we consider folks like you to be delusional?.","date":"2010-11-23","mins":"1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/11/23/pz-myers-is-a-fundy/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"PZ Myers is a Fundy"}]
