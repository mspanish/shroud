Perhaps Fanti’s 95% confidence may be overstated but on the face of it, he has provided yet another basis to question the carbon date. The Hungarian Pray Manuscript proves conclusively that the Shroud was in Constantinople prior to 1204 and thereby proves the carbon date is wrong….couldn’t possibly be from 1260 to 1390. In fact the artist who crafted the HPM was an eye witness to the cloth in Constantinople somewhere between 1160 1170…one hundred years older than the oldest carbon date. So we know the carbon date is wrong. How wrong? No one knows. Fanti adds physical evidence to the argument. Rogers decay of vanillin also supports on older date. Is it first century? We will need another carbon date to know that..","date":"2013-04-06","mins":"8:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/05/a-committee-far-removed-from-padua/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Committee Far Removed from Padua"},{"id":"comment-29492","author":"russ_breault","post":"Yes peer review is needed but MIT and Oxford specifically? We also have to be careful that we are not casting a sheep into a pack of wolves. There are many who would love to discredit the Shroud, who have an anti God world view. Science–yes. Agenda driven science–No. Fanti is accused of this very thing. Yet, most of the scientific community is still hanging on to C 14 as the final arbiter of truth. The review posted yesterday did a good job of questioning Fanti’s samples and methodology–all the reasons why it may be flawed. I also want to hear all the reasons why he may be onto something significant. Is it possible to get that balance?

It just goes to show that there is an element in the world and unfortunately in the church too, that want to humanize Jesus as much as possible.

All the deep things of God are all mysteries. Who can explain the Incarnation–the Word made flesh? Even the resurrection–how does a body just disappear? How does that same body walk on water or pass through a wall? How does one command a storm or feed 5,000 with a boys lunch? The Church may call them miracles but I just call them mysteries. So, if today we discovered a collection of relics associated with Jesus, and one of them was his burial shroud, the cloth that wrapped his bloody crucified body and was impacted by the resurrection event, wouldn’t it be consistent that the cloth itself would also remain a mystery? The fact that the Shroud of Turin remains a mystery, despite thousands of hours of analysis is not proof of authenticity, but it is consistent with the deep things of God, which are all mysteries..","date":"2014-09-13","mins":"8:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/13/mystery-is-never-ever-proof-of-anything/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Mystery is never ever proof of anything"},{"id":"comment-2761","author":"russ_breault","post":"Wow, that is really depressing.

I have always felt the message of the Shroud is past present and future. It is past because it speaks to the empty tomb, or more significantly, the vacant shroud which was the first piece of evidence that something extraordinary occurred. It is present in that the Shroud uniquely displays the price that was paid for our salvation. Scripture uses words like “ransom” that we were “bought” and that we were “purchased” and “redeemed”. What was the price? It is clearly displayed on the Shroud. But it is also future and that enters the realm of the prophetic. And why not, nearly one third of the bible is prophetic in nature. How is the Shroud prophetic? It speaks to a future event. Jesus is called, “the firstfruits of the resurrection.” That implies that whatever happened to Jesus in the tomb is what will happen to all who believe at some point in the future. This is what First Corinthians 15 talks about when Paul says, “Behold I show you a mystery, we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye.” The amazing thing is that Paul is not talking about Jesus in this passage but about the ultimate resurrection of all who believe. There are many such prophecy conferences, this is the only one that has embraced the Shroud and I am glad they did. I hope it opens new doors of discussion. I think the Shroud should be included in paranormal conferences too! Why not…if the Shroud is authentic, then it recorded the greatest paranormal event of all time. Perhaps there are other venues where the Shroud can be discussed. I would love to hear about them..","date":"2013-01-22","mins":"11:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/22/pitn-taking-advantage-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"PITN Taking Advantage of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-40461","author":"russ_breault","post":"I have not checked Wikipedia lately.

This is exactly why I never say that the Shroud is in fact the burial cloth of Jesus. Based on data for and against, assessing the preponderance of evidence, I believe it could be. That is far as I can take it. The Catholic church does not officially call it a relic or an icon, they recognize it as a “symbol of Christ’s suffering worthy of veneration.” I like the use of the word symbol, it forges a middle path. Whether authentic or not, it certainly remains a symbol. However, the word I use is mystery. It is a profound mystery and why not, all the deep things of God are all mysteries anyway. Who can comprehend either the incarnation or the resurrection?

It is not enough to simply claim the cloth is medieval without offering a credible process the alleged artist used to create this masterpiece. We are clearly looking for an artist who predated Leonardo by several hundred years. Charles Freeman has offered the most recent hypothesis but it too fails to explain why the blood penetrated the cloth whereas the paint did not, nor is it credible to assume that every speck of paint used to form the image has now disappeared. Garlaschelli’s attempt was compelling but still does not replicate the fine gradient that correlates with body to cloth distance, nor does it account for no image being under the blood. Contest this point all you want, this was a clear determination of STURP—you know, the scientists who had hands on access to the cloth for five days and nights. I also get annoyed when the cloth’s obvious origin in Constantinople is conveniently ignored so as to allege the history only begins in the 1300’s. This is irresponsible in view of the numerous documents both historical and visual that give strong evidence for the Shroud being stolen in 1204 by the French during the 4th Crusade. Too many unanswered questions for the Shroud to be dismissed as a Medieval fake..","date":"2015-04-23","mins":"7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-9149","author":"russ_breault","post":"I was intrigued and was waiting for his meter to respond…but then he took a break, edited the video and obviously doctored the results…or so it seems.
