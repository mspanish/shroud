He wouldn’t allow Mary to touch him that morning…yet that evening in the upper room everyone touched him. Regarding faith, Jesus made at least six post resurrection appearances specifically to bolster their faith. In fact Acts 1:3 says “After his suffering he showed himself to be alive through many convincing proofs.” Those proofs were the post resurrection appearances…but perhaps the Shroud is left behind as a convincing proof for the generations that would follow…especially this one where knowledge of the Shroud is communicated around the world instantly just like this blog.

It is a biblical principle established in Deuteronomy 19:15 that the truth of a matter is established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. There must be some significance as to why there were no human witnesses to the most important miracle of Christianity. God does not violate his own rules therefore there must be two or three witnesses…and there are! The linen cloth “lying there” was the first piece of evidence that Jesus had risen from the dead. There was also the “napkin” that was about his head folded next to the linen. This we believe is the Sudarium of Oviedo (Spain). And lastly the empty tomb itself–all three are witnesses to Christ’s resurrection today. Any one of them can be seen today, examined today, and venerated for their meaning today. The eye witnesses to his post resurrection appearances are significant but they are all dead–all we have is their written testimony two thousand years later. The Shroud, the Sudarium and the empty tomb all testify today and for all generations and fulfill the mandate laid down in Deuteronomy..","date":"2013-05-23","mins":"6:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/23/a-kind-of-witness/","cat":"event","title":"A kind of witness?"},{"id":"comment-128327","author":"russ_breault","post":"Louis, I like your comment regarding the Resurrection Movement.

For clarification, I always tell audiences that the message of the Shroud is Past, Present and Future. It is past in that it takes us back to the empty tomb–the resurrection seen as a historical event. It is present in that we can see on the shroud today–in the now–the extreme price that was paid for our salvation. It is future in that it represents a future event. Some may dismiss this, but what Paul writes about in 1 Cor 15: 51 53 references a future event…it hasn’t happened yet…but it is exactly what happened to Jesus in the tomb. How can I say that? Because Jesus is also called “the first fruits of the resurrection.” This means that if he is the first fruits…we are the rest of the fruit that follows at a later time. It is exactly the same concept as when the Jewish high priest was in the temple waving the first fruits of the barley harvest asking God’s blessing on the rest of the harvest. It is no accident that when Jesus rose from the dead…it was on the Jewish Feast of First Fruits! So my view is that the shroud is a picture of not just a past event but also a foreshadow of a future event as well. This is how the Shroud fits into a discussion of biblical prophecy..","date":"2014-06-10","mins":"9:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/10/add-to-cart-the-shroud-of-turin-prophecy-package-by-russ-breault/","cat":"lectures","title":"Add to Cart:  The Shroud of Turin Prophecy Package by Russ Breault"},{"id":"comment-213877","author":"russ_breault","post":"Andy, I will get that done. The methodology I mentioned in the PPT slides is primarily related to how Mc Crone analyzed the particles on the mylar tape without removing them from the tape. Mc Crone only found particles that were birefringent–two indexes of refraction indicated the substance was iron oxide. Adler and Heller removed all the particles from the tape fearing the tape would interfere. They found both blood which is non birefringent and they also found iron oxide. Why didn’t Mc Crone find the blood that Heller and Adler found? Because he was sloppy in his methodology.

AND if we can assume that the blood chemistry is correct, ie Adler, Heller and others, that the blood is in fact blood from actual wounds. Then there are two choices, either the shroud is the result of an actual crucifixion or one that was staged. The problem with the staged hypothesis, is that as far as we know, corpses do not make images on linen shrouds. There is nothing else like it in all the museums in the world…only shrouds covered with stains of body decomposition…no images. If it was the result of an actual crucifixion then a simple comparison should reveal the identity. The uniqueness of Christ’s crucifixion are numerous starting with a crown of thorns as a singular mockery as King of the Jews, severe scourging as a last ditch effort by Pilate to release him–he didn’t think he was guilty of a crime worthy of capital punishment–plus he was spooked by his wife’s dream. His legs were not broken and he received a side wound instead because he was already dead when it came time to remove the bodies–consequence of the scourging no doubt. He was given an individual burial even though most who were crucified were thrown into a common grave. He was wrapped in a very expensive linen–one suited for a high priestly garment. All this together would indicate it is probably Jesus. Is it Conclusive? Not by today’s scientific standards—but probably enough to hold up in a courtroom as the “preponderance of evidence”–the burden of proof necessary for a civil trial..","date":"2013-01-26","mins":"11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/25/eric-j-jumper-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Eric J.

We have a choice, do we fill in the gaps with doubt or with faith? It is really a choice we each make. Sure there are gaps in the data with the Shroud. A purely scientific view would conclude that a determination of authenticity can never be achieved…we don’t have the DNA of Jesus to make a definitive match. But my faith tells me it is authentic and I “venerate” it as such. Skepticism is good to a point, but too much of it could rob you of the simplicity of faith. This is exactly why Jesus said unless we have the faith of a little child we cannot enter the Kingdom. There is enough evidence to indicate the Shroud COULD be authentic.
