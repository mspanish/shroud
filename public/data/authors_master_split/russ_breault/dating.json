[{"id":"comment-192490","author":"russ_breault","post":"It is beyond annoying that anyone gets away with saying the first appearance of the Shroud is in the 14th century. A fact for western Europe but totally ignores the clear likelihood the Shroud was stolen from Constantinople in 1204. There was clearly a shroud in Constantinople, it clearly had an image on it with descriptions that match the TS. The HPM clearly links the two cloths with the obvious burn holes. The inconvenient truth is that 1204 is already older than the oldest carbon date of 1260. It doesn’t prove the Shroud is first century but it certainly indicates the carbon date is wrong..","date":"2015-03-05","mins":"8:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"id":"comment-8815","author":"russ_breault","post":"The most rediculous paragraph is the last one. It demonstrates the secular mind set that the Shroud simply cannot be authentic…regardless of any evidence to the contrary: “And of course ‘authenticity’ is not really a scientific issue at all here: even if there were compelling evidence that the shroud was made in first century Palestine, that would not even come close to establishing that the cloth bears the imprint of Christ.”.","date":"2012-02-28","mins":"10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/28/paper-chase-to-know-a-veil-by-philip-ball/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase: To know a veil by Philip Ball"},{"id":"comment-70829","author":"russ_breault","post":"I have known for years about this alleged unauthorized C 14 test that was done circa 1982. My understanding is that one end dated 200 and the other 1000. Two ends of the same thread yielded radically different dates. Now the alleged participants are in denial that said test ever occurred. Since this test supposedly occurred six years before it was formally dated, and if it was a made up story…why concoct a story supposing such disparate dates from a single thread? Why not just claim it dated to first century? That doesn’t pass the smell test. Such aberrant dates from the same sample area that has garnered so much controversy post 1988 seems to be consistent what Rogers determined and published in 2005. Seems to me the test indeed happened but politics has trumped truth telling..","date":"2014-01-01","mins":"9:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/01/for-sure-someone-is-lying-here-talk-about-chumming-the-comment-pool/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"“For Sure Someone is Lying Here” — Talk About Chumming the Comment Pool"}]
