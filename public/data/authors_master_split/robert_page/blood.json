[{"id":"comment-27513","author":"robert_page","post":"The Sudarium was recognized and authenticated by the Spanish Government, The King of Spain on March 14, 1075 to be THE PROPERTY OF JESUS OF NAZARETH. The official historical document would be acceptable evidence in any court of law. It is hardcore evidence the head cloth belongs to Jesus. The Sudarium is not unlike having the dental records of a known person to compare with the remains of a murder victim to make positive ID. In this case it is Jesus Of Nazareth we need to identify. The Sudarium of Oviedo is “the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself” (Now it is wrapped together in a place by itself in Ovideo, Spain) I placed the Sudarium (The Napkin) Over the 3 D Image of The Man In The Shroud in a process similar to the polarized image overlay technique used by The Spanish Center of Sindonolgy (This is also used by forensic detectives in unsolved murder cases to positively identify a victim) FACT: We know the man whose head was wrapped in the Sudarium Of Oviedo was leaned 20 degrees to the right,. Knowing this I chose a 3 D Image of Jesus that was also leaning 20 degrees to the right. So all we need to do is to lay the Sudarium over the head of the Man In the Shroud and see if it matches up. IT DOES! (Not unlike a fingerprint) TRIANGLE SHAPED WOUND ON RIGHT CHEEK…MATCH SWELLING AND BRUISING OF LEFT CHEEK…MATCH 120 POINTS THAT MATCH FROM FRONT TO BACK IDENTICAL FORM OF CHIN (not by coincidence) NOSE IS 8 CM ON BOTH BOTH CONTAIN POLLENS FROM PASSOVER BOTH CONTAIN AB POSITIVE BLOOD WITH BILIRUBIN BOTH CONTAIN POST MORTEM BLOOD BOTH CONTAIN BLOOD WHILE PERSON WAS LIVING BOTH CONTAIN PULMONARY EDEMA FLUID (When the Shroud image is placed over Sudarium you can see where edema fluid is coming from nose and mouth of the Jesus) TRACE AMOUNTS OF MYRRH ON BOTH FABRIC IS SAME THICKNESS ON BOTH FABRIC HAS SAME THREADS PER SURFACE UNIT (The Table Napkin and Table Cloth Go Together) NO EVIDENCE OF DECOMPOSITION (The blood is fresh) BLOOD IS NOT COAGULATED ON BOTH (Indicating violent death) The new seed of doubt being planted by the skeptics is “All blood degrades to type AB” If the above argument was presented to a jury it would immediately be over ruled as speculation, a theory not based in fact, bearing no weight on the case. It can be said “there is still doubt” But is it reasonable doubt? There are cases where unnamed victims have been given a Positive ID, on less than half the evidence presented in this post. We have not even mentioned the blood evidence and heart tissue that appeared during a mass in Italy in the 7th century that also matches The Shroud of Turin and the Head Cloth. We can go on all day long with this and at the end the investigation the forensic detective who has done his/her homework will find himself/herself backed into a corner with only 1 possibility remaining. “The Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus” By process of elimination it cannot be anything else..","date":"2013-03-17","mins":"1:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/14/new-thread-on-type-ab-blood-does-all-old-blood-become-ab/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New thread on type AB blood: Does all old blood become AB?"},{"id":"comment-27514","author":"robert_page","post":"To Ron:I would like to also mention that in the history of the Earth, there has never been a relic/item of historical significance that was officially authenticated from reliable sources as belonging to a certain figure in history that somehow over the course of time became unauthentic without just cause or reason. In this case we are talking about the Spanish Government, The King of Spain in the 10th century authenticated the Sudarium of Ovideo, as the property of Jesus. It is on the record, historical documents that we can hold in our hand and read and know to be genuine. Acceptable evidence in any court of law without question. You cannot come back over 1000 years later and say “No, the documents are not authentic, the head cloth does not belong to Jesus” with absolutely ZERO evidence to support the relic/item is not authentic or belonging to the person the historical record positively connects the item/relic too with unmistakeable clarity. “I hate Jesus” is not going to work in a court of a law as a reason to un authenticate a historical document, signed by a King who successfully ruled for nearly 40 years and was Emperor of Spain, well respected by the people and known for his great wisdom, of sound mind and body. He was known as “EL Bravo” A man of courage and honesty, character traits that are lacking in the people of this day and age. If you had a video taped close up of the head of a skeptic examining that document you would see a vein getting ready to burst, It is hard to deny a genuine demonstrated reality in front of your face, yet somehow the people of this day and age are able to do just that. It all goes back to the original sin of pride. The failure to acknowledge the good works of others, A evil desire to be more important and more attractive than others. Money hoarded for security and not circulated for improvement. Evil desire gives birth to sin and sin gives birth to death. The Man In The Shroud conquered that. Love is eternal, more powerful than death. May that eternal gift of love be yours..","date":"2013-03-17","mins":"2:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/14/new-thread-on-type-ab-blood-does-all-old-blood-become-ab/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New thread on type AB blood: Does all old blood become AB?"}]
