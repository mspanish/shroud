Yannick, You’re absolutely right that the Shroud could never be proven to be the Shroud of Christ; as we probably all know Science doesn’t actually ‘prove’ anything but is an epistomology of measurement and recording. It disproves other explanations, but it never proves a certain one. My only issue is when I see this: “If we could prove our faith, then faith would not be faith no more !” I don’t get this. Belief that Christ rose doesn’t necessarily mean I have faith in Christ. Paul said that all are without excuse in believing that there is a God, but he talks about faith — the trust and love in God — separately. I largely agree with your post and will admit that perhaps I wanted too much out of it. I still don’t think it’s wrong to present it to others though at the very least as a possible justification for belief. I.e., Dawkins can’t go telling me irrational if I show him the Shroud as what led me to belief. If still, I know that I could never use it as proof — it would simply be a piece of a much larger puzzle. One last thing. You said: “And, what’s the best about the Shroud, it forces some to reconsider what they really believe. That’s a very good thing.” I completely agree..","date":"2011-07-29","mins":"6:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/more-on-crazy-talk-are-atheists-biased-or-just-uninformed/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on Crazy Talk: Are Atheists biased or just uninformed?"},{"id":"comment-13136","author":"nick","post":"I largely agree with daveb on this one: science denying, self righteous fundamentalism has done horrors for all of Christendom (it was a large reason I was an atheist for so long). No sensible person is going to deny the age of the earth or evolution. As with priests, I also agree since I’m Eastern Orthodox and our priests can be married. I know many Roman Catholics who want to see this happen, and I guarantee you there would be a great increase of men who would respond to such a vocation..","date":"2012-06-28","mins":"9:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/28/almost-a-third-of-adults-under-30-doubt-existence-of-god/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Almost a Third of Adults Under 30 Doubt Existence of God"},{"id":"comment-3484","author":"nick","post":"Yannick, One last thing. Could you provide me a link or a source to where you got these conclusions: “…the body left the cloth without any visible and tangible signs of this disappearance (specially regarding the state of the blood stains). Till this day, science isn’t able to fully explain why the blood stains are in so good condition for a gravecloth who once envelop a corpse (we are pretty sure of this now) for a short time and after this time (less than 48 hours), this corpse left the cloth and didn’t corrupt there” I ask this because Robert Wilcox’s book makes it seem like Vignon was able to reproduce the blood clot images even though he did this by a tearing mechanism.
