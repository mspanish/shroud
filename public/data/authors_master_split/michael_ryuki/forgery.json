I just sent him the answer you gave me, but I’m sure he is going to ask proofs like scientific papers, and even if I bring him those proofs he will still keep his position. This guy is a lost cause. Thanks anyway for the reply and for your great work..","date":"2016-10-18","mins":"10:02 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"id":"comment-7955","author":"michael_ryuki","post":"Hi Colin, I’m arguing with a guy who says that the image left on the shroud is 300 nm thick and that it is not reproductible (I know he means it’s miraculous but don’t want to use the word to not sound stupid). He got this dea from Dilazzaro articles. I know he is wrong and that the Turin Shroud is a scam. I shown him every aspect to prove him wrong but he sticks to the idea that the 300 nm thickness is the absolute proof that the Turin is not fake or special. Do you have anything I could throw him back so he would stop spreading stupidities..","date":"2016-10-17","mins":"4:52 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"}]
