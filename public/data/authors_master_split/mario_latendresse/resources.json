I saw it several times and took several pictures of the Shroud you can see at sindonology.org. In the dark with a reduced amount of light you can prominently see the bloodstains and the image. The descriptions I read from the past centuries correspond to what I saw on the Shroud and that I still can see on these photos. The bloodstains are vivid, the images are prominent. I invite you, and the readers of this blog, to look at several of the photos taken at the 2010 Ostension, accessible at http://www.sindonology.org (http://goo.gl/FE Xp FF) (you can enlarge these photos by clicking on them). In particular, please look at the close ups such as the back http://goo.gl/FE Xp FF. What is so different from what we see on these photos and the descriptions of past centuries?

Charles, with all respect, you are not writing with precision. You wrote such a sentence as “Only when we have all the depictions can we begin to make a final assessment.” Notice that this sentence says “we”, then “begin” and then “make a final assessment”. That means that you have made no final assessment on the points you mentioned (e.g., loincloth, the Shroud lost paints so that the crow of thorns is no longer visible, and more). Right or not? But, you did write, in your History Today article, definite statements about the disappearance, on the Shroud, of various images (e.g., loincloth). Right or not? Perhaps, what you are saying is that that you are suggesting these possibilities. But your article does not say that at all, it states that these are proven. You wrote “What does it matter if there was a loincloth added or not?” I point out the loincloth because you mention it extensively in your article of an image that would have been painted over on the Shroud and then disappeared (erase or not intentionally). You made definite statements about these, but there is absolutely no proof of these statements. Do you understand that? No proof? This repeated suggestion, I insist on “suggestion”, that major amount of paint (or gesso) disappeared from the Shroud is speculation. There is no physical proof of that. Simply look at high definition photos of the Shroud and the photomicrographs. You are aware that they are readily accessible on the web, see for example the following http://goo.gl/93 Pp7t. You have many such photomicrographs available and none show any gesso or paint left. Then you have the simple observation that for 400 years there was a backing cloth for the Shroud (so that backing cloth was there during the last 4 centuries covering the period these images would have disappeared according to you), removed in 2002. Did we find any substantial amount of paint in the backing cloth? No. Therefore, any statement saying that major amount of paint disappear from the Shroud has to be explained. How did it happen? Take another example of statement without proof you made in your article (still related to the loincloth): “I have explained how Carlo Borromeo (and/or Francesco Lamberti) had insisted that the nakedness of the man on the Shroud should be painted over with a loincloth.” Note the word “insisted”. Did you prove that statement in your article? Did you reference any document proving this statement? I see no reference or proof in your article related to that statement.

Can you explain how such quantification could be done? Your hypothesis that gesso was used on the Shroud is as mysterious as the entire Shroud story itself. It would take a miracle to have this gesso disappear without obvious visible traces on the Shroud. As you know, gesso is glue like. It is used to fill the interstices between the threads. Also, a backing cloth was present without interruption for 400 years attached to the Shroud. It was removed in 2002 and no visible such material was found on the backing cloth, which should have received some of it if some add detached from the Shroud. Can you explain how all this gesso would leave no visible traces on the Shroud? Have you attempted of applying gesso on cloth, then try to remove it such that no visible (microscopic) traces is left? All of this without any traces on the back side of the cloth?

It contradicts the notion that it can only covers the outer fibrils of the threads. Again, the fibrils between the threads are not even damaged or colored in most places when looking at the photomicrographs. Simply look at the photomicropraphs. You cannot ignored them. “Once the surface of the Shroud came under pressure , the gesso would have fallen outwards not inwards.” For centuries, the Shroud was folded or rolled, so the image surface was inside the cloth. It was not kept flat for centuries. “As you will know STURP specifically said that they had not examined any medieval linen paintings so they had nothing to go on. This was an extraordinary omission. If they had bothered to do some basic research on painted linens before they set out to Turin they would have been in a much stronger position to make credible claims about painting.” This is irrelevant: we have scientific data, photomicrographs, and more from STURP and from other sources. This data cannot be ignored. “I am working hard to involve more specialists such as the professor ment Ioned above. I don’ t know of any Shroudies with the relevant expertise in so many areas of research I am interested in.” I do not know which professor you are referring to.

It is very similar to L’Histoire, the French counter part. The major problem of this article is that you used erroneous arguments (e.g., expected physical appearances of what the real Shroud image should be, faulty physical measurements confusing length of images vs length of bodies) to try to disprove the Shroud as inauthentic. The same thing happened in the magazine L’Histoire, but I must say that Andrea Nicoletti was much more careful about physics when he was interviewed by L’Histoire: he was mute about it.

But we have no other examples to compare to! He assumes that things should appear in a certain way as he expects them. But this is a circular reasoning: If you say “I expect that the image coming from a dead body would look like X” but cannot provide other examples of such image formation then you are assuming your conclusion. Here are the list of supposed qualities we should see if Christ had left his image on a shroud: 1) “A cloth laid on a body would pick up its contours, but there is no sign of this.” So we know that a body that leaves an image MUST do that? Charles has an example to show? 2) “Then again the heads do not meet, suggesting that this was not a cloth that was ever folded over an actual head.” Well, that’s not a problem since the contours are not shown. Charles did not see that observation 1 implies 2. There is no top of head shown (no contour), therefore the “two heads” should not touch. May be the artist was a bit more clever than Charles realized. The “artist” was completely consistent. And then the list of presumed “errors”, if the Shroud had an image coming from a real body, but without supporting these claims with any measurements: 1) “Again, the hair of the body would have fallen back if the figure had been lying down but the blood is as if it is trickling down the hair of a standing figure.” Well, what about somebody who had been standing up while being beaten: would the blood flow down, side ways, or up? Down appears to be the case. And did Charles note that the hair is away from the face as depicted on the Shroud, which is consistent with the fact that the cloth reached the hair as the cloth goes down towards the ground: the gap is proportional to the vertical distance from the cheek to the hair. The gap is consistent with the hair being lower than the cheek. 2) “If you lie on the ground and place your elbows in the same position as those on the back image of the Shroud, you can quickly see that it is impossible to hold the position of the crossed arms in the front.” Sorry, I cannot quickly see that. Any measurements that could be given to prove that point? 3) “There is a difference of seven centimetres between the lengths of the two bodies.” Is it “lengths of the two bodies” or the lengths of the two images such that no consideration is given about the cloth placement, the feet not completely visible and so on? Where are the measurements? I guess this is too complicated to give? Yes, it is complicated. So simply stating some differences in lengths of images prove nothing.

For the Shroud of Cadouin, you have a summary of the expositions provided at http://www.amisdecadouin.com/le saint suaire de cadouin/ with references. Between 1392 and 1455, the shroud of Cadouin is not exposed in Cadouin but in Toulouse. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the number of pilgrims to the expositions is going down to the point that there were no expositions between 1797 and 1866. In 1866, when the pilgrimage was reinstated, the number of pilgrims at Cadouin was estimated at 6000. After that it appears to go down (in the 1920s there is small procession in the city) until it is stopped in 1932 because it was found to be clearly inauthentic. This is the only number I have seen published and it is quite inferior to the number of pilgrims to the Shroud of Besançon, estimated at several ten of thousands at some point.

But my aim is definitely not to make you upset. I think my approach is fair in the following way. Yes, I learned late December 2014 that the manuscript 826 is available online from the Memoire Vive website. We had some exchanges of details about your upcoming publication and I learned that you were about to publish a book about that manuscript. Clearly, the book was not yet published back then. Of course, I had no access to the transcription you have done but I was aware that you transcribed it, yet, had not been published. I knew the book was about to be made available late February or early March. I did not know you paid for having that manuscript scanned. The Memoire Vive website have some (light) copyright claim on that scanned. I contacted them about the possibility of using a reproduction of one page of that manuscript in my book, and their answer was that it was free to do so as long as I mentioned the provenance of that image. But, it turned out that I decided not to use that image in my book. How much did it cost to have it scanned? I am even ready to pay you part of it. Yes, your book has 194 pages. So I expect, given your expertise and time taken to work on it, deep comments in your book. I trust your expertise and I am very eager to read your book about that manuscript. In my book I state that your book is about to be published. On my website (www.sindonology.org)) I do the same. I even just added a link to your page on Academia to the order form of your book. I am promoting your book! When I use the term “not published yet” for that manuscript (more precisely the first dissertation of that manuscript), it means that no clear printed version of the manuscript was available to the public. I think this is a fair definition. What I want to make clear to any reader of my book, is that I transcribed the first dissertation of that manuscript myself and not based on any other transcription. This is restated on the description on the back page of my book, and inside of the book. This is the main aim of stating “version inédite” and states that the transcription was never published before. It is true that you transcribed it before me, and you can definitely claim so, but it was not published when I transcribed it in my book. I think this is a fair description. The main aim is that this transcription should become available in an book form for everybody to read. This is my aim. And it will be at a very affordable cost. I hope you understand my point of view. And again, if you paid for the scanned, I am ready to pay for a part of it. I have not stolen any idea or information that you have provided.

Second, you are very upset (furious as you wrote) about my statement of stating that my work was not based on any further transcription. This is what I wrote in my book. I state that the transcription is “inédite” and I further explain that it was not published before so that the transcription of the first dissertation is totally based on a transcription I did directly from the manuscript put online. Of course, all due references are made to that manuscript online. Third, you keep writing that you paid to have the manuscript scanned. But Memoire Vive claims total copyright of these scanned images. I contacted them and they never mentioned you as having paid or help paid for the scanning of that manuscript. So, Memoire Vive does not record or state that you have any right on that online, so you should not behave as if there is some restriction, beyond the legal ownership of Memoire Vive, to use that online document. Fourth, you have not read my book yet and keep making many suppositions about its content. It has commentaries about the manuscript. Probably not as much as you wrote, but hopefully put in the write context. I do not comment on your book because I have not read it yet. Fifth, you never mentioned in the presentation of your book that the second dissertation of that manuscript has been published before. Twice actually. I am clear about that right up front (from the back page of my book) and the description of my book so that the reader is aware of that part of the manuscript is already available somewhere. I think the presentation of your book is misleading on that matter. Sixth, I did modernize the French language of both dissertations for reasons explained in the book. But a scholar can still refer to the online manuscript because every folio is referenced in my transcription. I even intend to make an ebook version where the reader can click a link and see the corresponding scanned image on Memoire Vive of the transcription in my book. Besides, this is 18th century French, not medieval, so the original French text is not that far from modern French. Finally, I repeat partly what I have already written to you : you can claim to have first transcribed completely the manuscript. I am not claiming that, that would be a foolish claim. Many people may have transcribed it before and that we are not aware of it. This is not so important anyway. I think you are making a huge fuss about that.

See paper http://sindonology.org/papers/latendresse2005a.pdf There is no need for a tight wrapping to explain the bloodstains in the facial area: Lavoie did not present any argument that such bloodstains cannot have been transferred from the hair and I do not see how such an argument can be made. As for the bloodstain near the elbow, it can be explained by the blood dropping from the elbow towards the ground and forming the blood line and droplet stain we see on the Shroud. Hugh Farey wrote: “This dichotomy is one of the biggest objections to a natural origin for the Shroud as we know it. Explaining it satisfactorily is possibly the holy grail of the authenticist viewpoint…” I think this is explainable along the line of the paper cited above..","date":"2014-06-18","mins":"12:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/16/clarification-of-the-stochastic-process-paper/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Clarification of the Stochastic Process Paper"},{"id":"comment-145567","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"If indeed “there`s a lot of people who thinks Mc Crone`s word is “sacred”.” according to this reader from Costa Rica, I think you only need to refer to Mc Crone’s own published work to show that he was completely unconvincing.

He certainly has not proven that the Shroud is a painting by what he published in it, a claim he upheld until his death. I’ll end by one of the many blunders one can find in his book. On page 191 one can read: “I have found a number of art experts who are scientific enough to agree with me (see p. 289).” On page 289, what you can mainly read is the reproduction of a postcard: “Old man Walter C. Mc Crone is an incompetent Senile Old FART who belongs in the Nut House. That old fraud Fudges data and misinterprets on an unprecedented scale. Citizens for scientific honesty”.

See for example the water stains photomicrographs at http://www.sindonology.org/photomicrographs.shtml There is even some large areas darkened by water that appears to have carry charred linen. Yes, I agree that a water stain moves microscopic materials by capillarity and that it could make some part “cleaner”, but the other case also occurs (move dirt from one part to another) and they do occur on the Shroud. The main issue on the Shroud is that water has moved some of the charred material onto the cloth over the image. Moon’s paper never states that the image was removed or dissolved by water. I do not see that anywhere in the paper. What is clearly stated, at least twice, is that the water stains obscure the image and in some cases from carbon (charred material) that drifted from the burned area. I agree to that. Take one of the elbow, for example: it is obscured by a water stain. But I disagree that the front feet were more visible before 1534, because the current image of the front feet is compatible with the toes of one foot pointing upward such that you could not see the side of the toes and most of the foot. And, as pointed out by others, the artistic rendering of the Lier copy cannot be taken to support the claim that the foot was once more visible because the artist may have added the appearance of the front feet to its copy. And note that Pam Moon was careful to write that the artist could have added that detail. In summary: water stains obscure some image areas and that can readily been observed by looking at high definition photographs of the Shroud or some of the Evans’ photomicrographs. Using the Lier copy to prove that claim, obscures (sorry for the pun!) the claim..","date":"2014-05-18","mins":"1:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/17/paper-chase-the-effects-of-douse-water/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase:  The Effects of Douse Water"},{"id":"comment-32981","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Barrie, this was a very nice talk.

How does homogeneity of the image make it in favor of a medieval creation? Or perhaps it is ” the homogeneity of the image is one of the arguments in favour of a human creation”?

I presented the “hovering” 2 position theory. Dr Jackson’s “fall through theory” through a mechanically transparent body also requires some tautness in the cloth for a high resolution photograph affect therefore 2 positions. You have not mentioned the 2 position theory so you must not accept it. It is necessary for both theories of radiation image formation fall through or hovering. This is all conjecture but working backward from the facts of the image in all its totality of characteristics, it is my opinion that the hovering is the most plausible of all theories and the “fall through” second. [..]Where is the contradiction now?[..]It is what I call the “best guess” theory. ” With all due respect to Dame Piczek, Dr. Lavoie, and Dr. Jackson: these theories are highly speculative for no reason whatsoever. Dame Piczek has never presented any measurements or well founded geometric argument to support her “tightly taut” theory. She uses her artistic intuition to support this theory. Is artistry the way to approach such a complex subject? Dr. Lavoie made many interesting observations about the bloodstains in relation to the image. But there are major contradictions as part of them based on simple geometric reasoning regarding the two position cloth theories (in a few words, the two position cloth theories imply that there would be incoherence between the bloodstains and the image due to the vertical shift, a point on which Dr. Lavoie has never addressed because he focused on the hotizontal shift.). Dr. Jackson theory of the the cloth falling through a “mechanically transparent body” has no numerical foundation. You have to look for the simplest explanation possible that explains the facts (Remember Einstein’s statement here, the modern statement of Ocam’s razor principle). And the simplest one is that there is only one position. I invite you to read a paper I presented at the 2005 Dallas conference.

Notice that the 3 D reconstruction puts some of the bloodstains in the hair, not on the cheeks as proposed by Lavoie. That makes sense. Also, during the 3 D reconstruction process, bloodstains was clearly identified in the mustache and beard. That puts a dent in the theory of a double superficial image in that area by Fanti. Double superficiality implies that no part of what we see on one side soaked on the other side, this is not the case for blood thinly spread in the mustache and beard as shown in this documentary..","date":"2011-11-19","mins":"9:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/19/the-real-face-of-jesus-on-kindle-fire/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Real Face of Jesus on Kindle Fire"},{"id":"comment-5518","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Dear David, what kind of medicine is Dr. Silverman practicing? I have attended his presentation at the Frascati meeting in 2010 and I have listened to this interview. I am baffled by the connections (if any) he is making between the Shroud and the physic he is describing. He does mention many other researchers’ findings (Lavoie comes to mind), but I do not see what he is bringing new as precise physic descriptions related to the Shroud. As for his descriptions of time vs mind and space, I think they are simply plays on words and basic concepts of the Special Theory of Relativity. His description of Quantum Mechanics vs consciousness is quite unrelated to the Shroud and is more baffling than enlightening, not to mention that he is giving a typical discourse of extrapolating the meaning of Quantum Mechanics in domains that were never intended for it. I do not see how his descriptions on consciousness/mind/body/time is related to the Shroud besides perhaps as a pastoral methodology, but I very much doubt it.

Where are the measurements? What theory of image formation are you basing your statement that the contour of the body MUST appear?
