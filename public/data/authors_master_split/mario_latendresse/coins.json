[{"id":"comment-21709","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Bonjour Cazab, mes meilleurs voeux pour cette nouvelle année. What I meant for the “tendency to increase”: If the surface of the sections (from the back side) are small, it becomes easier to find corresponding look alike sections on the front side. For example, if a small section of 10 pixels by 10 pixels is selected to represent the tip of the nose from the back surface, the very bright spot that is visible can be selected, then a similar section on the front surface can be selected where the nose is. Also, the tendency to increase would apply for one specific photograph that was used to find a maximum match, not necessarily for all of them. This is the case for the first column of Table 1. As I wrote in the previous comment, it depends on the matching process used. But they had lots of freedom in the way to search given several small sections. Obviously, by taking the entire face, you are then quite restricted in your matching process since you can only search once. This is what should have been done, but apparently this was not done that way which is very surprising. Note that the paper of Fanti and Maggiolo does not explain how the matching was done which opens up all kind of possibilities from which I selected one, namely by independently searching each section. Not to have explained this process and not providing the locations and sizes of these sections are major missing parts of this study..","date":"2013-01-07","mins":"12:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-21676","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Unfortunately, Table 1 lists eight image sections that are not described in sizes and locations. Some of these sections appear to have small surface (e.g., eyes, nose tip) which has a tendency to increases the score S (depending on how the matching process was done, which is not even described in Fanti and Maggiolo’s paper). Moreover, the matching process of each section appears to have done independently of each other and by searching for a maximum match. This whole process cannot be reproduced and is dubious. Please, see http://www.sindonology.org/reviews/double Superficiality.shtml for more details. Indeed, it is likely that the authors of the ENEA paper could only do a global score S for the entire face since, due to a lack of details for the image sections and matching process, there was no way for them to reproduce the results of Table 1..","date":"2013-01-06","mins":"7:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin"}]
