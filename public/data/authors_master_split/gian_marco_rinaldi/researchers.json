[{"id":"comment-57266","author":"gian_marco_rinaldi","post":"Fanti has compared, on one side, Shroud fibres from the debris collected by aspiration by Riggi in 1978, and, on the other side, control fibres freshly extracted from integer threads. I stressed this point in my critical note that Dan posted here on 4 April in the English translation provided by Hugh: https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/a critical review of giulio fantis new book unreliable results because of inadequacy of methods/ I quote from that translation: “We can assume that any fibers of the Shroud collected from the vacuum extractor had deteriorated more than the fibers still enclosed in the threads. Fibers have, in the course of time, detached from the back of the Shroud and become trapped inside the cavity between the cloths, but those that have would be either weaker or more damaged than those which remained in the threads. For example they could be fibers that originally came from areas of stitching or burning or soaking in water or any other places that had suffered damage for some reason. “In addition to the fibers that had already become detached in the past, Riggi’s vacuum cleaner could have detached others while it was working, and those fibres, too, would be weaker or more damaged than those which remained. Fanti’s material is thus shown to be unrepresentative in being particularly deteriorated, so it is no wonder that the age he calculated is more apparent than real.” Fanti did not address this point in his reply to me. The situation is not better if one reads the recent article by Fanti and Malfi: http://www.aimetatorino2013.it/cdrom/cdrom pdf fullpaper/001200008502.pdf In section 4.2 they write: “Eight different TS fibers have been recognized as such by the first author among others using a petrographic microscope and a particular technique based on cross polarization. TS fibers in fact present a greater number of transversal defects (kink bands) than other more recent flax fibers and it is therefore relatively easy to detect them.” These “kink bands”, if I understand well, are twists or bends that denote a weak or deteriorated fibre. One is led to suppose that Fanti for his test has selected the most deteriorated fibres from the Riggi debris!.","date":"2013-12-08","mins":"12:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/revisiting-fantis-dating-methods/","cat":"science","title":"Revisiting Giulio Fanti’s Dating Methods"},{"id":"comment-57274","author":"gian_marco_rinaldi","post":"For O.K.

Some photos are printed in the tables on pp. 379 384. In the previous pages 370 378 there are many SEM photos of pollen grains as illustrations of the article by Frei on p. 191. Also these photos were taken by Morano in a hospital of Vercelli. While the photos with the article of Morano are (supposedly) really from Shroud material, it would seem that the photos of pollen grains with the article of Frei are of fresh grains from herbariums or directly from flowers..","date":"2013-12-24","mins":"1:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/02/a-sturp-sequel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A STURP Sequel?"}]
