One has also to consider that the amount of cotton incorporated in a thread during spinning might vary irregularly from thread to thread. Perhaps one thread was spun in a room where also cotton was spun or was anyhow present, while another thread was spun in a room where cotton was absent. Even for spinning within the same room, according to circumstances, two threads (or two segments of the same thread) might contain different amounts of cotton. Therefore it is not sufficient to compare one or a few spots. It is necessary to statistically compare a sufficiently high number of spots.

The paper is available here: https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1051/1056 They say: “The graphite powder is collected, weighed, and ca 1 mg (if available) is pressed into a standard target holder for accelerator 14 C analysis. […] Samples as small as 0.3 mg have been successfully analyzed.” The amount of carbon (graphite) in a textile sample should be about 25%. We do not know the amount of textile weight that was lost during pretreatment. It depends on the conditions of the textile and the cleaning method. Let us suppose that (at least) 5 mg of textile are needed for a graphite pellet of 1 mg. The Arizona lab used 8 pellets (four pairs). This would amount to 40 mg of textile. If they used only two subsamples (14.72 mg and 11.83 mg) the total amount was 26.55 mg. Therefore each graphite pellet was well below 1 mg. At the 1986 Turin workshop (according to Gove in his book) the representatives of the laboratories were asked how much (pure) carbon they needed. The AMS labs answered with a figure between 1 and 5 mg. On the other hand, still to day the laboratories request a rather large amount of textile for the samples they receive. For example one laboratory indicates 20 50 mg. Another laboratory indicates 15 mg. Probably the labs prefer to work with abundant material, especially because archaeological samples may often be in bad conditions and suffer a rather large loss during pretreatment.

Other images are from minute 11.30. In all these photos, the warp threads run horizontally, as can be deduced from the inclination of the diagonals of the herringbone twill. From these photos it is easy to count the warp and weft threads. From the bar equivalent to 1 mm as shown with the first two photos, we may estimate that the dimensions of the rectangle are about 6 by 8/9 mm. Then it is easy to verify that the numbers of warp and weft threads per centimeter are just those to be expected from the known measurements by Vercelli and others. The values as given by Freer and Jull are completely wrong. Probably they have mistaken the warp for the weft. This is a serious mistake because it is well known that in the Shroud (and also, as a rule, in most ancient textiles) the warp threads are more dense than the weft threads. This is also immediately evident if only one looks at the inclination of the herringbone diagonals, which form an angle of less than 45 degrees with the warp direction. Miss Freer (or Mrs Freer Waters after her recent marriage) did this work in 2008 while she was at the Museum with a one year fellowship. She was very young (you may see her photo in the same video at minute 00.24) and had just earned a MS in 2007 from the University of Rhode Island.
