[{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Antero>Once more on behalf of Centro Português de Sindonologia I congratulate Dr. Stephen Jones for this excellent new post.Thanks. But again I am just plain \"Mr\".>If this website did not exist honest Shroud researchers would have an hard time to get such important scientific data.I believe that Jesus, the Man on the Shroud, has called me to this work in these last days (2 Tim 3:1; 2 Pet 3:3) before he returns. And that my whole 70 year life has been a preparation for it. >As a medical doctor I understand the importance of such findings because an elevated blood creatinine value means among several pathological situations, either renal failure or severe muscle trauma, two conditions Jesus endured in His ordeal, and besides Ferritin nanoparticles being wrapped by Creatinin means that the «painting theory» is bogus.Thanks for that medical confirmation.>And besides even if desperate anti authenticity guys state that a clever forger painted the blood on the Shroud that had been taken from a tortured man I recall at least two differences from the real Shroud:>>Neither Image nor bloodstains could have been painted because Shroud researchers Don Lynn and Jean Lorre studied them with FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and obtained an isotropic pattern which precludes painting as a method of obtaining Image and Bloodstains.Agreed. See my \"Non directional #17: The man on the Shroud: The evidence is overwhelming that the Turin Shroud is authentic!\" >The classical FACT: There is no Image under Bloodstain(How would an hypothetical clever forger overtake this difficulty????)That will be a topic, \"Blood before image and clots intact #24,\" of my next post in my \"The evidence is overwhelming that the Turin Shroud is authentic!\" series.That \"difficulty\" and many (perhaps hundreds) more! In my series, \"The evidence is overwhelming that the Turin Shroud is authentic!\" I am collecting all the problems of the forgery theory, which I will eventually present in a post by that name, \"Problems of the Forgery Theory.\" There will also be a chapter of that name in my book, \"The Shroud of Turin: The Burial Sheet of Jesus!\" (see 02 Jun17 and 06 Jul17).>I'm eaggerly waiting for your next update Thanks for your interest. I have one more installment of this post to publish which will be today. Then tomorrow I hope to start on \"Chronology of the Turin Shroud: Eleventh century\">warmest regards>Antero de Frias Moreira( Centro Português de Sindonologia)Regards,Stephen E. Jones MY POLICIES.
