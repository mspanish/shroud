[{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"The Deuce>I don't get Porter's point. *Obviously* the square isn't strong evidence for the Shroud's authenticity all by itself, and could be discounted as a strange but not too extraordinary coincidence in isolation, but nobody has ever suggested taking it in isolation in the first place. Exactly. Anti authenticists make the fundamental mistake of thinking that if they can find an apparent problem with ONE part of the Shroud then they have disproved ALL of it. But as I pointed out in a recent comment: It is a fallacy to think that the authenticity of the Shroud stands or falls on ONE feature alone. Shroud sceptics (i.e. True believers in the Shroud's NON authenticity) typically take pot shots at individual features of the Shroud, and if they THINK that they have won on ONE individual point, they can declare victory for the forgery theory.But what the Shroud sceptics need to do is propose a COMPREHENSIVE AND INTERNALLY CONSISTENT forgery theory, which:1) POSITIVELY explains plausibly how the image on the Shroud was formed in a way that is inconsistent with the Shroud's authenticity, including not only HOW the image was formed, but WHEN it was formed, and WHO formed it;and2) NEGATIVELY plausibly explains away ALL the evidence for the Shroud's authenticity.That there is NO such comprehensive and internally consistent forgery theory, is itself evidence that the Shroud is NOT a forgery. In my \"The Shroud of Turin\" series, I am collecting problems of the forgery theory which I will eventually post as \"Problems of the forgery theory.\" Then it will be seen that the problems of the Shroud authenticity theory are NOTHING compared to the problems of the forgery theory. What the anti authenticists need to do is compare the TOTAL pro authenticist general theory/model against a TOTAL anti authenticist general theory/model. Then they would see that the pro authenticist general theory/model has FAR less problems than the anti authenticist general theory/model. A comprehensive and internally consistent pro authenticists general theory/model could be collated from Ian Wilson's writings. But its counterpart could not be collated from any anti authentists writings.There is NO anti authenticist general theory/model and and anti authenticist sub theories contradict each other and no one sub theory has won the majority support of most anti authenticists. Unscrupulous anti authenticists like Joe Nickell argue for BOTH the painting theory: \"In fact, there is no mention of this particular `shroud' for some thirteen centuries; then a respected bishop reportedly uncovered an artist who confessed to having created it. In a letter of 1389 to Pope Clement VII, Bishop Pierre d'Arcis reported on an earlier investigation ... D'Arcis continued, speaking of the earlier bishop who conducted the investigation: Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed\" (Nickell, J., 1993, \"Looking for a Miracle,\" pp.25 26.

The technique involved wet molding cloth to a bas relief (used instead of a fully [28] three dimensional statue to minimize distortion), allowing it to dry, then rubbing on powdered pigment using a dauber much as one would make a rubbing from a gravestone. This technique automatically yields 'negative' images (or rather, just like the shroud, quasi negative images, since the hair and beard are the opposite of what would be expected). It also produces numerous other shroudlike features, including minimal depth of penetration into the threads, encoded `3 D' information, and other similarities, some of which specifically pointed to some form of imprinting technique. \"(Nickell, 1993, pp.27 28). When they are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. The evidence FOR one is evidence AGAINST the other.>Obviously the point of the Vignon markings argument is that lots of odd little coincidences, which wouldn't be all that significant in the absence of the others, add up together and reinforce each other, in combination with all the other evidence for the Shroud's authenticity.That is precisely the point! Porter (who from memory) is just an ex businessman with no relevant qualifications, and doesn't seem to have read many Shroud books, can't understand (or doesn't want to) this and other elementary points.>Particularly for someone who already believes the Shroud's authenticity on other grounds, or even strongly suspects it, the neatest explanation for these coincidences would be that they're based on the Shroud itself.Agreed. But Porter claims that he still believes in the Shroud's authenticity. But if he did, then he would presumably (unless he thinks the Shroud was hidden from the 1st century and next turned up in mid 14th century France) accept that Byzantine artists would have been able to see and copy the face on the Shroud for nearly seven centuries, in Edessa from the 6th 10th century and then in Constantinople from the 10th to early 13th century. If so, then why does Porter reject the simplest explanation (as per Ockham's Razor) that the 15 oddities which are on the face of the Shroud, some of which are physical flaws and creases in the cloth not part of the image itself, and are ALL 15 are found on various Byzantine depictions of Jesus' face (up to 13 on some of them) from the 6th to the 13th centuries?The answer can only be, absent Porter stating what evidence DOES persuade him that the Shroud is authentic, is that Porter is NOT TELLING THE TRUTH (at least to himself), that he actually has become a Shroud ANTI authenticist. That is OK. Porter can be an anti authenticist if that's how he sees (or wants to see) the evidence. But Porter should come clean and not hide behind his weasel words: \"Is the Shroud real? Probably.

In fact, it's logically impossible for there to EVER be a theory on how the most prominent features, like the photo negativity and 200nm depth of the image, were formed, since those things were completely unknown at the time of the supposed forgery, and couldn't be detected or known until hundreds of years later.That's why if an anti authenticist ever started a comprehensive and internally consistent forgery theory, he/she would have quietly given up.>So there can never be a Shroud forgery theory. At best there can be a \"How some guy forged an elaborate image on a cloth, and ended up producing all these amazing puzzling features he couldn't see or know about completely by accident.\"That is actually the position of one of the commenters on Porter's blog, Hugh Farey, the new Editor of the British Society for the Turin Shroud:\"Unlike my predecessors, whom I think are more or less committed to a pro authenticity point of view, I myself currently incline more towards an accidental 14th century origin for the cloth now preserved in Turin.\" (Editorial by Hugh Farey, BSTS Newsletter, No. 78, December 2013).And Porter thinks MY hacking proposal is \"ridiculous\"!That must have been SOME accident! Did some mad 14th century scientist experimenting with light sensitive chemicals accidentally tip over his test tubes onto his workbench. And then he used his ~4.4 x 1.1 metre linen bench covering sheet to mop it up, lying on it naked front and back to apply maximum pressure, and hey presto! There was the photo of his naked body, front and back, on the sheet??? Far fetched? And what about the mountain of historical and artistic evidence that the Shroud existed all the way back to the first century? It doesn't matter.

But if you are a philosophical naturalist (including that contradiction in terms \"`Christian' naturalist\" rescued from self contradiction by calling it \"Methodological Naturalism\" i.e. Naturalism is false but the best way to proceed in science is by pretending that Naturalism is true!) then a naturalistic theory which doesn't explain the most facts always beats a supernaturalistic theory which does explain the most facts!Stephen E.

Turin shroud older than thought NOT Fri Jan 28, 2005 4:48 am Stephen E.

Organic preservatives applied to the linen and absorbed by it would also reduce the radiocarbon age; and 3) Stevenson & Habermas mention that the Shroud has been for much of its history stored in vaults in castles and monasteries. If those vaults were stone and those stones contained uranium and uranium decay products (which is likely), then they would be a source of neutrons that would have had the effect of reducing the Shroud's radiometric age.This is not to discredit radiocarbon dating generally, but it is to point out the precariousness of relying on radiocarbon dating of *one* sample (i.e. The Shroud), and then using it to trump all other evidence.[...] Maybe at the end of my current series I will write a blog post outlining problems with the \"medieval ...

Has not sat in a sealed tomb or buried for 2000 or more years.Agreed. The Shroud has had a unique history, having been handled by countless hands, and a large part of that history is unknown. Yet that unknown history could be very important in assessing how much new carbon has been added to the linen. E.g. If the Shroud had been kept in granite castles/monasteries by the Templars and/or the Savoys, it may have been subject to a prolonged neutron flux from radon gas (a decay product of uranium and thorium which is in granite and accumulates in granite rooms see \"Radon: Accumulation in houses,\" Wikipedia), which could have converted Nitrogen 14 in the Shroud to Carbon 14.Remember that there only is a very tiny amount of C14 in carbon:\"Donahue ... Offered an analogy to illustrate it. `Let's say the shroud material is 1,000 acres of green marbles piled three feet deep, and in there somewhere is one blue marble,' he said in a telephone interview from his Tucson laboratory. `We've got to find the blue marble. It's daunting, but we can do it.' \" (Kenneth R. Clark, \"Shroud of Turin Controversy Resumes,\" Chicago Tribune, January 17, 1988.)so it would not take much new C14 added and/or original C14 lost to give a misleadingly young radiocarbon date.A part of the Shroud's history which is known is that it has been in a major fire in 1532 in which molten silver (which melts at 962ºC = 1571ºF) has burned through multiple layers of the cloth. And water used to douse the fire would have created superheated steam. The effects of 962ºC heat and superheated steam in an enclosed box could have forced new carbon deep into the linen, and even becoming a part of it, where it could never be removed by pre treatment. C14 labs warn against mere tobacco smoking near a sample to be C14 dated! >Archaeologists usually deal with items that have been 'secluded', not carried all over, handled, mended or exposed to outside influences/contaminations. Agreed. See above.>Even in the cases of 'secluded' RCD testings there have been anomolies! I have read that up to 50% of tests must be redone because of anomolies. Where does that put the Shroud in the error percentage scale? I'd say it's up there; Like a 95% chance of error from from a 'single' reading, possbly.Agreed. If it was any other linen artifact the C14 labs would have been much more cautious in claiming that an artifact which has historical evidence that it existed at least from the sixth century, and has such a known contamination history, and unknown history, can be \"conclusively\" proved to be \"medieval ... AD 1260 1390.\"The AD 1260 1390 date, i.e. 1325 +/ 65 is just too good to be true, considering all the problems AMS dating had had up to then, and yet the Shroud would have been one of the most problematic artifacts to carbon date, given its history.Yet the middle date, 1325, `just happened' to be about 20 years before the Shroud first appeared in documented European history, at Lirey France in about 1355.Therefore I suspect that the actual C14 dates may have ranged from 1st to 16th century AD, the former being the true date of the Shroud and the latter that of the medieval invisible repair, but the C14 labs had too much prestige at stake (let alone the anti Christianity of their leaders, Gove, Damon, Hall and Wolfli) to admit publicly that their new AMS method (or rather they) had failed, and what's more the Shroud could have been Jesus'. So out of their range of dates they chose those which averaged just before 1355, and ignored the rest.Stephen E.

Therefore like a drowning man clutching at a straw to stop him going under, the Shroud `sceptic' (i.e. True believer in the Shroud's inauthenticity) clings to whatever shreds of evidence he can find, that the Shroud is a fake.>When it is common knowledge (or I thought), that raidocarbon dating is not only NOT infallible but actually prone to errors??. To paraphrase the agnostic, but pro Shroud, Prof. Yves Delage, \"If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some [other] person\":\"If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, an Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection ... I have been faithful to the true spirit of science in treating this question, intent only on the truth, not concerned in the least whether it would affect the interests of any religious party ... I recognize Christ as a historical personage and I see no reason why anyone should be scandalized that there still exist material traces of his earthly life.'\" (Walsh, J.E., \"The Shroud,\" 1963, p.107).the 1988 \"medieval\" radiocarbon date of the Shroud would have been set aside as unlikely to be correct, because of all the other evidence that the Shroud dates back to at least the sixth century.>Also when one considers the 'assumptions' that are made in the process of the dating such as assuming c14 production has been relatively equal over periods of time. The main problem of C14 dating is the assumption that no new carbon has been gained and no original carbon has been lost. But the C14 labs have no way of knowing that. The three C14 labs did check that the C13/C14 ratio was constant but that only tells them there has been no C14 only added and/or lost. It does not tell them if there has been new carbon (i.e. C12, C13, and C14 together) added and/or old carbon lost.For example, if a medieval repair was part of the cloth dated, the C14 labs could not tell that, because it would contain C12, C13 and C14 in the same proportion as a 2,000 year old linen Shroud.>Furthermore the fact that actually only one test was performed, not actually three as the sample was from one area of the cloth and not from various locations as it should have been. When I did Ecology in my Biology degree, we were told that samples from an area were not statistically valid unless they were taken randomly from different parts of that area and in sufficient quantity. A tiny postage size sample taken from a deliberately chosen bottom corner of a 1.4 x 1.1 metre cloth, because it was already damaged there, is not a statistically valid sample.[continued].","date":"2012-03-22","mins":"9:20 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/03/four-proofs-that-ad-1260-1390.html","title":"\nFour proofs that the AD 1260-1390 radiocarbon date for the Shroud has to be wrong!: #2 The Vignon markings (4)\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"The Deuce>I'd never been able to make out the square with open top or the triangle underneath it before, Same for me.>but I just realized that's because I've always been looking at the contrast enhanced negatives of the Shroud, which actually obscure those details.

The The pro authenticity side no longer have to provide an answer since it no longer is (if it ever was) their problem. The 16th century invisible reweave theory is a possible explanation, among many, of how the radiocarbon labs got it wrong. If ... And his Shroud anti authenticist ilk don't like that explanation, then let him/them find another. It's now his/their problem, not ours!\"Stephen E.

The alternative would require a major upheaval of their lives, with the likely loss of non Christian family and friends.Here is a quote from Joe Marino's book that I was read a few days ago, on, which points out that \"in a real sense, the Shroud is more important for skeptics than it is for Christians\":\"Skeptics who deny the authenticity of the Shroud are often atheists, and many of these atheists are in the forefront of Shroud opposition. They are not willing to acknowledge the possibility of the supernatural and find it safer to dismiss the Shroud as a forgery, even when it flies in the face of all the evidence. Quite simply, the reality of the Shroud and its possible ramifications scares them. They know that an authentic Shroud of Turin puts their atheism on shaky ground. A comment by a bishop to one such skeptic really puts the whole significance of the Shroud in perspective. The bishop told him, `If the Shroud turned out to be 2,000 years old, it wouldn't really affect my faith, but it might affect yours'. Thus in a real sense, the Shroud is more important for skeptics than it is for Christians. It penetrates to their deepest philosophical levels.\" (Marino, J.G., \"Wrapped up in the Shroud,\" 2011, p.272). Stephen E.

It is very significant because it shows that even back in the 1900s the objective, scientific evidence that the Shroud is authentic was so strong that Yves Delage, an agnostic Professor of Anatomy at the Sorbonne, France's leading university, read a paper in favour of the Shroud being Jesus' before the French Academy of Science! >My point on the R Cdating also goes a little further in that I very rarely hear Shroud defendings using it in defense of the Shroud when it is an important question. I don't seem to have blogged specifically on the many problems with the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud. But there are Web pages on it, e.g. \"The Story Behind The Shroud of Turin And the Carbon Dating Debacle.\" In a message to my now shut down Creation Evolution Design Yahoo discussion group, I had only just read Stevenson & Habermas' 1981 book, \"Verdict on the Shroud\" and I had not before then heard that the Shroud had been radiocarbon dated as \"medieval\" in 1988.

I am not aware of anyone mentioning that.But Mt 27:34 & Mk 15:23 record that immediately prior to His crucifixion Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh (an analgesic) but when He tasted it, he refused to drink it.Two of my commentaries assume (as I do) that the reason Jesus refused to drink the wine mixed with myrrh was because He wanted to remain fully conscious throughout His ordeal:\"[Mt 27] 33 34 ... The drink of wine mingled with gall ('myrrh' in Mark) is usually understood as a narcotic to reduce the pain of crucifixion, and Sanhedrin 43a tells us that such a drink was offered by the noble ladies of Jerusalem to those about to be executed (a practice inspired by Pr. 31:6 7). If so, Jesus' refusal of it might mean that he was determined to undergo his fate in full consciousness.\" (France R.T., 1985, \"Matthew,\" Tyndale, p.395. Italics original)\"[Mk 15] 23. The sour local wine which they gave Him was 'laced' with myrrh; this would give it a bitter taste, but a soporific effect, and was an act of mercy. Jesus, however, would not take any such anaesthetic; all His faculties must be unclouded for what lay before Him. Such drugged wine, tradition tells us, was provided by pious women of Jerusalem for condemned criminals, to dull the pains of execution: whether 'incense' (so the Talmud) or myrrh was used, makes little difference.\" (Cole, R.A. 1989, \"The Gospel According to Mark,\" Tyndale, p.316. Italics original).>Anyone of us would have fainted fairly early in the ordeal. No. If fainting when undergoing extreme pain was a way of avoiding that pain, then crucifixion (and indeed most torture) would be pointless and we would not need anaesthetic during surgery! Wikipedia says that \"fainting, passing out and swooning\" is \"a short loss of consciousness\" with \"spontaneous recovery\":\"Syncope, also known as fainting, passing out and swooning, is defined as a short loss of consciousness and muscle strength, characterized by a fast onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery.

I'd like to believe I could form an opinion either in agreement or opposition but I am still digesting it all.There is so much here obviously. One of the things that should give pause to anyone skeptical of the Shroud is how much research there is, and how stubbornly it refuses to yield to their expectations. It's not that there isn't a simple answer; it's that they reject a priori the only conclusion supported by the evidence.But I digress.
