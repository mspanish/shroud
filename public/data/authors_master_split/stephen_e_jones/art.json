Della Rovere aquatint depicting how the Shroud’s image was formed, we can see how the Byzantine artist embroiderer had depicted the lance wound correctly on the mirror reverse side to that in which it appears on the Shroud proper, but has forgotten that the same rule must also apply to the crossing of the hands.” (Wilson, I., “The Blood and the Shroud,” Simon & Schuster: New York NY, 1998, p.137) You can verify it for yourself. Click on the image of della Rovere’s aquatint above to enlarge it. Note that in the copy of the Shroud held by angels, the spear wound bloodstain is on the opposite side of the uppermost hand. But on the Shroud itself the spear wound is in Jesus’ right side. You and your readers can verify this for yourselves by printing out a copy of the positive image of the Shroud, e.g. From Shroud Scope‘s Durante 2002 Vertical (not the Enrie black and white negative photograph). Hold the printed out Shroud copy in front of you and imagine it is laid over your body, as it would have been laid over Jesus’ body. You will note that the spear in the side bloodstain is on your right side. And it is your left hand which is over your right hand. Stephen E.

I find that unethical, and I have never, and would never, write a separate blog post attacking you, or any of my fellow Shroud pro authenticists. You also imply falsely that my “empty vessels [who] make the most noise refers to “my [your] readers” generally, when in the context it clearly did not.

You claim you did not block me from posting to your blog, but the facts are: 1. On 8 February this year my comments to your blog ceased to appear, immediately after I respectfully disagreed with you. I tried reposting my comments and even sent a plain text test message but they did not appear. 2. I mentioned under a comment you had made on my blog the same day, 8 February, that my comments were not appearing on your blog. I repeated my comment to this effect late that same day and again the next day, but there never was a response from you. 3. I find it strange that you never checked to see what my response to your comment on my blog was, in which case you would have read that my comments to your blog were not appearing. Were you not interested to read what my response to your comment was? And did you not notice that I had stopped commenting on your blog? 4. I also find strange your comment today that: “If something went wrong I apologize. If I made a mistake, perhaps, I apologize. There is no intent to block your comments, ever.” But as I commented back, “Your `If I made a mistake, perhaps, I apologize’ seems strange. If you did not block my comments to your blog, then there would be no reason for you to apologize.” Quite frankly Dan, for the above reasons, I find it hard to believe that you did not block me, especially now after your unprovoked hostile post against me.

Agreed. But Wikipedia is usually OK for most things. As I said in my post above, Wikipedia's strength is its weakness: anyone can edit it. That means that an anonymous someone who has read little or no books in the Shroud but who relies on what he/she reads on the Internet, can edit a Wikipedia article on the Shroud, and it sounds authoritative to members of the public, including young people, who don't know any better.>Anyways a couple of points to the Pray Manuscript drawing at the top of this page; 1. I tend to believe there is actually a second cloth represented in the bottom image, which extends beyond the Shroud slightly towards the Alpha symbol.Yes there undoubtedly is a cloth arising out of the midst of the Shroud. But it is difficult to interpret. The upper Shroud border is visible through it, and the Xs on the Shroud continue across it, so presumably it is not intended to be a physical cloth but a symbol of the grave clothes that the angel is pointing to as evidence that Jesus was not there and had risen. This is supported by the face of the Shroud in profile, in a line with it and the letter, which could be an alpha. I must remember that the artist was not probably not an expert on the Shroud, nor in 1st century Jewish burial practices, but simply drew what he saw on the Shroud before him and added information to better tell the Gospels' story of Jesus' burial and resurrection. As I mentioned in a previous comment, there is no Biblical reason for the artist not to depict other cloths, because in four places (Lk 24:12; Jn 19:40; 20:5,6,7) the Gospels mention that \"linen cloths\" were left behind in the empty tomb after Jesus' resurrection, without stating what they were.>I have not come to a conclusion of whether it is depicting the face cloth or 'more likely' the strips which would have been used to bind the Shroud around the body.Thanks for the insight! The `bar' across the head opening, which I had been puzzling over (and had just said a quick prayer to the One whose image is on the Shroud to help me understand what it is!) was probably meant to symbolise the chin band, which was used in 1st century Jewish to keep the jaw from opening. And which many sindonologists thought was meant by the \"napkin\" [Gk. Soudarion] in John 20:7 (KJV):\"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\"But since the discovery of the Sudarium of Oviedo, most now think that the soudarion was that, and the chin band was among the \"linen strips\" [Gk. Keira] used in 1st century Jewish burials to bind the hands, feet and jaw in place, and mentioned in the account of Lazarus' raising from the dead in John 11:44 (ESV):\"The man [Lazarus] who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips [Gk. Keira], and his face wrapped with a cloth [Gk. Soudarion]. Jesus said to them, `Unbind him, and let him go.'\"[continued].","date":"2012-05-29","mins":"8:25 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/05/my-critique-of-pray-codex-wikipedia-1.html","title":"\nMy critique of \"The Pray Codex,\" Wikipedia, 1 May 2011\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>I also think the face image cloth hanging from the ladies arm is depicting more likely the Sudarium...your thoughts? No. For one simple reason an artist in 12th century Hungary (and indeed anyone in Constantinople at the time) would be unlikely to know what the \"Sudarium\" (later called \"of Oviedo\") was. It was in Spain since at least the 9th century and took an entirely different route from the Shroud via Africa getting to Spain:\"According to this history, the sudarium was in Palestine until shortly before the year 614, when Jerusalem was attacked and conquered by Chosroes II, who was king of Persia from 590 to 628. It was taken away to avoid destruction in the invasion, first to Alexandria by the presbyter Philip, then across the north of Africa when Chosroes conquered Alexandria in 616. The sudarium entered Spain at Cartagena, along with people who were fleeing from the Persians. The bishop of Ecija, Fulgentius, welcomed the refugees and the relics, and surrendered the chest, or ark, to Leandro, bishop of Seville. He took it to Seville, where it spent some years. \" (Guscin, M., \"The Sudarium of Oviedo: Its History and Relationship to the Shroud of Turin,\" 1997)So I interpret the face in profile behind Mary Magdalene's right arm as the artist's way of depicting Jesus having risen. His depiction of Jesus' image on the Shroud is the upper Entombment scene.Remember that Byzantine and medieval artists did not depict Jesus as dead, but living and reigning. So they used the Shroud as a basis for their Christ Pantocrator (\"Christ All ruling\" icons), and converted bloodstains on the Shroud into locks of hair, and red crosses (as you say below) etc, on their icons.>Secondly; I believe the image which many mistake for the sephulchre is actually the Shroud, with all the red x's as it also depicts the holes of the burn marks and I think the red is to imply blood on the inside of the cloth....Anyways, just a couple of thoughts.Agreed. I have just received de Wesselow's book, and, as an art historian, he has useful things to say about the Pray Manuscript. He also agrees that the red crosses and `poker holes' are meant to be on the Shroud. He maintains the Hungarian artist saw the Shroud in Constantinople, and says there were close connections between Hungary and Constantinople in the 12th century. De Wesselow also suggests that the reason the artist did not depict the Shroud itself was because at the time artists were not permitted to do that (presumably because that then would be a second Shroud). While I regard de Wesselow's theory that Jesus' resurrection was the image on the Shroud as absurd, and against all the New Testament evidence, nevertheless, his agnostic art historian support for the Shroud being authentic will be immensely valuable to the Shroud pro authenticity cause. I will use what de Wesselow's says about the Pray Manuscript in my Wikipedia update.The Joe Nickell's of this world will find it more difficult to peddle their lies that those who believe the Shroud is authentic are all crazy Christian religious fanatics (I actually heard Nickell say words to this effect in a Coast to Coast radio debate with Barrie Schwortz).Stephen E.

Agreed. Some of the limitations of the Pray Manuscript's depictions of the Shroud are: 1) the PM it is not a photograph, but a work of medieval Christian art; 2) the codex itself is only 235 x 150 mm (Berkovits, 1969, p.103), so the artist had to fit a lot in a small space; 3) the artist worked only in ink and used only three colours red, blue and black; 4) he may not have understood much about the Shroud itself, and 1st century Jewish burials, as we understand them today; 5) he may have not been a great artist (de Wesselow thinks he \"was not particularly skilful\") and may have made mistakes (e.g. Did not exactly depict the `poker holes' assuming he even intended to do that he may have intended to symbolically depict them all by two compound patters); and 6) he may have been under what de Wesselow calls \"a code of secrecy\" which restricted what he could depict, e.g. He could not copy the Shroud itself, presumably because that would become a `second Shroud' and an object of veneration in itself as later Shroud copies became.Although surprisingly, and thankfully, the artist was allowed to depict Jesus nude, albeit modestly by placing both His arms and hands over His pelvic area. In plate II which depicts Jesus being taken down from the Cross, He is also nude but because His hands could not reasonably cover His genitals, the artist has Jesus wearing a girdle. Personally I think the PM's artist was very skilfull and managed to fit in a lot of meaning, within the limits he faced.>But the two most compelling factors remain:1. The position of the nude Jesus in the artwork, strikingly similar to the image of Christ on the shroud Yes. And art historian de Wesselow confirms that only the Pray Manuscript and the Shroud (and of course later post 1350 copies of the Shroud) show Jesus totally nude, his frontal modesty only being preserved by His hands crossed over His pelvic area.While not shown on the PM, the dorsal side of the Shroud, showing Jesus' totally nude, with nothing to preserve His modesty, is even more inexplicable, unless the Shroud image really is a \"snapshot of the resurrection\":\"Even from the limited available information, a hypothetical glimpse of the power operating at the moment of creation of the Shroud's image may be ventured. In the darkness of the Jerusalem tomb the dead body of Jesus lay, unwashed, covered in blood, on a stone slab. Suddenly, there is a burst of mysterious power from it. In that instant the blood dematerializes, dissolved perhaps by the flash, while its image and that of the body becomes indelibly fused onto the cloth, preserving for posterity a literal `snapshot' of the Resurrection.\" (Wilson, I., \"The Shroud of Turin,\" 1979, p.251).De Wesselow also confirms my point in my previous comment that the artist has depicted the Shroud symbolically (being not permitted to depict it literally).>2. The herringbone bone weave like pattern at the bottom of the image, with the 4 poker holes in the L shape.I have just realised that on the Pray Manuscript there are 5 L shaped circles, not 4 as I had been writing. So I am going to call them the 5 L shaped and 5 P shaped circles/`poker holes'.>Any notion that these holes are some kind of pattern or motif without any connection to the poker holes on the shroud is illogical. A decorative pattern comprising the circles would surely have been in a symmetrical pattern, rather than the asymmetrical pattern of the 4 L shaped poker hole alignment.Agreed. If the sets of L shaped and P shaped circles were a decorative pattern, they would have been repeated together across the whole Shroud depiction. They clearly are meant to represent the `poker holes' on certain parts only on the herringbone weave of the Shroud.Stephen E.

But the artist could have depicted both it and a heavier beard if he had wanted to. He was able to depict the beard and moustaches of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. But he did not show John with a beard either. So it may be that he wanted to emphasise Jesus' youthfulness, and perhaps also to de emphasise His and John's Jewishness (due to medieval anti Semitism).>When comparing details between the characters I think that the fingers seem to be quit long in general. The fingers on the Shroud are long because they are are actually `xrays' of Jesus' finger bones, as are the teeth which are visible under the skin around His mouth This is explicable by Jackson's \"Cloth Collapse Theory\".

De Wesselow points out that on Jesus' left hand, in the upper \"The Entombment\" (which he calls \"The Anointing\") scene, the thumb should be clearly visible (because we are looking directly at the thumb side of Jesus crossed left hand).This is inexplicable unless the PM artist was faithfully depicting Jesus' hands on the Shroud, which also have no thumbs visible (due to the thumb being retracted into the palm when the median nerve is damaged by a crucifixion nail).This was one of the items of anatomical accuracy on the Shroud image which made surgeon Pierre Barbet ask, \"Could a forger have imagined this?\":\"But these experiments had yet another surprise in store for me. I have stressed the point that I was operating on hands which still had life in them immediately after the amputation of the arm. Now, I observed on the first occasion, and regularly from then onwards, that at the moment when the nail went through the soft anterior parts, the palm being upwards, the thumb would bend sharply and would be exactly facing the palm by the contraction of the thenar muscles, while the four fingers bent very slightly; this was probably caused by the reflex mechanical stimulation of the long flexor tendons. Now, dissections have revealed to me that the trunk of the median nerve is always seriously injured by the nail; it is divided into sections, being broken sometimes halfway and sometimes two thirds of the way across, according to the case. And the motor nerves of the oponens muscles and of the short flexor muscle of the thumb branches at this level off the median nerve. The contraction of these thenar muscles, which were still living like their motor nerve, could be easily explained by the mechanical stimulation of the median nerve. Christ must then have agonised and died and have become fixed in the cadaverous rigidity, with the thumbs bent inwards into His palms. And that is why, on the shroud, the two hands when seen from behind only show four fingers, and why the two thumbs are hidden in the palms. Could a forger have imagined this? Would he have dared to portray it? Indeed, so true is this that many ancient copyists of the shroud have added the thumbs; in the same way they have separated the feet and shown their forward faces with two nail holes; but none of this is to be seen on the shroud. (Barbet, P., \"A Doctor at Calvary,\" 1963, pp.118 119. Emphasis original).And even in the unlikely event that a medieval forger could have imagined it, he wouldn't have depicted it because his contemporaries would not understand why he did it, and so would consider it a flaw.Which is the another reason why the Pray Manuscript's \"The Entombment\" (Plate III) scene is based on the Shroud. Significantly in the same artist's \"The Deposition\" (Plate II) and \"Christ Enthroned\" (Plate IV), where he is not depicting the Shroud, he shows Jesus with thumbs!Stephen E.

The shroud is twice the length of the man; 2. A herringbone weave pattern; 3. An `L' shaped pattern of holes on the front and back; 4. Beard and long hair; 5. Mark above the right eye corresponding to the reverse `3' shaped bloodstain on the Shroud; 6. Body naked; 7. Right hand over the left; 8. Long fingers; 9. No thumbs; 10. Nail wound on the wrist of the right hand (pl. IV); and 11. Three nails used for crucifixion (pl.

Therefore the Shroud must have existed well before the 1192 95 Pray Manuscript.>Furthermore you won;t actually see the \"herringbone\" pattern on the shroud unless your are very close up to it...so it's unlikely the artist would put the herringbone pattern in his picture.There is no reason why the artist could not have seen the Shroud very close up.>Imagaine I drew a TV picture onto a page...I would ONLY see the tiny pixels when I am close up to the screen...so I am highly unlikely to draw a rectangle with small square pixels...why on Earth would this artist draw the herring bone pattern if you can only see it close up?Because he was close up to the Shroud!Also, it's a false analogy between pixels on a TV screen and the herringbone weave of the Shroud. The former is not part of the object being represented, but the latter is.>What about the closes of the other people...when viewed close up you would see various inticate patterns and stitchings...but we don't see that in the picture...and what about close up views of the bodies you would see body and facial hair on the skin...how come this isn't in the picture but the herringbone pattern is?A drawing is not a photograph. Artists always leave some things out, according to what they deem to be the most important. Besides, plate III does have Christ's facial hair: eyebrows, moustache and beard.>THE only conclusion you can really draw from this is that the Pray Manuscript is NOT very strong proof at all as regards to the Turin Shroud dating.No, you are deceiving yourself, by denying what is obvious, presumably because you don't want to accept that the Shroud is the burial sheet of Jesus, bearing the image of His crucified, dead and resurrected body!Stephen E.

With his feet that would be about 135 mm. Twice that would be about 270 mm.The folded over shroud in the lower part of Plate III measures about 146+116 = about 260 mm. But like the feet, the far right edge of the Shroud is not shown.So while that is not exactly \"twice the length of the man,\" it is close enough to it(bearing in mind that the far right edge of the Shroud is not shown), to reasonably conclude that the artist intended to depict the ~4 metre (~14 foot) Shroud of Turin (as it now is called).>The only thing I can think of is that you are interpreting what I think is the tomb (with the red crosses) as part of the shroud.What you are intepreting as the tomb, is in fact the Shroud. The red crosses are the artist's depiction of the Shroud's herringbone weave pattern. And again the two parts add up to about twice the length of Jesus' body, as the Shroud is.>Likewise, I can't understand the reference to the L shaped pattern of holes on \"the front and the back\". Clearly there is the L shaped pattern of 4 holes on the object which the angel is standing on,That \"object which the angel is standing on\" is part of the depicted Shroud. The 4 L shaped circles match exactly one set of 4 L shaped holes on the Shroud.>but I interpret the circular objects on the object below it with the red crosses (which I think is the tomb) as decorative.Why would the tomb be decorated with red crosses? Besides, the angel, women and the Shroud are in the tomb. And part of the tomb itself can be seen in the background behind the angel. The holes amongst the red crosses (the herringbone weave) are another set of the total of four sets of burn holes in the Shroud, not all of which are L shaped. Click on this 1516 Liere copy of the Shroud link.>Also, if the painting is a copy of the shroud why is Jesus's body in the top part of the painting free of wounds and blood stains?The Byzantines were reluctant to depict bloodstains on their icon copies of Shroud, e.g. They depicted the reversed \"3\" bloodstain on the Shroud as a lock of hair. On Plate II where Jesus' body is being taken down from the Cross the artist doesn't depict any bloodstains on it there either. Only on Plate IV, does the artist depict Jesus as having red bloodspots on His hands and side.>Also, does Jesus in the painting have a beard? At best I can pick out whiskers!It is a beard, albeit not a heavy one as like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus' are in the upper part of Plate III (above). But if you look at Shroudscope's Face only Vertical, which is how the artist would have seen it (a photographic negative), Jesus' beard does not appear to be heavy. Which itself is more evidence that the Pray Manuscript artist worked directly from the Shroud!Thanks for your comments, but as per my stated policy (see above) that: \"Each individual will usually be allowed only one comment under each post.

I am not an art expert and nor can I read Hungarian.>Also, is that an image of the shroud's peaceful, closed eyes head behind the right arm of the apostle?The lower part of the above Plate IV seems to be depicting the scene in Mark 16:1 6, where in the empty tomb a \"young man\" (i.e. An angel) tells the three women disciples, \"Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome\" (John's mother) that Jesus had risen and points to the place where His body had been laid:\"1 When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. 2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. 3 And they were saying to one another, `Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?' 4 And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back— it was very large. 5 And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. 6 And he said to them, `Do not be alarmed.
