[{"id":"comment-26402","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"When I was doing my Biology degree (2000 2004), we were taught in the Philosophy of Science unit that philosophers of science had generally given up on the project of trying to demarcate what is “science” from “pseudoscience.” The problem was (as Dan mentions above), that the criteria proposed to demarcate “science” from “pseudoscience,” e.g. “testable,” “falsifiable,” “repeatable,” etc, would rule out as “pseudoscience” some fields generally regarded as “science,” e.g. String theory. And they would rule in as “science” some fields not generally regarded as science, e.g. Creation Science. For example to claim that Creation Science is “untestable” and “unfalsifiable” and then claim it has been tested and found to be false, would be self contradictory. But that does not prevent science polemicists claiming that an opposing position is “pseudoscience.” Their aim is to rule out in advance an opposing view so that it cannot get a fair hearing. That saves them doing the hard work of showing that an opposing view is wrong. As regards Colin Berry claiming that the field of Shroud pro authenticity (Sindonology) is “pseudoscience,” it would be helpful for him to state upfront his demarcation criteria of what he regards as “pseudoscience.” If it is any of the usual criteria, like “testable,” “falsifiable,” “repeatable,” then the Shroud pro authenticity hypothesis would pass with flying colours. For example, the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud showed that the Shroud pro authenticity position is both “testable” and “falsifiable”. It was claimed in NATURE that “The results provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval … A.D. 1260 1390,” and therefore the Shroud could not be authentic. That is, the Shroud was tested and found to be false (or so the dating laboratories thought). It would therefore be self contradictory of Colin (and the Royal Society) to claim that Shroud pro authenticity is “untestable” and “unfalsifiable” and yet regard the 1988 radiocarbon dating as having tested the Shroud’s authenticity and found it to be not authentic. As regards “repeatable,” all that is required is that the major features of the Shroud are replicated using knowledge, materials and technology available in the 14th century. Some have in fact tried to do that but to date all have failed. It might be argued that the theory that the Shroud’s image was caused by radiation emitted by Jesus’ resurrection fails the “repeatable” demarcation criterion. But some parts of mainstream science are not “repeatable,” e.g. The Big Bang and macroevolutionary events. And the theory that the Shroud’s image was caused by radiation emitted by Jesus’ resurrection is not essential to the Shroud pro authenticity position. So before Colin writes his letter to the Royal Society claiming that Shroud pro authenticity (Sindonology) is a pseudoscience he should first clearly state his demarcation criteria of what he regards as “science” and “pseudoscience,” and then show objectively and non circularly how Shroud pro authenticity satisfied his “pseudoscience” demarcation criteria..","date":"2013-03-04","mins":"10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/defining-pseudoscience-it-takes-a-rocket-surgeon/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Defining Pseudoscience:  It Takes a Rocket Surgeon"},{"id":"comment-4555","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"As the great Neo Darwinist geneticist, J.B.S. Haldane (1892–1964), realised, that “if my mind is a mere by product of matter” then “I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true”: “It seems to me immensely unlikely that mind is a mere by product of matter. For if my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true. They may be sound chemically, but that does not make them sound logically. And hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms. In order to escape from this necessity of sawing away the branch on which I am sitting, so to speak, I am compelled to believe that mind is not wholly conditioned by matter.” (Haldane, J.B.S., “When I Am Dead,” in “Possible Worlds: And Other Essays,” [1927], Chatto and Windus: London, 1932, reprint, p.209). And one of those beliefs is “that mind arises from nothing more nor less than the actions of the [material] brain.” In other words, as C.S. Lewis pointed out many years ago (e.g. In his 1947 book Miracles), Materialist statements like, “mind arises from nothing more nor less than the actions of the [material] brain” is self refuting. While I appreciate Prof. Barash’s candour (and nothing I write here should be construed as a personal attack on him or his ilk), nevertheless, Materialists have for decades (if not centuries) been making promises like, “I am also nearly as confident that some day, we’ll understand how.” It even has a name, “Promissory Materialism“!

I was going to add that Shroud pro authenticity has often published its findings and theories in peer reviewed scientific journals, as STURP did; but by contrast Shroud anti authenticity has rarely published its findings in peer reviewed scientific journals. The publication of the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud in NATURE might be the only occasion that Shroud anti authenticity published its findings in a peer reviewed scientific journal. And even then it is doubtful if that paper went through peer review. But it is not generally regarded as a demarcation criterion of science that a finding or theory must be published in a peer reviewed scientific journal. For example, Charles Darwin’s theories of evolution by natural and sexual selection were not published in peer reviewed scientific journals even though they did then exist. And Walter Mc Crone’s Shroud anti authenticity findings and claims were only published in his own in house journal THE MICROSCOPE. Also, while not a demarcation criterion of science, a mark of good science is presenting one’s paper before one’s peers at scientific conferences. And Shroud pro authenticity has held regular scientific conferences. On my bookshelf I have the proceedings of six such conferences. But Shroud anti authenticity has never, as far as I am aware, ever held even one such scientific conference. So on any objective criterion of good science, Shroud pro authenticity passes with flying colours, and Shroud anti authenticity only receives a bare pass, if that. Another criterion of good science is the attitude of its proponents. Shroud pro authenticity, for the most part, relies on evidence and argument, with personal attack being rare and frowned upon when it occurs. But Shroud anti authenticity relies heavily on ad hominem attacks. For example, Harry Gove, in his book on the 1988 radiocarbon dating, ruled out of court Shroud pro authenticity proponents like STURP, on the basis that they were all Christian believers (which wasn’t even true) and therefore biased in favour of the Shroud’s authenticity. But Gove, like most Shroud anti authenticists, was blind to his own anti Christian bias. Another example is a radio debate between Barrie Schwortz and Joe Nickell, where the latter relied heavily on ad hominem attacks against Shroud pro authenticists, but Schwortz (a non practicing Jew) simply presented the evidence for the Shroud’s authenticity. Indeed, if heavy reliance on ad hominem attacks is a mark of bad science in respect of the Shroud, then Colin himself is a prime example. Colin, for all his claims to be a scientist, seems unable to mount a rational argument without resorting to ad hominem attacks upon those he disagrees with. To me this is `body language’ which reveals that deep down Colin does not have confidence in his Shroud anti authenticist position. Indeed, if I were Colin I would be embarrassed to draw the attention of the Royal Society to my blog!.","date":"2013-03-04","mins":"10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/defining-pseudoscience-it-takes-a-rocket-surgeon/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Defining Pseudoscience:  It Takes a Rocket Surgeon"},{"id":"comment-2197","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Dan Thanks again for the plug. In addition to “Re: John Calvin on the Shroud #1” mentioned above, I have since added a concluding part#2. Also, to that part#2 I have just now added the following conclusion: “In conclusion, I am astonished how weak Calvin’s arguments against the Shroud were. As we have seen, they were mostly based on the Argument from Silence fallacy. Indeed, the Gospel writers’ silence on what happened to Jesus’ burial garments, having been unnecessarily mentioned as “linen” in all four Gospels (Mt 27:57 60; Mk 15:42 46; Lk 23:50 54; Jn 19:38 42) at Jesus’ burial, but then being obscurely mentioned in only two Gospels (Lk 24:12; Jn 20:5 7), points to their deliberate silence. That is, a silence that would: 1) explain to Christians where the Shroud and Sudarium came from; but 2) conceal from non Christians that the disciples had recovered them!” Stephen E.

In the beginning of time, God already WAS (Gn 1:1; Jn 1:1). God is the I AM (Ex 3:14), which if it means anything, means He is not subject to time. Jesus referring to this, confirmed that God IS the God of the long dead patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, because “to him all are alive.” (Lk 20:37 39). As for the Kenosis Theory, that in His Incarnation “Christ emptied himself of his divine (eternal) nature and became human (temporal)”, the Bible passage it is based on, Philippians 2:5 6, does NOT say that. Reading from my Interlinear New Testament, it says: “… Christ Jesus, who in the form [Gk. Morphe = nature] of God SUBSISTING [huparchon] … himself emptied [ekenosen = come to nothing – hence “made himself of no reputation” KJV] the form of a slave taking …” So Paul is NOT saying that Christ emptied Himself of His God nature, but that, while REMAINING GOD, He took on a human nature. That Jesus still had His God nature while on Earth, but normally voluntarily suppressed it, is evident in that with a word of command He stilled a storm (Mt 8:18,23 27; Mk 4:35 41; Lk 8:22 25), and the disciples, some of whom were professional fisherman, “were terrified and asked each other, `Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!'” (Mk 4:41). Stephen E.

Their presence on the Shroud, with the former confirmed by its pollen grains and both identified by presumed imaging, indicate that the Shroud originated in the spring season (March April) in the Jerusalem area. The high indicative value of Gundelia tournefortii‘s pollen grains derives from the fact that it is a monotypic genus (Feinbrun Dothan, 1978).

On that basis, maybe Satan faked Jesus’ miracles, as the Jewish religious leaders claimed (Mt 12:24; Mk 3:22; Lk 11:15), up to and including the resurrection?! No, first, the evidence overwhelmingly points to the Shroud’s authenticity, and the only evidence against it is: 1. A draft (not the original) 1389 memo by a French Bishop who claimed his predecessor (not he himself, therefore just hearsay) thirty four years previously knew the artist who painted the Shroud (except the Shroud is not a painting); 2. A 1988 radiocarbon test by three labs, on a tiny 1.2 x 0.8 cm, postage stamp sized sample of the Shroud, taken from the worst possible location: a damaged, patched, highly contaminated corner, claimed in a 1989 Nature paper, that the Shroud was “medieval … AD 1260 1390.” But a table in that Nature paper, giving the actual results of those test, on the same tiny sample, divided amongst the three labs, using the same AMS method of C14 dating, showed a spread of ages of the Shroud from a maximum of 795+65=860 years (Oxford) to a minimum of 591 30=561 (Arizona), i.e. 299 years. This can only be explained (assuming that at least two of the three labs did not simply bungle the test) by there being contamination from new carbon (e.g. From a 16th century invisible repair) which the labs pre cleaning had not removed. Second, the Shroud has led uncountable millions to faith in Christ, not least in the first ~1500 years of Christianity before the invention of the printing press and the translation of the Bible into national languages. If the Shroud is a trick by Satan then the joke is on him (the same applies to Picknett & Prince’s claim that Leonardo faked the Shroud as a prank played on Christianity)! Jesus gave us a test to detect Satan’s fakes: “By their fruit you will recognize them” (Mt 7:16,20). On that criterion the Shroud has produced good fruit in the lives of uncountable millions, including mine. For myself, although I had been a Bible believing evangelical protestant Christian for nearly 40 years when I encountered the Shroud in 2005, and was already leading a happy and consistent Christian life, my knowledge of the Shroud has since lifted my love for Jesus to new heights that I could not have imagined. I feel that I now know that Jesus lived, suffered, died, and was resurrected, in the same way that the Apostle John, when he entered the empty tomb, “saw and believed” (Jn 20:8)!.","date":"2012-01-24","mins":"5:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/23/satan-and-his-clever-shroud-of-turin-trickery/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Satan and his clever Shroud of Turin trickery"},{"id":"comment-961","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">Stephen Jones himself, in a 200 [sic] post on his website … wrote that the identification of Gundelia was in doubt. Thanks for this, which I had temporarily forgotten! I did not claim that it was not Gundelia tournefortii and as far as I know, no one has supported my suggestion. But I did add: “However, this reclassification by Prof. Litt of Frei’s Gundelia tournefortii pollen to the Carduus genus may be a blessing in disguise for the authenticity of the Shroud. That is because there is a species in that genus, Carduus argentatus, which grows around Jerusalem, flowers in April May, has a more attractive flower (see above), and is a much less thorny plant than Gundelia tournefortii.” It has just occurred to me that there is a second blessing in disguise if this is an error in classification by Frei, in that it would be evidence against claims by Shaffersman and others that Frei’s data was fraudulent. That is because if Frei did collect modern pollen and claim it was Gundelia tournefortii he would have collected pollen from that species as an easily identified living plant. There was also no reason for Frei to choose Gundelia tournefortii because as my quote by Wilson indicated, it is an unlikely plant to be used in a 1st century Jewish burial.
