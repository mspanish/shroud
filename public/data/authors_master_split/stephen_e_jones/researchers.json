Great! I only get Dan's posts, not his comments, so I am blissfully unaware of that debate.>A significant development was that after much prompting I got him to admit that the two red streaks on the shroud were in fact blood. There is hope for him yet! As you state below it is a major concession for a Shroud anti authenticist to admit that the blood on the Shroud is real blood (see below).I have just responded in a comment under my post, \"Shroud of Turin: Burial sheet of Jesus!: #9 The man has wounds and bloodstains matching the Gospels' description of the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ\") to a private message to Gio which is about the blood on the Shroud soaking through to the underside, which I presume was based on comments on Dan's blog by Colin.>This is a significant victory, because as I pointed out to him it is unknown for art of that period and even up to at least the 14th 15th centuries, for images to show blood on the shroud in entombment scenes. Indeed it is \"a significant victory,\" which was resisted by Walter Mc Crone to his dying day. He knew that no medieval forger would use real blood in painting the Shroud. Apart from the fact that real blood normally turns black (the Shroud's blood is red because of the bile pigment bilirubin, which is a response to massive physical trauma), there is the inherent difficulty (not to mention repugnance) of painting with blood.And real blood on the Shroud makes hot statue/bas relief methods unviable because the blood was on the Shroud before the image and so would be cooked if the blood soaked linen cloth was placed over the hot statue/bas relief.>This is further evidence that the manuscript is based on a viewing of the shroud.Sorry, but it is unclear to me why there being \"two red streaks on the shroud\" (there are a lot more than that) is \"further evidence that the [Pray] manuscript is based on a viewing of the shroud.>He's still saying that the 4 circles in a one off, assymmetrical L shaped pattern are just a random decorative motif though, which just defies logic as far as I am concerned!Like most (if not all) non Christian Shroud anti authenticists, Colin is afraid to accept evidence that would point to the Shroud being authentic, because they rightly sense that it would be a `slippery slope' down (actually up!) the path of them becoming Christians.As the agnostic Professor of Anatomy at the Sorbonne, Yves Delage, responded to his fellow atheist/agnostic members of the French Academy of Sciences, who attacked and ridiculed him for reading a paper to them in 1902 arguing that the Shroud was authentic, `if it was anyone but Christ, the evidence would be accepted':\"If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, an Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection ... I have been faithful to the true spirit of science in treating this question, intent only on the truth, not concerned in the least whether it would affect the interests of any religious party ... I recognize Christ as a historical personage and I see no reason why anyone should be scandalized that there still exist material traces of his earthly life.'\" (Walsh, J.E., \"The Shroud,\" 1963, pp.106 107).But as Colin the scientist knows, refusing to accept evidence because one doesn't like it for personal reasons, is the very antithesis of science.The true scientific attitude is to follow the evidence wherever it leads.Stephen E.

Sorry for not articulating that clearly.OK.>Colin didn't admit to real blood on the real shroud, rather he admitted the two red streaks on the object in the Pray Manuscript image which he thinks is the sarcophagus lid and we think is the shroud, represent blood.That explains it. But it is still a problem for him, because the Pray Manuscript was created in 1192 95 and the artist depicted blood, including a mark exactly where the reversed 3 bloodstain is on the Shroud.>I think this is significant. As I say,in the history of the art of Jesus's entombment there is very little evidence of blood on Jesus's discarded cloths / shroud. Almost always the cloths / shroud are unblemished. Agreed. The Byzantine artists used the Shroud image to depict Jesus as living and ruling (which is what \"Pantocrator\" means). So it is very significant that the Pray Manuscript depicted Jesus nude and with bloodstains, as He is on the Shroud.>I think that the Pray Manuscript artist shows two red streaks representing a bloodied shroud is therefore very significant.By the other red streak, apart from the reversed 3, I thought you meant the crown of thorns mark(s) in Jesus' hair on plate III (but see below). There are also red marks on Jesus' hands and right side on plate IV, corresponding to the nail wound and the spear wound bloodstains on the Shroud, although the left hand is covered by the right hand on the Shroud.But most significantly, equivalent to the L shaped `poker holes', Jesus' right hand on plate IV has the red nail wound mark on Jesus' wrist, exactly where it is on the Shroud! See my JPG of it in my 2010, \"The Pray Manuscript.\" The significance of this is actually strengthened by the fact the Pray Manuscript artist depicted the nail wound on the left hand of plate IV, which is covered by the right hand on the Shroud, in the palm as it traditionally is depicted by medieval artists. I am going to insert this as point 5 in \"My critique of `The Pray Codex,' Wikipedia, 1 May 2011, making 13 points (14 if the crown of thorns bloodstains are also inserted). I will also add an image of plate IV to that page.>My interpretation is that the two red streaks represent the two long streaks of blood on the arms of Jesus in the real shroud. I cannot see those \"two red streaks\" on plate III of my copy of Berkowitz.>In my view this is all stacking up very nicely, as the two long streaks of blood on the arms in the real shroud, and the L shaped poker holes, are two of the most prominent features.And the nail bloodstain in the wrist of Jesus' right hand of plate IV, exactly as it is on the Shroud, contrary to the traditional crucifix depiction of the nails being in Jesus' palms, as they are on Jesus' left hand in plate IV![continued].","date":"2012-06-16","mins":"7:26 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/06/turin-shroud-is-fake-and-its-one-of-40.html","title":"\n`The Turin Shroud is a fake ... and it's one of 40': Antonio Lombatti\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]BTW Colin a few hours ago tried to post here a substandard comment (which I deleted as per my stated policy) about my \"travesty of a blog site and of blogging\" and in which he threatened, \"I am minded to report you to Blogger Blogspot for your abuse of the medium\" and my \"sticking your simplistic labels on me.\" And because my \"modus operandi here is highly obnoxious\"!

But as Garza Valdes pointed out at the time, he had been personally given the fibres by Riggi, from a container in Riggi’s house, which had the seal of the then Archbishop of Turin, Cardinal Ballestrero’s on it, and Garza Valdes had a photograph of it to prove it. So Garza Valdes is a witness (and there are others) to the fact that Riggi, with the tacit permission of the then Archbishop of Turin, kept back a `reserve sample’ of the Shroud that he cut for the three C 14 laboratories in 1988. However, if one wants to be super sceptical, then to be consistent he/she would have to grant that the conspiracy theorists have a point that no one can absolutely prove that the Shroud samples tested by the three C 14 laboratories in 1988 were not switched, for the sample from the 13th century cope of St. Louis d’Anjou, which was a last minute inclusion as a control in the samples given to the three C 14 laboratories to test..","date":"2013-03-29","mins":"3:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"id":"comment-28773","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Yannick now changes the subject, rather than admit he was wrong, from his original point that: “Garlaschelli made a press conference to claim he had reproduced the Shroud, people in the pro Shroud world were completely offended by this kind of acting.

So, you think Fanti has not a word to say about the date of release of his own book? Come on!!! That is, as far as I am aware, the case with most (if not all) books.

And again, the article says that Fanti had ALREADY submitted his paper to the journal. >But in the end, I don’t care too much. That’s not the most important thing to note about this whole affair… No, the most important thing to remember is this: Fanti can claim anything he wants on the basis of his analysis of his very old and questionable dust samples, Yannick keeps mentioning “dust samples”. But the Vatican Insider article says nothing about “dust”. It says “FIBRES” (my emphasis): “The machine used to examine the Shroud’s FIBRES and test traction, allowed researchers to examine tiny FIBRES alongside about twenty samples of cloth dated between 3000 BC and 2000 AD…. Final results show that the Shroud FIBRES examined produced the following dates, all of which are 95% certain and centuries away from the medieval dating obtained with Carbon 14 testing in 1988: the dates given to the Shroud after FT IR testing, is 300 BC ±400, 200 BC ±500 after Raman testing and 400 AD ±400 after multi parametric mechanical testing. The average of all three dates is 33 BC ±250 years. …The tests were carried out using tiny FIBRES of material extracted from the Shroud by micro analyst Giovanni Riggi di Numana who passed away in 2008 but had participated in the1988 research project and gave the material to Fanti through the cultural institute Fondazione 3 M.” >but he will never be able to get largely accepted these as proven facts regarding the Shroud by the scientific community. Since “the scientific community” is dominated by atheist/agnostics whose religious philosophy is Naturalism (“nature is all there is there is no supernatural”) and therefore are IMPLACABLY OPPOSED to Christianity, that is one thing that Yannick and I agree on. >Again, that’s the reality, because of the highly questionable aspect of the samples he used and also because of the highly suspicion that exist versus the honesty, integrity and profesionnalism of the man. Ad hominem fallacy again. >So, before some of Fanti’s claims can be accepted as true facts by the scientific community, be sure that it will take more than a peer reviewed journal publication, especially if this publication happen in the same journal in which Fanti always publish his works about the Shroud. Personally I am more interested in the TRUTH of Fanti’s claims than whether “the scientific community” accepts them. And again the bottom line is that there are ONLY TWO viable alternatives: 1) either the Shroud of Turin is a forgery; or 2) the Shroud of Turin is authentic. The problems of the Shroud pro authenticity position 2) PALE INTO INSIGNIFICANCE compared to those of 1) the forgery position. It is highly significant that no one advocating 2) the forgery position has ever published a comprehensive and coherent explanation for the origin of the Shroud, which plausibly explains all the major facts about the Shroud. In my series “The Shroud of Turin” I am collecting all the problems of the forgery theory as a I go along and I will present them all together in section “9. Problems of the forgery theory.” But if 2) is correct and the Shroud is authentic then the Shroud’s fibres MUST date no later than the first century AD. Then problems of the dating of the Shroud and its fibres must be merely APPARENT problems, not REAL problems, due to our ignorance and misunderstandings. >In fact, it will take another round of direct researches on the Shroud that could scientifically confirm them. This surely won’t happen very soon.

I said nothing about a “rectangle” let alone “a neat 8.1cm x 1.6cm” one. That is Colin’s own straw man. They were just “threads” from “tufts” taken from the cope of St. Louis d’Anjou: “The Cluny Museum was contacted but refused to be involved. `…They got scared …’ as Evin remarked later. So he and one Gabriel Vial went along to the Basilica of Saint Maximin at Var and pulled some tufts out of the cope known to have been worn by St. Louis d’Anjou (d. 1297). A postal strike intervened so Vial had to hurry to Turin himself and hand his “control sample” to Tite himself on the very day of the cutting of the sample from the Shroud: 21 April 1988. … Confronted with the importunities of an excited Vial, the imperturbable Tite divided his offering into three parts which he placed not in cylinders but in envelopes for the three laboratories as an apparently unexpected but later very useful “Sample 4″ – threads from the cope of St. Louis d’Anjou (d. 1297).” (D. J. Mc Donnell, “The Great Holy Shroud Dating Fraud of 1988,” 4 November 2003). But it had to be enough linen in those threads for the three C 14 laboratories to carry out a valid C 14 dating, otherwise they would not have been valid controls. And each of the three C 14 laboratories subdivided their postage size sample of the Shroud several times (one was 9 times from memory), and each subdivided sample had to have enough linen to do a valid C 14 dating. From memory the Shroud samples were reduced to threads anyway, so that they could be pre treated more thoroughly. A self styled `Sciencebod’ if he thought about it (even if he had not bothered to READ about it) should have realised that the C 14 labs did not do their tests on the `rectangle’ of Shroud linen that they were each given. So if the Shroud is authentic (as all the evidence, apart from the 1988 radiocarbon dating, points to), then an explanation is needed for how three C 14 laboratories `just happened’ to agree on a C 14 date range, 1260 1390, the mid point of which, 1325, `just happened’ to be about 25 years before the Shroud appeared at Lirey in the 1350s. A not unreasonable explanation is that, faced with a public relations disaster, of three C 14 labs all using the then new AMS method, and with literally a million pounds then riding on Oxford’s AMS test being successful, and with the labs being unable to come up with a consistent, publishable, C 14 date, with some of the C 14 sub samples yielding a C 14 date of 1st century, and other sub samples yielding a C 14 date of 16th century (due to an invisible repair with cotton which Oxford lab actually discovered after Arizona had done its test), the three labs all agreed to use a 13 14th century date range, the midpoint of which was just before the Shroud first appeared in the European historical record. And one way to do that was use some of the dates that the 13th century cope of St. Louis d’Anjou had yielded. It used to be a trump card argument in favour of the 1325 +/ 65 years C 14 date, that if the Shroud was 1st century, then how did it `just happen’ to yield a a mid point date that was a mere 25 years before the Shroud appeared in the undisputed historical record? But that argument cuts both ways: if the Shroud IS 1st century (as the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence points to), then how did it `just happen’ to yield a mid point date that was a mere 25 years before the Shroud appeared in the undisputed historical record?! Therefore, I stand by my point (without necessarily saying or believing that that is what happened): “…no one can absolutely prove that the Shroud samples tested by the three C 14 laboratories in 1988 were not switched, for the sample from the 13th century cope of St. Louis d’Anjou …” >It should be easy enough therefore to shoot down this latest unhelpful attempt to muddy the waters of science by going back to the cope to see if there’s a missing rectangle. See above on the “rectangle” being Colin’s own straw man. I repeat that I said nothing about a “rectangle” being taken from the cope of St. Louis d’Anjou, and nor does my argument require it: “tufts” and “threads” from that 13th century linen cloth sufficient for three C 14 labs to each perform a valid C 14 test, will do just fine..","date":"2013-03-29","mins":"9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"id":"comment-28851","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">From comment # 18, “There is no evidence that the “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” paper in Nature, Vol. 337, 16th February, 1989, pp.611 615, was peer reviewed.” I stand by my claim that “There is no evidence that the “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” paper in Nature, Vol. 337, 16th February, 1989, pp.611 615, was peer reviewed.” For one thing, as I had previously pointed out, if the paper had been peer reviewed, it would have been rejected, so variable were its C14 dates and so fallacious was its reasoning. For example it is simply fallacious to claim that because a postage stamp sized (approx. 45 x 12 mm) sample of a ~4400 mm x 1110 mm cloth (i.e. 1/0.00011 th or 0.011% of the whole) returned a 1260 1390 C 14 date, therefore the whole cloth must have the same date. Any peer review committee worthy of the name would have pointed out that elementary error of scientific logic and asked that the paper’s conclusion, “The results provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval” be qualified by something like, “If the very small sample of the Shroud which was radiocarbon dated, amounting to only 0.011% of the whole cloth, is representative of the whole cloth, then ….” Apart from the fact that, as I have previously pointed out, if the Shroud IS first century (as ALL the other evidence points to), how did the three labs `just happen’ to come up with a date range, 1260 1390, the midpoint of which 1325 +/ 65 years, `just happens’ to be a mere 25 years before the Shroud appeared in the historical record? Or to put it another way, if the odds of the Shroud being 1st century, yet yielding a 13th 14th century radiocarbon date, is “about one in a thousand trillion”: “According to Professor Harry Gove, prime inventor of the state of the art accelerator mass spectrometry method that was used to carbon date the Shroud, the very same scientific criteria that provide a ninety five per cent degree of probability in favour of the Shroud’s manufacture between 1260 and 1390 also provide odds of ‘about one in a thousand trillion’ [Gove, H.E., “Relic, Icon or Hoax?: Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud,” 1996, p.303] against it dating back to the time of Jesus.” (Wilson, I., “The Blood and the Shroud, 1998, p.179. Emphasis original) then if the Shroud IS 1st century (as ALL the evidence except the 1988 C 14 date points to), then the odds that the 1260 1390 radiocarbon date of the Shroud is correct, is “about one in a thousand trillion”! But in that case, it is far more likely that the 1260 1390 radiocarbon date of the Shroud was the result of SCIENTIFIC FRAUD, than that a coincidence, the odds against which were “about one in a thousand trillion”, `just happened’..","date":"2013-03-30","mins":"11:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"id":"comment-28895","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">The man’s a complete buffoon.

That’s a puzzle to me. It was the same Giovanni Riggi who unstitched for STURP in 1978 part of the back of the Shroud: “Having acquired some considerable skills as a microscopist, in 1978 Riggi participated in the STURP scientific examination of the Shroud, a privilege that was arguably facilitated by his close friendship with the then Cardinal of Turin’s scientific advisor, Professor Luigi Gonella. Conspicuous in the Shroud test room for his spotless white coat and his meticulous methodology, Riggi quickly attracted the attention and admiration of the American scientific team, and despite his very limited command of English became formally enlisted him as one of STURP’s members. One of the procedures agreed for the 1978 testing work was the partial unstitching of one side of the Shroud from the backing cloth to which it had been sewn ever since 1534 …” (Ian Wilson, “Obituary – Giovanni Riggi,” BSTS Newsletter, No. 67, June 2008). It would seem easy, and indeed unavoidable, for threads of the Shroud to come loose in Riggi’s hand while was removing its backing cloth. If so, and Riggi is known to have personally souvenired for his own `reserve sample’ part of the 1988 sample cut for the three C 14 labs, then it would not be surprising if he similarly personally souvenired threads of the Shroud arising from STURP’s 1978 examination. If that did happen then Fanti might have been unaware of it until he gained access to Riggi’s samples after his death in 2008. And it might explain why Fanti avoids mentioning it, so as not to detract from the late Prof. Riggi’s memory. Because, while Riggi’s 1988 personal souveniring of part of the 1988 Shroud sample may be defendable because Turin’s Archbishop Ballestrero approved it, there seems to be no such excuse if Riggi did personally souvenir threads from the Shroud in 1978, if no one else knew about it, let alone someone with the requisite authority having approved it. Remember that in 1978 the Shroud was the property of ex King Umberto II who lived in exile in Spain, so even Turin’s then Archbishop, the same Cardinal Ballestrero, could not have given Riggi permission to keep threads of the Shroud for himself. If Riggi did, without authorisation, and especially if it was without anyone else even knowing about it, keep for himself threads from the Shroud which he obtained during his 1978 removal of the Shroud’s backing cloth for STURP in 1978, then I would have thought that was STEALING, and stealing of a most serious nature..","date":"2013-03-29","mins":"10:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Matt >Freeman's comment that interest in the Shroud has only been intense in the last 50 years is patently untrue.Agreed.

Freeman is writing about \"an early sixteenth century Byzantine icon ... [called] Noli Me Tangere (when Mary Magdalene meets Jesus in the garden).\" See John 20:11 17. I wasn't even going to quote this because being 16th century the icon is more recent than the Shroud's first public appearance in Lirey, France in c.1355, and therefore it is of no value in tracing the Shroud's \"missing history\" through congruencies between it and 6th 13th century Byzantine icons. >There is a separate sudarium and the wrappings from which Christ had extricated himself. The cloths found in the Jerusalem tomb in 2009 correlate with this tradition, an interesting example which points to the historical reliability of John’s gospel.\"Note Freeman's anti Christian \"wrappings from which Christ had EXTRICATED HIMSELF.\" Not \"had been RESURRECTED THROUGH.\" Presumably the atheist/agnostic Freeman holds to a version of the `Jesus did not die on the Cross' theory. Because a dead body cannot \"extricate himself\" from his burial wrappings! And a resurrected Jesus would just pass through them (or rather, according to Jackson's \"cloth collapse\" theory, they would pass through Him).>Note the references to the separate sudarium and the wrappings, and the reference to the 2009 tomb findings supporting this.Again I see nothing of great significant in this.

Probably because I don't normally read comments on other Shroud blogs.But in keeping with the Pray Codex artist depicting the Shroud symbolically in terms of contemporary 12th century Western burials (e.g. The empty tomb is depicted symbolically as a sarcophagus and its lid, decorated with the Shroud's `poker holes,' herringbone weave and bloodstains), the empty burial garments emerging from the sarcophagus are just part of the artists' symbolic depiction of Jesus' resurrection leaving behind the Shroud and the Sudarium.The Sudarium was, until the rediscovery in 1965 by Sindonologist Guilio Ricci of the Sudarium of Oviedo, thought to be the chin band around the head of a Jewish body to keep its mouth closed until rigor mortis had set in. And the chin band (and therefore the Sudarium) probably are (mistakenly) depicted by the artist in the strips of cloth around the neck space of the garment emerging out of the sarcophagus lid. >It's also interesting looking at this image and seeing the tomb / sarcophagus without a lid adjacent to it.

Note Freeman's preface of \"bizarre\" to Wilson's theory that the Edessa Image was the Shroud of Turin doubled in four, with only the face 1/8th of the Shroud visible in landscape mode.As mentioned in my post above, this is part of Freeman's ongoing attempt to \"poison the well\" against Wilson's theory in the minds of Freeman's readers.>Seventy years ago a Frenchman, Paul Vignon, noted that the bearded face on the Turin Shroud has some of the characteristics of Byzantine art. Vignon was not only \"a Frenchman\", but a Professor of Biology and an artist. But to be fair to Freeman, Wilson does not mention this in his latest book \"The Shroud\" (2010) which Freeman is relying on. >All kinds of measuring was done and some enthusiasts found as many as sixty resemblances. Note Freeman's \"enthusiasts\" being part of his continuing attempt to \"poison the well\" against Wilson's theory in the minds of his readers. And Freeman conceals from his readers that Wilson in his book only mentions 15 of these \"Vignon markings\" unique congruencies between Byzantine depictions of Christ starting from the early 6th century and the Shroud.>This is all interesting but Wilson goes on to make the absurd suggestion that this was because Byzantine art was born from the Image of Edessa, also known to Wilson as the Turin Shroud! More \"poisoning of the well\" by Freeman. Wilson's theory that \"the Image of Edessa\" is \"the Turin Shroud\" is dismissed by Freeman as \"absurd\". This is what we might expect from some anonymous commenter to a blog, not a professional historian.>Wilson makes some vague points about a new period in art at this time and finds a reference to two wandering Georgian monks with contacts with Edessa in the 530s who may have painted images. They were actually \"Assyrian monks ...Theodosius from Edessa and Isidore from Edessa's sister city Hierapolis ... Both monks travelled to Georgia specifically to paint interpretative versions of their charges for the newly founded churches there.\" (p.136). For a historian, Freeman is remarkably careless with historical facts!>His key argument is the appearance in iconography of Christ with a beard happens just at this time. Here Freeman sets up a \"straw man\" effigy of Wilson's \"appearance in iconography of Christ\" claim, so he can knock it down more easily. Wilson's clam is NOT ONLY that icons of Christ appeared \"with a beard.\" But I will go into that in detail when I get to that part of Freeman's paper.[continued].","date":"2012-07-10","mins":"8:23 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-turin.html","title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey,\" part 1: \"Introduction\"\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Matt >Freeman says:>\"If Wilson's thesis that this linen cloth was the Mandylion was not already in enough trouble, Wilson's thesis that the Turin Shroud was the Mandylion (aka Image of Edessa), doubled in four and encased in a flat, rigid, container, so that only the face of Christ appeared in landscape mode, is not in ANY trouble at all. Rather, i It is Freeman's thesis that: 1) the Image of Edessa is not the Turin Shroud, and 2) both are just two of many fake relics, which is in trouble.>he still has a major issue to tackle, the history of the Shroud from AD 30 to the second half of the sixth century when the Edessa Image aka to Wilson the Turin Shroud is first recorded in Edessa. It is a long period, much more challenging than filling in a mere 150 years.\"First, as you say, there IS evidence that the Shroud was in existence \"from AD 30 to the second half of the sixth century\" and I will quote some of it when I get to that part of Freeman's paper.Second, as Beecher pointed out in 1928, like an ancient \"bronze statue that was found at the bottom of the Aegean Sea,\" it still can be accepted as genuine without ANY documentary evidence, based on its own \"intrinsic proofs of authenticity\":\"I have heard many say that they are convinced that the Shroud was not produced in the fourteenth century, and that it has all the appearance of being the genuine Shroud of Christ, but they own to a feeling of diffidence regarding the long stretch of time from the thirteenth century backward. My aim in this chapter is, so far as I am able, to win the confidence and assent of such persons, and to convince them that the proof of authenticity, as it spans these centuries, is not so formidable as it appears. My chief argument is the self proof which the Shroud has stamped upon it. This in itself, even if we had not a single document to quote, is quite sufficient. And I wish to stress the same with all the emphasis I can, lest, in the course of our long historical enquiry, it should be lost sight of. When, for instance, archaeologists desire to know the history of some ancient building or monument, they do not think of going to parish registers in search of documents. NO, they examine the building or monument itself, and they are satisfied with whatever reasonable testimony may be found therein. I will give an example even more to the point. Some eighteen months ago the London Times had a photograph of a bronze statue that was found at the bottom of the Aegean Sea. Experts examined it and pronounced it a genuine Greek statue. It was accepted as such; no one doubted the opinion that was expressed; and it will be labelled for all future time as a Greek statue.

More of Freeman's \"straw man\". Wilson does not claim that \"Byzantine art\" BEGAN \"from the 540s.\">So we have the earliest bearded Christ in the catacomb of Commodilla in Rome in about 390 and then a fine central image of a bearded Christ in the church of San Pudenziana of c. 405 (below). Wilson acknowledges in his other writings that there were isolated parallel depictions of Christ with a beard, e.g. In the catacombs of Rome, etc. But these do not have the distinctive Vignon markings, and so are probably derived from independent traditions ultimately based on memories of what Jesus looked like.>Even a brief glance at a standard history of early Christian art would have shown Wilson the emergence of these fully fronted bearded portraits in the fifth century.\">Actually, as I have stated before, the story of St Alexius has him travelling to Edessa in 405 AD to venerate an icon, that eventually \"talks to him\" and influences his spiritual path.Thanks. There is a lot of other information that the Image of Edessa is the Shroud doubled in four, which Freeman presumably knows about, but conceals from his readers. Even if Freeman is basing his paper on Wilson's latest book, in the interests of scholarly honesty, Freeman should have revealed the existence of that other information to his readers, so as not to mislead them.>Whilst the evidence is not categorical, I consider it very likely that the icon is the Image of Edessa, which takes us back to 400 AD at least. So it is likely that the Image of Edessa DID influence the bearded depictions of Jesus that began to arise in the late 300s / early 400s Good point. Wilson's claim is NOT that the rediscovery of the Image of Edessa in 525 was the FIRST TIME Christians had seen the Shroud and what Jesus looked like on it. Wilson's theory IS that the Shroud existed from AD 30 in Jerusalem and was later taken to Edessa. And that at some point it was folded eight times (\"doubled in four\") and encased in a protective surround, so that only the face of Jesus was visible. So, even if the Shroud was not shown publicly, which would place the Shroud and its guardians in danger of it being confiscated by Christianity's enemies the then much more numerous and powerful Jews and Romans, there presumably would have been hundreds, if not thousands of Christians who knew what Jesus looked like from the Shroud.And also, there is no reason why traditions of what Jesus looked like independent of the Shroud/Image of Edessa did not persist into the 4th and 5th centuries. While the New Testament does not mention what Jesus looked like, it would have been common knowledge in the early church. We must also remember that we have only a tiny `tip of the iceberg' of early Christian art that has survived. Apart from the Iconoclast movements in the 8th and 9th centuries in which over zealous Christians themselves destroyed all the depictions of Jesus they could find, almost all ancient art (Christian and otherwise) has not survived.Stephen E.

Repeating a comment I made under \"`The Turin Shroud is a fake ... And it's one of 40': Antonio Lombatti: \"Linda Cooper `The Old French Life of Saint Alexis and the Shroud of Turin', Modern Philology [a journal devoted to research in medieval and modern literature], University of Chicago Press, August 1966, pp.1 17. The eleventh century Old French Life of Saint Alexis, generally recognized as the first masterpiece of French literature, contains the passage: Then he [Alexis] went off to the city of Edessa Because of an image he had heard tell of, Which the angels made at God's commandment... As Linda Cooper shows in this highly scholarly paper, the `image' referred to is none other than the Image of Edessa, and when the various versions of St. Alexis's life are studied, it makes a great deal of sense that this was one and the same as the Shroud. She cites, for instance, the Bollandist Vita Alexius which calls it `... An image of our Lord Jesus Christ made without human work on a sindone'; also the Latin Cod. Monac. Aug. S.Ulr. 111 ... `[he came] to the city of Edessa, in which there was preserved a blood stained image of the Lord not made by hands'. Both passages clearly refute arguments that the Image of Edessa was incompatible with the cloth we know today as the Turin Shroud.\" (Ian Wilson, BSTS Newsletter, No. 16, May 1987, p.14).Also:St. Alexius (or Alexis) lived in Edessa between 412 and 435:\"Saint Alexius or Alexis of Rome or Alexis von Edessa was an Eastern saint whose veneration was later transplanted to Rome, a process facilitated by the fact that, according to the earlier Syriac legend that a \"Man of God\" of Edessa, Mesopotamia who during the episcopate of Bishop Rabbula (412 435) lived by begging and shared the alms he received with other poor people was, after his death there, found to be a native of Rome.\" (\"Alexius of Rome,\" Wikipedia, n 24 March 2012).So if while St. Alexius was in Edessa between 412 435, the Shroud was there and known to be full length (and \"an image of our Lord Jesus Christ made without human work on a sindone\" and \"Edessa, in which there was preserved a blood stained image of the Lord not made by hands'' can be nothing else) then that is more evidence for Ian Wilson's theory that the Image of Edessa/Mandylion and the Shroud of Turin are one and the same. Again Freeman conveniently ignores evidence that undermines his theory that: 1) the Image of Edessa is not the Turin Shroud, and 2) both are just two of many fake relics.Stephen E.

NO, rather he would be looked upon as eccentric in not being able to see that the statue carried in itself its own proof of its genuineness.

But we should get sucked into playing by Freeman's rules, i.e. `the Shroud cannot be accepted as authentic until there is an unbroken paper trail going back to AD30.' But even if there was, the Freemans of this world wouldn't accept it. Freeman (and his ilk) denies even that the Pray Manuscript (1192 95) was based on the Shroud, so it is clear that NO evidence for the Shroud's authenticity would suffice for him/them.Stephen E.

Indeed it is!Agreed. Freeman, the historian, does not realise what de Wesselow, the ART HISTORIAN pointed out, that the WHOLE of plate III depicts the Shroud (and I would add the Empty Tomb) SYMBOLICALLY.>He rightly identifies it as the Sudarium, which is supported by the alpha letter connecting the sudarium to Jesus's head behind Mary's right arm. Disagree that the Sudarium is the empty grave clothes. The soudarion was probably thought by the artist, as it was until the discovery of the Sudarium of Oviedo, to be the strip of linen binding a Jewish body's jaw to prevent its mouth from opening until rigor mortis set in. In which case it is depicted around the neck area of the empty grave clothes emerging from the sarcophagus. The alpha letter is ambiguous. But agreed that it probably is intended by the artist to connect the empty grave clothes with Jesus' head on the Shroud in profile, behind Mary Magdalene's right arm.>So at least Freeman is one step more advanced than our friend \"Science bod\" who thinks this small piece of cloth is in fact the shroud \"Sciencebod\" has been permanently banned from commenting on this blog, because of his repeated breach of its policies. Therefore, as previously requested, I don't want him to be mentioned her because: 1) it gives him a continued proxy presence on my blog; and 2) it could be claimed by him to be unfair, that he is attacked in comments on my blog, but is unable to post comments in reply defending himself.>(no matter what you think of the artist's abilities, he does tend to get scale and perspective quite accurate in the illustration, and this cloth is far too small relative to the human figures adjacent to be the shroud. You are on the right track Mr Freeman!!!).Disagee. See above. Freeman has the wrong Gospel scene and the wrong burial cloth.>And finally Freeman again:>>\"No one who had seen the Turin Shroud and been impressed with it would have illustrated the discarded burial cloths of Jesus as is actually done on the Pray Codex, What with the sarcophagus and its lid, decorated with the Shroud's `poker holes' and herringbone weave, the the \"discarded burial cloths of Jesus\" are all part of the artist's depiction of the Shroud SYMBOLICALLY.>with, in the conventional gospel representation from John, of the sudarium being shown separately as it clear from a blow up pof this part of the manuscript.

Freeman the historian should know as much as anyone that ancient art used much symbolism.

As de Wesselow pointed out in his book, \"The Sign,\" the artist may not have been permitted by the Constantinople authorities to copy the Shroud (as those copies would become competing icons to the Shroud itself). So what the Pray Codex artist has done, is depicted the Shroud symbolically.>As it is they are jumbled up and hardly seem anything like the size of the Turin Shroud.\"This is FALSE. As shown (outlined in green) on my \"My critique of \"The Pray Codex,\" Wikipedia, 1 May 2011,\" the Pray Codex's (Berkovits, 1969, plate III, upper) Shroud is \"about 3.0 times Jesus' body, compared to the Shroud of Turin's about 2.4 times the length of Jesus' body.\">Comment:Why didn't the illustrator show the image of Christ on the Shroud? I don't know! But I can only hypothesize. Most significantly, the size of the Pray Manuscript is very small and it would have been very hard for the artist to meaningfully depict Jesus's image at this scale.Yes. As previously pointed out, the artist used \"artistic license\" to include Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and John in the entombment of Jesus by draping the Shroud around them. But to fit all this within a portrait mode illuminated manuscript miniature forced the artist to depict the Shroud about 25% longer than it is.>There is also the question of HOW he would depict what is a very faint image. I believe the Shroud image of Jesus is symbolically represented by the cross motifs near the angel's foot, and this is an easy way to get around both the scale issue as well as the faint image issue.As previously mentioned, IMO many elements of the Pray Codex's Entombment and Visit to the Sepulchre scenes (Berkovits plate III) depict the Shroud symbolically.>Freeman goes on:>>\"The most important point of all is that a blown up image shows that the sudarium is depicted as a separate piece of cloth and so the source seems, once again, to be the account in John's gospel where the sudarium is reported as lying separately. This cannot be the Turin Shroud! The usual practice of taking the gospel accounts as an inspiration seems to have been followed here.\"If Freeman is talking about the image of Jesus' head in profile near Mary Magdalene's right arm, then that is self evidently NOT the Sudarium (i..e. \"the face cloth [Gk. Soudarion], which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself\" in John 20:7). First, a face cloth would not show the features of Jesus' face; and second, the scene being depicted is not John 20:7, which involved Peter and John but no angel, but rather Mark 16:5 6:\"5 And entering the tomb, they [Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome v.1] saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. 6 And he said to them, `Do not be alarmed.

I interpret it that the empty sarcophagus and lid, decorated with the Shroud's `poker holes,' weave and bloodstains, with the empty graveclothes emerging from the sarcophagus, and the face of Jesus in profile near Mary Magdalene's arm, TOGETHER depict the Empty Tomb and the Shroud COMBINED.>BUT Freeman has actually done our case a great service.

However, let us start with what would be obvious to anyone who had seen the Shroud, the size of the cloth and the two images. So to turn to the Pray Codex, it shows Christ being laid onto a shroud, which, in traditional Jewish style, as recorded in John’s gospel, reaches only to his shoulders. This is false on two counts. First, a Jewish shroud doubled as a bed sheet, so it could have been double a man's length. Second, there is no necessity for the Shroud to have been specifically intended as a burial sheet. Although English translations say that \"Joseph bought a linen shroud\" [Gk. Sindon]:Mk 15:46. \"And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.\"it is the same Greek word that Mark uses in the previous chapter for the \"linen cloth\" that a \"young man\" (probably himself) was solely wearing (presumably his bed sheet):Mk 14:51. \"And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth [Gk. Sindon] about his body. And they seized him,\"So the Shroud that Joseph of Arimathea bought to bury Jesus in, was a large linen sheet that could have been used for any purpose, including making clothes, soft furnishings, a burial shroud, etc.>>There does seem to be some sort of fold under the buttocks but hardly enough to make up the size of the Turin Shroud. This is true. But as I have pointed out elsewhere, that appears to be a garment with two halves, with an opening for the neck and ties across the shoulders. It is therefore is not the Shroud. But we should remember that the Pray Codex artist probably was not an expert in first century Jewish burial garments, and since both Luke and John (Lk 24:12; Jn 20:6 7) refer to \"linen cloths\" plural [Gk. Othonia] there is no Biblical reason why Jesus could not have been laid on a garment.>>Surely anyone knowing the Turin Shroud would have shown it with the top half of the Shroud above his head ready to be folded back over the body and fixed at the feet.Why? Again there is no reason to think that the Pray Codex's artist was an expert in Jewish burials. And even if he was, the artist does show the Shroud, but around Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and John, and that evidently was his artistic priority, to depict their involvement in Jesus' burial. >>Then the Turin Shroud shows a bearded Christ, this illustration does not, unless it is a very light beard.\"As I pointed out in my post, \"My critique of `The Pray Codex,'Wikipedia, 1 May 2011,\" the Christ of the Pray Codex does have a beard, albeit a light one. And the reason for that may be traditional, cultural and/or even medieval Christian anti Semitism. The Apostle John is depicted with no beard at all, yet Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus are depicted with full Jewish beards.It could even be due to the artist's misinterpretation, since the beard on the Shroud Man is faint.[continued].","date":"2012-07-18","mins":"5:49 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-turin.html","title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey,\" part 1: \"Introduction\"\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Gio>It's odd. From the little I've read of him, Mr. (Dr.?) Freeman always rubbed off as a relatively honest historian, at least for somebody who writes on the topics he does with the views he does.Freeman may well be an honest historian generally. I wouldn't know because I haven't read his other work, except his review of de Wesselow's \"The Sign\".But I do claim that in this paper of his that I am critiquing, Freeman is dishonest in concealing from his readers evidence that undermines his thesis: that the Shroud of Turin is just another fake relic. >But this piece seems largely polemical, especially when he starts with as blatant a falsehood as that interest in the Shroud has been confined to the last 50 years!Freeman doesn't actually say that. What he wrote was:\"Relic cults come and go and the Turin Shroud is very much a cult of the past fifty years, not a medieval one.\"But this is remarkable imprecise for a historian to whom chronological accuracy should be very important. The \"past fifty years\" is since 1962. But what happened in 1962 that was significant regarding the Shroud? NOTHING as far as I am aware. As is borne out by Ian Wilson's \"Highlights of the Undisputed History: 1900's\" on Shroud.com: December 17, 1961: Death of Dr. Pierre Barbet.June 16 18 1969: On the orders of Turin's Cardinal Michele Pellegrino, the Shroud is secretly taken out of its casket for its state of preservation to be studied by a team of experts. These examine, photograph and discuss for three days, but do no direct testing. During this same period, and with the Shroud hung vertically for the purpose, Giovanni Battista Judica Cordiglia takes the first ever Shroud photo in color, also fresh black and white ones, and ones by Woods light. If by \"a cult\" Freeman means the renewed modern scientific interest in the Shroud, then, apart from it being an inversion of the truth, it is historically false. As I pointed out in my post above, the modern scientific interest in the Shroud began in 1898, when Secondo Pia photographed the Shroud and discovered that it was a photographic negative!: \"Highlights of the Undisputed History: 1800's\"May 28, 1898: Public exhibition. Secondo Pia, an Italian amateur photographer, makes the first photograph of the Shroud of Turin. It ushers in a new era in the Shroud's history, the era of science. But Freeman is here not interested in historical truth. What he is attempting to do in this paper is to \"poison the well\" against the authenticity of the Shroud:\"Poisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a rhetorical device where adverse information about a target is pre emptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can be a special case of argumentum ad hominem ... The origin of the term lies in well poisoning, an ancient wartime practice of pouring poison into sources of fresh water before an invading army in order to diminish the invading army's strength.\" (\"Poisoning the well,\" Wikipedia, 4 February 2012).so that his readers won't bother checking for themselves the evidence for the Shroud's authenticity which is overwhelming!Stephen E.

Although I basically agree with Freeman's critique of that part of de Wesselow's \"The Sign\" which attempts to explain away the post resurrection appearances of Jesus that they were really the disciples looking at the image on the Shroud.>Why is it when Atheists like Freeman ask for evidence and get it that completely ignore the scientific evidence and turn all pseudo scientific on us. I truely believe that they must reject the shroud at all costs because of the strong evidence for authenticity.Atheists are like cultists (or actually ARE cultists) whose minds have been made captive to a philosophy:Colossians 2:8. \"See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.\"namely Naturalism (nature is all there is there is no supernatural). It is a very powerful cultism in that: 1) it is held by some of the best and brightest; 2) it has brought great material benefits in science and technology; and 3) it is not recognised to be a cult by those whose minds Naturalism has captured.But there is absolutely no reason why Christian Theism cannot be true. Then what is true in Naturalism is just a subset of Christian Theism.And the Shroud of Turin is just another piece of the empirical evidence that Christian Theism is true, which God has graciously granted to those whose minds are not closed to receive it.>Even when googling about the shroud I couldn't believe all of the nonsensical information on the skeptical websites I have seen. I haven't read much of them, but what I have read, I agree is largely nonsensical. A major problem for Shroud anti authenticists is that few (if any of them) have invested in buying and reading Shroud pro authenticist books.They are therefore largely dependent on Shroud anti authenticist websites and discussion forums. But that is just a case of \"the blind leading the blind\" (Matthew 15:14).>Back in 2009 I was totally ignorant of the shroud and thought it was just some relic.

But Wilson doesn't seem to publicly respond to critiques of his works.Maybe as an author he works on the principle that \"there is no such thing as bad publicity\"?

Which would be necessary after that trial by fire, if a red hot poker was thrust through it, into the Shroud beneath.>Just theorising here, but maybe the Sakli image, as a later image of the Image of Edessa, shows the poker holes where earlier depictions don't, because the poker holes were created some time between the earlier depictions and the Sakli depiction?That is possible. Or maybe the Sakli image is a more faithful representation of the Mandylion's post 680 trial by fire protective surrounds?The Sakli church is deep within Turkey (check out the location of \"Goreme\" on Google maps).

In fact it cannot be done and arrive after a doubling in four with a landscape mode of a head with the space around the head that the Mandylion copies depict (e.g. At St Catherine's Monastery, and the Sakli Church) without starting with a cloth about the same length and width of the Shroud.Starting with the about 4.4 x 1.1 metre Shroud, 4 x 2 = 8 halvings yields a cloth 4.4/8 = 0.55 x 1.1 metres or 1.1 x 0.55 metres with the head in about 1:2 landscape mode.Again, I would like to wind up these comments which have strayed far from my original Lombatti post (by allowing this I am indicating that I will in future more flexible on what \"off topic\" means).I would appreciate new comments to be on Charles Freeman's paper under my \"My critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey.\"Stephen E.

That you even THOUGHT that of me, when my post, \"Shroud of Turin News, October 2013\" clearly did not say it, is just another symptom of your underlying anti Shroud authenticity (and anti Shroud authenticist) problem.

I have encountered them not only in evangelical circles but in Catholic circles as will and it seems.that they are motivates by emotions then the evidences .It is understandable that Protestants may be opposed to the authenticity of the Shroud as part of a general opposition to Roman Catholic relics. But what seems surprising is that some Roman Catholics are also opposed to the authenticity of the Shroud, and two in particular were among the most zealous (if not fanatical) opponents of the authenticity of the Shroud.Canon Ulysse Chevalier (1841–1923) who \"In the controversy on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin ... He worked by tracing back the history of the cloth, which was undoubtedly used as a shroud, but he argued was not produced before the 14th century and was probably no older\" but \"In 2006 French historian Emmanuel Poulle wrote in a peer reviewed journal that Ulysse Chevalier showed in this case intellectual dishonesty. According to Poulle, Chevalier deliberately did not correctly mention the Papal bulls of antipope Clement VII issued in 1390. In fact Clement VII never opted for the forgery thesis.\" (\"Ulysse Chevalier,\" Wikipedia, 2 June 2014). And in fact Chevalier's intellectual dishonesty regarding the Shroud, was much worse than that. He forged a crucial heading to Bishop Pierre d'Arcis 1389 Memorandum that wasn't there. Read Markwardt, J., 2001, \"The Conspiracy Against the Shroud,\" BSTS Newsletter, No. 55, June 2002).Fr Herbert Thurston (1856–1939) was another Roman Catholic leading opponent of the Shroud, although Wikipedia doesn't say much about that:\"Fr. Herbert Henry Charles Thurston, S.J. (15 November 1856 – 3 November 1939) was an English priest of the Roman Catholic Church, a member of the Jesuit order, and a prolific scholar on liturgical, literary, historical, and spiritual matters. ... In his day, he was considered something of an expert on spiritualism. ... Thurston wrote more than 150 articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia (1907 1914) [including the online article on the Shroud of Turin]... He was a close friend of the Modernist theologian, Father George Tyrrell, who was harshly sanctioned by the Church. Many of Thurston's articles show a skeptical attitude ... About holy relics [especially the Shroud of Turin] and his treatment of spiritualism and the paranormal was regarded as `too sympathetic' by some sections of the Catholic community.\" (\"Herbert Thurston,\" Wikipedia, 8 October 2014. My words in square brackets)Read Markwardt BSTS article above for details of Thurston's intellectual dishonesty also in further `improving' on Chevalier's already `improved' d'Arcis Memorandum.>I never knew about the shroud until 2009 and I found out about it from atheists of all people. Oh the irony When I `discovered' the Shroud in 2005 and posted a comment to a news article about it shortly after, on my now closed Creation Evolution Design Yahoo group, I found the atheists in the group knew a lot about it. Having only read Stevenson & Habermas' 1981 \"Verdict on the Shroud\" I didn't know anything about the Shroud's 1988 C14 dating, but I was in the midst of my Bachelor of Science degree, so I answered them using what I knew about C14 dating in general, until I could catch up on my reading about that.Stephen E.

I really think what we have here are 2 possibilities .>>1. They have a very liberal theology kind of stance towards the supernatural or From what I have read of Chevalier and Thurston, they were `progressive' Catholics who sought to rid the Catholic Church of its links with `embarrassing' medieval relics.They had their contemporary counterparts in liberal Protestant theologians who wanted to rid the Protestant Church of links to `embarrassing' Biblical miracles.I don't disagree that most RC relics are fakes and it is dishonest that the Vatican refuses to state which relics are authentic, like the Shroud, and which are fakes. But the problem with Chevalier and Thurston is that they sought to `throw out the baby with the bathwater.\" Indeed, they LIED in order to discredit the Shroud, which shows that concern for truth was not what motivated them.>2. They are afraid of being embarrassed in front of their materialistically leaning colleagues .That may have been true at the beginning of their careers, but so powerful is the indoctrination in Naturalism in Science, and Academia generally (including many theological colleges), that from my experience of over a decade (1984 2005) debating Creation/Evolution, these `Theistic Naturalists' are VERY enthusiastic in denying the supernatural, even Biblical miracles.>It's clear that something emotional is motivating this anti authenticity or anti super naturalism bias of theirs.The emotion probably comes from the inner tension of trying to serve two incompatible masters. Mt 6:24: \"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.\"in this case supernatural Biblical Christianity and Naturalism (\"nature is all there is: there is no supernatural\").And so Christians like me, who try to be consistent supernaturalists (i.e. Accept supernatural causation when the evidence points to it and naturalistic explanations don't work), presumably make them feel guilty deep down, which is why the Fence Sitter and his `Christian' ilk are so opposed to me, and tolerant of, if not actually on the side of, Anti Christians like Charles Freeman.It doesn't bother me, indeed on the contrary it confirms to me that I am on the right track:Jn 15:18 20: 18 \"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. 19 If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. 20 Remember the word that I said to you: `A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.\"And I know that if they don't repent, the Lord with repay them for any evil:Rom 12:19. \"Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, `Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.'\"they have directed at me for simply seeking to serve Jesus as the Man on the Shroud.[continued].","date":"2014-11-03","mins":"8:43 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>Hughes slandering posts and then his inability to back them up just smacks of hidden intentions and diversionary tactics.I presume you mean Hugh Farey?

Believe only in what they DO.\"And what they DO is act like anti Christian \"skeptics\" as you noted.And oppose me, who seeks to be a consistent Biblical Christian, in my support of the authenticity of the Shroud, and they support ANTI Christians like Charles Freeman.Jesus warned that there would be MANY on the Day of Judgement who THOUGHT they were Christians but WERE NOT:Mt 7:21 23. \"Not everyone who says to me, `Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one WHO DOES THE WILL OF MY FATHER who is in heaven. 22 On that day MANY will say to me, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' 23 And then will I declare to them, `I NEVER KNEW YOU; depart from me, you WORKERS OF LAWLESSNESS.'\" (my emphasis).Who are those \"many\" if it does not include them?

Art historian Thomas de Wesselow says in his book, \"The Sign\" (2012) that the modern art world simply ignores the Shroud, as though it doesn't exist. But as John Walsh pointed out, the Shroud is either authentic, or it is the greatest work of art of all time:\" Only this much is certain: The Shroud of Turin is either the most awesome and instructive relic of Jesus Christ in existence showing us in its dark simplicity how He appeared to men or it is one of the most ingenious, most unbelievably clever, products of the human mind and hand on record.

However, Wilson in 1998 (see below) says the 1997 fire was arson. Here are quotes about the 1997 fire on my system mentioning \"arson\" (my emphases below):\"Then, in the hour before the midnight of April 11, came the highly publicised fire. Although the Shroud itself was saved, all that had been its environs during the last four hundred years lay a tangled, blackened and water drenched mess. The once gleaming bullet proof display case had had to be most energetically smashed in order for the Shroud to be rescued. Where once there had been a three hundred year old wall of glass separating the Royal Chapel from the main body of the Cathedral there was now empty space. The Royal Chapel's dome was now in a far more dangerous state than before the restoration work began. Worst affected of all was the actual lining of the walls of the Royal Chapel. Likewise the adjoining part of the Royal Palace where STURP did its testing work in 1978, much of its splendid baroque ornament and valuable paintings having been ruined beyond repair. And BEHIND THE WHOLE EPISODE LAY THE DARK SPECTRE OF ARSON and sabotage on the part of as yet unidentified enemies of the Shroud, the Church and all that these represent. ... The Cause of the fire. According to the latest available information, as given at a Press Conference on 24 April, the exact cause of the fire is not yet known. However an overloading of the Palace electrical circuits has been ruled out, and ARSON SEEMS STRONGLY SUSPECTED. Some reports have spoken of a cryptic telephoned warning shortly beforehand, also signs that it started seemingly in two separate places at the same time (i) in wooden and aluminium scaffolding just above the roof of the passageway connecting the palace with the Royal Chapel, and (ii) inside the Chapel itself. The finding of a discarded petrol can has also been mentioned. The difficulty lies choosing between the several plausible categories of possible suspects. ... Whoever was responsible, if the fire was arson, then it will certainly not have been the first attempt to destroy the Shroud is this way. There was another in 1972, in which an intruder broke into the Royal Chapel after climbing over the Palace roof.\" (Wilson, I., 1997, \"Editorial: When Everything Seems Against You...,\" BSTS Newsletter, No: 45, June/July).[continued].","date":"2014-11-03","mins":"11:22 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">I haven't read The Fence Sitter's blog since 8th May, ...The Lord spoke to me in my quiet time this morning, that I should cease mentioning Dan Porter (aka \"The Fence Sitter\"), and his blog, in my blog.He can attack me all he likes, but I will from now on ignore him and his blog, unless he or any of his blog's members make comments on this my blog.So mentioning of Dan Porter, and his blog, and his blog's members in connection with Porter's blog, is henceforth off topic on my blog.Stephen E.

It is the EVIDENCE that matters.>It took me 2 years to even consider having an opinion on the shroud, and when I first studied it I made myself only visit anti authenticist shroud sites to make sure I wasn't wasting my time researching the shroud. It took Shroud.com's Barrie Schwortz 17 years:\"Mr Schwortz referred to the scientific evidence that is `the basis for my opinion that the shroud cannot be an artwork. STURP's data provided empirical evidence to that effect, although the sceptics of the world continue to deny it'. He continued: `Remember that I am Jewish (not Messianic), and it took nearly 17 years after our direct examination of the cloth before the scientific evidence actually convinced me of the shroud's authenticity. It was the science that did it.\" (Barrett, D.V., \"Expert dismisses historian's claim that Turin Shroud was made for medieval ritual,\" Catholic Herald, 29 October 2014).>So no, not all people on both sides embrace any theory as true.Agreed.>Im sure it took Stephen jones even longer to come to a conclusion on the shroud, not without much research and contemplation. Actually, after I was midway through reading Stevenson & Habermas' book, \"Verdict on the Shroud\" (1981), in January 2005, which only took a few days, I provisionally accepted the Shroud was authentic, subject to it passing the tests of further evidence. Which is still my position today. Except that after 9 years of continually exposing myself to all the evidence for and against the Shroud, and it passing all tests with flying colours, it is extremely unlikely that there is any evidence out there that would negate the MOUNTAIN of evidence for the Shroud's authenticity that I now know.Indeed, the WEAKNESS of the LEADING anti authenticist's (like Freeman) evidence and arguments is itself evidence that the Shroud is authentic. They are these days just a RABBLE of mutually CONTRADICTORY theories (e.g. Freeman's 14th century painter and Farey's 14th century accident), who are united only in their antipathy towards the authenticity of the Shroud!Stephen E.

It is still PREPOSTEROUS that the Shroud's image could have resulted from \"the accidental result of the passage of time on some other image.\"Microscopic and ultraviolet, etc, examinations of the Shroud by STURP, and others, have failed to find any evidence of an original image on the Shroud, and they would have found evidence of it if it had been there.Also you simply ignore all the historical and artistic evidence for the Shroud's existence well before the 14th century and all the way back to the 1st century.You HAVE TO be biased against the Shroud's authenticity to do that.The evidence is so strong for the Shroud's authenticity that even agnostics like Thomas de Wesselow and Ian Wilson, have been forced by that evidence to accept that the Shroud is authentic. And I myself, an evangelical Protestant, who had no reason to believe a `Roman Catholic medieval relic,' as I regarded the Shroud to be, was authentic, was also forced by the evidence to accept that it is. And do you really think that Jesus, who is ruling over all (Acts 10:36; Rom 9:5; Eph 1:21 22; Php 2:9), would allow millions of Christians down through the ages (including me) to be fooled by such a convincing \"accident\"?[continued].","date":"2014-10-31","mins":"12:23 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>d) You. \"united only in their antipathy towards the authenticity of the Shroud!\" I cannot speak for Freeman, who seems to have drifted away from Catholicism, but I certainly have no antipathy towards the authenticity of the Shroud, nor to those who think it authentic.

Going by polls of the equivalent to the Royal Society in the USA, the National Academy of Sciences, the members of the Royal Society would probably be 90 95% atheist/agnostics.

Telegraph.co.uk My response to Guy Walters and his critique Published: 5:19 PM BST 15 Apr 2010 Surprising as it may seem, I share Guy Walters' frustrations at \"the enormous amount of junk history around\". This therefore makes it all the more galling that Walters should have chosen me, Ian Wilson, as his number one target, lumping my books into this category without, on his own admission, having bothered to read a single word of them. By Ian Wilson, M.A. (Oxon.)The first rule of the professional historian is surely to familiarise himself with what he is writing about, thus avoiding the sort of \"ignorance and misconceptions\" that Walters says he so abhors. Yet Walters clearly saw no need to follow this rule when he rushed out his blog about me, condemning my standards as a professional author. First, Walters questioned my right to be \"labelled a historian\". The facts are that I am a history graduate of Magdalen College, Oxford, where I studied under A.J.P.Taylor and others. I graduated with honours in 1963, and was conferred an M.A. In 1977. Walters fails to mention the historical biography of Shakespeare, Shakespeare: The Evidence, which I wrote in 1994. No nonsense Oxford historian the late Dr. A.L.Rowse, reviewed this in the London Evening Standard as: \"Full of good sense. The reader will not go wrong with it Ian Wilson is conscientious, as a good Oxford man should be.\" Second, and compounding his ignorance, Walters has assumed that I must be a card carrying adherent of every topic that I write about. Had he actually consulted the books he might have found this to be very far from the case. In my book on reincarnation (Mind out of Time? 1981), I debunked the then popular myth that hypnotic regression could lead back to past incarnations. In Stigmata I showed this phenomenon to have a psychological rather than any spiritual origination. In Nostradamus: The Evidence I expressly showed the falsity of Nostradamus' prophetic reputation. Third, Walters is completely misinformed in supposing that Before the Flood speculated on the existence of Atlantis. I am no more a believer in Atlantis than Walters is. Likewise my The Blood and the Shroud did not argue for a \"thermonuclear reaction\" having corrupted the carbon dating texts. Nor in four decades of Shroud researches have I ever called myself a \"sindonologist\", a term I dislike as much as he does. Professing Christianity these days does not court popularity, and some of the subjects that I write about are undeniably controversial. However if Mr. Walters actually deigned to read my latest book The Shroud, published last month by Bantam Press, he would see that, although it is directed to the general reader, I maintain the critical standards appropriate to a trained historian. The extensive historical references that I have cited are not the garbage sources that typify true \"junk history\". They are solid academic publications in every instance. Mr.Walters has acted recklessly and in complete ignorance thereby abandoning his own professed historical standards. © 2010.","date":"2016-08-05","mins":"10:01 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2010/04/ian-wilsons-turin-shroud-theories-are.html","title":"\n`Ian Wilson's Turin Shroud theories are the worst kind of junk history'\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"This is Guy Walters' critique of Wilson, which is no longer online, but I had saved it as a text file. Telegraph.co.uk Ian Wilson's Turin Shroud theories are the worst kind of junk history By Guy Walters Politics Last updated: April 13th, 2010 The Shroud of Turin (Photo: Telegraph)If one object encapsulates the practice of junk history more than any other, then it's the Turin Shroud, which is currently on display until May 23. Those who study this piece of cloth grandly call themselves sindonologists, as if concocting crackpot theories about a 13th or 14th century hoax were a legitimate branch of academia. Their high priest is one Ian Wilson, who the BBC flatteringly refers to as a \"historian\".Quite why Wilson deserves this job description is unclear, because his works have little to do with history, and instead are books that hail from a strange sector of publishing nicely captured by Peter Wilson in The Independent in 2001:Pick an ancient riddle to unravel. Mix together a pinch of history, a splash of archaeology, a soupçon of theology, lashings of first person travelogue and a hefty dose of maps. Then flavour it with talk of the pyramids, the Inca sacred sites, the truth behind the Bible and obstructive, conspiratorial clerics. Finally, garnish in a bold cover with gold letters and a sensational title about a lost civilisation, a missing continent or extra terrestrial life. Watch the copies walk out of the bookshops.A look at Wilson's back catalogue sheds little light on why he should be labelled a historian. My favourites are The Turin Shroud: The Burial Cloth of Jesus Christ? (1979); The Evidence of the Shroud (1986); Holy Faces, Secret Places: An Amazing Quest for the Face of Jesus (1991); The Blood and the Shroud: New Evidence That the World's Most Sacred Relic Is Real (1998); The Turin Shroud: Unshrouding the Mystery (2000); and his latest shlockbuster, The Shroud : the 2000 Year Old Mystery Solved (2010). Are you spotting a patten here?Wilson has also written about stigmata, reincarnation, and yep, you guessed it, Nostradamus. It's clear that Wilson's \"historical\" enquiries are little more than excuses to peddle the type of bilge that appeals to those who believe in The Da Vinci Code. I don't have time to read Wilson's books, but it's clear from their reviews that his imagination easily outstrips that of Dan Brown. For example, in Before the Flood (2001), Wilson speculates on the existence of Atlantis. But my favourite is The Blood and the Shroud, in which Wilson wonders whether the resurrection of Jesus took the form of a small thermonuclear reaction that corrupted the carbon dating tests made on the Shroud.You couldn't make it up. Neither could I.

I didn't see it. But Jackson's paper I posted predicts that any reverse side image would be \"less intense\":\"It is likely, however, that if a frontal image discoloration exists on the reverse surface of the Shroud, it would be somewhat less intense than the discoloration which is observed on the normal viewing side because that side presumably entered the body first.\"Besides, it is not necessarily so that \"the image on the reverse side of the Shroud contains ... Not the rest of the body.\"The second image's discoverer, Prof. Giulio Fanti, says that a second image of the rest of the body may be there, but \"masked by the noise of the digital [sic. Frontal?] image itself\":\"`Though the image is very faint, features such as nose, eyes, hair, beard and moustache are clearly visible. There are some slight differences with the known face. For example, the nose on the reverse side shows the same extension of both nostrils, unlike the front side, in which the right nostril is less evident,' Fanti said. But the enhancing procedure did not uncover the full body image as it appeared on the front side. `If it does exist, it is masked by the noise of the digital image itself. But we found what it is probably the image of the hands,' Fanti said.\" (\"Turin shroud shows another mystery face,\" (Rossella Lorenzi, Discovery News/ABC Science, 12 April 2004).Since Jackson's theory is that the intensity of the image is a function of how long was the time a body part fell through the radiation:\"The initial draping configuration of the Shroud over a body establishes the initial cloth body distances. If, then, the Shroud overlying the body falls into the body region, different points on the cloth will intersect the body surface at different times depending upon how far that point was originally away from the body. Thus, each cloth point will receive a radiation dose in proportion to the time that it is inside the emitting body region.\"the head and hands would be expected to show up more clearly on the reverse image because they were the highest body parts of the Man in the Shroud (due to His bent forward crucifixion position, fixed by rigor mortis) and therefore they received the most radiation.Stephen E.

Could I please have a link or reference to where: “Linda T.

Here is my quote at http://members.iinet.net.au/~sejones/quotes/T So T/stuc0706.html being referred to: “I wrote to the Rev A Dreisbach of the AICCSST (Atlanta International Centre for Continuing Study and Exhibit of the Shroud of Turin) to see if he knew anything about the carbon dating of the sudarium in Arizona. Unfortunately, his answer was negative … However, he did make some other very interesting points. In relation to the dust particles on the nasal area of the Shroud, he mentions an analysis carried out on particles from the foot area. He says: `microscopic dirt particles taken from the foot area during the 1978 examination were eventually analysed by Joseph Kohlbek at the Hercules Aerospace Laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah and found to be travertine aragonite – a rare form of calcite also found near the Damascus Gate (i.e. The one closest to Golgotha) in Jerusalem. That finding was later confirmed by Dr Levi Setti using an electron probe microscope at the Enrico Fermi Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois.’ This interesting information is further proof that the Shroud is that of Jesus, because no forger, either pious or impious, nobody who made a portrait of Christ, for whatever reason, would ever think of including such details, which would have been ignored anyway until this present age with its microscopic possibilities.” (Guscin, M., “The Oviedo Cloth,” Lutterworth Press: Cambridge UK, 1998, pp.78 79) The words of Dreisbach’s that I left out and replaced by ellipses in the above quote were: “I regret that I am not informed about the details of Dr Baima Ballone’s `highly contaminated’ sample of the Oviedo Cloth which he had sent as gas in leaky capsules to Dr Paul Damon at Tucson. My best guess would be that he acquired them in 1994 when he was present in Oviedo with that group and Alan Whanger, M.D. Of Duke University.” As can be seen, this has nothing to do with the issue of “travertine aragonite – a rare form of calcite also found near the Damascus Gate (i.e. The one closest to Golgotha) in Jerusalem” being found near the feet area of the Shroud, which was the topic of my quote.

His name appears first on the 1989 Nature article of those from Oxford: “… C.R. Bronk,3 E. T. Hall,3 R. E. M. Hedges, 3 R. Housley,3 I. A. Law,3 C. Perry,3 … 3 – Research Laboratory for Archaeology and History of Art, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3 QJ, UK …” As such he would have been aware that a 200 X microscope examination of the Shroud sample provided to Oxford revealed that it contained cotton which “may have been used for repairs at some time in the past”: “COTTON ON THE OXFORD CARBON DATING SAMPLE Kindly brought to our attention by the Revd. Kim Dreisbach of Atlanta is a hitherto unnoticed report in the journal Textile Horizons of December 1988 concerning the Shroud sample supplied to the Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratory. Apparently the British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd of Ambergate, Derbyshire was asked by the Oxford laboratory to help identify certain ‘foreign’ fibres observed, isolated and extracted from the Shroud sample prior to its destruction during the carbon dating process. According to Precision Processes managing director, Peter South: `It was while the sample was undergoing tests at the radiocarbon acceleration unit in Oxford that Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place. He mentioned this to his friend Sir James Spooner, chairman of Coats Viyella, to which our firm belongs. Consequently, after several telephone calls, the minute samples, which looked like human hair, were sent to us.’ Magnified two hundred times by a Precision Processes microscope the fibres became immediately identified as cotton. … Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.” (Wilson, I., “Cotton on the Oxford Carbon Dating Sample,” British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter, No. 26, September/October 1990, pp.7 8). But Oxford’s problem was that the Tucson Arizona lab had already run its carbon dating test on 6 May 1988, which dated the Shroud at 1350 AD. Then the Zurich lab had run its test nearly 3 weeks later on 26 May, which agreed with Tucson’s date. Oxford eventually submitted its results on 8 August, over 3 months after Tucson’s. So if the cotton was part of a medieval repair and Oxford had removed it, and then dated the remaining pure linen, and the result then was that the date of Oxford’s sample was now much older than that of the other two labs, it would be a major scientific embarrassment, and a public relations disaster for the new AMS method of radiocarbon dating. In that case, what would a young scientist entrusted with such a major radiocarbon dating do? Announce that the other two labs had badly bungled their tests? Or run a carbon dating on another of their several sub samples, complete with cotton, which would give a date broadly in agreement with the other two labs? If something like this did happen, it would explain why Ramsey/Bronk would have to defend the consensus radiocarbon dating of 1260 1390 AD, unless something like Jackson’s carbon monoxide contamination theory gave all three labs an honourable way out. But to admit that the labs tested a cotton contaminated patch of the Shroud would not be an honourable way out. Especially as Oxford knew that their sample was contaminated with cotton..","date":"2012-01-01","mins":"9:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/01/di-lazzaros-gambit/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Di Lazzaro’s Gambit"},{"id":"comment-6290","author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"It is worth noting that the ” C.R.

Linick and the German hacker Karl Koch, who confessed to working for the KGB. The latter's death on 1 June 1989 was contrived to look like suicide and it could only have been the KGB. And since Koch had already confessed all his selling of military and computer secrets to the KGB he must have been killed by them to prevent him confessing some different hacking for the KGB, which the KGB was much more concerned about. The KGB's involvement in the hacking of the Shroud's C14 dating fits that bill, and nothing else does. In 1988 the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, and it did collapse in 1989. The USSR and its Eastern Bloc satellites had HUGE Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox populations. A 1st or early century C14 dating of the Shroud would have been a nightmare scenario to that Atheist regime.If Linick has contacted the KGB offering to ensure the Shroud C14 dated to just before 1350, the KGB would have jumped at the chance.And Linick was found dead on 4 June 1989, in \"mysterious circumstances,\" and his death was suspected to have been suicide.But that was when Linick was FOUND dead. Allowing for the time zone differences between Germany and Arizona, it is possible that both Koch and Linick `committed suicide' on the SAME DAY, or at most only a few days apart. Also, after the first C14 dating of the Shroud to the `bull's eye' date of 1350, leaks to the media started which said the date was 1350. Ian Wilson later worked out that the Rev. David Sox, who was a former Secretary of the British Society of the Turin Shroud, but who had turned anti authenticist, was the leaker to the media. But Sox was not in Arizona when the Shroud was dated, so the primary leaker to Sox had to be a member of Arizona lab's staff.And Sox actually published a book, \"The Shroud Unmasked: Uncovering the Greatest Forgery of All Time,\" in August 1988. Oxford did its dating on August 8, 1988, and there is no mention of Oxford's result in Sox's book. In that book, Sox quotes Linick, as being anti authentist:\"The night before the test Damon told Gove he would not be surprised to see the analysis yield a date around the fifth century, because after that time the crucifixion was banned and a forger would not have known of the details depicted so accurately on the Shroud. TIMOTHY LINICK, a University of Arizona research scientist, said: `IF WE SHOW THE MATERIAL TO BE MEDIEVAL THAT WOULD DEFINITELY MEAN THAT IT IS NOT AUTHENTIC. If we date it back 2000 years, of course, that still leaves room for argument. It would be the right age but is it the real thing?'\" (Sox, H.D., 1988, \"The Shroud Unmasked: Uncovering the Greatest Forgery of All Time, p.147. My emphasis).Remember that Sox was not there in Arizona in May 1988 at their dating. And why would he quote Linick who was not one of the leaders of the Arizona labs? The simplest explanation is that Sox got his Arizona leaks from Linick. And if Linick was the hacker it would have been part of his plan to create a climate of expectation that the Shroud was dated about 1350.[continued].","date":"2014-05-08","mins":"9:47 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus-my.html","title":"\n\"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus\": My response to Dan Porter\n"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]And at worst they are not Christians at all, but are what the Apostle Paul called, \"FALSE [Gk.

They took the side of the atheists against their fellow Christians in arguing for FULLY NATURALISTIC evolution. It is of course POSSIBLE that God used a fully naturalistic process to originate and develop life, and also to create the image on the Shroud. But the EVIDENCE IS AGAINST both.

They argue for the Atheist side (or at least won't argue against it) and don't see any problem with providing God's enemies with ammunition to use against their fellow Christians.

The MOUNTAIN of evidence that the Shroud existed well before 1260, indeed all the way back to the 1st century, is proof beyond REASONABLE doubt that the 1260 1390 = 1325 +/ 1325 radiocarbon date of the Shroud was WRONG.Indeed, as I have pointed out in my posts, \"My theory that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker #5\" and #6, Table 2 of the 1989 Nature paper, with its admission, that: \"An initial inspection of Table 2 shows that the agreement among the three laboratories for samples 2, 3 and 4 [non Shroud controls] is exceptionally good. The spread of the measurements for sample 1 [the Shroud] is somewhat greater than would be expected from the errors quoted\" shows that the Shroud sample's dates were not real dates, but were computer generated (e.g. By Timothy W. Linick's hacker program).Since samples 1 (the Shroud) and 2, 3 and 4 [non Shroud controls] were all on the one ~26 mm or ~1 inch carousel wheel and each sample was irradiated in turn for 1 minute, the whole run taking 10 minutes, there is NO WAY that the Shroud samples could have a spread of different C14 dates AND \"the agreement among the three laboratories for samples 2, 3 and 4\" be \"exceptionally good.\"Something MAJOR must have gone wrong (e.g. The Shroud dates are not real dates but computer generated), and the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud should have been declared FAILED.But the labs went too far out on a limb publicly to admit that, and so they HAD to pretend that the Shroud's dating was valid, when it WASN'T.

Again he is deceiving himself.

So where are all the other 14th century shrouds and artworks produced by these \"printing techniques\"? And what 14th century \"printing techniques\" can print an image on linen that is one flax cell wall (\"one fifth of a thousandth of a millimetre\" or 0.0002 mm) deep? With no ink (the Shroud image is not paint, dye or pigment but a physical change to the linen fibres).>Further the argument is reinforced with analytical results showing that under any reasonable assumption about the surface bi directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) including the use of measured human skin data, the observed 3 d properties cannot be reconciled with any known radiative imaging process and thus must be a contact process.Again, it CANT have been a contact process because the Shroud's image shows recessed areas of the Man's body which could not have been in contact with the cloth.

A particular oddity that he discovered of the Shroud `blood's' bile pigments was that these seemed to contain what he called `an extraordinarily high' level of the pigment bilirubin, giving rise to the question why this should be so. As he explained: `... A torture, scourging and crucifixion leading to shock that would produce a tremendous hemolysis [break up of red blood corpuscles IW]. In less than 30 seconds the haemolyzed haemoglobin will run through the liver, building up a very high bilirubin. If that blood then clots the exudate forms, and all the intact cells with haemoglobin stay behind, only the haemolyzed goes out along with the serum albumin which bind the bilirubin. So what one ends up with on the cloth is an exudate which has an enhanced bilirubin index with respect to the haemolyzed haemoglobin. You now mix bilirubin which is yellow orange with methaemoglobin in its para hemic form, which is an orangey brown, and you get blood which has a red colour.'\" (Wilson, I., 1998\"The Blood and the Shroud,\" p.89). Note that Adler's tests did find \"an extraordinarily high\" level of bilirubin in Shroud blood.

However, another explanation for the red color may be due to Saponaria treatment of the cloth.\" (Zugibe, F.T., 2005, \"The Crucifixion of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry,\" p.177).Of which there is experimental evidence by STURP:\"It is worth noting that, if the cloth was washed using soapwort, it might also help explain the reddish colour of the bloodstains, since Saponaria solutions are haemolytic, i.e. They break down red blood cells and release the haemoglobin. Apparently, this was tested before the STURP team went to Turin by applying blood to linen washed with soapwort, and twenty five years later this blood was still red, whereas control samples on ordinary linen had turned black. This is an alternative explanation to that proposed by Adler, but it does not necessarily invalidate his conclusion that the blood belonged to a badly injured person.\" (de Wesselow, T., 2012, \"The Sign,\" p.111).Berry claims to be speaking for science, but since when is it scientific to:1. Depend on personal abuse to make up for the weakness of one's arguments?2. Fail to research thoroughly the literature of the hypothesis that one is attempting to refute?3. Ignore the mountain of other evidence in favour of the overall theory one is trying to refute, with a single \"molehill\" item of apparently contrary evidence?Science does not throw out a theory that is backed by a large number of different lines of evidence, because of one claimed problem.

It was clear that Bernstein uncritically accepted everything Mc Crone wrote on the Shroud as Gospel Truth and he even during the Q&A at the end of the lecture ignorantly claimed of Mc Crone’s analysis of STURP’s 32 tapes that “no one had ever written a book saying `this guy [Mc Crone] got it wrong.'” I responded by inviting Prof. Bernstein to read John Heller’s Report on the Shroud of Turin and/or Ian Wilson’s The Blood and the Shroud where Mc Crone’s claims that the Shroud was a painting and that the blood was just iron oxide and vermilion were comprehensively refuted. But he seemed uninterested. It is ironic that Prof. Bernstein used pro authenticity Shroud research as a prime example of “pathological science” and Mc Crone’s anti authenticity research as “good science,” when the boot is well and truly on the other foot! And Prof. Bernstein himself is hardly engaging in “good science” when he lectures on a subject without bothering to read extensively the other side. But then from my analogous experience in the Creation/Intelligent Design vs Evolution debate, that is the whole point of demonising Shroud pro authenticity research as “bad” and even “pathological science” or just “faith.” Then, like the proverbial ostrich with its head in the sand, you don’t even have to consider the non naturalistic other side!

Jones to Attend and Report on Lecture by Joel Bernstein"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">See also Adler's paper \"Chemical and Physical Characteristics of the Blood Stains,\" on page 135 of his \"The Orphaned Manuscript,\" which I will eventually scan and it will be placed online (probably early to mid this year) by Barrie Schwortz, in his Shroud Spectrum International archive.I have today scanned pages 60 61 of Adler's \"The Orphaned Manuscript,\" which is part of an article of his, \"The Origin and Nature of Blood on the Turin Shroud\" (1986).On page 61, Adler wrote (my emphasis):\"The next test we did was to take micro spectrum photometry on the nonbirefringent red coated fibrils from the Shroud. It was obvious that the spectrum it produced did not match the spectrum of methemoglobin, at least as it is given in the standard references, which is a solution spectrum of blood. But in a film of hemoglobin there is a confirmation change; it no longer remains in the `met' form but goes to the para hemic form. It is known now that there is a certain species which will spontaneously go to the para hemic form if there is not enough turn over in the spleen and the liver to process the blood fast enough. We found a spectrum that was characteristic of only one known group of compounds — the so called high spin, high iron porphyrins. So instead of being wrong, the spectrum peaks were in the right place. What we were seeing was the breakdown products of hemoglobin — bilirubin and biliverdin. And one began to make sense out of all this. There is AN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH BILIRUBIN COUNT, almost as high as the methemoglobin. Now how does one account for such a high bilirubin in a person? One possibility is that the person had a severe malaria, but this does not seem very likely. But A TORTURE, SCOURGING AND CRUCIFIXION LEADING TO SHOCK — THAT WOULD PRODUCE A TREMENDOUS HEMOLYSIS. In less than 30 seconds, the hemolyzed hemoglobin will run through the liver, building up a very high bilirubin content in the blood. If that blood then clots, the exudate forms, and all the intact cells with hemoglobin stay behind, only the hemolyzed hemoglobin goes out along with THE SERUM ALBUMIN WHICH BINDS THE BILIRUBIN. So what one ends up with on the cloth is AN EXUDATE WHICH HAS AN ENHANCED BILIRUBIN INDEX with respect to the hemolyzed hemoglobin. You now mix bilirubin which is yellow orange with methemoglobin in its para hemic form which is an orangey brown and YOU GET BLOOD WHICH HAS A RED COLOR.In fact, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIMULATE THIS SPECTRUM IN THE LABORATORY BY THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE. This very strongly suggests that the blood stains are of a man who was severely beaten. No one would have ever dreamed, when we first started doing the analysis, that THE CHEMISTRY WOULD PROVIDE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE to what the pathologists concluded long ago about the Shroud figure. The blood has no cells, is very low in potassium, and HAS THE RIGHT COLOUR AND COMPOSITION FOR THE BLOOD OF A MAN WHO WAS SEVERELY FLOGGED AND CRUCIFIED. This is entirely consistent with the forensic evidence.\"Hopefully \"The Orphaned Manuscript\" will be online in May as part of Barrie Schwortz's next Shroud.com update, if I can finish scanning it by then.

I have in the past stated on my blog I am not against further testing of the Shroud and that is still my position. In the context it is only radiocarbon dating that I was referring to. And it isn’t that I am against radiocarbon dating, but that given that: a) there is so much evidence for the Shroud’s authenticity, b) further radiocarbon dating be unlikely to be conclusive; and c) it would have to destroy more and from all areas of the Shroud to be representative. However, if the Vatican allowed a new round of radiocarbon dating, I would not be against it. If such a C 14 test was conducted properly this time I would confidently expect the C 14 date of the Shroud to be a lot closer to the 1st century, but because of centuries of contamination which has become part of the Shroud’s carbon, I would not be surprised if it was 4th century. As for your term “ridiculous computer hacker hypothesis” you are entitled to your opinion. But as (from memory) you are merely an ex businessman on social security with no science qualifications, I see no reason why I should be swayed by it. Your running a blog and issuing editorials from `on high’ blasting the views if those you disagree with (like me) as “ridiculous,” while it may `poison the well’ against me in the minds of some of your readers, does not make you right. I have stated the evidence for my `the laboratories were duped by a computer hacker’ theory: 1. As Clifford Stoll revealed in his 1989 book, “The Cockoo’s Egg”, in the 1980s university computers were all interconnected; and they were poorly secured. I mentioned in passing that not long after that era, in the early 1990s, I was a UNIX Systems Administrator of a widely distributed hospital computer network, I have some expertise in that area. 2. In the very era the Shroud was being C 14 dated, 1980s, there were numerous successful unauthorised hacks of university and even military computers. The hacker, Markus Hess, who hacked into Stoll’s Berkeley University computer network, was dialing in from Germany and hacked into 400 different university and military computers. 3. The very first AMS date of the Shroud at Arizona University’s C 14 lab was the `bull’s eye’ date AD1350. 4. Gove and those present, including those who thought the Shroud was authentic uncritically accepted that date as the date the Shroud’s flax was harvested. Even though before the test Gove thought the Shroud would date from 1000 +/ 100 years. 5. So if a hacker by that `perfect date’ was using shrewd psychology to overcome resistance, it worked! 6. But for that AD 1350 date to be true: a) the flax would have to have been harvested only 5 years before the Shroud was displayed at Lirey, France, in 1355; and 2) Arizona laboratory’s pre treatment would have had to be perfect removing all traces of non original carbon. 7. Agnostic Thomas de Wesselow considers fraud to be a real possibility in the 1988 C 14 dating of the Shroud, because the 1325 +/ 65 years C 14 date of the Shroud is just what a fraudster who wished to discredit the Shroud would use. 8. Ian Wilson, who knew many of the labs’ leadership, believes they were basically honest. But fraud did not have to be by the laboratories. Computer hacking is a type of fraud which could have duped the laboratories because most of those dating the Shroud thought the Shroud was a fake. My theory that a hacker accessed the online control console computer at the three C 14 labs and overrode the Shroud’s dates coming from their same AMS dating systems, and replaced them with 14th century dates, which together produced a date of the Shroud, the midpoint of which is only 25 30 years before the Shroud appeared at Lirey in the 1350s, fits all the above facts. It is not impossible, given the interconnected and insecure university computers of the 1980s, and given the inexplicability of the 1988 AD 1260 1390 C 14 dating of the Shroud, it is a real possibility, if not a probability, Stephen E.

That is 65 years before the earliest 1260 radiocarbon date of the Shroud. And the drawings within the Codex, which depict the \"poker holes\" (and 7 other unique features on the Shroud, according to agnostic art historian Thomas de Wesselow), must be even older than that. Therefore the Pray Codex drawings alone refute the 1260 1390 radiocarbon date of the Shroud.13) The Pray Codex was discovered in 1770 by György Pray, presumably in the archives of the University of Nagy Szombat in Slovakia where Pray was then a professor of theology. The codex and its drawings had presumably been there unrecognised since 1285 when the Boldva monastery was destroyed by the Mongols and the monks fled. The unknown, hypothetical, medieval forger of the Shroud, in addition to his other `superhuman' museum and art gallery (which didn't then exist) travels, would have had to travel to Hungary or Slovakia, discover the Codex written in Old Hungarian, and the drawings inside it, copy 8 features on those drawings including the \"poker holes,\" and incorporate them also into his hypothetical Shroud forgery.Shroud sceptics can respond with the glib answer that the forger incorporated the Vignon markings and Pray Codex features in his forgery, but no Shroud sceptic has actually proposed a COMPREHENSIVE forgery theory which plausibly explains in detail HOW and WHEN the forger did it (let alone WHY), museum by museum, art gallery by art gallery, marking by marking. If a Shroud sceptic had attempted to develop such a comprehensive forgery theory, he must have quietly given up, when he realised its IMPLAUSIBILITY (if not IMPOSSIBILITY). >Many thanks in advance for anything you can tell me,[...] I hope this has helped you to realise that you were indeed right the first time!Stephen E.

The artist who had painted it.\" (Wilson, I., 1979, \"The Shroud of Turin,\" pp.266 267).If the artist who had painted the Shroud's image of a completely naked Jesus, showing His buttocks, and scourge marks around His genitals, had been discovered by Bishop de Poitiers, the forger would have been arrested, charged, tried, found guilty of blasphemy, and burned at the stake. There then would have been a record of his arrest, trial and execution, and the forger name would have been cited by Bishop d'Arcis, who was a lawyer. That d'Arcis cited no name of the forger, or details of his trial and execution, shows there never was a forger, and d'Arcis was at best misinformed, and at worst lying.Stephen E.

But there are still more proofs accumulating for the Shroud's authenticity, e.g. As briefly mentioned in my post above, Markwardt's evidence in his paper, \"Ancient Edessa and the Shroud: History Concealed by the Discipline of the Secret\" that the Shroud was known in the second century AD, but was concealed by allegorical language. >As a side note, I have also found your 2037 interpretation to be quite an interesting conclusion, and am continuing to reflect and read up on your line of reasoning.

This was such a good collection of articles and thoughts.Thanks for your comment and for the link on your blog, Path of the Weis.>I love how this one takes a nice swing at the silly claim of the JW claim. One wonders what in the world they are thinking sometimes.They don't think for themselves. The Watchtower Society warns J Ws to \"Avoid Independent Thinking\" (my emphasis bold):\"Avoid Independent Thinking From the very outset of his rebellion Satan called into question God's way of doing things. He promoted independent thinking. `You can decide for yourself what is good and bad,' Satan told Eve. `You don't have to listen to God. He is not really telling you the truth.' (Genesis 3:1 5) To this day, it has been Satan's subtle design to infect God's people with this type of thinking. 2 Timothy 3:1, 13. How is such independent thinking manifested? A common way is by questioning the counsel that is provided by God's visible organization. ....\" (\"Exposing the Devil's Subtle Designs,\" The Watchtower, January 15, 1983, pp.18 22, p.22)and even to \"Fight Against Independent Thinking\":\"Fight Against Independent Thinking As we study the Bible we learn that Jehovah has always guided his servants in an organized way. And just as in the first century there was only one true Christian organization, so today Jehovah is using only one organization. (Ephesians 4:4, 5; Matthew 24:45 47) Yet there are some who point out that the organization has had to make adjustments before, and so they argue: `This shows that we have to make up our own mind on what to believe.' This is independent thinking. Why is it so dangerous? Such thinking is an evidence of pride. ... If we get to thinking that we know better than the organization, we should ask ourselves: `Where did we learn Bible truth in the first place? Would we know the way of the truth if it had not been for guidance from the organization? Really, can we get along without the direction of God's organization?' No, we cannot! ... When we consider the mighty spirit forces who are fighting against us, we must acknowledge that on our own we could not possibly win. Yet with God's backing, and with the help and support of his organization our worldwide association of brothers we cannot lose. ...\" (\"Armed for the Fight Against Wicked Spirits,\" The Watchtower, January 15, 1983, pp.23 27, p.27) which means unthinking and unquestioning obedience to the Watchtower organization, which is really the JW's god.>Along with the Mormon claim, this is such a house of cards that any study, be it Theological, historical and in this case scientific will blow a mighty wind a knock the house over.The problem is that for J Ws and the Mormons their ultimate ground of belief is not in the Bible, nor in any objective evidence, but it is in their respective cultic organizations, the Watchtower Society and the LDS Church.But that is why a JW's faith might be shaken more by evidence that the Watchtower Society has been wrong for nearly 60 years in that Jesus really did die on a two beamed cross and not a single upright stake, than by arguing about the meaning of Bible verses (which however does have its place).>Thank you for continuing to update us on what you find about the Shroud. I like you am thoroughly convinced of it's authenticity. What more does a person really want to convince them? My faith doesn't rest on it, but it certainly backs up my faith.Agreed. For us Christians, the Shroud is just another example of the truth of Ephesians 3:20 \"Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine ...\"However, as the public become more and more aware that the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud to the 14th century was wrong (if not fraudulent) and the now overwhelming evidence that the Shroud is the very burial sheet of Jesus, inscribed with a record of His horrific suffering and death on a cross for them and also with His resurrection, maybe millions who otherwise wouldn't will become Christians in one last mighty harvest, in these last years before Jesus returns (in my considered opinion before 2037).>Blessings to you in the name of Christ,Thanks.

The gospels clearly say that Jesus was wrapped in 'strips' of cloth, except for a a type of hood over his head.No. As leading evangelical Christian theologian Dr. Gary Habermas (and others) has demonstrated in his two co authored books, \"Verdict on the Shroud\" (1981) and \"The Shroud and the Controversy\" (1990), the Shroud is perfectly in harmony with the Gospel accounts of Jesus burial (as well as His suffering, death and resurrection), when the data in all four Gospels is carefully considered, especially in the original Greek.The \"strips of linen\" in Lk 24:12; Jn 11:44; 19:40; 20:5 6 is a mistranslation by the NIV in being too specific when the underlying Greek words can just mean linen cloths. The KJV more correctly translates those same verses by the more general \"linen clothes\" and \"graveclothes.\" The NASB translates those verses as \"linen wrappings.\" The NLT of those same verses has \"linen wrappings\" and \"graveclothes\" and \"long sheets of linen cloth.\"Also the NIV is at variance with Jewish burial customs, where bodies were enfolded in a shroud not wound around in strips or bandages like an Egyptian mummy. The only strips that were used in Jewish burials are those tying the hands, feet and jaw, to keep them in place before rigor mortis set in. That is probably what is meant in Jn 11:44 where Lazarus was still bound by those linen strips, but it does not mean (or say) that he was otherwise naked, which he would be if those strips were all that he was wearing.See my 2007 post \"Bogus: Shroud of Turin? #1\" and Does the Shroud Contradict the Gospels?.Stephen E.

I wish they could explain thelack of distance between the front of the image and the back. Thanks for your comment. I am away from my home while it is being painted and so I don't have access to my Shroud books. So this is an answer off the top of my head (no pun intended!).My first point is that claims of apparent gross anatomical blunders in the Shroud's image (and in this case there may not even be that see below) argues more in favour of the Shroud's authenticity than the alternative forgery theory.That is because: 1) other anatomical features of the Shroud (e.g. The wounds, blood flows, etc) exhibit an accuracy (if not a perfection) that would require an an artistic genius of at least the level a Leonardo da Vinci. But then an artistic genius of at least that level would hardly commit gross anatomical blunders that even an average art student would not make.2) If there were such apparent major anomalies, that would be evidence that the Shroud's image was formed not by human or normal natural processes, but by some extraordinary or supernatural process, e.g. The image actually is a type of xray originating from within the body (see my CED blog post of 14 May 2007), where distances are less than at the surface, and not from its surface where distances are greater; and/or the image was formed as the linen collapsed downward as Jesus' body was resurrected through it, as proposed by physicist John P. Jackson. >I placeda blanket on my head there was an 8 inch gap of where my face wouldhave touched the front and where my head would have touched the back.According to this anti authenticity article, an \"8 inch gap\" is is fact what exists between the Shroud's front and back head images: \"The front and back images of the head are separated by a gap of perhaps 20 cm (8 inches)\"!But as I said, I don't have my books with me, but when I get home I will refer to my large photos of the Shroud and measure the gap and report the result in a further comment.>Looking at the PHOT Os there is less than 2 inches.

I believe since 631 AD. This is fact.Agreed about \"the 7th century\" but not necessarily \"631 AD\". The Sudarium probably entered Spain on or shortly after AD616 but did not arrive in Oviedo until 718 (see below).The AD631 date is when St. Braulio, bishop of Saragossa, Spain, wrote in a letter that \"the linteaminibus [linen] and the sudarium in which the Lord's body was wrapped\" had been in Jerusalem but he did not know of their present whereabouts (Guscin, M., \"The Oviedo Cloth,\" 1998, pp.11 12). He was either genuinely ignorant of the location of the Sudarium being in Spain, or did not want to reveal it.Guscin says that, according to the chronicle of Pelayo, bishop of Oviedo (1101 43), the Sudarium was taken from Jerusalem before it was sacked by the Persians in 614 and arrived in Spain after the fall of Alexandria in 616 and before the death in 633 of St. Fulgentius, bishop of Ecija, Spain, who received Sudarium in a chest (Guscin, p.14).The chest containing the Sudarium passed to St. Isidore, bishop of Seville (c.560 636), who in turn passed it on to his student San Ildefonso (St Ildephonsus), who became bishop of Toledo in 657 and died in 667.Then following the Muslim invasion of Spain in 711, the Sudarium was taken in 718 in its chest to a cave near Oviedo (which was not founded until 761). The sudarium remained in the cave until King Alfonso II (791 842) built the Camara Santa for it in the Oviedo cathedral in 840 (Guscin, p.15). The chest was eventually opened in 1075, by King Alfonso IV and the Sudarium was in it (Guscin, p.17). So the historical evidence is that the Sudarium has been in Spain since at least 633 (and probably 616 620), and before that it was in Jerusalem, presumably from the time of Jesus' crucifixion (because why would anyone keep a small, plain, blood stained cloth in Jerusalem if it was not Jesus'?).>When the Sudarium and The Shroud of Turin face are aligned, the blood spots exactly line up. Agreed. This is the strongest evidence (which in a criminal trial would be accepted as proof beyond reasonable doubt) that the Sudarium of Oviedo and the Shroud of Turin covered the same face.And since the Sudarium has been in Spain since 616 633 and in Jerusalem before that, the simplest hypothesis is the Shroud of Turin must also have been in Jerusalem and also covered the body of Jesus.>The Sudarium and the Shroud of Turin both have the rare blood type AB.Apparently old blood tends to degrade to type AB, so this is not conclusive evidence that the blood of the Sudarium's and Shroud were from the same victim. But if the blood type had been different, then that would have been strong evidence against the Sudarium and the Shroud having covered the same body. So the fact that the Sudarium has the same type AB blood as the Shroud is an important test of authenticity that the Sudarium could have failed but successfully passed.>This alone should be cause for alarm, with respect to the C14 dating of the shroud. The C14 should have, at least, dated the shroud to the 7th century.Agreed. Before the Sudarium of Oviedo evidence, the evidence that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Christ was already very strong (e.g. The Shroud's unique marks found on art going back to the 6th century), and the only positive evidence against it was the 14th century C14 dating.Because of the many problems with C14 dating, due to contamination with external carbon, etc, archaeologists normally disregard a C14 date as anomalous if it disagrees with other known facts about an artifact. So the only reason the C14 dating has not been set aside in the case of the Shroud is because of the enormous loss of face science would have to endure, especially in respect of Christianity. This is exacerbated by the fact that most scientists are agnostics/atheists and if the Shroud of Turin really is the burial sheet of Christ, then that is personally very hard for them to accept.Stephen E.

A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question which contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt). Aside from being an informal fallacy depending on usage, such questions may be used as a rhetorical tool: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda. The traditional example is the question `Have you stopped beating your wife?' Whether the respondent answers yes or no, they will admit to having a wife and having beaten her at some time in the past. Thus, these facts are presupposed by the question, and in this case an entrapment, because it narrows the respondent to a single answer, and the fallacy of many questions has been committed.\" (\"Loaded question,\" Wikipedia, 15 June 2015).I DID answer your question by pointing out that: \"It is not a question of knowing.

I found the following post by \"Hugh Farey\" over at Dan's blog regarding this blog entry and thought you might like to address it: ...No. As I stated as recently as 20 August 2015, posting comments on my blog for the purpose of providing discussion on Porter's blog is off topic:==================================You may not be aware that since November 4, 2014 it has been my policy that:\"... Mentioning of Dan Porter, and his blog, and his blog's members in connection with Porter's blog, is henceforth off topic on my blog.\"I further advised of this policy in my comments of: November 14, 2014; November 16, 2014; and May 31, 2015 My reason is given in my November 16 comment that I don't want to provide `grist for the mill' of Porter's blog: \"As I have stated ... It is my policy ... That: `... Mentioning of Dan Porter, and his blog, and his blog's members in connection with Porter's blog, is henceforth off topic on my blog.' ... This includes you [Porter] , or your members, making comments on my blog for the purpose of providing `grist for the mill' of your blog. Which in turn is based on my objection stated in my post, of May 8, 2014: \"`The Letter from Alexius Comnenus': My response to Dan Porter,\" that \"Porter is a pirate who steals the hard work and intellectual property of others\" including me: \"Again Porter has scavenged my work, rather than do original work of his own. As I have said before, ... Porter is a pirate who steals the hard work and intellectual property of others ... But Porter is evidently untroubled by the ethics of parasiting off the work of others, despite it being against their expressed wishes, to feed his `gossip column' blog.\" My policy above is aimed at preventing Porter and his readers from starting a comments debate on my blog and then cross posting it to Porter's blog, to provide `grist for its mill'.==================================Except to say that Farey, a mere science teacher, contradicts ancient textiles conservator Mechthilde Flury Lemberg's statement that the stitching of the seam joining the sidestrip and the main body of the Shroud is closely similar, if not identical, to that found at Masada. As Farey himself stated according to you: \"As it happens, I don't agree with some of Flury Lemberg's interpretations.\" So if anyone choose to believe Farey over against Flury Lemberg that's THEIR problem.Here are the sources I based the Masada part of my \"Sidestrip\" entry above on. First was Ian Wilson's eye witness report of what Flury Lemberg said at the 2000 Turin Symposium (my emphases):\"The first speaker was Dr. Mechthild Flury Lemberg ... But even more importantly, Dr. Flury Lemberg found the cloth's finishing, at its hems, and in the joining seam to have been done using an unusual type of stitching very nearly invisible on one side, and as such CLOSELY RESEMBLING THAT OF ANCIENT JEWISH TEXTILES AS FOUND AT MASADA, THE JEWISH PALACE FORTRESS THAT WAS OVERTHROWN BY THE ROMANS IN AD 73, NEVER TO BE OCCUPIED AGAIN. This alone, therefore, constitutes powerful evidence against the carbon dating result of 1988. As Dr. Flury Lemberg told the Sunday Times 'In my opinion the Shroud is not a mediaeval fake. The parallels I have found indicate that it could have existed at the same time as Jesus Christ and in what is now Israel.'\" (Wilson, I., 2000, \"`The Turin Shroud – past, present and future', Turin, 2 5 March, 2000 – probably the best ever Shroud Symposium,\" BSTS Newsletter, No. 51, June).

Continued].And significantly, the website ignores the perfect match of the bloodstains on the Sudarium of Oviedo as evidence for the Shroud's authenticity!So the real silly belief is those who continue to claim that the Shroud is not the burial sheet of Jesus, when: 1. The positive evidence is overwhelmingly that it is; 2. The negative evidence that the Shroud is not authentic can be, and has been, plausibly answered; and 3. Those who claim the Shroud is not authentic do not have an adequate alternative explanation of how the image was formed or faked.Regarding the latter, significantly, the website states:\"Question: How do you think the image on the Shroud was formed? To be honest I don't know. But if I had to pick the most promising method, I would say it could have been constructed using a rubbing technique on a bas relief model.\"But the \"bas relief model,\" far from being \"promising\" is just another one of the many failed naturalistic alternatives of how the Shroud's image was formed. Indeed, that the \"bas relief model\" is just one of many so called \"promising\" naturalistic methods of forming the Shroud's image, is itself evidence that other Shroud anti authenticity advocates regard it as inadequate. Also the \"bas relief model\" conflicts with the website's own citing of \"a Catholic bishop's [d'Arcis] report to Pope Clement VII, dated 1389, stating that ... A predecessor had `discovered the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it'\". The website cannot have it both ways. If the Shroud was \"painted\" then it should be advocating the \"painting model\" not the \"bas relief model.\" But if the Shroud was not \"painted\" (which it wasn't) then this bishop's report was wrong (which it is)!Stephen E.

From admittedly what little I have read about the Tilma of Juan Diego, aka. The Image of Guadelupe, there is no comparison between it and the Shroud of Turin.Scientific testing of the Shroud of Turin has shown it not to be a painting, with no paint or pigment, but scientific testing has shown the Image of Guadelupe to be a painting, with layers of paint:\"In 2002, art restoration expert José Sol Rosales said he examined the icon with a stereomicroscope and that he identified calcium sulfate, pine soot, white, blue, and green \"tierras\" (soil), reds made from carmine and other pigments, as well as gold. Rosales said he found the work consistent with 16th century materials and methods ... Norberto Rivera Carrera, Archbishop of Mexico, commissioned a 1999 study to test the tilma's age. Leoncio Garza Valdés, a pediatrician and microbiologist who had previously worked with the Shroud of Turin, claimed, upon inspection of photographs of the image, to have found three distinct layers in the painting, at least one of which had initials painted on it.\" (\"Our Lady of Guadalupe,\" Wikipedia).Garza Valdés, whom I know of from my Shroud of Turin studies, is a devout Roman Catholic, who regards the Shroud of Turin as authentic, so if he says the Image of Guadalupe is a painting, that is decisive for me.>Considering that the tilma still exist to this day and did not rot, it could be said that it is alive.I gather the Image of Guadelupe is on hemp, which is very durable. >When alive, plants absorbed radio carbon and stop only when it died whence radio carbon decay. This is the basic principle of carbon dating. Agreed.>Now if the shroud is alive up to the date when it was first exposed to public then it was only at that date where the linen (derived from plant) has its radio carbon start to decay. The Shroud itself is linen, which is woven flax and ceases to be alive when the flax dies, i.e. Is harvested.>Consequently, the carbon dating will point to the said date, which was the one observed in the radio carbon dating experiment. This can support the belief that the shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus It wouldn't. That the flax the linen of the Shroud is made of was alive just before the Shroud's first undisputed appearance in France c. 1350, is in fact what the 1988 radiocarbon date of 1260 1390 assumed is the case.Proponents of the authenticity of the Shroud claim the flax was alive only up to or before the early 1st century AD, and that the radiocarbon date is wrong, i.e. It does not yield a true chronological age, due to one or more factors, such as contamination with younger carbon, and/or enrichment of neutrons (i.e. From Jesus' resurrecting body changing its state of matter), that are known to give an apparently younger radiocarbon age than the actual chronological age.Stephen E.

However, there were a lot of problems with the latter, including the possibility (if not probability) of outright fraud. See \"The Great Holy Shroud Dating Fraud of 1988.\" I certainly don't agree with everything in this paper, but there seems to be at least a prima facie case that the Shroud linen sample may have been switched for a sample from a medieval cloth.If my proposal to radiocarbon date the Shroud's pollen (as set out in my paper \"A proposal to radiocarbon date the pollen of the Shroud of Turin,\" to be published in December's British Society for the Turin Shroud's Newsletter), if carried out, will provide an independent check, using the same method, on the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud's linen.>It is my understanding from various passages in The Bible that the shroud is unlikely to be the burial shroud of Jesus, especially in looking at Jhn 20:7.>>\"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\"Again, the short answer is that there is no real conflict between the Shroud and the Bible. In my book, \"The Shroud of Turin: Burial Sheet of Jesus?,\" I will have a chapter, \"3. THE BIBLE AND THE SHROUD,\" where I will fully cover this issue.The basic problem is that the various gospel writers, writing from their own perspective, use different Greek words for the various graveclothes, singly and collectively (i.e. Sindon = linen sheet, shroud; othonia = linen strips, linen collectively, sudarion = head cloth, jaw band; and keiriai = bandages, windings); and the problem is compounded by our English translations of those Greek words, and our preexisting ideas that the Jews wrapped their bodies like Egyptian mummies, when they did not.Here are some quotes which explain and answer these problems:\"Although the New Testament's description of typical first century Jewish burial customs is not overly detailed, it does give the general features. The body was washed (Acts 9:37) and the hands and feet were bound (John 11:44). A cloth handkerchief (Greek, sudarion) was placed `around' the face (John 11:44; 20:7). The body was then wrapped in clean linen, often mixed with spices (John 19:39 40), and laid in the tomb or grave. The Code of Jewish Law adds that the Jews usually shaved the head and beard completely and cut the fingernails before burial. However, the gospels tell us that Jesus' burial was incomplete. Because the Sabbath was about to begin, he was removed from the cross and laid in the tomb rather hurriedly. This is why the women returned to the tomb on Sunday morning. They had prepared spices and ointments for Jesus' body, and they went to the tomb to apply them (Luke 23:54 56). It is not often noticed why the women went to the tomb. They certainly did not expect Jesus to rise (Luke 24:3 4; John 20:12 15). Rather they came in order to finish anointing Jesus' body with the prepared spices (Luke 24:1; Mark 16:1). They were worried about who would help them to move the stone from the entrance of the tomb so that they could finish the job begun before the Sabbath (Mark 16:3).\" (Stevenson, K.E. & Habermas, G.R., \"Verdict on the Shroud,\" Servant Books: Ann Arbor MI, 1981, pp.46 47).\"Another apparent problem crops up in the descriptions of the grave clothes the disciples saw in the tomb on Easter morning. Both Luke and John describe grave clothes in the tomb. Luke says that Peter went inside the tomb and saw the othonia the generic term for all the grave clothes, including the shroud and the smaller pieces used to bind the jaw, hands, and feet. John, however, gives a more detailed description of what he and Peter saw, and he introduces another term into the grave clothes listing. When they went into the tomb, they saw the othonia lying on the ground, but also the sudarion lying rolled up in a place by itself, apart from these othonia. John adds the detail that the sudarion had been \"around the head\" of Jesus. Sudarion means `napkin' or `sweat cloth.' It is, at any rate, a rather small piece of cloth. If it had been placed over the face of Jesus in the tomb, no image of Jesus' face would have appeared on the Shroud. Since the Shroud of Turin bears the image of a face, the reference to a sudarion seems to challenge the authenticity of the Shroud. Indeed, some Christians have pointed to this passage as evidence that the Shroud is incompatible with scripture. However, a number of scripture scholars do not think that the sudarion was a napkin or cloth placed over Jesus' face. The Mishnah instructs Jews to tie up the chin of the corpse (Shabbath 23;5). The Code of Jewish Law also commands the practice of binding the chin. 8 Lazarus' napkin was wrapped \"around\" his face (Greek, perideo), a position that is more consistent with the jaw being tied shut. Additionally, John's observation that Jesus' napkin was found \"rolled up\" (Greek, entulisso) in the empty tomb corresponds closely to the cloth being used to bind the jaw. John A.T. Robinson, the British New Testament scholar, gives the most plausible explanation for the sudarion. He says it was probably a jaw band, a piece of linen rolled up into a strip, placed under the chin, drawn up around the face, and tied on the top of the head. Its function was to keep the jaw shut before rigor mortis set in. Not only does the New Testament not state that the napkin was placed over the face so as to cover it, but the combination of `wrapped up' and `around the head' (John 20:7; cf. 11:44) fits what is depicted in the Shroud. Jaw bands are used for this purpose today and there is every reason to believe that they were used in first century Palestine. There is evidence for just such a jaw band on the three dimensional image of the face of the Shroud. The hair of the man seems to be separated from the cheeks. The hair or the left side of the face hangs out over the edge of an object probably the chin band.\" (Stevenson & Habermas, 1981, pp.49 50). \"As we have already mentioned, it was normal for Jews to be buried in clothing, more specifically the white garments they wore for festivals. In the case of Jesus we would not necessarily expect this, as we know his clothing was taken from him at the time of crucifixion. But many authors have pointed out. That we would certainly not expect the fourteen foot sheet that we find preserved in Turin. Here again we are in a hornets' nest of controversy over gospel interpretation that exists quite independently of the Shroud. It all stems from apparent conflicts of information between the synoptic writers and St. John. The synoptics speak only of the sindon purchased by Joseph of Arimathea (Mt. 7:59; Mk. 15:46; Lk. 23:53). This is often translated as shroud, although it should be pointed out that it does not have a specifically sepulchral meaning. St. Mark, for instance, used the same word to describe the garment lost by the young man at Gethsemane who fled at the arrest of Jesus (Mk. 14:51, 52). St. John, on the other hand, does not use the word sindon, but instead says the body of Jesus was wrapped in othonia. And in his account of the discovery of the linens in the empty tomb again he uses the word othonia (which he describes as lying at the scene), and refers also cryptically to a mysterious soudarion, rolled up and lying in a place by itself (Jn. 20:7). The precise meanings of othonia and sindon in their gospel context have been hotly debated. Some have contended that othonia (which is a plural form) means linen bands and that Joseph must have torn up the sindon into strips to wind Jesus mummy style. Quite neutral exegetes such as Pere Benoit have pointed out that it would surely have been easier for Joseph to purchase ready made bandages rather than tearing up a large sheet for this purpose. The most balanced modern view is that othonia means cloths in general, which could incorporate shroud and bands.\" (Wilson, I., \"The Turin Shroud,\" Book Club Associates: London, 1978, pp.41 42). \"What of the soudarion, literally a `sweat cloth'? Some have thought of this as simply the headcloth or chin band which is clearly what the soudarion mentioned in the story of Lazarus as `round his face' (Jn. 11:44) was. Others have argued that it may have been our Shroud, on the grounds that the description of it as having been `over his head' (Jn. 20:7) could well refer to the manner in which we know the Turin Shroud was used. In support of this argument we may note that in the Lazarus account St. John uses the word peri ('round' or `about'), in contrast to epi ('over'), in the case of Jesus, leaving open the possibility that a different arrangement (and different size of cloth) is being described. St. John makes special mention of Jesus' soudarion being `not with the othonia but rolled up in a place by itself,' which certainly might suggest a cloth larger and more important than a mere chin hand; but as many maintain adamantly that a soudarion could not be anything larger than a handkerchief sized piece of cloth, it seems unwise to be dogmatic. The conclusion to be drawn is that from exegetical studies alone we can be sure of nothing, that of themselves they can neither prove nor disprove that the Shroud is genuine. It does seem worthwhile at least to consider the various possibilities raised by the gospel accounts for what the Shroud might have been among the linens Peter and John found in the empty tomb on the first Easter Sunday.\" (Wilson, 1978, pp.42 43). \"The precise nature of the burial cloths has been the subject of much debate. The synoptists tell us that Joseph of Arimathea bought (Mark) a clean (Matthew) linen shroud or sheet (Greek sindon) and wrapped Jesus in it (Matthew, Mark, Luke) [Mt 27:59; Mk 15:46; Lk 23:50 56]. John mentions no shroud, but speaks in the plural of linen cloths (othonia) [Jn 19:40; 20:5 6] and also of a soudarion \"the napkin, which had been on his head ... Rolled up in a place by itself.\" [Jn 20:7] The disputed (but probably authentic) passage at Luke 24:12 makes no further reference to the sheet, but mentions othonia lying by themselves. Christian artists have commonly depicted the grave clothes of Jesus as broad bandages wound round the limbs and the body, together with a turban like towel around his head. Some writers have visualised the linen sheet being torn into strips and the spices being wound into the folds. It has then been supposed that at the resurrection thesoudarion and othonia collapsed in situ to form two separate piles. As will be seen presently this does not in fact tally very well with what the evangelists say, but it illustrates the apparently rather imprecise and confusing picture which they seem to give. John gives us an account of a normal burial in a well to do home in his record of the raising of Lazarus: \"The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages (keiriai), and his face wrapped with a cloth (soudarion). Jesus said to them, `Unbind him, and let him go.'' [Jn 11:44] There is nothing in this account to suggest a winding of long bandages around arms and legs and other parts of the body; indeed just the opposite, for the resuscitated corpse was certainly not deprived of wrappings which left him standing there naked. Before burial he had been washed, anointed with perfumed ointments and dressed in his best clean garment. Short strips of cloth had apparently been tied round wrists and ankles to keep his arms and legs in position, and the soudarion kept the mouth from falling open. The hobbled Lazarus was able to shuffle to the entrance of the tomb, where he was set free by the untying of these three cloths. And now he stood there fully clothed.\" (Wenham, J.W., \"Easter Enigma: Are the Resurrection Stories in Conflict?,\" [1984], Paternoster: Exeter UK, Reprinted, 1987, pp.66 67).\"Q. Doesn't the Shroud conflict with Scripture? a) John 20:5 7 mentions linens and at the very least implies there were a minimum of two cloths. Many have suggested that the linens were `strips,' however the Shroud is merely one piece of cloth. ... A. …. The answers to these apparent discrepancies are as follows: First, the Gospels use the following words to describe the Shroud: Sindon burial sheet, winding sheet, shroud; sudarion sweat cloth, face cloth, handkerchief; othonia linens. One way for the synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) to be in harmony with John is if a burial method like the one depicted on the Shroud was used. John mentions a cloth that was described as `around his head' and about the face of Lazarus (John 20:7; 11:44). The word is sudarion, used in burial to bind the jaw against the effects of rigor mortis. There is evidence on the Shroud that a sudarion was used, though the whereabouts of any such cloth has long been unknown. The Shroud is a pure linen garment with some evidence that the head, hands, and feet were bound, most likely with other `linens.' The synoptics describe a linen sheet a single cloth. Most likely, the sheet was more significant to the synoptic writers than other funerary cloths. Since the Jewish burial custom allowed the use of cloths to bind the hands and feet as well as the jaw, the total picture matches Jewish burial customs exactly and explains clearly why the synoptics only mention a sindon and John mentions othonia. Second, John's use of othonia has led to a widely held belief that Jesus was wrapped like an Egyptian mummy. But such a procedure doesn't conform to what is known of first century normal Jewish burial ritual. Nor does it match what was previously mentioned in the Word, to wit, that Joseph of Arimathea had purchased a winding sheet and wrapped Jesus in it (Mark 15:46). Even John used the word edesan, which is translated wound in the KJV but literally means `enfolded.' Enfolded would also match the burial custom. Being wrapped with strips of cloth would not. In other words, othonia in John should be understood to mean that Jesus' dead body was enveloped from head to feet in one burial cloth, not wrapped like a mummy with numerous strips of cloth.\" (Stevenson, K.E. & Habermas, G.R., \"The Shroud and the Controversy,\" Thomas Nelson: Nashville TN, 1990, p.149 150. Emphasis original).\"In addition to the Frei sticky tapes taken from the Shroud in 1973 (Table 1) and 1978 for pollen grains, other related materials were also examined. This included three samples from the Sudarium of Oviedo, the traditional face cloth (John 20:7), which would have been wrapped around the head to cover the disfigured face until enshroudment. The Sudarium, which has only bloodstains and no image, has been housed in Oviedo, Spain, continuously since the mid 8th century (Guscin, 1998). In 1979, Frei took 46 sticky tape samples from the Sudarium. All except three of these were removed from his collection shortly after his death and were not available for examination.\" (Danin, A., Whanger, A.D., Baruch, U. & Whanger, M., \"Flora of the Shroud of Turin,\" Missouri Botanical Garden Press: St. Louis MO, 1999, p.11)See the video \"Shroud Report Interview with Mark Guscin\" for a demonstration of how the Sudarium of Oviedo (the sudarion of John 20:7) complements the Shroud of Turin.>There are other issues as well that would lead me to believe that this is not the burial shroud of Jesus.OK.>I confess that I am neither a theologian nor an expert and it is clear that you have done much research into this area but I see some things that appear to be contrary to the belief that the shroud is in fact His.See above.>Thanks!Hope this has helped.Stephen E.
