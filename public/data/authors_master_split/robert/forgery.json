[{"id":"comment-3010","author":"robert","post":"It seems that my intentions were not understood. I just wanted to stress that the changes I have introduced to the article will make it different from your copy. This is probably due to the fact that I am not a native English speaker/writter. Conversely I did not feel any offense in what you have written. This being said I doubt that the embrace of Shroud authenticity was the overpowering force might have the reason why the French langage does not really make a difference in suaire/linceul. I have however not evidence to show it or to show the contrary. As to the reason why de Charny came into possession of the shroud I would like to stress that during the Middle Ages relics fabrication (or forgery) has been an industry. In his Treatise on Relics John Calvin lists at least half a dozen shrouds of Jesus, af course all given as the authentic one by their holders. Furthermore it seems that the shroud has neve been mentioned as being the ownership of Geoffroi de Charny but only as being owned by his widow Jeanne de Vergy. The tradition (what does this mean?) reports she said to have received it from her ancestors. I must however acknowlege that one cannot exclude that she could have said this because she did not want to openly make a link with Jacques de Morlay of Geoffroy de Charnay (assuming the later was indeed the uncle of his dead husband – which I am still not convinced). Beside I have also found this story ( http://h2g2.com/edited entry/A462458 ), but maybe you have already seen it..","date":"2014-02-15","mins":"9:21 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain."},{"id":"comment-3007","author":"robert","post":"Well, having seen your comment relating to the “Suaire d’Oviedo” article in French wikipedia (to which I am a regular contributor) I have undertaken some changes to the structure of this article: https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suaire d%27 Oviedo&diff=101285115&oldid=96397135 It will definitely not look anymore as what you have shown in your blog. Now with respect to the reasons why in French the words “linceul” and “suaire” are both used for designating the shroud of Turin, it is difficult to provide a logical explanation. It is clear that they had different signification and have once meant different objects which is not really the case anymore. As I am a French speaking Belgian (who lives in Geneva) please do not ask me to answer the question “So how do the famously logical and rational French defend this uncharacteristic lapse into ambiguity?”. As a matter of fact a language changes over the centuries and French is no exception. It is therefore difficult to know whether this confusion between “suaire” and “linceul” is due to the shroud of Turin (which is indeed usually – but improperly – named “suaire de Turin” and not “linceul de Turin”) or to other reasons. One would need to get the help of a linguist to have more information on this topic. I seize this opportunity to tell you that I appreciate your blog even if I do not necessarily share all your theories. For instance if I agree that the shroud is an artifact from the 14th century I do not think that the men of the shrould could be Jacques de Molay or his fellow Geoffroy de Charnay. First of all because to the best of my knowledge all know relations of de Molay et de Charny death say they were burned at the stake. I have never read that they could have been roasted on a grill like Saint Lawrence. Beside one can also question the existence of any link between Geoffroi de Charny – named according to the French city of Charny (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charny, C%C3%B4te d%27 Or ) and Geoffroy de Charnay (there are several cities names Charnay in France). I am not aware of any records that would make a familial link between these two men. I hope my comment was not too long..","date":"2014-02-15","mins":"8:12 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain."}]
