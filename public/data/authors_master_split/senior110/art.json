As for your comment about everyone coming together, I subscribe to the idea that there are many paths to God and Jesus is just one way. That is, God sent different prophets for different circumstances in order to lead people of time to Him. Please consider the suggestion and don’t feel offended.

My fear originated about 55 years ago when I realized that I would die some day. I have found life so beautiful and awe some that not feeling it would be the ultimate dread. No, I do not come from a priviledged background, in fact I would consider our family as a poor working class, but over the years we worked hard and had our share of trials and tribulations. Today, I consider ourselves blessed with healthy and independent children and their families. My struggle against my fear has led me to reading many books, medications, and counselling and ultimately to baptism into the Catholic faith. Being retired for the last 9 years, I have a lot of time thinking about God, death, etc. My conclusion is that if there is no God, then life is meaningless. God has 100% of my heart and about 80% of my mind. I desparately seek closure on this fear, so I can fully appreciate life and let it go gracefully. I pray very often these days that God would send some “agent” or event that would put my mind to rest. This is the reason that read posts such as these – to find new ways of reaching God or better still, have God reaching me. I would appreciate any suggestion that would remove my residual doubt.

In my life time I have seen six cases where young good people died in the prime of their lives.Three of them left young families behind.

Skeptics would say that there is no God or is it true that the good die young? If so, why?.","date":"2012-11-06","mins":"3:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
