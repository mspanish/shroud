This is my personal opinion and has nothing to do with Shroud research by experts in this area since I am not an expert. His presentation in his area of expertise really adds to the body of knowledge about the Shroud. I quite enjoyed his presentation. His inabilities in other areas & his opinion about a Maillard reaction are not relevant for Shroud studies, but offer his own personal opinions. Everyone is entitled to hold their own thoughts on the Shroud, but areas in which one is not an expert are generally irrelevant in terms of Shroud studies unless confirmed by an expert. One example of this happening is the Benford Marino studies which were eventually supported by experts in their respective fields..","date":"2015-06-14","mins":"5:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/14/stephen-jones-on-the-thomas-de-wesselow-presentation/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones on the Thomas De Wesselow Presentation"},{"id":"comment-201740","author":"dcn_andy","post":"There is only one misstatement made by Dr. De Wesselow concerning the VP8.
