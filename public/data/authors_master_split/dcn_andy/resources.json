Some would argue they do not accept these records because they do not agree on every detail. I would argue that makes their authenticity and reliability ever more powerful. One would expect forgers who were trying to create a water tight document would eliminate any conflicts between eyewitness accounts. Yet the fact remains most eyewitness accounts of the same event often contain variances, so that 4 writings that did not conflict at all would be unbelievable..","date":"2015-08-18","mins":"6:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-200308","author":"dcn_andy","post":"Hey Joe, if it appears to be inappropriate, well darn it, it must be.

That is a certainty if one can believe an expert in his own area of expertise who proved the man in the Shroud was deceased. For this reason, and knowing that this paragraph is written by those who have a vested interest in making this statement (a dead Christ who affects the lives of billions of Christians cannot be countered), I would dismiss it in light of the experts’ forensic science and its conclusions..","date":"2015-05-29","mins":"11:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?"},{"id":"comment-213989","author":"dcn_andy","post":"I think the Shroud has been recognized much longer than since the middle ages (which has a shifting date range depending on who you talk to)..","date":"2015-10-31","mins":"9:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/31/forbes-editors-need-to-polish-up-their-headline-writing/","cat":"article","title":"Forbes Editors Need to Polish Up Their Headline Writing"},{"id":"comment-210013","author":"dcn_andy","post":"Excellent rebuttal, Joe.
