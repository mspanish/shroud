I mean, intellectual, highly educated who shot John, but that is it. Conjecture. Was blood added or not, etc. The plain facts are, and to this day, NO ONE KNOWS. In the words of B.Shwartz, “We can tell you what it is not.” UNTILL we know what the image is, (I am convinced we never will, but to keep looking is only right and human) you cannot add or take away from its total construction. What I mean is, it was either a contrived artifact, or it is not. I don’t think somebody found the SOT and added any adornments or additional visual info. When (and if) we figure out how the image was made, the question of the bloodstains will pretty much answer itself, won’t it? The question of where the blood came from, at least as I see it, is inextricable from the question of how the S. Was formed, simple as that..","date":"2013-10-26","mins":"1:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture"}]
