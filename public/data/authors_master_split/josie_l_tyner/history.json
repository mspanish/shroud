[{"id":"comment-47568","author":"josie_l_tyner","post":"Dave, you know of at least one Roman writer( he of course wrote in Greek) with “an intimate knowledge of the Hebrew scriptures,” that would be Paul. While not culturally a Roman, he was a Roman citizen. Ptolomy (Philadelphius, I think, not sure) had the Hebrew scriptures translated into the Septuagint. I am not saying it was on their ‘best sellers of all time’ list but was certainly available to the Roman reader if desired. Flavius Josephus, another Jew, wrote for the Roman audience in his “Antiquities.” Tacitus mentions Jesus, and Suetonius in his “Lives of the Caesars” tells of “Chrestus” and his followers. It was believed that “Chrestus” was a god of the slaves, Chrestus being a popular name for a male slave, meaning pleasant, or cheerful. Julius Africanus quotes Thallus and others who indeed confirm that on the afternoon of the crucifixion, an earthquake and darkness (possibly an eclipse) followed the crucifixion. Pliny the younger also mentions Christians. I am not sure if you are including early Christianity in the context of Hebrew thought. It is possible to include Christianity as an extension of Judaism at it’s inception, certainly this was bone of contention between Peter and Paul. You no doubt know all this stuff, just adding this for reference..","date":"2013-10-15","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/15/jesus-fiction-created-by-roman-aristocrats/","cat":"history","title":"Jesus:  Fiction Created by Roman Aristocrats?"},{"id":"comment-47565","author":"josie_l_tyner","post":"It was a Roman, I believe, who said “There is no concept so outrageous, or any theory so mad, that some philosopher shall not someday say it. ” “Pacify the poor?” Just exactly how were the poor of Judea to be pacified by a Messiah whom most believed to be a re run of King David, one who would liberate by the sword? If the Gospel is any witness, most of His followers believed this: that He would liberate His people from Roman oppression, not establish a new covenantal relationship between God and Israel. Mass crucifixions and brutal taxation kept the people “pacified” enough for Roman purposes. What I would like this author to do is come up with some proof. Failing that, please establish a parallel or historical precedent where Pax Romana drew upon local “superstition”( I use this word purely in the context of Roman rule) to engage in conspiratorial control of anything. The coming Messiah was an obscure, and uniquely Jewish, concept. In fact, the beleaguered procurator Pilate had no wish to crucify Jesus at all. I cannot understand why an event where local religious zealotry backed Rome into a corner would benefit either the Roman aristocracy or the military establishment. In fact, it made Rome look really bad; the big, bad, Roman establishment being cowed into crucifying an innocent man by a bunch of ill tempered old farts comprising a local religious body called the Sanhedrin? Yeah, that makes Rome look swell. You can hardly establish control over a population by attempting to manipulate a powerless minority. Not even by the A. D. 400’s was Christianity the majority religion of the Roman Empire. This author must have read Kurt Vonnegut’s “Cat’s Cradle” and assigned the character of Bokkonon to Jesus. It is the miserable failure of this and many, many other modern thinkers (term used very generously) to ascribe to the ancients concepts not found in Western thought until the Enlightenment. If you have a contingent of trained, merciless butchers, why the hell would you need a popular religion? If the Romans wanted to control their empire using religion, there were cults and devotions much more likely to appeal, less restrictive, less burdened with concepts like “sin” and “redemption.” Why not find some all embracing, all accepting, anything goes as long as you pray and pay mother goddess from the Eastern provinces? Actually, any serious Christian of any denomination can tell you why. The Happy Goddess Mommy wouldn’t have lasted any more than “Good Vibes Jesus” or “Buddy Christ ” or “Anything Goes Forget that Whole Sin Thing Jesus” is going to last now. Only His love has that kind of power..","date":"2013-10-15","mins":"10:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/15/jesus-fiction-created-by-roman-aristocrats/","cat":"history","title":"Jesus:  Fiction Created by Roman Aristocrats?"},{"id":"comment-47595","author":"josie_l_tyner","post":"Truly. Thank you for the clarification on the Septuagint. Have read Ehrman and like his wor. .Among other works worthy of perusal is the U.S bestseller “The Case for Jesus” by Lee Strobel. It falls under the genre of popular literature, but is amazingly and exhaustively well researched. There are few serious scholars who doubt the historical Jesus. At the end of the day, I don’t think Mr. Atwill impressed either of us.

This Thallus could have been one of two people: a respected historian who wrote a history of the fall of Troy, and lived between 50 and 100 BCE. His name has been linked with one Castor of Rhodes, whose work was important in setting the standard for future historical writings. There was another Thallus to whom Flavius Josephus referred; he wrote a few minor works but was more famous for loaning about a million drachmas to Herod Agrippa. I have a library that includes the Anti Nicene Fathers, so I can vouch for the reliability of the Ethereal Library, a website where you can freely access almost every Christian work ever written. It is in Chapter XVIII : “From the Circumstances Connected with Our Savior’s Passion and His Life Giving Resurrection” (ANFO6: Fathers of the 3rd Century; Gregory Thaumaturges, Dionysius the Great, Julius Africanus.) The work of JA exists only as preserved by Eusebius and a Byzantine Scholar who wrote mostly in Aramaic, one Georgius Syncellus. However, as I understand it, a fragment of an earlier copy of the Chronography was discovered in one of the Oxyrhinncus Papyri.
