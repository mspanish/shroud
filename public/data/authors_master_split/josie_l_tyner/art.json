If the Lord wants to, he can totally forget my mansion and give me a shack in NZ. Our country is one of great beauty, but yours takes my breath away. Adolphe William Bouguereau was one of the most famous artists of the 19th century in France. His Madonnas were calculated to appeal to the sensibilities of the bourgeois French who had grown up with the tales of the “phenomena” in Lourdes and La Salette and a few other places, including Paris with St. Marie Labouret., another wax covered cadaver. Needless to say, “La belle vierge Marie” didn’t look anything like Maryam Bint Joachim, daughter of the house of David. She was in all likelihood very much like the Bedouin girls living there now; diminutive, malnourished, probably toothless and possibly bow legged because of a lack of dietary protein. Not anyone in Daumiers’s “Fourth Class Carriage” would have sat next to her, mores the pity. One of Bougereau’s finest works graces our humble San Antonio Museum of Art; “Admiration.” I got close enough to take a really good look. This artist was so amazing he painted the veins under the clear and perfect skin with anatomical accuracy. He was voted President for Life of the Academy of Fine Arts, and rightly so. Because of his conventionality and convictions, he was nearly forgotten after Modernism, Cubism, Fauvism and all the other twentieth century “isms.” I’m a big fan, he was awesome..","date":"2013-10-29","mins":"11:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/29/bouguereaus-mary/","cat":"art","title":"Bouguereau’s Mary"}]
