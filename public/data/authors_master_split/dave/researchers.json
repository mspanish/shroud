[{"id":"comment-9592","author":"dave","post":"Hi Colin, It’s like a breath of fresh air to find a site about the shroud that isn’t blatent religious propaganda! Thanks for all your efforts. Reading this latest post, my only concern is with your use of the Zeke filter. Although I’m not aware of the precise detail of what it does, I am concerned about the possibility that the effect of increasing contrast could produce image granulation where there wasn’t any in reality. Presumably some pixels will be lightened and some darkened to create the ‘enhanced’ image, which would create a more granulated image. Have you tested the Zeke filter on an image that has a smooth colour gradient to see if it will create granulation where there was none (obviously any image will have granulation at the image’s pixel level, so the check would be to see if the Zeke filtered image shows granulation of a larger size than pixel size where there was smooth colour graduation on the original)? Best regards, Dave.","date":"2017-06-28","mins":"10:28 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/sturp-space-age-technology-unleashing-religious-propaganda/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"STURP: Space-age Technology Unleashing Religious Propaganda!"}]
