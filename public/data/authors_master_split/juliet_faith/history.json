I am a Historian and Author, who has studied and written about the Templecombe panel. I have also had two recent visits by Rex Morgan, who has assisted me with all his research papers, including lab results of particulate samples taken from between the grooves of the Templecombe panel by his collegue Dr E. Nitowski, which provided some very interesting results. The Carbon 14 dating for this artifact is between 1280 and 1340. It now hangs in a special exhibition room at the Bishops Palace, Wells, Somerset. Are you also aware that another ‘head’ exists? It is from Temple Cloud Somerset. This head is wooden, and carved in relief. It has recently been Carbon 14 dated, and is of almost identical date to the Templecombe panel. The chuch where it was found was in the possesion of the Knights Templar. I would argue that there is a strong possibility that this is another example of a Templar ‘Idol’, or as Dr Frale would say ‘Simulacra’. All this, including Dr Nitowski’s findings, and Rex Morgan’s research are included in my latest book ‘Glastonbury, the Templars and the Sovran Cloth’ published by the History Press 2012.

It is a life sized head which would origially have been painted, with wide open eyes an open mouth, long hair and a forked beard, it also has a trellis frame or border often seen in examples of the Manylion. The C.14 dating of this head, which was recently undertaken by the Oxford lab dates it between C.1280 – 1341, it is made of oak. It was found in a Templar church, and local tradition says it is Templar. If another identification can be made I am prepared to be pursuaded! For now though it seems to fit the picture of the Templar idol. I refer again Dr Frales comments on the ‘cult of the Simulacra’ a cult which was introduced to Britain by the Templars and emerged in Britain ‘in the late 1200’s..","date":"2013-04-28","mins":"3:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/18/templecombe-and-the-shroud-of-turin-continued/","cat":"history","title":"Templecombe and the Shroud of Turin (Continued)"},{"id":"comment-32017","author":"juliet_faith","post":"Dr Gowlett of the Oxford Radiocarbon Excelerator Unit (ORAU) examined the samples, and his conclusion was that the wood was cut between 1280 and 1310 plus or minus 60 years. He added that the wood was cut in the early Mediaeval period. Obviously there is no way at present to prove when the image was painted, he observed that it could be as late as 1440, however during the Mediaeval period wood was usually used ‘in the green’. I agree that the head could be Hospitaller, but in view of the accusations of heresy levelled at the Templars for ‘worshipping’ a disembodied bearded head, one may consider it a little foolhardy of the Hospitallers to paint an image that could invite accusations of the very same?.","date":"2013-04-27","mins":"3:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/18/templecombe-and-the-shroud-of-turin-continued/","cat":"history","title":"Templecombe and the Shroud of Turin (Continued)"}]
