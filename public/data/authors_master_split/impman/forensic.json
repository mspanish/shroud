Paolo you wrote, “I am confident you will forgive me if I give more relevance to the opinion of a worldwide recognized expert of forensic medicine that gave a close look to the Shroud rather than to your opinion, based only on indirect information and probably without a specific professional skill in medicine. Professor Baima Bollone is a physician specialized in forensic medicine and in his career he analyzed more than one thousand corpses, and I am sure he can recognize if a stain is from blood or not.” I embarrassed that those words were written by a fellow member of the Shroud of Turin Science Group (SSG). I was even more embarrassed when you wrote, “Again, I repeat we are in the realm of hypotheses, and among them “the best ones” are usually those formulated by skilled experts, scientists, historians and medicians (as far as I know not by bloggers, sorry).” Here is an opinion formulated by a world renowned expert. “Everything I have read or heard from Ian Wilson, Max Frei, John Jackson, William Meacham, Alan Adler, Baima Bollone, Alan Whanger, Leoncio Garza Valdez, et al., is contradicted by my findings. How can I explain how only I could be right and dozens of other “scientists” be wrong? Very simply, none of them are chemical microscopists, small particle microanalysts, nor have they studied the Shroud tapes against a background of familiarity with pigments, media and artist’s paintings. If I am right, then all of their ideas are wrong and I am right.” The expert was microscopist Walter Mc Crone. Should we agree with him because he is a world renowned expert? Appeal to authority (Baima Bollone in this case) does not make for good science or good argument. Not in the blog and not in the all too secretive SSG chat rooms. Praise the bloggers, they know better. Praise the bloggers for are discussing the shroud in public where it should be discussed. It is bloggers and other non experts that are challenging the experts and raising legitimate questions. And Yannick is told by you that the good answers come from “skilled experts” and “not bloggers.” What crap! Danin is an expert. He is highly respected, and deserves to be. I think he is wrong about plant images. Many bloggers think so too. Jackson is an expert. Perhaps no one has contributed more to shroud science. I think he is great and quite right on many things. I think he is wrong on some things. Many bloggers think so too. Rogers was an expert chemist. The world of shroud science owes so much to him. He was right on many things. I think he was wrong on some things. Many bloggers think so too. Flury Lemberg is a textile expert. I can’t tell you how much I admire her work on the shroud. She is right on many things. I think she is wrong on some things, particularly the reweaving. Many bloggers think so too. Over at SSG, it has been particularly nasty lately. One member was driven off by the kind of crap we just saw here in the blog. In every case it has to do with arguments about unsubstantiated claims by single experts. Maybe that is what happened here. SSG nastiness spilled over. In fact I think that is what is wrong with shroud science today. Too many experts with their own opinions and not enough science and discussion. SSG members need to stop talking among themselves and come out and blog without being “bitchy.” Maybe WE should stop being so secretive and make out deliberations public like bloggers do. BTW, IMHO, I think Yannick is right. But then, I’m not an expert..","date":"2011-07-24","mins":"3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/not-true-the-shroud-of-turin-and-flagrum-proportions-and-measurements-are-identical/","cat":"flagrum","title":"Not True: The Shroud of Turin and Flagrum Proportions and Measurements Are Identical"}]
