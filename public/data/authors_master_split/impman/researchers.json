[{"id":"comment-4597","author":"impman","post":"This is part of what seems to be driving Dr. Fanti. He is actually citing this junk on SSG. “From my reading of many books on the Year 2012, I see that this scenario is very similar to that described in these books, the common theme being that there will be no electrical power to heat and light our homes, and the only protection will come from prayers, especially to the Mother of God, and by lighting a blessed candle. It is very likely that far infrared light emanating from blessed candles may also offer additional protection, as demonstrated by an American physicist, Prof. Phillip Callahan of the University of Florida. It may sound presumptuous, but I believe that electromagnetic energy generated during prayers in Medjugorje, where The Mother of God is appearing daily, may form a kind of a protective umbrella against deadly radiation coming with the solar wind. … Due to closing of the recent precession cycle in 2012, the Earth axis will assume a perpendicular position to the Galactic eclipse and thus geographic areas between Poles and the Equator will have a constant, Spring like weather. – A thousand years of Peace ? … In conclusion, despite terrifying predictions associated with the year 2012, we will survive if we follow the instructions given to us by God. It is possible that many people will perish, but we cannot consider it to be God’s wrath, but a kind of a self punishment resulting from our lack of faith particularly in a protective love of Our Lady of Fatima and Medjugorje that is the belief and trust in God and His Providence. Dont believe me then check out http://www.medjugorjeusa.org/boguslawstudy07.htm and ask Dr. Fanti why. It is all electrical corona discharge stuff that is doing images and changing carbon dating..","date":"2011-11-05","mins":"10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/04/a-guest-posting-by-giulio-fanti/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by Giulio Fanti"}]
