Intelligence is a measure of how much time it takes someone to grasp a theory and how well they can explain a theory. Judgment is needed when marshaling the evidence and deciding whether a theory is true or just probable. If my comments make no sense to you that means one of us is failing at the level of intelligence. Either you don’t understand what I am saying, or I am not expressing myself clearly or have an unintelligible theory..","date":"2012-11-30","mins":"4:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/28/david-roemer-will-maybe-present-the-shroud-of-turin-at-the-princeton-club-in-new-york/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Roemer will maybe present the Shroud of Turin at the Princeton Club in New York"},{"id":"comment-19608","author":"david_roemer","post":"I have a Ph.D. In physics from N.Y.U (1971) and have been trying to persuade the American Journal of Physics to retract an article titled “Entropy and evolution.” The editor of the AJP is using trickery to avoid taking responsibility for the absurd article, which contains a fake equation. My article explaining why the article is absurd was published in the Catholic Truth of Scotland. I assure you that even if you never heard of entropy or the second law of thermodynamics, you can understand why the article is a disgrace. My correspondence with physicists about the article is at http://newevangelist.me/2012/02/22/physics department of new york university/ http://newevangelist.me/2012/02/02/american journal of physics/ http://newevangelist.me/2012/02/23/american association of physics teachers/ http://newevangelist.me/2012/05/06/american institute of physics/ http://newevangelist.me/2011/12/07/american scientific affiliation 2/ http://newevangelist.me/2012/08/02/first things/ My You Tube video titled “The Truth About Evolution and Religion” (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q Ka F8v X6 HXQ) also sheds light on this issue.

In my judgment, the not smeared blood marks means it is highly probable that humans created the image using methods that have been lost to history.
