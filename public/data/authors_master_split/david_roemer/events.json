On July 7, 2014, I advised the CDF of Bruno Barberis’s roll in rejecting my presentations at the St. Louis and Bari conferences.

I have no way of knowing what the shortcomings are of my presentation. I got only one invitation to give my lecture. I arrived at the parish in Manhattan with my slides and the pastor told me he decided to cancel my presentation because I was not promoting the authenticity of the Holy Shroud. I complained to the Vicar General, who told me that it was a matter than concerned only me and the pastor. I said there was no way the pastor and me could resolve our disagreement and asked to give a presentation to the pastor with other knowledgeable Catholics to discuss the disagreement. Cardinal Dolan told me I was “debunking” the Shroud, and I filed charges against him with the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. So far no attempt has been made to resolve the conflict between me and Cardinal Dolan..","date":"2014-07-14","mins":"10:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/14/bari-conference-a-scientific-event-unprecedented-in-puglia/","cat":"event","title":"Bari Conference:  A scientific event unprecedented in Puglia"},{"id":"comment-26872","author":"david_roemer","post":"The Resurrection is both an historical event and an object of faith. I do not try to prove that Jesus is alive in a new life with God. Rather, I give my reasons for believing with a summons to believe. One of the reasons I have for believing is that there is no explanation for how the image got on the Holy Shroud. Another is the Resurrection.

You referred to the “materialist paradigm of science.” This implies that so called “materialists” fail at the level of reflective judgment. In other words, materialists are not good at evaluating the evidence against materialism. Materialists fail at the level of intelligence. The only theories they grasp are dualism and materialism. If someone only understands two theories of the mind, you should not treat their drivel with respect..","date":"2014-05-03","mins":"5:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"St. Louis Conference News"},{"id":"comment-110438","author":"david_roemer","post":"My explanation of why the Shroud is not authentic was published by Spero News on Jan. 18, 2008, and is currently on my website (http://www.newevangelization.info). My slideshow is at http:www.holyshroud.info. The relevance of the mind body problem is that non believers do not understand it. You should not even talk about the existence of God to such people. You should first explain why the human mind is a mystery. There is no evidence supporting dualism and very little supporting materialism.There is more evidence for idealism than for materialism and dualism.The evidence that Gnostics did it, which ever sect, is that images are always created by humans.

My application has been rejected. However, I am appealing to the conference’s committee and sponsors to reconsider the decision. History and science are two different methods of inquiry. Asking whether or not Jesus really cured sick people is not a good question because there are no before and after medical records. Asking where the Holy Shroud came from is a necessary science question because the Shroud exists. It is an artifact. The best theory is that it was created by Gnostics in the 1st or 2nd century using a crucified victim and methods that have been lost to history. If this theory is not presented at the conference, the committee will be guilty of misrepresenting our salvation history..","date":"2014-05-02","mins":"1:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"St. Louis Conference News"},{"id":"comment-110884","author":"david_roemer","post":"I don’t think Fr. White or Carl Jung know what they are talking about. Metaphysics is a method of inquiry that stands alongside science. Scientific questions arise from our five senses, and metaphysical questions arise from our ability to make ourselves the subject of our own knowledge. Metaphysics is based on the insight that goodness and unity are properties of being. Finitude, class membership, and changing in time give rise to the concepts of essence/existence, form/matter, and substance/accidents. It is only important to understand metaphysics and to understand that it leads to the existence of a pure act of existence, which the Western religions call God. Discussing whether or not metaphysics has any truth content or the correctness of metaphysical theorems is like arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. More to the point, it is like arguing whether or not the Shroud of Turin is authentic. Gnostics thought that Jesus had wisdom and created the Shroud to tell the story of His passion and to have something to venerate..","date":"2014-05-04","mins":"1:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"St. Louis Conference News"},{"id":"comment-111213","author":"david_roemer","post":"There is a conflict between me and you, and we should try to resolve it.

I intend to file a complaint against the conference organizers with the IEEE. Papers accepted and presented at IEEE conferences are published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. I think the IEEE would be perfectly justified in stripping the conference of its IEEE logo and all the benefits of such an association.
