I just tried responding to your same comments over on Dan’s site, but Word Press does not seem to accept my login and the commenst has not appeared. Here it is: “Mouse In The House is absolutely correct when he says that a thermal stencil image is a positive, not a negative, since dark charcoal covered areas become dark scorched areas. I thank him for the opportunity to back track a little on what I may have said previously, or at any rate to qualify it. To produce a Turin Shroud like negative, one that becomes a positive on the photographic negative, then the hypothetical sketched image would have had to be drawn as a negative, with a reversal of light and shade, which is admittedly unconventional. But there may be strong practical reasons for doing so given the proposed technique: in a well illuminated subject there will be a predominance of light reflective areas over ones that are in shade (eye sockets and the like). That would tend to give a scorch pattern with just a little scorch, but an awful lot of white space. By reversing lighjt and dark in the sketch, one ends up with something that makes a much bolder image but one that is still recognizable as a man, despite the reversal of light and shade. I hope that makes sense…” Could you oblige by cutting and pasting into Dan’s blog. I’ll try and sort out the Word Press thing later. Odd, because I am able to post comments to another Word Press blog without being pre registered for that site… January 2, 2012 3:36 AM.","date":"2012-01-02","mins":"8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/thermo-stenciling-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thermo-Stenciling the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-4276","author":"mouseinthehouse","post":"I imagine the reference to a flying saucer was to illustrate that we easily misinterpret what we see when we are ill informed.","date":"2011-10-24","mins":"7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/21/there-is-an-image-of-a-flying-saucer-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"There is an Image of a Flying Saucer on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-6491","author":"mouseinthehouse","post":"How about the partial image on the reverse surface of the cloth with nothing in between? how about the halftone that causes only apparent saturation effects?.","date":"2012-01-03","mins":"7:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/thermo-stenciling-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thermo-Stenciling the Shroud of Turin?"}]
