The discovery exposed remains of the man who had suffered leprosy and died tuberculosis. The researches records that deceased have lived in 1 50 A.D. (in the time of Jesus) and the tomb was obviously the family tomb of upper class or priest family. Gibson said that the man had been buried according to manners of the Jews at that time. The manner was that the body wrapped to linen clothes, and the head wrapped with separate face linen. Gibson said that if the person wasn’t actually dead and woke up, he could shake and blow off the face linen and shout for help. Professor Shimon Gibson said that the shroud of Turin doesn’t fit together for burial practices in first century Palestine. Gibson said that the shroud of Turin is a single sheet made with a twill weave. According to Gibson the twill weave was known only from the medieval period.
