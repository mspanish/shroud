[{"id":"comment-160441","author":"eric","post":"Not only that, but the paper makes it clear that the methodology was flawed. The “shelves” with the objects were not placed in each of the rooms, which means that only 22% of the surviving patients were attended in a room that had one. Only two reported an OBE and neither was attended in one of the rooms with one of these shelves installed. Even if these OB Es were real, there was no way that the patient could report seeing the objects. So, we are basically left with one intriguing case where a 57 y.o. Patient reported verifiable events while he was proven unconscious via stimuli and several anecdotal cases. That one case is interesting and promising, but hardly the “boom” that a “proven” OBE could have been and all of it is thanks to flawed design. If they are going to continue (which seems likely, they just go another grant from Templeton) they should shrink the sample size to include only the patients attended in the retrofitted rooms or as I said above, reconsider the placement of the “signs”..","date":"2014-10-08","mins":"1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-160423","author":"eric","post":"This is actually not new, Parnia had hinted that they had one case where they used external stimuli to gauge if the “experience” took place when the brain was “off” instead of “rebooting” (or going “shutting down”) and determined that it actually happened during the “off” phase. That was back in December: http://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=player embedded&v=z P Cvuva2de U I have a few issues with the AWARE methods… First of all, if there are real OB Es, simply placing something above and out of view does not mean that the patient would see it. Heck, if I suddenly found myself outside of my body, I would place all of my focus on one thing: my lifeless body and the doctors working on it. AFAIK, most of the patients reporting OB Es report seeing themselves. So, if I was handling the study I would certainly focus on placing something near the patient’s body during the cardiac arrest. If doesn’t need to be something instrusive, but the focus should be the patient instead of the ceiling..","date":"2014-10-08","mins":"11:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-160464","author":"eric","post":"The entire lower body does not interfere, I could think of a few methods to place something “unusual” there. The most simplistic would involve a psychedelic colored sheet which would be placed on the legs of the patient by one of the nurses and quickly removed once a pulse is found. Alternatively, something could be worn by a member of the staff. Would wearing a clown wig while trying to revive someone be considered inappropriate?.","date":"2014-10-08","mins":"2:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4703","author":"eric","post":"I have never seen Christ holding an orb in any rendition of him.
