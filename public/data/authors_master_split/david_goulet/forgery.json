Who would have knowledge of such processes? Bakers, cooks. Most sindonologists focus on artisans/painters as likely hoaxers and have looked there for the prototypes, that missing link between concept and finished product. None have been found in the art realm, yet. Though contact prints are in the ballpark. But is there something in the food realm that could be the prototype, something that could be pointed to as the inspiration? Perhaps the search should be widened and not just ancient art or linen experts interviewed, but experts on medieval baking and food prep..","date":"2016-11-07","mins":"8:30 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"id":"comment-8031","author":"david_goulet","post":"I suppose you need to be more sensationalistic in your headlines.

It’s often struck me that there is little in the Gospels about the Shroud – if the image was as pronounced as it is today — or perhaps even more vivid. The burial linens might still have been kept as precious relics (the blood alone would make them very special). It’s not until later in the ‘historic’ record that we here more about an image not made with human hands. There are different theories about fires and poker holes – might the Shroud have been baked unintentionally at some later point – which led to the Maillard reaction image to become pronounced. Obviously, flour is not the material that cooked in this scenario, but perhaps other oils or substances used in the burial process. As you noted at some point, there’s almost no way currently to find evidence of a flour base so I assume this would be the same with other similar substances. If you don’t wish to entertain this 1st century line of thinking, I understand. You’re ‘all in’ (to use a poker term) on this medieval model (for good reason) but it did strike me that aspects of it are transferable to the 1st century hypothesis. Shroud researchers (pro or con authenticity) should be paying attention to your experiments..","date":"2016-09-28","mins":"3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"}]
