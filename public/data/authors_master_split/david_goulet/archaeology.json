[{"id":"comment-212557","author":"david_goulet","post":"Louis, Daveb was right to point out that the topic post is about the linen on the Shroud possibly being of Indian origin. This has nothing to do with the spread of Christianity to India et al. How was that provocative of him to simply mention it? And if the professionals here cannot easily dismiss the ravings of upstart amateurs, then perhaps they are not as professional as they believe. To be honest, I’ve noticed your tendency to swerve the post topics toward your favourite domain of religious/Biblical history and musings on modern monotheistic culture. Interesting they may be, but they do tend to sidetrack the main discussion – as this thread demonstrates. By the way, there is no such thing as an amateur thinker. Even an amateur can ask a wise question. I sincerely look forward to your upcoming article(s)..","date":"2015-10-15","mins":"8:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/14/linen-from-india/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Linen from India?"},{"id":"comment-212670","author":"david_goulet","post":"Well said, OK.

I’m an expert of nothing (least of all computer technology) – relevant to the Shroud – but as this is a public blog that matters not. I’ve been following this blog for a few years now, reading all the posts and debates. And if my comments are that nasty or provocative I’m sure Dan will rap my knuckles.

But if we all (me included) can keep the discussions cordial and with less bluster (I’m not speaking specifically of you Louis) this makes it much easier to concede a point. It takes great humility to concede those points, as evidenced by Charles dogged defense of what is not a promising theory. The longer we hold to ‘defeated’ points the longer the distraction from gaining ground on the truth. The ideal climate for discussion is one that is open and charitable — even as it is focused on evidence. As a Christian I believe that Jesus won’t judge us on how ardently we stood for the Shroud, but how well we stood for each other during our mutual exploration of its mystery. Enough sermons from me. Let’s carry on with the meaty discussions..","date":"2015-02-23","mins":"10:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/update-again-on-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Update Again on the Gospel of Jesus’ Wife"},{"id":"comment-191606","author":"david_goulet","post":"Admit defeat.
