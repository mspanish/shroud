It’s tough to answer because, as is often pointed out with others, it is the sum of many factors that convinces me. If I have to choose just one, I suppose it is the fact that we have only one such Shroud. If it was a fake the method used for the image formation should have (n.b. Not ‘must’ have) been used again in some similar way. This is the hallmark of novel technologies. But I’d like to flip the question to our skeptic friends and ask what one feature of the Shroud convinces you it can’t be authentic?.","date":"2014-01-04","mins":"8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/04/what-one-single-characteristic-about-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"What one single characteristic about the shroud  . . . ?"}]
