Among the textile fragments excavated at Masada were the remains of pieces of fabric with L shaped cloth markings affixed to them. Dating to before A.D. 73, these are among the very earliest known examples of such marked garments. Scholars refer to these markings as gammadia, some of them being shaped like the Greek letter gamma (G). Though similar patterns have been found in several locations, the significance of these markings remains unknown to archaeologists and art historians. Because these markings seem to appear artistically in conjunction with some hope for life or glory after death, their presence on the clothing found at Masada may reflect something about the religious hopes and convictions of the Jewish fighters who died there.” It doesn’t appear the L is Shroud based, if this info is correct.

If 3rd to 9th century Byzantines still recognized the significance of the L shape this means they would not have dared repair those holes. And if the holes were created in the medieval era, when the appreciation of the symbolism was lost, then they most certainly would have been repaired, no? Unless it was known that those holes existed from the very beginning in which case – even if the symbolism was lost – the need to preserve their unique presence (a checkmark of provenance) was paramount.

Is the blood belt a point of resistance? A transport linen would need to be longer and stronger than a simple enrobing death shroud. Hugh has pointed out many times how thick the linen is. If it’s the transport cloth would this explain Jesus’ more supple arms in death, rigor not having set in (this occurring later)? If this was the transport linen (versus the burial shroud)then it does remove the Resurrection as a possible image formation source. The image would be natural, though no less a ‘miracle’ given the conditions required to create it. Some questions for our forger theory: why did they choose this type of linen for their reproduction? If they are basing their material selections on the Gospels, then why not choose a finer linen as mentioned in the Gospels?

One problem I had with the HPM is that the bottom rectangle didn’t ‘make sense’ to me. The holes on it (more of a circular pattern)didn’t match with the top rectangle (a clear L pattern). However if the bottom rectangle is the tomb lid those holes then make sense if they are the viewing holes. And this then allows the top rectangle to be more stand alone and represent (as you believe) the Shroud. I’m not an artist but I could then see some significance to ‘reading’ the drawing from right to left and from the bottom to layer to the top layer: tomb (death), the Shroud and discarded grave linens (death overcome) and finally the angel (heaven triumphant). Also the very fact that the men preparing Jesus for the tomb have him on a linen is not insignificant.

As much as it pains me to say it, The Shroud Affair is not likely to succeed. I’m a screenwriter who has likewise attempted to use crowd funding to further a script and it’s a tough slog. Adding to the challenge is the fact that there are already dozens of Shroud themed projects/scripts out there. I know because a major Hollywood producer told me this 12 years ago when I was pitching him one I’d found. The pitch behind the Shroud Affair feels, in my opinion, too soft — and no Hollywood producer is going to make a film with the goal of creating a scientific opportunity. It’s about making a profit, pure and simple. As a Shroudie, I hate to rain on the parade here. But I’m only giving my opinion based on my own experience and knowledge of Hollywood — especially pitching. All that being said, there is a very tantalizing high concept premise in the Shroud pitch that I believe a Hollywood producer might be interested in: the one million dollars to whoever can replicate the Shroud! This reminds me of James Randi’s famous million dollar offer to anyone who could reproduce a paranormal event (under scientific observation). He never had to pay out – though many tried. Pitch the Shroud Challenge, a reality TV series. Get an insurance firm to cover the million (I don’t think anyone will get to claim it!). Then invite challengers to submit (online) their proposed method for replicating the Shroud. Select the best (and a few of the really goofball ones) and film their efforts for the series. TV channels like Discovery or FX would be obvious potential partners. It’s Mythbusters territory – edutainment.

Freeman: “the earliest representations of Christ with a beard are not in the east but in Rome.” My comment: You’re right about that but if the Shroud has likely been the model (direct or indirect) for the Pantocrator type of icon (early 6th century and possibly a bit before that time), I seriously doubt it if the same thing for the few bearded Christ frescos that have been found in the catacombs of Rome. On that subject, there are 2 things that make me think like this: 1 At that time (3th or 4th century A.D.) in Rome, the most common figure of God was a man with long hair and long beard (like Zeus and other great divine figures), so it is highly probable that those pagan depictions of God have been used to represent Christ at a time when no one knew what he looked like (which make me think the Shroud was still well hidden somewhere at that time). And 2 There is not one of these bearded Christ frescos that show as many points of congruence as we found in most Pantocrator like icons, which make me think the first depictions (the Roman frescos) were not based on the image we see on the Shroud, while it is the contrary for the Pantocrator like icons.

Why do you assume the Shroud was seen/displayed full length? The front of it was all that would have been of interest to followers, and displaying the naked rear may have been deemed sacrilegious. Others have theories about only the face being shown — it’s a credible theory. I simply don’t see the lack of double image representation in the historic record as a backbreaker for the authentist argument. A fair challenge to be sure, but not a brick wall. There’s no need for special pleading when the challenge is surmountable to begin with..","date":"2015-02-09","mins":"10:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-189356","author":"david_goulet","post":"Guilty as charged, Daveb. I shall look into Markwardt. Save the spoon for your morning pablum. I was dead serious, Colin. You have no precedent in art history for the Shroud so you can’t ipso factso call it man made. You have only a theory – no proof. Note, I’m not saying the theory is without merit. You did say not to mention the carbon dating. :).","date":"2015-02-05","mins":"9:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-190406","author":"david_goulet","post":"You’ll be back.

Why are all the pre 1300 art references to the Shroud cryptically encoded so that only one 21st century man (Max) is able to decipher their link the Shroud? Why is there not one single overt representation such as we see post 1300? The 1300 year gap is a serious challenge to the authentist side. As Dave B has pointed out, there are theories (credibly presented) that provide some accounting for that gap. This is what makes the Shroud so enigmatic, on almost every level it sits on the fence of proof — sometimes leaning to the grass of the authentic, sometimes to that of the inauthentic. It appears unequivocally in the historical record at the 1300 mark — but there are signs pointing back to the 1st century. It is a grand puzzle authored by…...","date":"2015-02-05","mins":"9:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-189368","author":"david_goulet","post":"So every person/artist who may have seen the Shroud pre 1300 was part of this esoteric initiation?.","date":"2015-02-05","mins":"10:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-189406","author":"david_goulet","post":"It has no precedent in art or otherwise. You’ve accounted for that ‘gap’ with a reasonable theory. Polite applause for that.

The authentist rightly points to the Shroud popping into art history without precedent so it’s fair to turn the table on that observation. There will be theories. Some may have more merit than others. But until the authentist produces some undeniable evidence of the Shroud’s existence pre 1300, it all remains theory. Likewise, until the skeptic produces proof of Shroud prototypes in the art or historic record, it too remains theory that it is man made. One thing in favour of that “newish” linen is that if – as the theory goes — the Shroud was lost/hidden away then it was in a perfect situation for preservation. Some mummies look newish compared to others that may not have been as undisturbed. The lack of history, for both sides of the debate, is a stumbling block — not a road block..","date":"2015-02-04","mins":"3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-189800","author":"david_goulet","post":"So the movie Finding Nemo is actually a documentary about finding the Shroud in the murky depths of history?
