I’d only add that the Shroud is not simply a science matter but also a history matter and an art matter. These realms are much more subjective and can be vexing when mixed with the science. For a person who prefers pure science it will indeed appear as pseudo science. But it isn’t necessarily. There is the possibility that the science could reach a definite conclusion about the Shroud and still be wrong. Say what, Dave? The C14 tests may be accurate — but because we do not know everything of the Shroud’s history there is the possibility that something has altered the materials and thus the C14. This may be highly improbable, but it is not impossible and thus not unscientific to explore that avenue. Much the same way it is improbable leeches were used to bloody the Shroud, but not impossible, and therefore not unscientific for someone like yourself to explore it. I have no problem with any ‘researcher’ theorizing whatever they can imagine about the Shroud. Quantum physics, lazers, time distortions, Maillard, scorches, etc. The Shroud is a huge question mark and at this point the image formation is open to all possibilities. What matters is the logic of the explanation of the theory and what proofs the person gives to explain why they still see it as a possibility. There is too much certainty in the tone of too many folks around here. On both sides of the debate.

As a Jesuit he is a man who understands the role of science and reason. Allowing a balanced new study of the Shroud would be a great way to further this type of respectful (fingers crossed!) dialogue. What a fitting way to practice what we preach — and this Pope is certainly trying to be a ‘practice what I preach’ type of leader.

And you’re quite right about the anomalous dating of snails and virtually all marine organisms. A lot of their carbon is obtained from dissolved CO2, which in turn can derive from old carbonates as well as atmospheric CO2. This was given as the explanation for Richard III’s bones dating from before their ‘correct’ date, as he was assumed to have eaten a lot of seafood. It is probably also the explanation for the famous ibis anomaly, if the bird’s diet was largely aquatic, while its wrappings came from atmospheric photosynthesis.
