I believe the majority of the team (whether they were religious or not) expected to find evidence fairly quickly that the Shroud was not authentic. The fact that they did not find conclusive evidence is telling. And I’ll bet all of them, at some point in the ensuing years, thought “I wish we’d thought to check for (insert preferred test here).” I found it interesting in Barry’s EWTN interview that he mentioned the Tilma of Guadalupe and how, based on the existing evidence, he thinks further testing would “disappoint” people. He’s implying of course that from what he’s seen it is fairly clear the Tilma is man made (but no less a holy icon). He knows what to look for.

His claim is that this is a unique image created by a artisan looking to create a relic that fills the niche between the Veronica (Jesus still alive) and the linens post Easter. He’s basically saying that the Shroud was not meant to be a shroud at all, but an imprint (like the Veronica) of the deceased Jesus prior to entombment. You said the sources of the 15th and 16th century refer to the Shroud as the linen Jesus is taken from the cross with — which is Colin’s theory re: the Shroud. Thus there is a dovetailing that fits his theory, that after the Shroud debuts, people begin to connect the Shroud with the linen — which I will henceforth refer to as The Nicodemus linen, as per Colin’s theory.

If the blood did come first (some here maintain this has to be truly proven yet) then the likelihood of it being a fake is extremely remote. The next challenge would be the image formation mechanism itself. No one has been able to duplicate that process – at least not to the point where the majority of objective viewers would agree ‘okay that’s very likely how it was done’. Colin, and others, have come up with several formation methods of varying degrees of complexity that indeed give us a close approximation of the Shroud, using materials available to a medieval artist. These experimental images would have been sufficient to ‘fool’ a medieval audience which did not have any type of expertise to discern otherwise (nor did they have direct access to the relic for study). This then is problematic for the theory as one would expect the medieval artist himself to have employed one of these methods. Had he, we would be able to duplicate the method rather easily today. And yet here we are discussing Maillard reactions, scorches, paint, lemon juice, flour, etc. Even if the materials were easily accessible in the period, the technology employed would appear to have been known to only a handful of conspirators who took that knowledge to their graves. Another challenge, and this applies to most contact theories that rely on an actual human model, is the hair. Exposed skin makes for a nice contact surface but hair not so much. And even if accomplished, did no pilgrim ever wonder – “how does hair leave an image in a sweat imprint without a little divine help”? And if the divine can be easily brought into the explanation, why did the forger go to such length on the image formation mechanism? There are some other challenges that Daveb has outlined as well. All grist for the mill. Whether one agrees with Colin’s Shake n Bake theory – he’s come up with a rationale motivation and plot line for the forger.

Did he attempt to promote the icon as the ‘full body Veronica’ only to be disappointed to have it interpreted as the actual burial linen? I can understand you mining this niche as it explains why a medieval artisan would make an image of a dead Jesus (rather than a more potent fake relic of a Jesus in the process of being resurrected which would have really played to medieval sensibilities). And certainly if you found the niche, it’s possible a medieval person may have too. If this was the case it would appear he was too clever for his own good though.

Jesus himself, when tempted in the desert by the Devil to call on God to prove that Jesus was the Messiah, replies “you shall not put the Lord your God to the test”. This may be on the minds of Church leaders. Are we testing the Shroud to prove our faith (a motivation Jesus warns against) or is it to seek Truth for its own sake (something Jesus encouraged)? And if we refuse to do the testing, is it because we fear we will be disappointed and our faith shaken? If so, then this is all the more reason to test it. Or is the Shroud, like the Resurrection itself, destined to be a mystery forcing us to believe or not believe according to our ‘faith’?.","date":"2013-11-22","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/22/quote-for-today-13/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Quote for Today"},{"id":"comment-174935","author":"david_goulet","post":"“Icon of Holy Saturday” is a perfect description by Benedict.
