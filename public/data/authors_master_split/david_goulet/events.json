If blood was added to the Shroud in the medieval era, why is it so degraded that we can only claim, with some certainty, that it is primate blood? I would expect the blood, if it is ‘only’ 600 years old, to still be more useful forensically. Perhaps Dr. Kearse can provide some insight on that question..","date":"2015-03-17","mins":"12:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"id":"comment-193648","author":"david_goulet","post":"Thanks for the Blood 101 lesson.

One could look at Barrie’s pro authenticity stance, and many appearances promoting that stance, as evidence that he is no longer an objective sindonologist. Should he then be the ‘face’ of STERA – which should be recognized as an objective organization? Optics matter. I think that is a fair question, respectfully. Do I think he is doing these talks/presentations simply for monetary gain and late life fame? No. But I can’t know his motivation without being able to read his mind and heart. Can anyone besides Barrie? p.s. His referencing the ‘sold out’ presentations I take as his way of conveying the great interest in the Shroud. I didn’t see it as grandstanding.

That’s not his fault. He’s been put on a pedestal by some, to the point I feel like he’s being upheld by some Christian Shroudies as a modern Nicodemus — ‘the good Jew’. Because he remains Jewish this makes him even more ‘valuable’ as an icon. The fact that he’s a warm and charming man only makes him more desirable as a champion. I’m talking plainly and openly here, I mean no disrespect to anyone. There’s a palpable emotionalism tied to his relationship with the Shroud. This is not the case with you on the other side of the debate. We all know that there is much more to this debate than just science and history. The Shroud is a lightening rod for our deeper beliefs. Barrie is not just another Shroudie, he’s much more. He didn’t plan it that way, no one did. It’s an organic process driven by human psychology and, dare I say, providence..","date":"2015-09-24","mins":"3:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"id":"comment-211099","author":"david_goulet","post":"Addenda, when I speak of emotionalism I don’t mean from Barrie, but from others..","date":"2015-09-24","mins":"3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"id":"comment-211094","author":"david_goulet","post":"For the record, Thibault, I think Barrie is a genuine and very good person.
