There were only two people who believed she was still a virgin — Joseph and Mary. Growing up Jesus would have been the punch line to many a joke about “Joseph’s son’. Whether Jesus was born of a virgin is mystery — what is written may be fact, it may be myth, in the end it is not what defines him. Nor is he defined by his chromosomes – for “he was like us in all things but sin”. Like us.

It is then that she may have shared the story of the annunciation to him. Pure speculation of course. Fact remains that Mary’s family would not have believed her explanation of her early pregnancy – perhaps Joachim and Anna did but they would have kept this a secret for the very reason that the extended family would have thought the angel/virgin birth story a bald faced lie by Mary to cover her pregnancy outside marriage. Joseph was faced with a dilemma. He had to accept the unborn child as his, or see Mary stoned for dishonouring her marriage pledge to him. He chooses, after the dream, to acknowledge the child as his own. Though those close to him may have known he was not the true father, his public acceptance of the pregnancy ended the conversation. By the time Jesus begins manifesting miracles, the only person still alive that knew of the virgin birth was Mary herself. It’s unlikely she would have shared that secret at that time — and of course who would have believed it anyway? it would only be the post Easter community, that believed Jesus was divine, that would have been open to such a possibility. Again, this is all speculation. How much is myth, how much is fact or at least rooted in fact we can never know. I’m mindful of the adage ‘just because a story isn’t factual doesn’t mean it isn’t true”..","date":"2015-12-09","mins":"11:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Jesus, the XX Male"},{"id":"comment-216033","author":"david_goulet","post":"To answer your question: it makes no difference to my faith who Jesus’ biological “father” was.
