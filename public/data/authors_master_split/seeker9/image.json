[{"id":"comment-2795","author":"seeker9","post":"I would have to say neither camp, for or against has made conclusive arguments Carbon dating past, present, future (although highly unlikely) proves the age of the cloth itself and not when the actual image was produced Some refer to Da Vinci and the camera obscura..i.e the reason it behaves like a photograph is because it was made using photographic techniques. Some experts have also noted key similarities between the face on the Shroud and that of Da Vinci himself But Da Vinci appears to have been born way too late in terms of what some consider to be historical references to the shroud e.g the Holy Mandylion of Edessa or the Pray Manuscript. Then again, it could be argued that if it is indeed man made, the “artist” used an ancient piece of cloth and had seen the Pray manuscript and added those finishing details to the image…. But then there’s the possible relationship with the Sudarium of Oviedo…. So, I will not say it is fake or real I just think it is absolutely magnificent regardless And I am Sikh not Christian!.","date":"2011-04-04","mins":"6:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/30/new-3d-rendering-of-the-shroud-of-turin-face-by-john-chen/","cat":"image_theory","title":"New 3D Rendering of the Shroud of Turin Face by John Chen"}]
