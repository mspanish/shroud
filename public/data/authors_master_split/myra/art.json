[{"id":"comment-28544","author":"myra","post":"For the past few months I have been going through things in my home for a yard sale. I was just quickly going through them and then without really looking at the books that I was putting into boxes , then day before yesterday I was rearranging the books in two of the boxes and I don’t remember ever buying this book , but I had heard about it and thought one of these days I’m going to buy it. Well GOD or his SON JESUS must have been listening to me , because there it was in one of the boxes that I was packing up to put in the yard sale. So I took it out and started to read it ” Heaven is for real ”. It had been a long time since I had sad down and read a book so intently. I have saved on my computer all of this other information. I love this book , I fully believe in GOD and HIS SON JESUS and HEAVEN. I have no certain religion in my life , I believe as it says in the Bible that GOD loves us all and that he will be our only judge when we reach the gates of heaven. I have asked him for forgiveness for my young life and my discretions during that time. I have become older and wiser now. I thank GOD for putting this book in my hands ..","date":"2013-03-27","mins":"10:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
