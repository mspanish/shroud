I don’t think the “exact match” is as convincing as the authors seem to think, but I do understand their comparison. Can I ask if these pictures are from (the Polish version of) “Le Linceul de Turin et la Tunique d’Argenteuil : Le point sur l’enquete” by André Marion and Gérard Lucotte? I may have to get a copy to understand their ideas fully. Yes. Hugh Farey : And has anyone read “Une si Humble et si Sainte Tunique” by the man who commissioned some of the investigation? Does it contain anything the Lucotte book doesn’t? (I’m too mean to buy both books if one will do!) Unfortunately I don’t have it. Almost all of my knowledge comes from Le Linceul de Turin et la Tunique d’Argenteuil, other sources are either older and before 1997 2005 investigations (but can be useful for historical research), or are simply derived from “Le Linceul…” like Górny& Rosikoń. I have also La Tunica di Gesu. Tirata a sorte dai soldati romani a piedi dalla croce by Father Jean Charles Leroy, which is mainly repetition from “Le Linceul…”, but has also some supplemetary information.

The blood comes both from thehair and side of the face, as suggested by Lavoie. This is evident when you make some proper measurements and some digital processing of the images. First look at those Shroud Scope measurements The lenght from the tip of the nose to the blood mark (around 9 cm) in the hair is perfectly consistent with what one would expect about the distance from the tip of the nose to the side of the cheek.

I am not certain whether our views are similar, or different. You wrote: It was a specific discussion of the few rivulet looking blood stains on the side of the face. Do you mean side of the head (cheeks area, ~90 degrees from the nose) or frontal (face) side of the head? Because we may understand the term different. They certainly cannot come from the scalp. Perhaps from the cheek as you wrote, not the scalp, but I do not think this is the case either, explained at length in the paper that the Shroud was not flattened I presented at Dallas in 2005. In fact, this is the case, but, this does not contradicts your 2005 paper, in fact only strenghtens it. I definetly agree that the Shroud was not flattened it couldn’t have been But this does not exclude the bloodmarks in the cheek area and the presence of hair there also. Let me explain this. First the Shroud layout on the face: Yellow line is the flat reference surface (flattened Shroud, which we reject). Red line is the Shroud in strict contact with the body the contact image (which leads to consideable distortions, so we reject that hypothesis). Blue line is the Shroud being stretched while wrapping the face. This is the most likely position of the Shroud while the body image was created leading to moderate distortions. That’s what you have shown in the paper. Next we have projection mechanism: Where: 1. Vertical projection 2. Projection perpendicular to the body 3. Projection perpendicular to the sheet 4. Projection via the lines of the closest distance between body and sheet. You conjectured that the most likely projection mechanism is 4. Yet, in your paper you assumed 1. For its simplicity. Most people also assume mechanism 1.(verical projection on the sheet), even not being aware of the problem. It appears to be “natural”, so most people adopts it by default. But this leads to considerable delusion, if any other mechanism is correct. If other mechanism of projection than vertical is invoked, the results on the flat sheet would be different. For example 4. We apparently see hair being a few centimeter to the side of the face, separated from them by dark areas. But this is illusion! If you take some measurements via Shroud Scope, and compare it with meauserents perfromed on a living men, using simple elastic tape measure (which reflects approximately the shape of the linen wrapped around the face), it is obvious that the hair must be next to the face. This is further strenghten by the 3 D relation the intensity of the hair area is similar to that of the face. Further, if you eliminate dark bands, it is apparent that the image is continuous between the face and the hair thus clearly showing that the hair must be closely bound to the sides of the face. No other option. The only solution is the presented Mask of Agamemnon. It was once normal mask, a 3 D block covering the normal face but was forcefully flatten by collpasing roof. Similarly, the Shroud once wrapped 3 D shape a 3 D head. But as the sheet is flat due to its nature, the resultatnt body image is distorted in a similar way the Mask of Agamemnon is. You need some 3 D imagination to correctly perceive it +plus perhaps digital elimination of bandings. Their use by the Shroud Creator to give us impression of looking at undistorted face is absolute masterpiece!.","date":"2015-01-07","mins":"12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"},{"id":"comment-181887","author":"o_k","post":"Mario: Can the frontal bloodstains come from the hair?

Actually they come from both skin and hair. The blood marks on the face side are actually in the positions indicated by Lavoie, in the cheeks.But the hair are also in this area, tightly bound to the face. What misleads people is the misconception that hair are away from the cheeks. Actually they are exactly on the cheeks.

This is clear conclusion from Lind & Antonacci paper, as well other works. If the blood is old and already coagulated, it doesn’t get reflected on linen. So only the most fresh bloodmarks, created just before (or shortly after) death could have been reflected. This mean that the Shroud image doesn’t reproduce the full amount of blood present on the body in fact only small percent, which may be misleading. Presumably whole body and hair were covered with blood. So I adjusted color balance of the photo of wounded gentleman but exactly in opposite way to what David Mo has done, reducing amount of red, and showing only the most prominent blood tracks.

Not a smidgin. The crease is modern. No old painting can be based upon it. I would not depend on a single photo, no matter Pia, Enrie, Miller, Schwortz, as the visibility of the crease may depend on lighting parameters. Nevertheless, the crease is (although barely) visible on the Shroud Scope’s Durante photos. I don’t understand your reference to the Manopello painting, which probably dates to the late middle ages. That means you know very little about Manoppello Image. Now, why don’t paintings show a uniform collection of abnormalities? Are we to suppose that every pantocrator painter had personal experience of the shroud, and they each picked out their own selection of imperfections? Some went for forked beards, some didn’t notice that the beard was forked but did spot a minutely visible imperfection in the weave between the eyes? The arbitrary selection of this or that characteristic is, I think, the main argument against these Vignon markings having credibility. This seems strange when artists are supposed to have studied the shroud in such detail as to copy minute imperfections of the weave as if they were essential parts of their reproductions. How should I make more clear to all those sceptics, that most of those images are copies of the copies of the images derived from the Shroud? That’s why the choice is arbitrary in several cases. Those are paintings, not photocopies. Besides, as we noted, even photographs may differ basing on their parameters, so what to say about paintings. The St Catherine’s Pantocrator is one of the earliest. It seems to come from Constantinople in the 6th century. It shows no sign of having been derived from the shroud. The major features, the droopy moustache, the long pointed beard, the round shape of the hair around the head, and so on, bear no resemblance to the shroud. Even the asymmetric eyebrows and the bag under the left eye owe nothing to the shroud. Look carefully. The other Pantocrator you link to is in Delphi, in Greece. This one is also typical of its group which represent a more graphic and sylised art form, with lots of well defined lines on the forehead and neck. There is possibly a greater case to be made here for derivation from the shroud, but I still don’t think the case holds water. Again, look carefully. Count the number of similarities to the Shroud. All in all, I’m still not persuaded that the “Vignon markings” have any cogency. They have. But they are not everything. Every icon is specific and has its own similarities to the Shroud.

We had a look at this last December (The Sciatica Effect, Dec 28 2013), and I queried the existence specifically of the celebrated “double crease” under the chin, said to be the source of so many of those Byzantine portraits of Christ with a double line at the top of his tunic. As it was discussed, the “double crease” is visible under appropriate conditions. Besides, one should decide what is more important, the “double” or “crease”, which is very often represented as low collar on Christ’s tunic. The neck is alos often emphasized, another common trait with the Shroud, just see http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Meister von Daphni 002.jpg As for the two strands of hair, they do not appear at all on the shroud, and I am not at all persuaded that they are representations of the epsilon blood drip ‘translated’ into hair. But they appear here: http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C5%82un z Manoppello#mediaviewer/Plik:Volto Santo 01.jpg Anyway, it is one of the most characteristic features on the majority (but not all) of the Byzantine icons. Whether they are derived from the Shroud aka Mandylion or Manoppello aka Camuliana (it could be from either of them) is a secondary issue. Three of the Vignon markings, which appear to exist on the shroud, are really only one, namely the open square, the shallow V inside it and the droopy V below it. The square is easily the most visible, but apart from the Roman catacomb painting (what was the shroud doing in Rome, one wonders?) most of the paintings which are claimed to have derived from the shroud seem to have omitted the square altogether in favour of the V markings. How odd. There is no icon with all 15 markings. Those three are not one and the same, instead one of them is usually picked. On Daphni Pantocrator there are all 3. The Rome pantocrator is likely based on some other icon derived directly from the Shroud most of those paintings are copies of copies, second or third generation from the Shroud. As for the nose and cheeks, there is, very properly, no sign of any bruising or battering on the Byzantine portraits. On the glorius Pantocrator? Are you crazy? Nevertheless, look at the Sinai painting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg It is a face of a boxer, isn’t it? They nearly all show their subject turned slightly towards, and illuminated by, light from the right. Not only does this reduce the area of cheek visible on the right, but also means that there is a greater area of cheek, and more shadow, on the left. I do not feel this establishes that this asymmetry in the depiction of the nose and cheeks is derived from the shroud. Again, this is artistic interpretation, based on.. What? How do you think, what was the origin of this tradition? As for the moustache and beard, it is obvious that the general shape of a Byzantine moustache looks nothing like that of the man in the shroud. His is quite bushy and bulges around the nostrils; theirs consists of two long straight diagonals with a little tuft in the middle. If anything, this style of moustache clearly shows that these portraits are not derived from the shroud You should be happy that there is even a mustache separeted from the beard! Demanding that the mustache must be ideally copied from the Shroud is just splitting hairs. But look again on the Sinai Pantocrator. Byzantine depictions of beards, surely the most prominent and distinctive of features (I have a beard myself, dear reader) are split about 50/50 forked or pointed. Not a clear derivation from the shroud, in my opinion. I would say it is more than 50/50 for forked than pointed. But you should look also for other characters, and I think in their case it is far less than 50/50 forked to pointed. And finally, leaving aside all the markings, once again the basic question: Why every child recognizes this face, while there is nowhere in the Scripture written how he looked like? This is the very basic question, most academic (pseudo)scholars never asked!.","date":"2014-04-26","mins":"2:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/26/how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"id":"comment-104066","author":"o_k","post":"Fair enough.

See http://www.shroud.com/shroudfr.gif and compare with http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Full length negatives of the shroud of Turin.jpg Where is the upper crease just above the head, for example? The point about the Vignon markings is that they appear on images and “cannot be artistically justified except with reference to the shroud.” And there’s no doubt that the Roman catacomb portrait does have a big meaningless square between the brows. It is, however, the only instance of that in all the images I have seen (It is not one of OK’s examples). All the others, and every instance of the supposed “forehead streak” and most of the “V”s, are perfectly reasonable deliniations of the supra orbital ridges and bulge of the forehead, and need owe nothing to any supposed imperfections on the shroud. A very few images, it is true, have well defined, and apparently meaningless well defined curvy lines, loops and triangles drawn across the brows, and these, I agree, need explaining, but they look nothing like the faint imperfections on the shroud. OK, like most “Vignon spotters” somewhat arbitrarily assigns these to “topless squares,” and the two supposed V’s within and below them. This means that either you, or those who maintain this, does not understand what’s going on. There are no unique Vignon markings. All of them can find some non Shroud explanation. But the key is that they, even if stylishly incorporated as either “supra orbital ridges and bulge of the forehead” or anything else (which is just artistic interpretation) are present on those portraits (along with several other marks). Why? Isn’t it an attempt to “naturalize” some barely visible signs on the Shroud which origin they didn’t understand? They are not always visible at first glance but they are, even if just symbolically marked. But one needs to carefully and patiently observe those icons what, I suppose, you do not, instead judging from the first impression. Remember, 2 3 marks means nothing they may be accidental. But 5 6 are significant. A single casual glance at the image on the shroud shows a roughly rectangular face with no visible ears, a bushy moustache and a short, stubby, split beard. Astonishingly, in spite of their alleged study of minute differences between single threads, not a single one of OK’s images can be so described. Byzantine artists probably never got close enough to see any of the alleged weave imperfection markings at all. Hugh, I want to underline this : those are not exact photocopies of the image on the Shroud. Instead, they are usually copies of copies of images derived from the Shroud Most of the artists that painted those, never saw the Shroud. But they saw some other similar icons (derived from the Shroud) with some strange, unexplained markings on them, which they dutifully marked on another copies. Without asking unnecessary questions: why. It is not about reproducing photographically the shape of the nose or bird, symbollism and mystery are much more important in the icon business. There is a forked beard, so let there be forked beard, there is a small traingle between eye, or two little strands of hair, so let it be. They don’t have to look exactly the same, but they must be represented in some way, because it is some “theological mystery”, to say at least. Even more surprising, perhaps, is the fact that Vignon’s own sketch (if so it be; it seems the most reproduced) of his markings looks nothing like the shroud face either! A simple overlay test, such as is much beloved by the Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer and Akiane Kramarik schools of thought, shows no comparison at all. That’s no truth at all Hugh! What about this https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/image44.png Or this: http://www.theanimationacademy.com/an/Jesus Shroud7a.jpg or this paper of Resch (of whom I have not a high opinion, truly saying) http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Resch Web.pdf 1) Of course I’m a more authoritative observer than Vignon. So is anybody else. Vignon would have given his eye teeth for shroudscope or Shroud 2.0. His 1938 book was based on Enrie’s photographs, which, however good for their time, are nothing like as good as the ones we have today. And what have I used – isn’t it 2002 Durante from Shroud Scope? 2) I do not deny that all these marks (apart from the hairstrands and the crease) are distinguishable in one form or another on the shroud. What I deny is that perfectly natural depictions of the contours of the brow, on the one hand, or precisely delineated wavy lines with loops and triangles, on the other, are obviously derived from these markings.</I. So Hugh, let me ask a rhetorical question, if those are not derived from the Shorud, than from what? Look more carefully, Hugh. The similarities are astonishing, one just doesn’t have to turn own eyes away..","date":"2014-04-28","mins":"4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/27/more-on-how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"More on How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"id":"comment-104475","author":"o_k","post":"I have already sent an updated version with Novogrod Mandylion (so now there are 20 icons) and some basic descriptions from Wikipedia..","date":"2014-04-27","mins":"5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/27/more-on-how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"More on How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"id":"comment-106023","author":"o_k","post":"Hugh: The whole point about ghe Vignon markings, as I understand it, is that by making no artistic sense, they prove that they must have derived from some other tradition which the artist didn’t understand. And I have already agreed that the style of pantocrator with the distinct wavy lines and triangles is one such anomaly. What I don’t agree in that case is that these designs are obviously derived from the shroud. If not from the Shroud, than from what? I cannot find any better model, and the number of similarities between those icons and the Shroud is striking. They are not direct proof, but the number and frequency of Shroud similar points (not only Vignon marks, which have some flaws, but no one suggested better set) is also far above what one could expect from simply random occurences. I’m afraid I’m not taken in by any of OK’s superpositions. All faces have eyes and mouths, and any two full face portraits can be related so that these features coincide. You are inconsistent. You claimed before that A simple overlay test, such as is much beloved by the Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer and Akiane Kramarik schools of thought, shows no comparison at all. And I showed that it is exactly opposite. Overlay tests are useful, but they are frequently overused as proof for some strange ideas (Leonardo or Good Shepherd examples), so they cannot be considered conclusive. It is a combination of those + some minute details like Vignon markings + some general similarities + some common sense (it is absurd to look for Vignon marks on the Virgin Mary icons for example, because even if they appear sometimes, they are obviously not derived directly from the Shroud) to make a good case. The fact remains that the most obvious and easiest to copy features of the face on the Shroud are not reflected in any of the Byzantine portraits, with their ovoid faces, with narrowed chins or beards, droopy moustaches and visible ears. Hugh, those are exactly the features of the Shroud face, and they are reflected on those Byzantine portrait. Strange you can’t see it. Watch the Durante photo in my paper carefully, it is exactly ovoid face, with very (even pathologically) narrowed chin and jaw, especially on the right (from the viewers perspecitve) side! Compare it with Sinai Pantocrator. Have you even read my remarks about that face? See also the droopy mustache and compare it with the Shroud, it ends abruptly on the right side much closer to the centre than on the left side, exactly the same as on the Durante’s photo. What about right skewed nose? What about scar on the neck, just in the very similar place like on the Durante’s photo? Haven’t you noticed that? As to the ears, they were simply added by Byzantine artists. Jesus, as being fully human, obviously had to have both ears. I don’t expect them to be photocopies, and no doubt most of them were copies of copies, but it is disingenuous to claim on the one hand that the copiers were only vaguely accurate about what they were depicting en large, but fanatically careful to include minute details – for mystery’s sake. See above. And one another thing see the gallery of painted Shroud copies.

A few days ago you dismissed my wide range of non Christ portraits carrying Vignon markings because, as they didn’t have shoulder length hair, they couldn’t possibly be derived from the Shroud. Now you seem to be a staunch defender of the Spanish Pantocrator, even though, as it has short hair, by your own repeated and insistent criteria, it cannot be derived from the Shroud, and therefore any Vignon markings it may posess are accidental! To every rule, there are some exceptions.For example, the Mandylion from Skylitzes (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Surrender of the Mandylion to the Byzantines.jpg )has no recognizable shoulder lenght hair, but surprisingly it has two strands of hair. We can say that one “Christ style” dominates from the 6th century, but what about Michelangelo? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Michelangelo%2 C Giudizio Universale 03.jpg When I said: “Jesus without long hair is not Jesus”, of course I meant general, not absolute rule. And frankly, I expected that sceptics would be trying to play red herring with it. That would show how despearate measures they need to utilize. There are not absolute criteria, and even Vignon marks have some flaws, though no one has yet suggested better system. What one needs is some common sense, which is dismissed by so favored byt he sceptics overconcentration on particular elements. Are there multiple Vignon marks on Byzantine potraits of Christ? They are there in majority of cases, and no one except most prejudiced sceptics deny this. Are there Vignon marks on non Christs? Yes, sometimes, but they are minority. It is obvious that on non Christs they cannot be derived from the Shroud but in the case of the Christs they can, and are the frequency of their presence is simply too high, and there are other notable similarites with the Shroud (beard, long hair, similar proportions etc.). Possible minor differences (ears, no blood traces) can be easily, and rationally explained. And that’s the whole philosophy. As to the Spanish Pantocrator, one can argue that there is long hair, hidden at the back of the head it is definetly not short hair. But that it would be unkind, one would feel like asking you the question you asked of Mo, wouldn’t one? In the case of David Mo, I hardly believe he didn’t notice marks 12 & 15 at last.

Jesus beardless and with the short hair was an icon that persisted till the first centuries of the Middle Age. And John the Baptist was ever presented with long hair and sometimes with a curl on the front. This has no necessary relation to the Shroud nor the actual appearance of Christ but to some theological conventions. Jesus with a beard and long hair was assimilated to the philosophers and Wisdom. Jesus beardless was the symbol of the Life. Cf: Chavanne Mazel, Claudine A.: “Popular Belief and the Image of Beardless Christ”, Visual Resources, Vol 19, no 1; 2003; p. 19 24. It is on line, I think. First thanks for the article, it is indeed interesting. It shows clearly that the further from Constantinople, the dominance of long hair, bearded, skinny Christ comes later. But this dominance since the 6th century is undisputable, and some exceptions confirming the rule cannot change that! And all the theories that development of such image occurred without influence of the Shroud are in fact nothing but pure academic speculations based on no evidentiary basis at all! We enlarge arbitrarily the rank of our survey. For example, we accept the Pantocrator of Taüll but not the Pantocrator of the Cristo de la Luz of Toledo. Why? Because we think the first accomplish (?? I doubt a lot) some Vignon Marks and the latter not a single one. That’s not true. There are several marks on the latter (http://www.arteguias.com/imagenes/cristoluzpinturas.jpg ), for example 1, perhaps 2 or 3, 12, 15, maybe more. Are you blinded or simply lying? How long the influence of the Shroud reached ? How? These are some important points to an historical hypothesis never specified in this case. It lasts up to this day, as I have shown a couple posts above. For practical reason I would consider only the period 500 1350, between discovery of Image of Edessa and the first appearance of the Shroud in Lirey. I hope this criterion is clear. The influence of the Shroud on Christ iconography post 1350 is beyond any discussion, as I will show one day. The influence in a period before 1350 (when , according to the sceptics, Shroud didn’t exist) as well. In what sense ‘oddity’? I think they are a ‘stilyzed’ sign, perhaps of concentration and power. (‘Stylization’: a natural feature modified in terms of an aesthetic style). But they scarcely ever or never appear as a vertical succesion of signs in form of V+rectangular box+V (2,3,4 marks) in the space between the eyebrows. Not in the Shroud, of course. They are rarely present all three (usually one or two), but on the Daphne Pantocrator they are all three, very expressly highlighted (why? ad hoc ideas about “stilyzed’ signs, perhaps of concentration and power.” don’t hold water) http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Meister von Daphni 002.jpg And they are certainly noticeable on the Shroud. Closing eyes and denying this don’t help you, David Mo. Yes on the non Christ they are accidental. On the Christ they are related to the Shroud. Petitio principii. You suppose the Mandylion is the Srhoud. This is far to be demonstrated. I suppose nothing about the Mandylion at this moment. I simply notice that frequency of the oddities known as Vignon marks is far beyond from what one could expect from mere random occurrences (the case of non Christ icons). And the very similar oddities can be found on the Shroud. Reasonable conclusion: they are derived from the Shroud.

The marks 5, 6 7 or 8 are practically inexistent, the same as the combination 2, 3 and 4. The mark 13 has two different ways of representation It is true that some of the marks are more frequent than others (see the table at the end of my presentation https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/shroudvignonpantocratorsmandylions.pdf ), but this not mean that those are not present on some (sometimes very significant) examples (for example Sinai for 5 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg and Hagia Sophia for 6,7, 8 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Christ Pantocrator Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg ) The combination of 2, 3, 4 is present on multiple examples, although rarely all three (Daphni is the most striking example http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Meister von Daphni 002.jpg ) The mark 13 can be represented in various ways, but the most important point is that it is represented. First problem: Marks 1, 10, 11 and 13 in both forms are common marks to a lot of portraits of these times and even before. Then, we have only two marks that can be considered identifying of Christ: 12 (divided beard) and 15 (lock of hair). I agree that marks 1,10,11,13 can be quite common on several portraits (though not all, and not in any context or style like in the case of the Christ), but then, even if we agree to your deeply sceptical interpretation, we have marks 12 and 15 as decisive factor (that means 12 & 15 +those mentioned before) during examination. But in some portraits of John the Baptist (for example) we can see the same lock of hair. Evidently here it doesn’t represent any blood stain, but only a lock of hair. Why do you think that the same lock of hair represents a blood stain in the Byzantine representation of Christ? Have you any reason to think so? Surely not. I haven’t heard any explanation of this arbitrary interpretation. One should remember that John the Baptist was born just a half year before his cousin Christ, so he is often portayed in the fashion similar to the latter. So in some occasions, he “inherited” the lock from Jesus. And that’s nothing unimaginable. See this modern icon of St. Joseph with baby Jesus ( http://lodztrojmasztowa.bloog.pl/id,337752810,title,Ikona modlitwa wschodu,index.html?smoybbtticaid=612b9f , below Pantocrator). Baby Jesus has a lock of hair, so has Joseph, who is clearly portrayed in a manner similar to adult Jesus. It has some improtance in this particular artistic expression. So, even in the supposition that the 15 Vignon’s marks were present in the Shroud (and I don’t see more of six or seven), there is not any “extraordinary coincidence” between these marks and the Byzantine iconography of Christ when we examine better the facts.” I can see all 15, (and can suggest some more) and there is clearly the coincidence, contrary to the other figures not related to the Shroud, like Moses, Elijah, St. Nicholas, Constantine or any other..","date":"2014-05-15","mins":"4:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-119766","author":"o_k","post":"Why?

Criticism acknowledged. However the fact is that it is impossible to determine where beards end and hairs begin on those icons. – The Christ of the Shroud has rings under de eyes. (???) And leptons. Yes indeed, it has some brighter ellipse rings around the eyes. – You do a ‘liberal’ intrpretation of mark 14 (rings under the eyes). But then, almost all the roman portraits of adult men, specially philosophers and emperors, have the same mark. It is not a characteristic feature of portrait of Christ! Nobody needed to copy nothing, but follow a pictorical convention thoroughly established. I don’t know what do you mean by the term liberal. I admit that this mark is problematic, as it is unclear what “heavily accented owlish eyes” actually means. Nevertheless, this is a feature that is visible on several icons those black eyes, like after some boxing fight, or three nights without sleep. The Sinai Pantocrator with its squint eyes is the most striking example. I cannot imagine how they could paint it without the reference to the Shroud. – You believe that two or three hairs sometimes almost invisible (VIII) are “similar” and “inspired” by a strong spiral form of blood(Shroud). (???) In Spain we say that this analogy “está traída por los pelos” ( is farfetched; literally: ‘brought by the hair’). Never better said. Have you any reason to suppose the first artist’s intention that converted the blood to hair or it is a mere supposition? Striking, or almost invisible, the most important point is their presence. The Byzantine icons ususally (although not always) have real obsession on this strand of hairs.as they are present even on miniatures http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mandylion#mediaviewer/File:Surrender of the Mandylion to the Byzantines.jpg So there must have been something important in those strands (even if they are just symbollically marked), for, if we forget the blood mark on the Shroud or similar strand on Manoppello (assuming it is identical to Camuliana Image, as Pfeiffer suggest), otherwise unknown reasons. You should not be blamed by have claimed these nonsense. Vingnon’s theory is based on remote analogies and statements of intentions without any verifiable support. I have never concealed that Vignon’s system has some weak points it mixes absolute marks (like 9, 12 or 15) with relative ones (6,7, 14). Besides marks 10 and 11 are usually related. Nevertheless, although flawed as it is, it allows for some basic systematic survey of all those icons, and makes a point, that there are several similarities between Shroud and Byzantine images of Christ. But the matter is of course much more complex, and one cannot stay just with the Vignon only. There are probably the whole famillies of genetically related icons there is some equivalent of “textual criticism” needed. Each icon has also its own specific similarites to the Shroud, not listed among Vignon marks. One could expand or revise that system. Besides there are some basic similiarites of proportions, and basic feature: long hair, presence of beard and mustache, thin nose, skinny face, and so on.

DM: Why do you think that the same lock of hair represents a blood stain in the Byzantine representation of Christ? Have you any reason to think so? They have similar shape, simply. And the easiest way to represent this epsilon shape on the glorious Pantocrators and Mandylions is with the use of hair lock. Of course the audience don’t know the true nature of it. Painters, if the whole Shroud had not been fully unveiled, perhaps also. And the form of the wrinkle in the neck of the Shroud (that actually is not) is very different of the wrinkle of the neck of the most part of Christ’s images we are analyzing. But these latter are very similar to many roman portraits. I think you will be able to extract the adequate inference. That wrinkle, or rather the whole base of the neck visible on the Shroud, can be interpreted in various ways, and both representations you showed can be justified. Just look carefully at the neck area on the Shroud. Just look a little bit below that wrinkle, there some U shaped area, similar to the mark 2. The sole feature common to the Shroud and the standard representation of Christ in the medieval art that might be clearly observable is the divided beard. All the other are based either on subjective vision or ad hoc inferences. And those ad hoc intreferences are indeed in those places on the shorud isn’t that remarkable? As to the subjective vision, everyone has it’s own. Isn’t it possible that some Byzantine artist had their subjective visions very similar to what some Shroud researchers claim (that means, they paid attention to the same tiny curiosities)?.","date":"2014-05-15","mins":"9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-120490","author":"o_k","post":"Dear O.K, are you sure what are you speaking of? Copernican Revolution?? Yes, Copernican Revoltion. Accepting that the most common image of Jesus since at least 6th century is in fact derived from the Shroud of Turin, would be Copernican Revolution in Christian art studies. It would be like moving from geocentrism to heliocentrism. But the Copernican Revolution you claim becomes a ridiculous thing if the sole historian you quote is against the method of Vignon with at least a similar argument as I have done here. See “THE SHROUD OF TURIN AND THE FACE OF CHRIST IN PALEOCHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE AND WESTERN MEDIEVAL ART”: “Vignon was a scholar of the natural sciences, of chemistry and biology. His iconographic arguments in regard to the Shroud therefore lack a bit of exact methodology. He was not sufficiently acquainted with the very vast range of the diverse images of Christ nor the variety of details they show”. (p. 12) and it goes further: “Vignon is right when he affirms that a resemblance exists between the classic type of the face of Christ and the Shroud face. He is right when he says that certain deformities on the Shroud face are due to the maltreatment Christ suffered during the different stages of his passion. If identical traces are found in art works representing Christ, Vignon reasoned, then these art works must be seen as dependent on the Turin relic. These same disfiguring marks seen on the Shroud face are indeed found on images of Christ but, Vignon added, they are found also on other personages. This, for art historians, is the weak spot in Vignon’s argument. In establishing a connection not only between the Shroud and images of Christ, but also with images of other persons, Vignon went beyond the limits of a method of certainty. He was the first to compare the sindonic face with the diverse art images, the first to introduce a method fundamentally sound (boldings mine), but he did not realize its limitations. Therefore, even though we owe so much to Vignon, we will take a different path.” Do not take sentences out of context. Copernican model was also imperfect, until Kepler..","date":"2014-05-16","mins":"12:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-120403","author":"o_k","post":"David Mo: Sorry, but in History of Art Vignon was so amateur as I am or worse (I have Internet and I have read some books). If am not in a mistake Vignon and his theory had no influence on studies of Byzantine Art. Perhaps, Wesselow?It wouldn’t be a big succes. Perhaps also Pfeiffer, for example: http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Pfeiffer Web.pdf http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi09part4.pdf http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi10part3.pdf Vignon and his theory had no influence on the studies of Byzantine Art? Well Vignon Wilson theory is in fact real Copernican Revolution in those studies something that the concrete will never accept. They prefere to stick to their suck out of the thumb theories about Zeus/Jupiter/Serapis, “portrayal of a bearded philospher”, or “popular pressure” contrary to the hard evidence of the Shroud image.
