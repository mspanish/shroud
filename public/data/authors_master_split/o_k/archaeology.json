As to India, and generally countries east of the Roman Empire (with possible exceptions of Georgia and Armenia), the Greek Roman world knew actually very little about them. It was largely a fantasy land. Almost the whole historiographic tradition of the West comes from Greek & Latin sources (and a liitle syriac, georgian and armenian). There are virtually no Persian historiography extant. And as to India, with a couple excpetions, there are no written history books (in Herodotus or Livy style) from there up to about 1200 AD (the muslim expansion), when an in Europe, an ordinary knight like Robert de Clari could write his own chronicle of the 4th Crusade.

Regardless of all problematic issues with commenters (what was to be expected regarding such extremely controversial matter as the Shroud), you created a great platform, where interested people, no matter their background, nationality, age and education, can exchange their views, knowledge and opinions on the Shroud, interact with each other, and even participate. This is extremely boosting for new views, new insights, deepening knowledge, introducing new ideas, making the research on the Shroud carry on. This blog really has potential to be the leading place for the scientific developments on the Shroud no matter personal quarrels that happen from time to time. Without it, we all would be limited to a bunch of books, articles, and about quarterly update on Barrie’s site.
