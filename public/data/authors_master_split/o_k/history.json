No matter that Pete Schumacher is an imaging expert, but as Mario Latendresse rightly commented, nowhere in the paper nor presentation slides there is evidence for his claims. There is nowhere clear illustration showing that there is indeed a halo around the face on the Shroud. Pete Schumacher has written ” I am convinced that this evidence is conclusive and can be readily duplicated by anyone reasonably capable in the disciplines applied while using a variety of easily accessible tools and even some readily accessible images.” So as I consider myself “reasonably capable” in this field (at least I know a little bit in this topic) and have some “easily accessible tools” and images, I tried to verify Pete’s very bold (and significant,had it been true) conclusion. Unfortunately, I have found no basis for it and should I had there been some. Look at those images. Can you see circular shading (“halo”) around the face? Can you see significant differences with other non image areas on the cloth? Then draw your conclusions yourself. The fact that someone is allegedly an imaging expert, while he does not present compelling arguments for his conclusions, does mean nothing to me. And one another thing.

The Chartularium itself was lost during WWII, but there was a 18th century transcript of some documents (including the letter to Innocent III), testified in 1859 by Benedetto d’Acquisto, arcibishop of Montreal, and former abbot at Monte Casino, considered distinguished humanist.

Assad is a doctor who studied in England while his wife studied in an Anglican school there. Yeah, yeah. And what does it mean little in fact, except that Assad is much smarter than many other dictators. But that’s clearly misleading. The Assad famiglia is classical model of mafia, ruling Syria for over 40 years. And Bashar is the current Godfather in elegant suit, even despite in fact his hands are up to elbows covered with blood. It always seems to be a choice between two evils. After Saddam was overthrown, the aftermath in Iraq was worse than the disease. Getting rid of him was no solution, but has brought mayhem and destruction to Iraq. The same situation is likely to occur in Iran. Get rid of Assad will almost certainly result in radical Islamism taking control of whatever revolution follows, and Christian people and places of worship will certainly be targeted. Assad realises that the western powers will be aware of this, and it serves him as a counter trump to continue his own atrocities. That’s exactly what regimes like Assad’s or Iranian Ayatollahs want us, Westerners, to think. You need us in power, because the alternative is Al Qaeda. So why blame Assad? He tried to get the opposition to talk, but they wouldn’t listen. Once again, don’t be naive Louis. The talks between opposition and Assad? The only language they know is crushing rebellion with tanks. They are gangsta, you know. Why? Because they are backed by al Nusra, A/Q and hundreds of fundamentalist, fanatical Chechen, Saudi Arabian, Iraqi mercenaries, financed by Saudi Arabian petrodollars. Yeah, yeah, by everyone except Assad. And that makes him suspect. Looking at the course of the Iraq War from 2003 it was obvious that the greatest stream of men, money and material was going from Syria via the Anbar province. But for political reasons there was silence of this in the most media. It was far easier to blame the Bush administration (they committed several errors I admit, but world wide anti Bush hysteria at that time was something quite unprecedented in history). Have you seen what Prince Charles and Prime Minister David Cameron said about protecting Christians recently? Are they badly informed? Have you seen the plight of Christians in Pakistan? Where was B/L found? The military there didn’t know anything about it? Why is Pakistan getting even more closer to Saudi Arabia? No, Louis, I haven’t. And that’s the problem, that West has fallen into powerlessness and decadence. This is the same reason why Putin is doing in the Ukraine whatever he wants he knows that West is degenerated and cowardly. The LGBT privileges are often far more important than fundamentals of the Western civilization. The terrorism in Iraq could have been easily suppressed (by brutal force it was the only way), had not foolish pressure on “political solution”, “national reconciliation” and similar nonsense babble. Which resulted in mulitple amnesties once captured the Saddamists terrorists were being released from captivity, as a “good will” gesture (or rather incredible stupidity) which resulted in more and more innocent victims. Here you have example: 02 Dec 2010 Source: reuters // Reuters * Iraq says 39 al Qaeda suspects arrested * Third highest leader in Iraq among those captured * Raids produce identities, photos of top two Qaeda leaders By Muhanad Mohammed BAGHDAD, Dec 2 (Reuters) – Iraq said on Thursday its security forces had arrested 39 al Qaeda militants, including the group’s leadership in Anbar province and one of its top officers in Iraq, in raids over the last five weeks. The group carried out car bombings and attacks against police in Anbar, a former al Qaeda stronghold; recruited and equipped suicide bombers from abroad and plotted attacks on government ministries, Interior Minister Jawad al Bolani told a news conference. The raids also gave security forces the real names, and photographs, of al Qaeda’s two top leaders in Iraq, officials said. “The repeated and painful blows to al Qaeda, by the killing and arrests of its leadership, will lead to the demise of al Qaeda in Iraq,” Bolani said at a news conference in Baghdad. Bolani identified one of the captured men, Hazim al Zawi, as al Qaeda’s third highest leader in Iraq and the “security minister” of its local affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq. Thirty eight of the men, wearing orange prison uniforms, were led into the news conference. Zawi was brought into the room wearing a black hood, which was pulled off to allow photographers and TV cameramen to take pictures of his face. Iraqi and U.S. Forces struck a major blow against the Islamist militant group in April when al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Ayyub al Masri, and Abu Omar al Baghdadi, the head of ISI, were killed in a raid. Military officials said the deaths were a serious setback to a stubborn insurgency that still unleashes attacks daily, more than seven years after the U.S. led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein. Among those arrested, officials said, was Ibrahim al Zobai, al Qaeda’s “deputy war minister,” who had been in charge of bringing Arab suicide bombers into Iraq since 2004. Security forces also captured Ahmed al Essawi, a religious adviser in ISI, Ali al Fahdawi, an ISI administrator and Abdul Razaq Albu Essa, the group’s head of media, authorities said. General Dhiya Hussein, the head of the Interior Ministry’s counter terrorism department, said the raids enabled security forces to obtain pictures and learn the real names of al Qaeda’s two top leaders, the men who replaced Masri and Baghdadi. “The successful arrest operation connected us to the head of the terrorist organization, Ibrahim Awad al Samarrai, who was known as Abu Baker al Baghdadi, and his war minister, Nuaman Salman, who was known as Abu Suleiman before,” Hussein said. Many of those arrested were held in U.S. Custody at one time but were released as a result of political deals and had gone back to the insurgency, Bolani said. “We call on the politicians not to repeat the past mistakes. Don’t let the criminals escape from punishment,” he said. Last week Iraqi officials announced the arrests of 12 suspected al Qaeda militants in connection with an Oct. 31 attack on a Baghdad Christian church in which 52 hostages and police were killed.

Is that because you are Catholic in Eastern Europe and aiming at Putin, a Russian Orthodox Christian? I am in direct and almost constant contact, sometimes personal, with Syrian (Arabic speaking) Christians, both clergy and laity. I have to because of my research into early Christianity. It began years ago when I was invited for coffee and an opportunity to meet and talk to the Iraqi prelate Mor Severios Jamil Hava, bishop of Baghdad, which was preceded by the usual two hour mass celebrated in Aramaic. I have come to learn what really is going on in Syria through them in the process, although politics does not interest me that much, but we live in this … world. Would you call Mor Cyril Aphrem Karim, recently elected the supreme head of the Syrian Orthodox Church a liar? Watch the video, then tell me: No, Louis. It is not because that I am Catholic and Putin is allegedly Orthodox (but in my opinion the only thing he believes in is his own power). The thing that concerns me here is not Putin, but praising Bashar al Assad the Corleone of the Middle East. BTW Putin is the same mafioso like Assad just look what’s going on Ukraine and the latter is kissing Putin’s &%$, because he knows the Russians saved his own. And the two bandits like each other due to similar character, but anyway. It is absolutely no mystery to me that Assad stays behind the so called “Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant” (consisting mainly from ex Saddam security officers ruthless sexual deviants for which killing people gives pleasure and brain washed teenagers, cannon fodder from all the islamic world, dreaming about easy acces to 70 virgins). Just from observing the course of the Iraq War. Just look at this action: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008 Abu Kamal raid The whole terror campaing in Iraq had only one purpose, let the US be absorbed in that country, let they suffer casualties! Let the public opinion in the West turns against the further interventions!The Middle East regimes like Iran & Syria were aware, that after overthrowing Saddam, they are next in the line. That’s why over 100 000 innocent Iraqis died. And when popular unrest against Assad regime started in Syria, what was the obvious move? To call their Iraqi friends and start similar wave of violence in Syria. And, of course, to portray themselves as the victims of Al Qaeda brutality, instead of being their main sponsors. The classic false flag operation, aimed at preventing the US intervention. It is incredible how Western democracies can be so blind, and so easily deceived! Putin is currently doing the same on the Ukraine. Bashar al Assad is responsible for 250 000+ innocent deaths in both Syria and Iraq. IMHO his place is together with Hussein, bin Laden and Gaddafi.

I was discussing only objects which existence were testified by witnesses whosaw them with their own eyes, excluding various legends about St. Luke, or Pilate’s wife possesing some burial cloths. What I recommend to read, is Remi van Haelst article in footnote 4. It gave a lot of info to me. There is a very interesting problem of Charlemagne’s relics we know that around the year 800 he obtained, either from Jerusalem or Constantinople, two burial cloths, or possibly representative copies of them, the large Sudarium Domini, currently stored in Kornelimünster, and the so called Sindon Munda, divided between Kornelimünster and Compiègne. If we combine the two halves of the latter, we obtain a cloth about 4 metres long, 1 wide, very similar to the Shroud of Turin.

So, if this would be true, we could still make the hypothesis of a natural forgery, meaning that someone could have taken the real dead body of a crucified man looking like Jesus of the Gospel in order to produce a false relic of Christ. Even if such a scenario is very improbable (personally, I estimate the probability as being under 1%), it is still POSSIBLE and no one have the right to completely reject this hypothesis for the moment. The door must be left open for it, even though it is only a very slim opening! Yannick, Barberis estimated that one of 200 000 000 000 (200 bilion) crucified could have just 7 characteristics similar to that of Jesus. And even if 200 000 000 (200 milions) people were crucified in antiquity, the chance that somebody by coincidence would have the same 7 charactersitics is less than 1:1000.

The forger must have been a madman to create a false relic with not only image, but above all the bloodstains on the cloth. There is simply no tradition, beyond the Shroud, of Christ’s full body having left an image – of whatever origin – on a cloth. “Ad monumentum Petrus cum Iohanne cucurrit recientaque in linteaminibus defuncti et resurgentis vestigia cernit.” “Peter ran to the tomb with John and saw the recent imprint of he who was dead and risen on the cloths” – the Old Mozarabic Liturgy, see http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n71part14.pdf Hugh: It was a question of ‘my shroud has to be better than your shroud,’ and there were plenty of unmarked shrouds already in existence by the 13th century.

Destroyed 1794 during the French Revolution *Sindon Munda from Kornelimünster and The Shroud from Compiègne (the latter destroyed between 1789 and 1840) –probably two halves of the same piece of cloth. No image of the bloodstains, and no reports about the image of a man. Possibly Arculfus Shroud, its copy or lining, or a copy or lining of the Shroud of Turin * Sudarium Domini from Kornelimünster. No traces of blood or image. Theoretically it could be Arculfus Shroud. Possibly external shroud, or used to transfer the body from the cross. *The Shroud of Cadouin. Most probably fake, perhaps “found” during the 1st Crusade in Antioch to boost the morale of the crusaders. * A linen shroud from Constantinople (distinct from the Shroud of Turin). Some pieces sent to Louis IX. Another candidate for Arculfus Shroud. *Arculfus Shroud. The greatest unknown it could have been any shroud mentioned above. *Sudarium of Oviedo. Bloodstains. * The Coif of Cahors. Wrapped around the head, binding the jaw. Bloodstains, no information about image. *The cotton sudarium from Constantinople, some fragments in Halberstadt. * Sudarium Capitis from Carcassonne. No traces of blood and image.

Given that almost every relic known to history has been chopped into innumerable fragments for dissemination among the faithful, including the crown of thorns, the nails, the cross and even the sepulchre, is it not surprising that the Shroud is so intact? The table of the last supper, everything the Holy Family ever wore – it’s all in shreds around the world. Only the Shroud remains substantially as it ever was, if it ever was, with only those two corners and a few stray threads missing. Because it has the image on it. That’s why it cannot be fragmented so easily. Vincenzo: Complete and total fraud, the true cross was destroyed by Saladin during the Crusades It is only partiallly true. The True cross was already fragmented in Sain Helena times. The Saladin’s booty was only small fragment of it. The total volume of True Cross is estimated to be between 36 000 cm^3, up to 178 000 cm^3, while the total amount of the alleged relics of True Cross is less than 4 000 cm^3.

The cross was slotted into a hole a stone ring (11.5 cm in diameter) serving for that purpose was found in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1986, see Witnesses of Mystery pg. 310 313. It is estimated the cross was no higher than say, 250 cm. The Good Theft Patibulum, currently in Rome’s Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (see Thiede&Ancona The Quest for The True Cross and Pierluigi Baima Bollone Sindone, 101 domande e risposte) is 178 (but originally it was probably longer, say 200 cm) x13 x 13cm. This gives us estimated cross volume of 59767 cm^3. Giving estimated wood density of 0.5 g/cm^3 this would give us about 30 kg. Contrary to widespread myth, it was entirely possible for a man to carry the whole cross. A small correction, if we assume density of 0.75 g/cm^3 this would give us about 45 kg As to the spiecies, the reports are hardly reliable. I have seen claims of oak, olive, pine, and cypress.

Right, I meant 1998 paper. I looked briefly on 2008 paper once, but had no time to study it in depth, I will do it so. Daveb of wellington nz : If Edessa was evangelised in apostolic times, why would it accept subjugation to the Antioch church? Perhaps because Antioch was much greater ciy than Edessa. And don’t forget about time of the first evangelization 30 AD, and subsequent pagan reaction. About 30 33 AD, Christianity was in embryonic form. About 57 AD the pagan rection in Edessa came. The Church structure much developed between 30 33 and 57 AD. The definite split with judaism came only after 70 AD, and destruction of the Temple. Before about 100 AD, the terms bishop and presbyter meant essencially he same. So it is nothing strange that Edessa was evangelised twice, first in the times of Abgar V, who just invited Jesus to his kingdom, and probably was not even aware that the new worlwide religion had already begun there, and for the second time during reign of Abgar VIII, when Church structure was much more developed, and Abgar VIII, influenced by his predecessor decided to adopt Christianity. Daveb of wellington nz The evangelisation of Edessa in apostolic times can only be speculative, more so than the Edessa image was the Shroud! There is no evidence that Edessa was evangelised much before 200 AD, only the Abgar tale, which postdates 200 AD! Eusebius was instructed by Pamphilus who was martyred in 310 AD, that’s way after 200 AD! The first indication of a church in Edessa, was a reference to a flood in 201 AD, in a Syriac chronicle, earliest extent edition of the 6th century. There is no evidnece, but on the other hand there are no serious reasons to doubt the event took place. Remember, the first real comprehenisve history of the Church is that of Eusebius written in the early 4th century. The Acts of the Apostles written by Luke, although very reliable source of information, are actually not history of the Church (and Luke never mentioned that he intended to write such one!), but history of the Paul! The accounts about Peter and early church of Jerusalem are most probably based on the accounts of Peter told Paul, see Galatians, Chapters 1 and 2. And Eusebius does not mention the second evangelization of Edessa around 200 AD. Outside telling the Abgar Story in Book 1, he does not mention Edessa at all! About lack of indications of evangelisation of Edessa during Abgar V in Syriac chronicle (you mean this http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronicle of edessa.htm ), remember this chronicle is very brief, and probably largely incomplete. Remeber that is very likely that Abgar’s V successors tried to destroy testimonies of his conversion. Ancient history is very different from modern history remeber.

Neither Markwardt nor any other scholar has any proof that the story of Abgar V and his conversion was fabricated during the reign of Abgar VIII. Such allegations are based on nothing but on prejudices, and belief that early Christainity was nothing more than a local Jewish sect. The sources always atribute the first evangelization to Abgar V, although details of the event are often mixed with legendary material, or as in a case of Doctrine ofd Addai confused with conversion of Abgar VIII. The Doctrine of Addai in fact is quite strange mix of sermons and old legends, including Abgar legend as well as finding of the True Cross 300 later. Separating facts from fiction is difficult, but there are some grains of the truth in the story, like in any other legend. Dave, don’t slavishly adhere to what scholars say. They don’t know the facts, so do I, they only voice their opinions. But my interpretation that conversion of Abgar V really took place is just as justified, as their opinion that it is later invention or even more, because all the sources atribute that the first ruler of Edessa to adopt Christianity, was Abgar V.

Adiabene and Osroene (the capital of latter was Osroene) were two neighbouring kingdoms in Assyria on the Silk Road. In the 1st century trade with the East flourished, and was largely maintained by Jews, who also sometimes served as diplomatic couriers. One of them was Ananias (known also as Hannan in different version of Abgar legend). Ananias was messenger between King Abgar and Jesus. He became one of the first christians in Edessa, however at that time there was no such term as “christian”. Christianity was only a branch of Judaism. But Abgar was a gentile, and nevertheless Jesus sent a missionary to his kingdom! This was breakthrough, suggesting that uncircumcised gentiles can also worship God. This was absolute heresy for the Jews! Later, as reported in Acts, one Jewish merchant, known as Ananias baptised a fanatical pharisee Saul, student of Gamaliel, who couldn’t even imagine such violation of Jewish law. Saul became Paul, and became most vocal opponent of necessity of circumsition of the gentiles, we all know this from his letters. This eventually led to the Council of Jerusalem in 50 AD, which declared that the gentiles didn’t have to be circumcised. Who taught Paul this view? Who was his first master of Christianity? A certain disciple known as Ananias And a few years later, a certain Jewish merchant known as Ananias came to the kingdom of Adiabene, right next to Osroene, and converted its king to the “Jewish faith” (remember Christianity was considered a jewish sect at that time). And he said that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did resolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship of God was of a superior nature to circumcision, as related by Josephus. Unfortunately, another Jew from Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, came, and convinced Izates that circumsition was absolutely necessary for a Jew (compare with Paul’s complaints in Galatians). Thus Izates became a Jew, instead of Christian.

Either the cloth was the Shroud or it was some other cloth with an image. We would then have a plethora of cloths with images of Jesus, despite the Jewish aversion to images. The tale is set during Jesus’ own mortal life time, so it could not be the Shroud and Abgar V was a contemporary of Jesus. You will therefore have to believe in some multiplicity of cloths with images of Jesus. I should be reluctant to do so. Dave, have you forgotten Manoppello Image? An image of the face, that looks like a painting… but is not a painting. Compare with the account in Doctrine of Addai I said that the Mandylion never existed as only one, single object. It was an idea. Daveb of wellington nz : I take it that you have now read Markwardt’s 2008 paper. In that case we will have to agree to differ on the merits of Markwardt’s 2008 paper. I note that there is no record in the gospels of Jesus multiplying images of himself for general wholesale distribution. It is also unlikely that the Shroud would have been sent to Edessa, a then pagan city, so soon after the crucifixion, as there are several references to it being kept elsewhere, including being kept by Peter, or being given to Pilate’s wife, and also being kept in Syria. I read it, although briefly. An as I said, I consider that it was more likely, that Manoppello was the original Mandylion. The Shroud of Turin arrived in Edessa later, perhaps from Antioch or elsewhere. Markwardt may be right at this point. We talk about two different things here the conversion of Abgar V to early Christianity, and arrival of the Shroud to Edessa. Besides there were more than one linen. According to the latin verison of Life of Adam and Eve, Adam was buried with three shrouds, so it is entirely possible that more linens were used: See http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/pseudepigrapha/adamnev.htm XLVI 4: And the Lord said again to the angels Michael and Uriel: ‘Bring me three linen clothes of byssus and spread them out over Adam and other linen clothes over Abel his son and bury Adam and Abel his son.’ See also: Remi Van Haelst, THE SINDON MUNDA OF KORNELIMUNSTER, COMPIEGNE AND CAHORS http://resurrectionnowinc.blogspot.com/2011/01/shroud images throughout world.html daveb of wellington nz : I therefore find it more credible that the Shroud was hidden in Antioch, and with the impending destruction of the city by earthquake and by Chosros, that it may then have been taken to Edessa in the time of Abgar VIII, leading to creation of the legend. Alternatively, it may have arrived in Constantinople by some other different route entirely. As I said, it is possible. But remember, there were more cloths. The Abgar story may be entirely true, but not necessarily the Shroud must be the original Mandylion. Daveb of wellington nz : Finally if Edessa was evangelised in apostolic times it would have claimed for itself a status of being one of the primary patriarchates, which it did not, nor never did, despite it subsequently being a major centre of Christian scholarship.

Just like Markwardt does. But if you look closer at this novel… What I would like to show you it’s only a theory. Not proven facts! But IMHO such theory is quite likely, even if I can’t prove it. See Josephus’ Jewish Antiquites , Book XX, Chapters 3 4: Now, during the time Izates abode at Charax Spasini, a certain Jewish merchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women that belonged to the king, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish religion. He, moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and persuaded him, in like manner, to embrace that religion; he also, at the earnest entreaty of Izates, accompanied him when he was sent for by his father to come to Adiabene; it also happened that Helena, about the same time, was instructed by a certain other Jew and went over to them. But when Izates had taken the kingdom, and was come to Adiabene, and there saw his brethren and other kinsmen in bonds, he was displeased at it; and as he thought it an instance of impiety either to slay or imprison them, but still thought it a hazardous thing for to let them have their liberty, with the remembrance of the injuries that had been offered them, he sent some of them and their children for hostages to Rome, to Claudius Caesar, and sent the others to Artabanus, the king of Parthia, with the like intentions. 4. And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the Jewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely; and as he supposed that he could not he thoroughly a Jew unless he were circumcised, he was ready to have it done. But when his mother understood what he was about, she endeavored to hinder him from doing it, and said to him that this thing would bring him into danger; and that, as he was a king, he would thereby bring himself into great odium among his subjects, when they should understand that he was so fond of rites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never bear to be ruled over by a Jew. This it was that she said to him, and for the present persuaded him to forbear. And when he had related what she had said to Ananias, he confirmed what his mother had said; and when he had also threatened to leave him, unless he complied with him, he went away from him, and said that he was afraid lest such an action being once become public to all, he should himself be in danger of punishment for having been the occasion of it, and having been the king’s instructor in actions that were of ill reputation; and he said that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did resolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship of God was of a superior nature to circumcision. He added, that God would forgive him, though he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted out of necessity, and for fear of his subjects. So the king at that time complied with these persuasions of Ananias. But afterwards, as he had not quite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, and who was esteemed very skillful in the learning of his country, persuaded him to do the thing; for as he entered into his palace to salute him, and found him reading the law of Moses, he said to him, “Thou dost not consider, O king! that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws, and art injurious to God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised]; for thou oughtest not only to read them, but chiefly to practice what they enjoin thee. How long wilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not yet read the law about circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety thou art guilty of by neglecting it, read it now.” When the king had heard what he said, he delayed the thing no longer, but retired to another room, and sent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to do. He then sent for his mother, and Ananias his tutor, and informed them that he had done the thing; upon which they were presently struck with astonishment and fear, and that to a great degree, lest the thing should be openly discovered and censured, and the king should hazard the loss of his kingdom, while his subjects would not bear to be governed by a man who was so zealous in another religion; and lest they should themselves run some hazard, because they would be supposed the occasion of his so doing. But it was God himself who hindered what they feared from taking effect; for he preserved both Izates himself and his sons when they fell into many dangers, and procured their deliverance when it seemed to be impossible, and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of piety does not perish as to those that have regard to him, and fix their faith upon him only. See Acts of the Apostles 9:10 19: In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered. 11 The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. 12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.” 13 “Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. 14 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.” 15 But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel. 16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.” 17 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, 19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength. See Eusebius: 1. The divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ being noised abroad among all men on account of his wonder working power, he attracted countless numbers from foreign countries lying far away from Judea, who had the hope of being cured of their diseases and of all kinds of sufferings. 2. For instance the King Abgarus, who ruled with great glory the nations beyond the Euphrates, being afflicted with a terrible disease which it was beyond the power of human skill to cure, when he heard of the name of Jesus, and of his miracles, which were attested by all with one accord sent a message to him by a courier and begged him to heal his disease. 3. But he did not at that time comply with his request; yet he deemed him worthy of a personal letter in which he said that he would send one of his disciples to cure his disease, and at the same time promised salvation to himself and all his house. 4. Not long afterward his promise was fulfilled. For after his resurrection from the dead and his ascent into heaven, Thomas, one of the twelve apostles, under divine impulse sent Thaddeus, who was also numbered among the seventy disciples of Christ, to Edessa, as a preacher and evangelist of the teaching of Christ. 5. And all that our Saviour had promised received through him its fulfillment. You have written evidence of these things taken from the archives of Edessa, which was at that time a royal city. For in the public registers there, which contain accounts of ancient times and the acts of Abgarus, these things have been found preserved down to the present time. But there is no better way than to hear the epistles themselves which we have taken from the archives and have literally translated from the Syriac language219 in the following manner. Copy of an epistle written by Abgarus the ruler to Jesus, and sent to him at Jerusalem by Ananias 6. “Abgarus, ruler of Edessa, to Jesus the excellent Saviour who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem, greeting. I have heard the reports of thee and of thy cures as performed by thee without medicines or herbs. For it is said that thou makest the blind to see and the lame to walk, that thou cleansest lepers and castest out impure spirits and demons, and that thou healest those afflicted with lingering disease, and raisest the dead. 7. And having heard all these things concerning thee, I have concluded that one of two things must be true: either thou art God, and having come down from heaven thou doest these things, or else thou, who doest these things, art the Son of God. 8. I have therefore written to thee to ask thee that thou wouldest take the trouble to come to me and heal the disease which I have. For I have heard that the Jews are murmuring against thee and are plotting to injure thee. But I have a very small yet noble city which is great enough for us both.” 101 The answer of Jesus to the ruler Abgarus by the courier Ananias. 9. “Blessed art thou who hast believed in me without having seen me. For it is written concerning me, that they who have seen me will not believe in me, and that they who have not seen me will believe and be saved. But in regard to what thou hast written me, that I should come to thee, it is necessary for me to fulfill all things here for which I have been sent, and after I have fulfilled them thus to be taken up again to him that sent me. But after I have been taken up I will send to thee one of my disciples, that he may heal thy disease and give life to thee and thine.” 10. To these epistles there was added the following account in the Syriac language. “After the ascension of Jesus, Judas, who was also called Thomas, sent to him Thaddeus, an apostle,one of the Seventy. When he was come he lodged with Tobias, the son of Tobias. When the report of him got abroad, it was told Abgarus that an apostle of Jesus was come, as he had written him. 11. Thaddeus began then in the power of God to heal every disease and infirmity, insomuch that all wondered. And when Abgarus heard of the great and wonderful things which he did and of the cures which he performed, he began to suspect that he was the one of whom Jesus had written him, saying, ‘After I have been taken up I will send to thee one of my disciples who will heal thee.’ 12. Therefore, summoning Tobias, with whom Thaddeus lodged, he said, I have heard that a certain man of power has come and is lodging in thy house. Bring him to me. And Tobias coming to Thaddeus said to him, The ruler Abgarus summoned me and told me to bring thee to him that thou mightest heal him. And Thaddeus said, I will go, for I have been sent to him with power. 13. Tobias therefore arose early on the following day, and taking Thaddeus came to Abgarus. And when he came, the nobles were present and stood about Abgarus. And immediately upon his entrance a great vision appeared to Abgarus in the countenance of the apostle Thaddeus. When Abgarus saw it he prostrated himself before Thaddeus, while all those who stood about were astonished; for they did not see the vision, which appeared to Abgarus alone. 14. He then asked Thaddeus if he were in truth a disciple of Jesus the Son of God, who had said to him, ‘I will send thee one of my disciples, who shall heal thee and give thee life.’ And Thaddeus said, Because thou hast mightily believed in him that sent me, therefore have I been sent unto thee. And still further, if thou believest in him, the petitions of thy heart shall be granted thee as thou believest. 15. And Abgarus said to him, So much have I believed in him that I wished to take an army and destroy those Jews who crucified him, had I not been deterred from it by reason of the dominion of the Romans. And Thaddeus said, Our Lord has fulfilled the will of his Father, and having fulfilled it has been taken up to his Father. And Abgarus said to him, I too have believed in him and in his Father. 16. And Thaddeus said to him, Therefore I place my hand upon thee in his name. And when he had done it, immediately Abgarus was cured of the disease and of the suffering which he had. 17. And Abgarus marvelled, that as he had heard concerning Jesus, so he had received in very deed through his disciple Thaddeus, who healed him without medicines and herbs, and not only him, but also Abdus227 the son of Abdus, who was afflicted with the gout; for he too came to him and fell at his feet, and having received a benediction by the imposition of his hands, he was healed. The same Thaddeus cured also many other inhabitants of the city, and did wonders and marvelous works, and preached 102the word of God. 18. And afterward Abgarus said, Thou, O Thaddeus, doest these things with the power of God, and we marvel. But, in addition to these things, I pray thee to inform me in regard to the coming of Jesus, how he was born; and in regard to his power, by what power he performed those deeds of which I have heard. 19. And Thaddeus said, Now indeed will I keep silence, since I have been sent to proclaim the word publicly. But tomorrow assemble for me all thy citizens, and I will preach in their presence and sow among them the word of God, concerning the coming of Jesus, how he was born; and concerning his mission, for what purpose he was sent by the Father; and concerning the power of his works, and the mysteries which he proclaimed in the world, and by what power he did these things; and concerning his new preaching, and his abasement and humiliation, and how he humbled himself, and died and debased his divinity and was crucified, and descended into Hades, and burst the bars which from eternity had not been broken, and raised the dead; for he descended alone, but rose with many, and thus ascended to his Father. 20. Abgarus therefore commanded the citizens to assemble early in the morning to hear the preaching of Thaddeus, and afterward he ordered gold and silver to be given him. But he refused to take it, saying, If we have forsaken that which was our own, how shall we take that which is another’s? These things were done in the three hundred and fortieth year.” I have inserted them here in their proper place, translated from the Syriac232 literally, and I hope to good purpose..","date":"2013-10-27","mins":"5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-48906","author":"o_k","post":"Daveb of wellington nz : However, in all cities that Paul ever visited, he always preached to the Jews in their local synagogues first. It seems that there had to be a Jewish presence in the city beforehand. Was there one such in Edessa? I’m not sure whether that is known or not, the local gods were Bel & Nebo. Yes, according to the Doctrine of Addai there was sizeable Jewish community in Edessa, which is nothing unusal. Here you have the text: http://www.apostle1.com/doctrine addai syriac orthodox1.htm But remeber, the mission in Edessa was a very special case. It was performed on personal invitation from King Abgar to Jesus himself! And is quite likely that Jesus requested disciples to send King Abgar the cloth that later would have been known as the Image of Edessa, whether it was the Shroud, or perhaps rather Manopello. Daveb of wellington nz Acts states that it was Ananias who baptized Paul, but under protest. Was it the same Ananias who instructed Izotes? We don’t know, but there was a very limited number of names in those days, and it may have been a different Ananias. As I said, I cannot prove that three Ananias were actually one and the same person. But their characteristics are very similar, so it is quite likely, and cannot be dismissed so easily, as the so called “scholars” say, because it runs contrary to their usual paradigms. Daveb of wellington nz There is no reference to baptism in the Izotes story; Izotes is to be accepted into the Jewish faith, and there is no mention of Jesus, even obliquely. Yes, but remember that Izates ultimately became a Jew, not Christian (or at least not Pauline Christian), and the account of Josephus comes from the second hand, and I bet it is selective. The only Jewish sect we know that abandoned circumsition was Christianity. That was so shocking for a Jew, more even than belief in Jesus, so that the story concntrated on this topic. This was the most crispy detail in that story. Daveb of wellington nz Now suppose that the Abgar legend was set down in the time of Abgar VIII. There are two 1st century local stories circulating about a messenger named Ananias, one about baptizing Paul, the other about converting a nearby king into the Jewish faith. Therefore in writing up a story about the conversion of Abgar V, the messenger will also be called Ananias, because that’s the sort of thing Ananias did and he’s a prime 1st century candidate for the role! So really I think we end up no wiser about the true situation at all. That’s what most scholars believe, but this version is not a bit better than mine. Actually, it runs contrary to the sources which all claim that it was Abgar V, not VIII who first introduced Christianity to Edessa. Assuming otherwise, would be assuming that the whole story of Abgar, Ananias, Thadeus Addai, Thomas Apostle, and so on was fabricated on purpose, but we have no evidence for such conspiracy. But of course most critical scholars of early Christianity have quite paranoid vision of it, so early Christans are considered fakers, fraudsters, who did nothing, but invented some pious fairy tales, fabricated evidence, forged their relics, faked their writings and so on. Christian = Liar in their minds. Daveb of wellington nz I think the point of all our discussion on this, concerns the timing of the arrival of a cloth with an image of Jesus on it, which became known as the Image of Edessa. We don’t know if that was the Shroud as Ian Wilson claims, or whether it was something else. See account about Edessa Image in Doctrine of Addai: When Hannan, the keeper of the archives, saw that Jesus spake thus to him, by virtue of being the king’s painter, he took and painted a likeness of Jesus with choice paints, and brought with him to Abgar the king, his master. And when Abgar the king saw the likeness, he received it with great joy, and placed it with great honour in one of his palatial houses. This description matches the Manoppello much better than the Shroud! daveb of wellington nz It is possible that Abgar V may have been baptised; if he was, Christianity in Edessa was nonetheless short lived. The story about Addai arriving in Abgar V’s court with such an image, does seem to be a subsequent attempt to explain the arrival of the image, with the purpose of enhancing the status of Edessa. Pope Gelasius in the 5th century considered it spurious, and a fiction. I think it more likely that such icons would have been secretly and carefully guarded by trusted members of the early Church, and that any taken to Edessa, would only be because their safety was now threatened and Edessa had in that time become the safest place to keep them. As I said, if Jesus had personally requested such transfer of the one of miraculous images of Himself (Manoppello or the Shroud), that explains everything. It is often raised that in the first versions of Abgar’s tale there are no mentions about the image. One however must remember that the image was lost at that time, and theological objections against the veneration of images. But see account of Eusebius, who was against images: Tobias therefore arose early on the following day, and taking Thaddeus came to Abgarus. And when he came, the nobles were present and stood about Abgarus. And immediately upon his entrance a great vision appeared to Abgarus in the countenance of the apostle Thaddeus. When Abgarus saw it he prostrated himself before Thaddeus, while all those who stood about were astonished; for they did not see the vision, which appeared to Abgarus alone. “A great vision” is most likely an allusion to the Image of Edessa, slightly censored by iconoclast Eusebius..","date":"2013-10-27","mins":"1:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-48929","author":"o_k","post":"Daveb of wellington nz : I feel inevitably drawn to the conclusion, that any such special images of Jesus, whether Shroud or Manopello, or anything such, would have been secretly kept by trusted members of the early Christian community, and not distributed elsewhere, regardless of whether the prospective recipient was a king or not. Actually most of the relics of the Christ (True Cross, Nails, Crown of Thorns, garments, Sudarium of Oviedo, Holy Spear and many more) were kept in Jerusalem or vicinity (we can trace their provenance back to there), and only in later centuries distributed elsewhere. But the Image of Edessa, whether it was Shroud or Turin, or Manoppello it could be sent to Abgar, if Jesus Himself instructed the Disciples to do so. God knows why, for what purpose, he keeps a safe hand over it. So I have no problem with accepting the core of the story at face value, despite many different variants of it. Besides Edessa had very close ties with Thomas Apostle, his relics were brought back there around 200 AD from India, until redistributed later.

I think it was Eusebius who denounced the Abgar legend as a forgery. No Dave, Eusebius is actually the first one who mentions the story of Abgar. See his The Church History, Book 1, Chapters 12 13: http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250101.htm daveb of wellington nz : Jack Markwardt argues that the Abgar referred to in the legend is in fact Abgar VIII (the Great) but for political reasons, it was written as a legend referring to the earlier Abgar to avoid the attention of the Roman emperor and the prospect of persecution. It seems likely that Christianity was established in Edessa no later than 200 AD, but not much earlier. There is nothing that makes a story of christianization of Edessa about 30 AD impossible. Remember, the temr Christians was first created in Antioch around 40 AD, see Acts 11:26. The Council of Jerusalem took place around 50 AD. So even if Abgar V had converted into what would have been later called Christianity (and what was nothing but a branch of Judaism at this time), there probably would be no evidence of this. The matter is very complicated, but claims that the story of Abgar couldn’t happen are based actually on nothing else, but prejudices of most scholars. The dubious authenticity of purproted letters is however another thing, even if some were exchanged, their content was later probably at least interpolated..","date":"2013-10-25","mins":"4:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-48699","author":"o_k","post":"BTW: Dave, have you ever heard about conversion of rulers of Adiabene (a country in Assyria next to Osroene ruled by Abgars) to judaism circa 40 AD?

Segal also claims it as spurious. They were Jerome (Comm. In Ezech. Ad 44, 29 30) and Augustine (Contra Faustum manich. 28,4; De consensu Evang. 1, 7, 11) who considered it spurious, on the basis that had there existed some writings of the Lord it would have been kept in the highest esteem by the Early Church. But it is flawed assertion, as not everything that Jesus or Apostles may have written must be considered biblical canon, for example tax returns and other every day documents. Later Decretum Gelasianum condemmed alleged correspondence between Abgar and Jesus as an apocrypha. Daveb of wellington nz : If you’re not already familiar with it, I suggest you check out Markwardt’s 2008 paper ref above. Markwardt makes the point that if Edessa was christianised in apostolic times, it would never have become subservient to the the Antioch church, which seems a valid point. His explanation of why the legend was made to refer to Abgar V, rather than to Abgar VIII, was a ruse to record an important religious event in Eessa’s history, while diverting political attention away from Abgar VIII becoming Christian. “Only the names were changed to protect the guilty.” Yes I am familiar, however I consider Markwardt’s theory based on nothing but pure speculations. But I am inclined to the theory that the Shroud arrived at Edessa later, possibly around 200 AD during the reing of Abgar VIII. As to Abgars V & VIII I have several volumes of biblical apocrypha, and I know how the legend evolved. It was always claimed that the first Christian ruler of edessa was Abgar V. So there was probably some historical core of the story. But the first Mandylion was more likely to be today’s Manoppello Image (later known as Image of Camuliana, described in Dan’s next post, and later as Veronica Veil), the Shroud become a Mandylion on a later stage. I think the Mandylion never existed as a single object it is more general term atributed to various images, painted and miraculous. So the theories that the Shroud was Mandylion, the Manopello was Mandylion, as well as Image of Genua, or that the Mandylion was sold to Louis IX, do not contradict each other actually. Daveb of wellington nz : It is also unlikely that a Christian missionary would seek to evangelize a king unless invited to do so. But according to the legend, he was invited to do so! It was nothing impossible that a pagan king heard from Jewish merchants about a miraculous healer, in the distant land of Palestine, and wanted to invite him to his kingdom. Moreover, it was very likely, especially in desperate Abgar’s situation. The critics are always narrow minded and can’t imagine such simple situation. Daveb of wellington nz : It seems that sons of Abgar V were pagan in any case, and any latent christianity in Edessa would soon be suppressed. I don’t think the charge of scholarly prejudice holds in this case. I find Markwardt’s case persuasive, exceedingly well referenced, and I suggest you check it out. As I said Markward’s paper is interesting, but has very weak fundamentals. Nevertheless, it is very likely that the ancient history of the Shroud was much more complex than any scholar has imagined. As to pagan reaction, remember suppresion of monotheism introduced during the reign of Pharaoh Echnaton, after his death. The conversion of Abgar V to Christainity could be attempted to be erased from chronicles in similar way..","date":"2013-10-25","mins":"6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-114026","author":"o_k","post":"It is curious that nearly all “Man of Sorrows” and “Lamentation” depictions show the right arm over the left, as appears on the cloth, and yet the chest wound is usually correctly shown on the right side, as on the negative. We know from the negative reversal that actually the left arm is over the right. John’s gospel does not mention what side the chest wound was inflicted, and the cloth itself would convey the impression that it was on the left. I wonder why the artists showed the correct location of the chest wound on the right, despite the reversal of the arm positions. Perhaps they were following the Easter hymn “I saw water flowing from the right side of the temple” which seems to be based on Ezekiel 47:1 describing the prophet’s vision of the heavenly temple, and applied it to Christ. Yes, you are right here. It seems odd that no artist seems to have picked up the logic that any burial shroud showing an image arising from some kind of bodily contact, would naturally mirror reverse the sides. They wouldn’t need a photographic negative to realise this, only some mental reflection (the pun is unintentional).

Centro Espanol de Sindonologia CES ) In this paper, the author talk specifically about the supposed 2 X 8 cubits evidence and conclude that we must be extremelly careful before taking such a supposition for granted because in ancient time, the cubit measurement unit was not standard everywhere and all the time. The author state: “The debate about ancient cubits is no easy matter: the length of common cubits varies between 44.5 and 45.7 cm and that of royal cubits between 50.3 and 52.4 cm; as for the “Syrian cubit”, more correctly called “Assyrian cubit”, its measure is uncertain as much, and it’s seem therefore UNWISE TO IDENTIFY IT AT ALL COST WITH A SUBMULTIPLE OF THE SHROUD’S DIMENSION.” Folks, I AGREE 100% with such a prudent conclusion. And I would add another important possibility to back up this conclusion: nobody can be certain if the actual dimensions of the Shroud were the same originally. On this subject, the simple presence of the side strip (which presence has never been fully explained beyond any doubts by textile experts) is enough to at the very least make us very cautious concerning the question of the Shroud’s original dimensions. Yes, there are some uncertainities, but regularity of Shroud dimenisons expressed in integers is striking! It suggests that the original TS dimensions hasn’t changed much through centuries. The units that were used to measure the size of the TS were either cubits circa 55 cm long, or ell measuring 110 cm, that is 2×55 cm. Or, according to Ada Grosii: Thus, the Shroud’s length would be 56 tefachim (436.8 cm) and its width 14 tefachim (13+1, that is 109.2 cm = 101.4 + 7.8 cm); on the other hand, always keeping in mind that these measurements are approximate, we could also evaluate the Shroud’s dimensions by the tefach sochek (9.33 cm), and we would obtain even more interesting numbers: 47 tefachim (438,52 cm) by 12 tefachim (11+1, i.e. 111.96 cm = 102.63 + 9.33 cm). 7 tefachim = 6 sochek =1 ammah (cubit). 7 *7.8 cm=54.6 cm =1 Assyrian cubit! 6*9.33 cm =55.98 cm. Thus the opinion of Grossi: This line of reasoning certainly suggests great caution: playing with numbers, any result can be achieved is unjustified, if we only keep some rules, only the results that Shroud dimensions allow can be obtained. One more quotation from Grossi: As far as the Hebrew cubit is concerned, it measures about 45.7 cm and corresponds to the ammah, the Biblical cubit; in addition, Jewish sources often mention the biblical and talmudic gomed, which, according to some, is actually shorter than the ammah; furthermore, in the Mishnah we can find two other cubits (M Kelim 17:9). Thus, we can say that Rabbinical knowledge basically deals with two cubits, the Mosaic cubit, 45.7 cm long, and a longer one, which varies between 56.018658 and 58.352 cm The information derived from TS dimensions, “accidently corresponding to the units of measure used in the ancient Middle East is not a final proof of its authenticity, but neither it is meaningless, as the sceptics try to convince us, and can be used as an argument for pro authenticity..","date":"2013-11-19","mins":"7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits"},{"id":"comment-52050","author":"o_k","post":"Anonymous : Is there other ancient cloths of the same dimensions as the Shroud that have been found or that have been preserved?

It may as well refer to the semi gnostic Acts of Thomas. Besides, in the whole text of the Syriac Doctrine of Apostles, there is no direct link between him and Edessa.

T3) The letter of Theodore Angelus to Innocent III (allegedly 1205), mentioning: “the most sacred of all, the linen in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before the resurrection […] in Athens.” Some (for example Nicolotti) maintain its 18th century forgery. The letter comes from Palermo, Sicily, almost 1000 miles away from Besancon. Https://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos jesus images in constantinople the documentary evidence/ (Document XV). The document was rediscovered in 1981, but is much older. It was once a part of so called Chartularium Culisanense codex from Palermo, a codex of document of Saint Sophia Order, associated with Sicilian de Angelis family. The Chartularium itself was lost during WWII, but there was a 18th century transcript of some documents (including the letter to Innocent III), testified in 1859 by Benedetto d’Acquisto, arcibishop of Montreal, and former abbot at Monte Casino, considered distinguished humanist. The document is spurious, and as a copy, it is likely interpolated. But that’s not so important, as the info it contains about sacred linen in Athens in 1205. This is consistent with Otto theory. Anyway, the mention of the linen in Athens (ruled by Otto at that time) is complementary to T1 and T2. Those are (although each spurious on its own) three seemingly independent witnesses about Otto possessing the Shroud.</B. Three testimonies are more than one and need serious consideration. Now you need to use those “unreliable” sources wisely. 1.) The MS826. You claim that the author made up fanciful stories about other historical facts. Ok. But he claimed that Otto, Duke of Athens once was in possesion of the Shroud. There are two possibilities: A1) He invented the whole story B1) He heard the story from some seemingly unreliable source (rumors), and tried to back it with some documents in a clumsy way. Then the questions arise: If A1, then where the stories about T2 and T3 originated? Question 1: Where and when the tradition of Ray Castle coffer originated? and Question 2: What are the links between obscure MS826, obscure coffer in Ray’s castle and the equally obscure letter of Theodore Angelus from Sicily? In short, there are two possible options: A) Either Othon did not have the Shroud, and then all T1, T2, and T3 are fakes. This is the case if the Shroud was still in Constantinople up to 1241, as Mario’s Sainte Chapelle theory assumes. B) Or he had the Shroud in possession. Then all T1, T2, and T3 essentially say the truth about that, even if they have several issues with other things. What if A)? This means that all (very obscure to general public, and at least T3 is distanced from the two others) T1, T2 and T3 must have been simultaneously faked in order to create false impression (about 200 years after alleged fabrication in case of T1 and T3 at least) that Othon once had the Shroud.

It may suggest this or may suggest that, depending on the current context; that is which opinions (NOT FACTS!!!) are currently fashionable in academic circles. HISTORICAL FACT that the letters were the whole base of the Abgar legend and, only later on (possibly a few centuries later), the whole concept of an « image of Jesus not made by human hands » was ADDED to the original legend. There are no HISTORICAL FACTS per se, only facts that were described in historical sources. And we have no evidence that the concept of an « image of Jesus not made by human hands » was ADDED to the original legend. One can find good reasons why it is not mentioned in the earlier versions of the Abgar legend, further one can find in the text of Eusebius, an iconoclast, some probable allusions to the image. I think the most rational conclusion is to, at the very least, also seriously doubt the possibility that the Mandylion could have been the same cloth as the Turin Shroud. Obviously you have the right to do so, but your arguments are weak and I find rather quite demagogical. What has the issue of the authenticity of the text of the purported letters to the Mandylion? They are two separate issues. The letters exist in many versions I hardly believe any of them is the original one, if there had been any letters (the current text being faked, or at least interpolated does not imply there were no letters at all).

I think it is probably one of the most complete and authoritative resources on the problem. Yes, it is one of the most complete and authorative resources, except the Count Riant’s compendium (Exuviae sacrae constantinopolitanae, practically impossible to obtain, unless one is a specialist in that field) on which it is largely based. I used it extensively, when I was writing my paper about the relics of the burial cloths venerated across Europe through centuries (part 1 http://ok.apologetyka.info/ateizm/ile byo pocien pogrzebowych jezusa cz1,749.htm and part 2 http://ok.apologetyka.info/ateizm/ile byo pocien pogrzebowych jezusa cz2,750.htm ) The primary documents are indeed veritable jungle, but it is possible to obtain some good indications, and possible solutions to the problem of the burial clothes stored in Constantinople and even some clues, about Byzantine attitude to some of them! There were probably three burial clothes in Constantinople before 1204, one of which was our Shroud of Turin, as well as at least two others, parts of which were gifted to Louis IX in 1241, and to Dionysius I, Metropolitan of Moscow circa 1380. Matthias: Either 1 or 4. I think probably 4 So modest your expectations are? In fact it is quite possible, that ALL OF THOSE 5 objects were actually the Mandylion, each in its own sense. Because in my opinion, the Mandylion never existed as a single object. It was an idea, the real image of Jesus, not a single piece of cloth. Remember, in Edessa, there were at least two copies made. There were later brought to Constantinople, along with the “original” 1.The Sainte Chapelle Mandylion, sold to Louis IX disappeared 1793 most probably an empty casket for the “original” Mandylion. 2. The Genoa Mandylion possibly one of the two copies from Edessa 3. The Vatican Mandylion the other copy from Edessa. 4. The Shroud of Turin probably the tetradiplon, the cloth folded in 8 layers, to show just a face, and resmeble the original face only Mandylion of King Abgar. Which probably was… 5.

If you believe everything that the Church of those turbulent years of christianity said, then you’re more naive than I thought… Dave say: Does Anonymous then concede that the Mandylion was some such kind of miraculous image? And I answer: Of course not! I’m not a fool to believe everything the Church is saying as being automatically an absolute truth… I am a free minded Christian who has not put aside his own conscience along the way! I don’t even believe that Mary was a Virgin and there are a lot of other “truths” proclaimed by the Church I don’t believe… Now, concerning the “image not made by human hand” slogan, this was simply what the “orthodox” Church of Edessa wanted to make people believe to support his battle against the heretical groups of Christians that were present in the region of Edessa (namely the Monophysite and Nestorian Churches) Probably a Pantocrator like icon of the face of the living Christ… And what was the model for this Pantocrator Christ? I would say, with some prudence, the Shroud image but maybe just indirectly via a sketch or something similar… So, you see, in the end, the Mandylion is important because it is probably the copy of a copy of a copy of the face we see on the Shroud… I want to remind in what circumstances the Mandylion was brought from Edessa to Constantinople. In 942, John Kourkouas, a leading Byzantine general, on the order of usurper Romanos I Lekapenos, started his campaing in Northern Mesopatamia. The Arabs had never experienced such beating from the Romaioi! “At the head of an exceptionally large army, some 80,000 men according to Arab sources, he crossed from allied Taron into northern Mesopotamia. Mayyafiriqin, Amida, Nisibis, Dara—places where no Byzantine army had trod since the days of Heraclius 300 years earlier—were stormed and ravaged.” Ultimately he turned to his ultimate goal Edessa, the city of King Abgar, where legendary Mandylion was stored. And then, something unexpected happened. Kourkouas, who previously captured with ease so many cities, now on behalf of the Emperor gave to the Arabs, unexpected offer: * The Byzantines will withdraw from all the conquered territory. * They will give a gurantee that Edessa will not only be spared, but not attacked again. * They will pay a ransom of 12 000 pieces of silver. * And they will release 200 high positioned Muslim prisoners. On a single condition: GIVE US MANDYLION! Such was the price for such old piece of linen. For what cost the Byzantines wanted it? FOR ALL COST! Whatever the Mandylion was, it was definitely not an old, painted icon.

He does not mention the portrait, most likely because he is something of an iconoclast. Some corrections, Eusebius asserts that the correspondence between Jesus and Abgar is genuine. Only later it has been discounted by Jerome and Augustine, on the basis that no authentic writings of the Savior would have been preserved in the Apostolic Church.

Except that conclusions are different. Or simply because depicting gruesome details we see on the Shroud would have been seen as scandalous for the susceptibilities of the era in which the Mandylion and the Pantocrator icon were created… Dave, you remind me a great deal of Wilson in the sense that you seem to forget good and important parts of the historical context in which those images of Christ came to be known publicly, especially the fact that, in those days, depicting a bloody and suffering Christ was not at all part of the normal way to depict him and the fact that, in those days, around Edessa, there was a big battle that was raging between the Orthodox Church and some heretic movements like the Monophysites and the Nestorians… As far as I remember, this mimics exactly the Wilson’s reasoning behind Mandylion=Shroud hypothesis! Haven’t you noticed that? All those things could explain very well the making of a false relic like the Mandylion by the Orthodox Church of Edessa and can also explain very well why the Mandylion face was showing a living Christ without injuries or bloodstains. All those things could explain very well why Shroud was folded in Mandylion face only form, as suggested by Wilson. It is almost exactly the Wilson’s reasoning (except that motivations are slightly different) Also, concerning this last topic, you MUST also consider the FACT that all the versions of the Abgar legend up until the so called discovery of the Mandylion in Edessa (probably during the second half of the 6th century) ALWAYS located the action BEFORE the Passion of Christ! Again, it’s a big point you seem to forget in your analysis! In such a context of a miraculous image supposedly done by Christ before his Passion, don’t you think it is normal that the forger was not inclined to had bruises and bloodstains on his painted image of Christ, even though it is possible that he based is work on the Shroud image? I really think so! In that context, every time, I will expect to see an image of the living Christ with his eyes wide open and that’s exactly what we could see on the Pantocrator icon and on all the Mandylion depictions. Just want to remind, that all representations of the Veronica Veil, before 1600s, showed an image of the living Christ with his eyes wide open, no bruises and bloodstains and so on, except the legend which placed the creation of the relic during the Passion, on the road to Calvary. This has much in common with depictions of Mandylion and this is not incidental. Yannick, you still miss the point. Your problem is that you don’t ‘sense’ don’t ‘feel’ the story of Mandylion. To your satisfaction, I tell you that Wilson also probably missed the point (or maybe not, but rather delibaretely tried to dismiss it). There is one missing element, most people haven’t noticed. One missing piece of the puzzle but apparently found recently. I don’t want to say here what, I have already said it not once, and not twice. See my posts #37 and #52 for some indications. And on the end: Important note: the historical context I refer is the one that prevailed around the time the Pantocrator and the Mandylion came to be known (during the 6th century) and not the context surrounding the transfer of the relic from Edessa to Constantinople in 944… The Mandylion from the 6th century is apparently the same as transferred to Constantinople in 944..","date":"2014-01-12","mins":"8:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"id":"comment-73251","author":"o_k","post":"Look at fact #9 in this very good paper: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/clc3a9ment questions about the mandylion hypothesis of wilson 2012 06 28.pdf First, this is, for me, one of the main historical fact that clearly indicate that the Shroud and the Mandylion were two separate objects and second, this is one important clue that tell us that, at the beginning of the 8th century, there were people Inside the Church who were aware of the presence of a relic known to be the Shroud of Christ. But, of course, the question that remains is: Was this shroud the same as the one in Turin? There is no way to be sure about that since Damascene did not describe it. Nevertheless, if we presume this was the same Shroud, we can think that around the time the Mandylion came to be known publicly (around the 6th Century), it is truly possible that the authentic Shroud of Christ was kept and well preserved by the Church elsewhere (probably around Jerusalem at that time, since we have no record of a shroud of Christ in Constantinople before the middle of the 11th Century). The testimony of Arculf (around 670) seem to confirm a bit more this possibility. And if this is true, then we must assume that this Shroud was not often exposed publicly to veneration because there is absolutely no record from that era which talks about a Shroud of Christ with a body image and bloodstains on it… Good, Yannick, you got it. The only one hypothesis that makes sense, outside Mandylion hypothesis, is that about the Arculfus Shroud. Although largely abandoned, it makes sense, after a few assumptions, but I find Mandylion track more reliable. Nevertheless, I have planned to write a short article about it for Dan, as a guest posting. I have some thoughts about it. As to the shrouds, there were definetly more. In #52 I wrote: There were probably three burial clothes in Constantinople before 1204, one of which was our Shroud of Turin, as well as at least two others, parts of which were gifted to Louis IX in 1241, and to Dionysius I, Metropolitan of Moscow circa 1380..","date":"2014-01-13","mins":"5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"id":"comment-73483","author":"o_k","post":"From the Damascene writings alone (and even more when you take all the other evidences together as a whole), it’s EVIDENT that the Mandylion was just like the copies we have, i.e. An image of the LIVING Christ, which had nothing to do with his death and burial. The only thing that is EVIDENT, is the opinion of the Damascene, nothing more. Probably referring to what majority thought at that time, except a few privy guys, of course. Why? Because Damascene doesn’t included the Mandylion in his list of relics related to the Passion!

Don’t you realize that, at the beginning of the 8th century, while the Mandylion was still present in Edessa and, if we believe Wilson, no one was supposed to know that it was the real Shroud folded in 8, there were people in the Church (like St John Damascene) who were aware of the presence of a Shroud of Christ as a relic venerated by the faithful (Damascene don’t say where this veneration was taking place but this cloth had nothing to do with the Mandylion), while at the same time, who were also aware of the presence of the Mandylion in Edessa as a DIFFERENT cloth not related to the Passion of Christ?This testimony of Damascene is impossible to discard for all the partisans of Wilson’s wild ideas and that’s why no one ever talk about that, not even Wilson himself (to my knowledge)… Yes, I have read it , quite well I think. And I see no slightest problem at all with that. How many times do I have to repeat, that the Shroud of Turin was not the only one burial cloth venerated at those times? In Constantinople there were at least three such burial cloths, one of them was the TS. I have recently posted a text about Arculfus’ Shroud, if you haven’t read it: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus shroud a guest posting by o k/ Neglecting for a moment theoretical possibility that Arculfus’ Shroud and the Mandylion could have been the same object at various times, we have such possibilities: A) The TS is Mandylion, the Arculfus’ Shroud is another alleged shroud of Christ. B) The Mandylion is not the TS, Arculfus’ Shroud is TS. C) Neither cloth is TS. Anyway, the testimony of Damascene does not solve here anything, and does not exclude the possibility of Mandylion being TS. And one more thing: The main point I try to make here is this: While Wilson and others pro shroudies think that the various changes that occurred over the centuries concerning the Abgar legend were due to a progressive understanding of the real nature of the Mandylion (which would have been the Shroud of Christ folded in 8), I propose that most of these changes (if not all) took place because of the evolution of the theological views and battles that were going on inside the Church and in particular, in the region of Edessa, and later on, after the Mandylion came in that city, in Constantinople. Fine. But do you really understand this? What “evolution of the theological views and battles that were going on inside the Church and in particular, in the region of Edessa” are you talking about? What the changes in the legends about the Mandylion have in common with them? That’s only empty talk, unless you give some convincing explantions: what and why. On my side, I see no relation whatsoever, and no way how theological disputes might have led to the evolution of the idea what was the Mandylion. The other way makes more sense, the better the true nature of the Mandylion was known the more changes in the legend. But that’s really complex matter, because I think the story of Mandylion might have been much more complex than anyone suggested especially if there is some missing link in the legend… If Wilson was correct and the various changes of the Abgar legend were due to a progressive understanding of the real nature of the Mandylion, then why in the world there is absolutely no version of the Abgar legend that clearly indicate that this cloth was a burial cloth and why there is absolutely no version of the Abgar legend that locate the miraculous imprint AFTER Jesus death on the cross? Due to various reasons. First because there were probably some people who were not interested in revealing the truth. You wrote that if we believe Wilson, no one was supposed to know that it was the real Shroud folded in 8 Here I disagree with Wilson. I think there are some indications that the true nature of the Mandylion was actually known to few better informed people. But they had some reasons to keep it secret, and maintain the mystery. Secondly, perhaps because of the some missing link, you still can not see like most people. The old versions of the legend were possibly closer to the truth than later… And why there is absolutely no depiction of the Mandylion that show bruises and bloodstains? Read once again “The Story of the Image of Edessa” written by Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (appendix C in Wilson’s 1978 book). If the understanding of the real nature of the relic would really have increase over the centuries, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, at some point, the truth would have come out regarding the burial aspect of the relic! By whom? If you know the history of the Mandylion, it is clear that there was no chance for that… Since you can’t find anything clear about that anywhere (whether in art or in written sources), then we must conclude that the Mandylion was not showing any signs of the Passion of Christ and therefore was not the Shroud of Turin… To me, this is clear. And to me, exactly opposite is clear… Just from the same reasons.
