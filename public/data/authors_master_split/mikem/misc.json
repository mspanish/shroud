I don’t think people were aware of the rest of the image’s existence. I lean towards the hypothesis that the Shroud was folded into a Mandylion type of display (because of the nudity) how many people were given access to the Mandylion and how often? Also who dared to open it up and see the backside of this legendary face cloth and for what reason? The nudity was the reason the image was initially folded like this and placed in a reliquary with an opening to the face but I don’t believe subsequent generations had access or knowledge of this fact. This is my 2 cents and what I personally believe..","date":"2015-12-06","mins":"9:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216616","author":"mikem","post":"Dan, Thank you for all your effort keeping this blog running and may God bless your Future projects..","date":"2015-12-15","mins":"6:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-215719","author":"mikem","post":"I might also add, In the Orthodox Church, relics are not readily accessible to the public and no body opens the reliquaries for investigative purposes.

Those relics were received from elsewhere and again no one dared to touch them over there either and son on. Relics are treated with great respect in our church, the weight difference is a nonstarter for me because the weight of the cloth could easily evaporate in the weight of the reliquary (probably made of solid wood &/or metal). This is not a 1300 years conspiracy theory. It just takes one believer early on (probably in Jerusalem, Antioch or Edessa) to make that decision and hide the body for respect and the Mandylion would be treated as a Mandylion ever since. It was probably unfolded after it was taken into Constantinople, displayed and witnesses by the crusaders (which is documented). That’s what I believe in and will leave it there. Let’s respectfully agree to disagree..","date":"2015-12-06","mins":"8:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"}]
