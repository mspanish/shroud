When jesus was resurrected he may have been set back to his mid twenties(who knows) when he had short hair. And when he was crucifeid had long hair. As for the buldge in the nose, he was brutally beaten and whipped so the buldge on the bridge of his nose may have been a swollen area..","date":"2011-03-03","mins":"2:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
