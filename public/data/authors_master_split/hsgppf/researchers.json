This is what happens when work is not fully cited………………………… EXCERPTS FROM http://holyshroudguild.org/drraes problematic threads.html password protected Dr. Mc Crone writes in “Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud” page 82 on Dec 26 1978, starting with 3 CB a heavy image area, blood from the lance wound using low magnification (10% +10% oli) I could see a heavy crustacean (of blood?) – too red”! Page 84 on Feb 2 1979 he writes, “I have spent a lot of time looking at the tapes especially the red particles. There are a lot of them and they are definitely inorganic. Hundreds of fiber are well coated with these deep red particles. They are the same particles Pellicori and Evans show in their low power photomicrographs they say this is blood I say it is an inorganic compound. In our archives I have more notes written by Dr. Mc Crone which was not published. ” Dr. Mc Crone writes on June 13th 1979, “Sample 3 AF (finger image) shows the largest percentage of colored fibre examined it closely the fibers are un uniform colored over lengths exceeding weave units hence the color is not a surface effect possible mechanism includes heat or liquid treatment. There are in this sample and others a number of yellow amorphous tubular flaked like a material resin. ( I thought in the part they could be aloes or etc).” The yellow amorphous tubular flaked like material resin was possibly also the same thing Dr. Nitowski saw and was convinced it was Myrrh and aloes just as Dr. Mc Crone first thought. Steven Schafersman is also correct when he states the madder root was first announced by Dr. Mc Crone. This is also confirmed by Paul Maloney, President of ASSIST at a Talk given at the “The Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi Faceted Enigma” conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14 17th 2008, when he states, “Walter Mc Crone had sent him in 1981 several Kodak transparencies of photos he took of Shroud linen fibers. “On those slides, (Guild also has them) Mc Crone had written the following note: madder rose, linen fiber, medium (blue) sample 3 CB” 4 and sample 3 AB. Mc Crone was referring to photomicrographs made on STURP sticky tape samples 3 CB and 3 AB which came from the blood flow across the back nearest the side strip side of the Shroud and directly adjacent to that flow on linen, itself. It was on that side where someone would have been working their repairs if the re weave theory is held to be correct. Mc Crone, of course, due to his belief that the Shroud was painted by an artist, was trying to prove that the Shroud had been in an artist’s studio.” Source: Maloney, Paul C. “What Went Wrong With the Shroud’s Radiocarbon Date? Setting itall in Context.” Talk given at the “Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi Faceted Enigma”conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14 17th 2008. Comments: Regarding the presence of madder rose on the cloth, Maloney says, “There is now a new way of looking at the presence of that madder rose. Although this is some distance from the “Raes Corner” such trace amounts can now be conjectured to explain the dye that was used, along with the aluminum mordant and the gum Arabic as a binder to create the wash to finish the re weave. Thus, it may now be seen not as a contaminant from an artist’s studio, but rather a contaminant from the weaver’s workshop.”.","date":"2012-05-21","mins":"11:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/20/the-valencia-dawkins-challenge-no-consensus-on-consensus/","cat":"challenge","title":"The Valencia Dawkins Challenge:  No Consensus on Consensus"}]
