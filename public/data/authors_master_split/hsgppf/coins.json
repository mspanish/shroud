[{"id":"comment-4482","author":"hsgppf","post":"Hello Max. The reason we only allow access to our archives on our site is because we need to keep track who’s accessing them. If we allow people to have the digital files from our archives we would not be able to keep track who’s accessing these files since people can easily transmit these files via e mail. Plus the images that are used in the P paper document are HSG ppf© and can be easily extracted in photoshop. The best we can offer with any of our archives are hard copies.
