I really doubt that this piece of cloth can really convert a lot of people, especially in our modern materialistic world. I have sense that the Shroud is there to strengthen the faith of you, me, Russ, Andy, etc., much more than to convert a non believer like my friend Barrie Schwortz!!! And I also think that Christians would gain a lot by forgetting the idea that they can find some proofs of the Resurrection by studying this cloth, but instead, that they can get a great help to meditate on the extreme LOVE AND MERCY of God for each one of his children, believer or not..","date":"2013-03-08","mins":"4:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/08/pope-benedict-says-shroud-of-turin-authentic-burial-robe-of-jesus-it-doesnt-matter-what-science-says-about-its-authenticity/","cat":"event","title":"Pope Benedict says Shroud of Turin authentic burial robe of Jesus & it doesn’t matter what science says about its authenticity"}]
