[{"id":"comment-7496","author":"matthew_demattei","post":"Hi Colin: I happened on your site today and was fascinated by your work here. I have been interested in the Shroud ever since I was a kid when I read the 1980 article in National Geographic. I have seen many explanations for the image over the years, but these haven’t always synced well with the data gleaned from the Shroud by STURP. Apart from the chemical change in the fibers, Dr. John Heller reported a number of particular details about the image: 1. The image fibrils showed no signs of capillarity. If your images were analyzed, would they also show this? 2. The darkened color was only present on the very crowns of the fibrils. Under a microscope, would we see the same thing on your samples? 3. Heller also reported that there was no variation in the color of the image fibrils–areas where the color seemed to be more intense on the linen was due to a greater number of fibrils in a given area being colored–almost like the digital images on an old black and white Macintosh computer. I have done some text searches to look for some of these details on your blog, but didn’t find anything. If you have already mentioned one or more of these, I apologize for asking a question that you have already answered. If your images have these details, then there’s a strong possibility that you may just have solved the mystery once and for all. Thanks for the work you’re doing.
