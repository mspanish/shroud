But lacking any substantive arguments all they could do was ridicule the History channel for making so many ridiculous show. That is true. The History channel can be insane at times. But it also produces some great award winning series like the Universe, America the Story of Us and How the Earth Was Made. Are these to be ridiculed simply because the are from the History channel?

Some of those are click ins from You Tube’s automatically generated suggestions. Some are probabably links from this blog. I would be surprised if anyone watched the show from beginning to end. It is really awful. It is so obvious that they have not done any real research. Unable to really criticize the shroud, they spend their time ridiculing others..","date":"2011-07-27","mins":"2:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/26/%e2%80%aaan-invitation-to-discuss-the-shroud-of-turin-youve-got-to-be-kidding/","cat":"video","title":"‪An invitation to discuss the Shroud of Turin.
