The Shroud of Turin has always attracted much more attention from authenticists than from non authenticists and one will encounter much more authenticists than skeptics on this website for example. Believers in authenticity or “Shroudies” as they sometimes call themselves, have always been very vocal and expansive. They have tried to demonstrate by whatever means one can imagine of (controversial scientific tests, weird hypothesis, conspiracy theory, inept mathematical reasoning, biased research, et cetera) that the Shroud of Turin wrapped the body of Jesus Christ. Scientists have better things to do than to study an old cloth whose medieval origin was already written on the walls prior to that monstrous radiocarbon testing. That being said, I don’t have anything personal against shroudies and would be happy to invite any of them to a good restaurant and discuss with them whilst enjoying a good meal and drink.
