Dr. Robert Bucklin M.D, was a former Professor of Pathology and Forensic Pathologist in Los Angeles, and member of STURP (The Shroud of Turin Research Project.) He personally conducted over 25,000 autopsies in his capacity as a Forensic Pathologist, to determine the Identity and exact cause of death of the “Man on the Shroud.” He conducted an autopsy on the Shroud of Turin for STURP, and described the wounds of “The Man on the Shroud” in minute detail. His full findings may be read on http://shroud.com/bucklin.htm He positively identified the Man on the Shroud as Jesus Christ, and Crucifixion as the means of execution. A summary of Dr Robert Bucklin’s research on the Body of the Man on the Shroud is as follows: ——————————————— 1. The body was approximately 5ft 11inches tall. 2. The body weighed approximately 175 pounds. 3. The body was anatomically well developed and normal. 4. The body had stiffened in Rigor Mortis. 5. The body had long hair, and a short beard. 6. The body had multiple puncture wounds over the entire scull area. 7. The body had an abrasion at the tip of the nose. 8. The right cheek was distinctly swollen. 9. Rounded foreign objects can be seen over the right and left eyes. 10. There is a large blood stain over the right chest area, consistent with the post mortem wound to the chest. 11. There is a penetrating skin wound in the right chest wall produced by a sharp puncturing instrument. 12. The blood flows from the injuries in the wrist indicate that the victim died with his hands raised about 65 degrees from the horizontal. 13. The body had been nailed through both wrists. 14. Only four fingers are visible of both hands, suggesting injury to the Median nerve of both wrists. 15. The body had been nailed through both feet. 16. The left foot had been flexed over the right foot before nailing. 17. There are a series of traumatic injuries which extend from the shoulder areas to the lower portion of the back, and down to the backs of the calves. These images are dumbbell shaped imprints, applied possibly by a whip. 18. There is abrasion and denuding of the skin over the right and left shoulder blade area consistent with a heavy object, like a beam resting over the shoulders. 19. The whip injuries occurred earlier than the other injuries. 20. Had been scourged with His hands above His heads, by two separate soldiers. 21. The victim was executed in an upright position with His arms extended upwards. 22. A Crucifixion type posture would be the most plausible explanation for these findings. 23.The wound in the right side released a watery type fluid from the body cavities as well as blood from the heart area. 24. The Man on the Shroud died of postural asphyxia as the result of His position during the Crucifixion. 25. There is also evidence of severe blood loss from the skin wounds, as well as fluid accumulation in the chest cavities related to terminal cardio respiratory failure. 26. In the case of Man on the Shroud, the forensic pathologist will have information relative to the circumstances of death by Crucifixion which he can support by his anatomical findings. 27. The forensic pathologist will be aware that the Individual Whose Image is depicted on the cloth has undergone: – Puncture injuries to His wrists and feet – Puncture injuries to His head – Multiple traumatic whip like injuries to His back – Post mortem puncture injury to His chest area which has released both blood and a water type of fluid. Dr Robert Bucklin concluded, “From this data it is not an unreasonable conclusion for the forensic pathologist to determine that only One Person in history has undergone this sequence of events. That Person is Jesus Christ.” =================================== 3. “The body was anatomically well developed and normal” False. No ears, no navels, right arm is too long, right hand is too long, forehead is too small, et cetera. 13. “The body had been nailed through both wrists.” False. We can see only one wrist. 15. “The body had been nailed through both feet.” False. We don’t even see the feet. 16. “The left foot had been flexed over the right foot before nailing.” False. We don’t even see the feet. 20 “Had been scourged with His hands above His heads, by two separate soldiers.” Did Bucklin view the scene ? A shame for a scientist to write things like that..","date":"2015-07-27","mins":"5:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/26/1999-interview-with-isabel-piczek/","cat":"image_theory","title":"1999 Interview with Isabel Piczek"},{"id":"comment-206668","author":"phpl","post":"Daveb of wellington nz has commented at length on the C14 Shroud test to criticize it, I guess that he is a C14 expert.

Concerning the replies to my comments, (that I won’t reply to because there is no need to) they are typical of what to expect from shroudies. The reasonable conclusion ( to use a well worn expression ) of all this is that just as Bucklin he is heavily biased towards authenticity.

This weakness has paradoxically turned into a force. That’s enough to make some people unleash their fantasies. Some here pretend that the forensic experts who examined it unanimously say that the shroud is authentic. That’s not true. Some pathologists like Lee or Baden disagree with this.
