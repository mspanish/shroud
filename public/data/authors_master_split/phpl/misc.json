The plane is somewhat overload, one of the pilots had a few drinks, one passenger’s passport is a fake one, and so one. Will these trivia elements prevent you airplane from carrying you to Kathmandu? That’s extremely unlikely, otherwise most air flights would be doomed. The Turin Shroud was submitted to a Radiocarbon 14 dating test so as to know it’s age. The fact that the protocol was not fully followed, that the results were leaked in the media, that there was an exclamation mark, et cetera, are nothing more than trivia elements that didn’t have any impact on the Radiocarbon dating test.
