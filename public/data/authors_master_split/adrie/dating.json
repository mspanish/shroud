Adler had 3 radiocarbon threads: a warp thread from the outer edge of the sample, one from the inner edge, and a weft thread from the middle. From each thread (which may have consisted of about 188 fibers in cross section, cf. The F15001 thread) he took 5 fibers: 1 from each end, 1 from the middle, 1 from the inside, and 1 at random (Adler at ca. 6:46). Of each fiber he made a FTIR spectrum and found a great deal of variability between even the 5 spectra from a single thread. This can be explained. Adler wrote that each RC thread had an encrusted coating, looked scorched and waterstained, and had dirt deposits/microdebris (p. 94). Also, each would have had (ancient) cotton spun in (2 20%, Fanti, Rogers). So, the RC sample was practically homogeneous at thread level. But at fiber level there was much more variability, because a fiber from a single RC thread can be either: – cotton or linen – with a very thick, or very thin, or no coating – scorched or unscorched – with or without dirt deposit because a fiber can be either from the inside of the thread, from the outside of the thread, from the top of the weave, or from the intersections of the weave. This may vary even along the length of a single fiber. The only top of the weave surface fibers from the main Shroud sticky tape samples, on the other hand, “were removed from the tape, and their identity as to type verified”: Adler picked and cleaned 5 fibers of the non image type, 4 of the waterstain type, 4 of the scorch type, 2 of the serum coated type, 2 of the image type, etc. (p. 94). No wonder that the FTIR spectra of a type were identical. E.g., a chosen and cleaned non image non scorch non waterstain fiber from the sticky tapes, is only linen, with a very thin coating, unscorched and without dirt deposit. Of course there were spectral differences between the types. Important is that the differences between the unchosen RC fibers were not very big: the spectra (p. 99) show that the threads were not entirely different from each other. They have roughly the same peaks, although of different relative intensities. Also the text doesn’t read the threads are different from each other, just that there is “more variation in the patterns” than in the non image type (p. 96). Adler wrote: “There is insufficient evidence to conclusively demonstrate the presence of any adventitious linen in the radiocarbon sample area. … In fact, the FTIR data for the radiocarbon sample … shows physical characteristics of both the waterstain and scorch regions of the cloth” (p. 98). This corroborated that the RC area visibly belongs to a waterstain and scorch area: “you can tell by just looking at it” (Adler at 4:06 4:17). Now, a RC subsample that was RC dated, was not a fiber, not even a thread, but a piece of cloth, in which the variability among a thread’s fibers will have averaged out. So, the chemical variability at fiber level alone can not explain the strong linear trend shown by the twelve (thoroughly cleaned) pieces of cloth in the carbon dating. Only a substantial residue of carbon containing handling dirt (inside the hollow fibers) that systematically varied over the twelve subsamples, might perhaps explain it. Or systematical irradiation ….","date":"2012-05-04","mins":"4:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/28/new-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Peer Reviewed Paper on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin."},{"id":"comment-10917","author":"adrie","post":"The four authors’ article “Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin: Partially Labelled Regressors and the Design of Experiments” on http://www2.lse.ac.uk/statistics/research/RAFC04 May2010.pdf has the same abstract as their April 2012 article. It says “We conclude …that there is a significant trend in the longitudinal coordinates”, and its final conclusion is: “Due to the heterogeneity of the data and the evidence of a strong linear trend the twelve measurements of the age of the TS cannot be considered as repeated measurements of a single unknown quantity. The statement of Damon, Donahue, Gore, and eighteen others (1989) that “The results provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval” needs to be reconsidered in the light of the evidence produced by our use of robust statistical techniques.” (all on page 4) This doesn’t mean that the twelve radiocarbon measurements themselves were invalid, but that the mean date from these twelve measurements is not representative for the single Shroud. The strong linear trend in the twelve measurements suggests that the Shroud did not radiocarbon age homogeneously, but in way that systematically depended on the longitudinal distance of a certain subsample – one of the twelve – to some (central) location of the Shroud..","date":"2012-04-28","mins":"2:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/28/new-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Peer Reviewed Paper on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin."},{"id":"comment-11010","author":"adrie","post":"Thank you, John.
