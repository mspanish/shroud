[{"id":"comment-11367","author":"adrie","post":"In my (updated) article I give a number of (new) reasons why a Maillard reaction would not have colored the starch dye impurity layer: 1. Absence of (evidence of) reducing saccharides 2. Transformed alizarin of Madder explains the fluorescence peak shift in image areas, but alizarin can not be transformed by a Maillard reaction 3. Diffusion of gaseous reactants into the cloth would have produced a color gradient (Rogers and Arnoldi, Scientific Method, p. 5) As to the presence of starch on image fibers: Rogers found traces, but Heller and Adler found none. This can be explained by the variation of color along long image fibers.

Heller and Adler deliberately tested image type fibers ‚Äì i.e. Completely colored fibers ‚Äì for starch, and didn‚Äôt detect it (A Chemical Investigation, p. 37, 43, 50). This is not speculative. 2. Rogers incidentally found traces of starch fractions when ‚Äútesting for sulfoproteins in blood areas‚Äù (Comments on, p. 13 14 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers.pdf). Here, the tested fiber was possibly from a blood/image area, but it was not necessarily a completely image colored fiber. The detected starch fractions may have been present on a not colored length of it, perhaps even under the blood. Rogers added: ‚Äúwe should have tested for starch‚Äù, so he didn‚Äôt do any specific tests for starch on specific fibers then. His later remark in Scientific Method (p. 30 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers2.pdf ) ‚ÄúThe hypothesis on carbohydrate impurities is supported by observations of traces of some starch fractions on image fibers‚Äù gives no specification or reference. This is not scientific. 3. Rogers‚Äô book (p. 44) says Mc Crone ‚Äúhad found wheat starch on the Shroud‚Äù, but also here there‚Äôs no reference. 4. Kohlbeck found starch on sample 6 BF from the lance wound area, i.e. A blood/image area (http://holyshroudguild.org/dr raes problematic threads 3.html , and Mapping of research test points http://www.shroud.com/maptap2v.htm F=Front=Ventral). These observations prove that, where starch was present on a fiber, and if this starch was colored, it was completely transformed by the image formation process. A Maillard reaction can not do this: it can not transform starch. It can not color the primary cell wall either. VUV irradiation can color the primary cell wall (Di Lazzaro et al., http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Di Lazzaro Web.pdf), and probably also starch if it is less stable.

It just fluoresces less than the background. The UV vis spectra of image and ‚Äòred‚Äô scorch are even almost the same: ‚ÄúWhen the photoelectric data are convolved with the scotopic response curve and normalized (Fig. 9), it becomes obvious that the background linen itself is responsible for the measured response of the blood and image areas, since there is an identical wavelenght characteristic. This agrees with the visual description. The curve for scorches having visual reflectance corresponding to that of image areas shows only a light weighting toward the orange region relative to the curves for body image, although the color difference is obvious to the eye and in the fluorescence photography. The explanation might be that the eye has an excellent ability to distinguish between colour differences when compared side by side.‚Äù (Pellicori, Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin, Applied Optics, Vol. 19, No 12, 1980, p. 1919). So, it is is not that the image formation should produce no fluorescence at all, it should only produce less fluorescence than it takes away. If the Shroud threads were wiped with starch paste at weaving just as you dabbed the linen with your finger, Hugh, touching only individual fibers, this might indeed explain some of the ‚Äòhalf tone effect‚Äô of the Shroud image..","date":"2012-10-25","mins":"8:06 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Refining a model: children‚Äôs ‚Äòinvisible ink‚Äô trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (‚Äúscorching‚Äù) at a much reduced¬†temperature"},{"id":"comment-1013","author":"adrie","post":"You guys sure are fast, I can only just keep up üôÇ (if this is good English) This is the comment I made on The Other Site a while ago http://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment of the week by thibault heimburger/ So, Hugh, if you like, you might read my article http://jesusking.info/Internal%20selvedge.pdf or the parts you think are useful now.

These margins at least contain: ‚Äì many red iron oxide particles (from iron in water originally used for the retting of the linen.

The water stain margin at the edge of the Raes corner contained a higher concentration of salts than those in the rest of the Shroud (Adler, http://www.shroud.com/adler2.htm ). My hypothesis is that the Shroud has a very thin film of starch that was dyed with an acidic dilute madder dye solution (pale yellow). A madder dye solution can be made by boiling dried crushed madder root in acidified water and/or by fermenting. (http://footguards.tripod.com/06 ARTICLES/ART33 madder.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madder ). First century Jews used vinegar for acidification of water (cf. The ‚Äúvinegar‚Äù offered to Jesus on the cross Jn 19,29). Pliny talks about ‚Äúsome small drops of vinegar‚Äù (minimo aceti asperu) used in the water for making a fine starch paste. In Latin, acetum was sour wine, but perhaps sometimes lemon was used to acidify water. The colorants of madder are the carbohydrates alizarin and purpurin, which fluoresce in the violet blue and yellow red. Together with the light blue fluorescence of the lignin in uncompletely bleached linen, they could explain the faint and mottled yellow green background fluorescence of the Shroud. The image formation then transformed this film (plus perhaps the primary cell wall), quenching the background fluorescence..","date":"2012-10-25","mins":"5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Refining a model: children‚Äôs ‚Äòinvisible ink‚Äô trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (‚Äúscorching‚Äù) at a much reduced¬†temperature"}]
