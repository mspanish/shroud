[{"id":"comment-102746","author":"prof_dr_nicholas_peter_legh_allen","post":"Dear Sir I would like all references to me removed from this site. I am a serious scientist and not some fringe person I was also ill advised to appear on this recent Smithsonian Channel documentary which claimed that a real scientist was going to evaluate my findings!!! Also, I explained back in 1992 about the stigmata issue and if one actually bothers to do their homework instead of wasting their time on mindless speculation, they will soon discover that I have written about this and many other issues repeately over the past twenty or so years. The blood (or blood like reagent) was painted by brush onto the shroud after the body image was created photographically. Please note that all blood “flows” on the shroud contain acute angled kinks isomewhere along their supposed flow. This is caused by an artiistic flick of the wrist during painting. Also, all blood flows, regardless of where they supposedly emanate from, exhibit the same thickness and consistency. Please take me off your site and refrain from misquoting me as this just confuses your reader further.
