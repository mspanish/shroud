The point has been previously raised in the blog that the presence of AB blood on the Shroud could possibly be taken as evidence to indicate that it may not be authentic (as AB blood is a relative newcomer according to this theory). The D’Adamo theory is at direct odds with the conclusion from most DNA sequencing studies which indicate that the most ancient version of the ABO gene is A. The next blood type that appears by human lineage is B, followed by O. (see previous discussion on the blog) To apply this to the touch up scenario above, the original blood on the Shroud would be type O (as AB wasn’t around yet), and the later applied touch up would be type AB. The original type O would have gone undetected in the original Shroud typing studies as only anti A and anti B antibodies were available, hence type AB only the touch up would be positive. “Follow up studies using monoclonal antibodies developed against the core O antigen, however, specifically indicated O antigens were not present in the bloodstained fibers of the Shroud that have been examined” The original typing studies were subsequently followed up on with more recently developed antibodies, which can recognize the O blood type directly.

If a single individual (AB) was involved and one clings to the controversial notion that O blood may be the most likely as it is the oldest according to certain theories (discussed in previous threads) such original blood would not be reactive with anti A and anti B antibodies in the original forward typing tests, and thus remain undetected. Follow up studies using monoclonal antibodies developed against the core O antigen, however, specifically indicated O antigens were not present in the bloodstained fibers of the Shroud that have been examined. As anti A and anti B reactivity was approximately equivalent, this showed both A and B antigens were present with an assigned phenotype of AB. This conclusion is from using forward typing methods, (some might argue reverse typing results support this, but as a negative result is expected, this argument becomes somewhat circular). Molecular biology analysis looking at the genotype (DNA), if feasible, would confirm and extend the forward typing results. If this were a touchup job, then careful scrutiny of bloodstained fibers on the contact versus the reverse side of the cloth might reveal disparities in blood type, barring divine assistance or a very, very good luck of the draw (see opening sentence above)..","date":"2013-04-09","mins":"10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/09/an-important-distinction-in-catholic-theology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An important distinction in Catholic theology"},{"id":"comment-30062","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh, It would depend on the type(s), but with mixture of A + B, approximately equal amounts from two different individuals, that would look similar to a single individual with AB.

To be classified as O by reverse typing, this would indicate that both anti A (could be from either an O or a B individual) and anti B (could be from either an O or an A individual) antibodies would exist in the serum. Reverse typing in older samples could be pretty iffy to provide a reaction they would have to remain functional, which is dependent upon conformation, etc. They could be present but invisible in such a readout like a rusted out car on the side of the road it’s there, but doesn’t work. The previous comment about anti O refers to the fact that in the early going (mid 70s or so), anti O reagents really weren’t available.

Speaking both as a scientist and a Christian, if you compromise your objectivity and feel it necessary to selectively favor those data that support your own personal beliefs, while ignoring those that don’t, then what good is that you’re not really interested in the truth, just a biased version of it. That is false integrity for either a scientist or a Christian. True faith withstands the flame. So does true data. Put it to the test as many different ways as you can. If you truly believe something scientifically, you should try to disprove it, not support it at all costs. If the Shroud is real, it’s real, if it’s not, it’s not.

I have worked intensively on relic cults and I think that the number of people, especially in a Europe where we have grown up with such things, who believe that the Shroud is authentic are very few. The same goes for any other pre medieval relic although I have a Roman archaeologist friend who confirmed that one of the several Holy Lances is indeed a Roman lance. So ‘saving the masses from a possible delusion’ is not really an issue because very few are deluded ( or not as the case may be) in the first place. The vast majority of those who believe the Shroud is authentic come from other climes. In medieval times, the Shroud was never an important cult (one of the criticisms of it was that John would have mentioned the images on it in his gospel if they had been there on the original), it becomes one when the Savoys take it over and make it such a central theme of their royal prestige. In this sense its heyday was the seventeenth century when it was exhibited to vast crowds almost every year. I like the Shroud as a subject because, despite it not being seen as important in its day, there are lots of issues surrounding the nature of its weaves, the actual history itself,the iconography of the Shroud and what it might actually have been if not originally a grave cloth. I am just hankering after some proper tests so that I can have more evidence to work from. So my ‘personal’ interest is as a historian who has specialised in relic cults, and sees some unresolved issues here that interest me. So I keep an eye on these debates and contribute when I feel i have something to offer (as in areas where i would like to see further research). Despite the odd snipe at me from some contributors, I congratulate Dan for keeping things as open as they are. Charles, Thanks. I don’t think you took my general comments as a veiled snipe, but, if even a little doubt may exist, that was not the purpose. I was just commenting in general. If I didn’t like rap music, I wouldn’t listen to it for 18 hours and gnash my teeth continually. Then get up the next day and do it again. I put on some Beatles and be done with it.

I could understand others less scientifically or technically qualified making it, but YOU???? Where does one start? How does one start? Let’s just say that one would expect blood that was either 700 years old or 2000 years old to be extensively degraded, and not something that could be so easily identified as the kind of blood that is looked at routinely in modern crime forensics. OK, that’s speculative, maybe, but you surely don’t need me to tell you that Adler and Heller were hard pushed to characterize Shroud blood with standard test procedures. Those field kits only test for the first two stages of degradation as I recall, i.e.as far as hemochromes. But degradation was surely far more extensive, given the difficulty of getting blood stains, real or look alike, into solution, requiring hydrazine and other harsh reagents as I recall, Then there was the atypical porphyrin spectrum, which then occasioned what was largely speculation on their part, i.e. Biblical narrative driven speculation (spectral shifts attributed with trauma induced bilirubin (photo labile) that some might consider would have been photo oxidized away within in no time at all),. One might reasonably ask why they did not attempt a chromatographic separation and identification, e.g. By pyrolysis spectrometry. Adler was a porphyrin specialist, I grant you, but you must surely agree that the approach and background of a synthetic organic chemist is entirely different to that of a haematologist dealing with semi oxidized but relatively intact haems check his Google Scholar for evidence of that. Best stop here, methinks, and wait for immediate reaction/feedback to my astonishment at the line you have taken. The basic chemical identification of blood based on the presence of a heme group is the same in both cases that’s what I was referring to, nothing more, than the bottom line. Field kits, hydrazine solubilized (aged), the initial chemical identification of blood in both contexts is heme/Fe. Immunological tests measure the primary blood components albumin, Ig, although more current tests include glycophorin, which can distinguish species readily. It think it gets advertised way too much that Heller & Adler were in way over their heads, not even able to troubleshoot at a first year graduate student level. The book version may be in narrative style, but such results were accepted & published in the scientific literature. Surely, the reviewers were much more scientifically & technically qualified than me. Regarding degradation, etc., of course aged blood is expected to be more degraded than fresh blood, but certain components can and do survive blood has been identified on prehistoric tools, immunoglobulin has been detected in T. Rex digs, similarly ABO antigens in mummy remains. Hope this alleviates some of the astonishment… Shocker!.","date":"2013-11-10","mins":"10:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cementing Over Central Park"},{"id":"comment-50670","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Charles Freeman : Kelly, I am sure I have not read everything – most books about the Shroud are very repetitive and add nothing to our knowledge but perhaps John Klotz will make a break through. (Heller and Gove are the more readable and informative.) Clearly whatever happened to the tapes on the disbandment of STURP they do not seem to have been made over to a public institution that could care for them and make them available for scholars to examine. This is a pity as if they have been kept in pristine condition and together, new tests would certainly add new information about the Shroud. I once worked on a US led archaeological dig in Turkey. We were allowed to take materials out of the country for testing on condition that they were returned.I wish the same had happened here but clearly the deal was done otherwise and so we have a fragmented Shroud. No one here seems to mind much. (One of my first jobs when working as a ‘slave’ – I suppose ‘intern’ nowadays, in Rome, in 1966 was packing away gold fibulae from Etruscan tombs and I was taught how vital conservation and labelling was because one would never know who might one day want to examine the finds.) Even if I was granted access to the tapes I don’t have the expertise to do any new tests so I just made the enquiry as a matter of interest. I do hope the wrangling about the radiocarbon dating can stop – we have passed the 25th anniversary. Even if the tests are declared invalid there is not a scrap of evidence from the tests done by the labs to date the Shroud to the first century so why go on about them, Even a patch, that no one who has examined the Shroud close up ( e.g Flury Lemberg) can see. Might simply have been a sixteenth century repair of a cloth made two hundred years before. The atmospheric palynologist, Dr. A. Orville Dahl, surveying the Frei tapes, pointed out that no less than 32 of the 57 pollens could only be deposited by insects – rather than blowing in on the wind as Frei suggested. Dr. Dahl put it cautiously when came to the conclusion that the pollen was not ‘due to wind borne deposition but to human activity of some sort.’ I am not one for conspiracy theories but I admire his restraint! Heller’s book remains as one of my favorites, together with William Meachum’s, title notwithstanding, but I understand. I would also list anything by Fr. Rinaldi. The Heller book has some good narratives regarding the blood tests; today’s blood tests still evaluate the same thing the presence of hemoglobin bound iron. Blood really hasn’t changed during the past 30, or even 300, years. DNA evaluation is now included in the current forensic techniques, but blood testing still involves the same one two approach described in the book, chemical tests for Hb/Fe, followed by immunological tests no disrespect intended to anyone, but it really doesn’t require a huge degree of technical skill to chemically analyze for the presence of blood, even that in dried bloodstains field technicians do it all of the time, so do undergraduate forensic students. The arguments about Heller & Adler being too technically naive to test for the presence blood are ludicrous hemoglobin is a porphyrin; Adler was a porphyrin specialist, for crying out loud.

Why not? Because he’s not au fait with the problems of dealing with the biological milieu of proteins, lipids etc, of learning the little tricks that are needed to break attachments between your target molecule and the surrounding gunk, and then persuading that molecule, once free, to partition into an organic layer from which it can then be pipetted off and spotted straight onto a TLC plate and run against authentic standards. My first years in research were spent having to acquire precisely these kinds of techniques, and had I encountered Alan Adler at coffee, shaking his head over his “ancient blood” problem, I’d have wasted no time in suggesting a certain fix, one I learned from the bile acid literature, and had successfully applied to bilirubin, and not just free relatively apolar bilirubin but its more polar conjugates (mono and di glucuronides). What one does is exploit the fact that porphyrins and linear tetrapyrroles that originate from haemoglobin all have two propionic acid side chains that make them negatively charged organic anions, or partially anionic, in physiological buffers around about neutral p H. The trick is this. There’s a cationic surfactant called CTAB, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, i.e. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, which you may have heard of, since it’s used to extract DNA from chloroplasts and other plant material. You add CTAB, and being cationic, it forms a tight association with you anionic porphyrins etc. You then add chloroform, methanol and buffer in the correct proportions to get two immiscible layers, i.e. A standard Folch extraction, and hey presto your CTAB porphyrin associations from the aqueous to the organic layer. Take off that lower organic layer, maybe evaporate some surplus solvent with a puff of nitrogen, then as I say, run on TLC with a solvent of intermediate polarity, maybe with a dash of acetic acid to help split the CTAB porphyrin associations. All you need is a uv lamp to detect the porphyrins as they migrate up the silica gel. You can then take them off with one of those gizmos attached to a vacuum line whose name I have forgotten, and when the removed areas of silica gel have dried you tap out the powder, elute off your purified porphyrins etc for analysis by glc mass spec or whatever. I and Don Ostrow were using this technology in the early 70s to track the fate of bilirubin in the phototherapy of neonatal jaundice. Alan Wotshisname at the Mayo Centre was doing the same thing to track the fate of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. Why on earth did STURP not take advice and tips from people dealing with biological material. Why did they recruit a synthetic organic chemist who, smart though he was, very smart by all accounts, was simply ill equipped to deal with biological gunk? I don’t know, I suppose you’d have to ask them, Adler seemed like a pretty good pick to me. Approaches are different here at the US at this time of year, some rake their leaves…some mow…some use a blower…some a vacuum. I suspect there is even someone, somewhere using tongs. My hunch is that if you, yourself, had performed the tests with any and all of the above mentioned considerations & techniques, and had those results accepted and published in the scientific literature, there would be those that would take issue with the data.

It’s called hydroxyproline (HP), a breakdown product of collagen and elastin in connective tissue. Given there’s a lot of connective tissue in a leech that may have been extruded along with semi digested blood (depleted in potassium and with an anomalous porphyrin spectrum) by our Brother Hirudo, looking for a handy look alike non clotting substitute for fresh blood, there’s actually quite a few aspects that could be said to fit a ‘wacky’ leech hypothesis. But jump forward to the late 20th century, where an explosives thermochemist recruited to STURP as Chemical Director detects a hydroxyproline peak on his pyrolysis mass spectrum of Shroud “blood” , and what’s his response? Answer: to assume it’s normal to have HP as a major constituent of human blood (where’s the evidence?) and immediately to seize upon it as a handy way of bolstering a flimsy case against the Shroud image being a scorch, claiming that the heat would have driven off HP (despite it being a relatively involatile high melting solid which he probably detected via its fragmentation pattern rather than improbably volatile molecular ion). But there’s a long, long new posting that has just gone up on this site that has confirmed my long held suspicions that anything one says about the hallowed Raymond Rogers and his peculiar blind spots in chemistry will be totally ignored, like my recent dismissal of his claims that thymol makes further radiocarbon dating a waste of time (bless!). I even provided an email address for the American Chemical Society, inviting folk here to get a second (and better informed) opinion on what I consider to be generic eye wash rather than branded mouth wash. Yet all his outrageous claims that thymol would form chemical bonds with the cellulose of linen have been totally ignored, and his phoney chemistry endorsed as if unchallengeable fact. I am clearly wasting my time here. Anyone who claims (like John Klotz) that I am a poodle barking at Great Danes could do a lot worse than consult Google Scholar, and check my credentials against those of Shroudie Land celebs (enter R.N.Rogers, A.D.Adler, J.H.Heller etc and compare with mine – C.S.Berry). Thank you for the putdown, John Klotz. I had never thought of using Google Scholar to check names instead of topics until you made that poodle remark. I see no further point in being modest about my contributions to biomedical science when there are folk like you on the site, attempting to turn Shroudology into a scientific beauty contest, one in which biggest pair of tits (fake as often as not ) make the biggest impression on the panel of self appointed judges. Ah, yes, hydroxyproline I believe that’s been discussed before. I was actually hoping for a journal reference or two with an evaluation of blood, pre ingestion vs. Post ingestion, particularly showing that the atypical spectrum of maybe blood is recreated by vacationing in the gut of a leech. Is there data of an anomalous spectrum or just an assumption that the profile would be similar? I’m just asking. “Wacky” hypothesis? I thought it was pretty creative, particularly with the anti coagulation angle beats keeping a cage full of vampire bats on hand. But, the blood is only part of the story if it’s blood or maybe blood, there is an alternative. It could be something else If the blood tests were so botched, what about the tests to include/exclude the possibility that paints,pigments can account for the “bloodstains”? I believe that 2nd question was posed by an eavesdropper in the coffee room (Heller? Mc Crone?) listening in to your conversation with Adler. In his book, Heller states that six tests were performed to evaluate the presence of blood, any one of which would be accepted in a court of law. He adds that together they were irrefutable. Sounds like a pretty strong statement. Apart from the book, their work was scrutinized and peer reviewed by other scientists, some of whom may have even made the club on Google scholar. Many would consider publishing in such peer reviewed journals as a pretty strong statement. The question came up because if one considers the tests for the presence of blood as inconclusive, what about the other tests that were done for an alternative? Should these also be categorized as incompetent, incomplete, etc.? There are two ways to approach the question. If it’s not blood, or even maybe blood, then can one definitely say that it is anything else or does it fall under the category of RBD, remains to be determined? Are there enough results from the tests that were performed & published to make a conclusive statement regarding this inclusion/exclusion of paints, pigments as a possibility?

Naturally, I shall not risk giving offence by offering you first refusal as Immunologist in Chief, to say nothing of destroying this site’s raison d’etre were the answer to be a positive (though I’ve no doubt the documenting of “false positives” in archaeo immunology would keep the site ticking over for a few more months and years, embellished with claims that the metabolism and biochemical make up of a leech is in fact remarkably similar to that of our own, making differential comparisons meaningless, and in any case, Raymond N.Rogers would have scoffed at the very idea of a convenience blood substitute, drawing on his extensive knowledge of chemical explosives…; ) Interesting question if unique leech antigens from the gut would be present in digested blood meals, and would persist in aged bloodstains created from them. I think it might be a bit of a tough sell to get hunting for leech antigens moved to the top of the list, provided there was a list. Would need some connection to the data that’s already been collected, other than just HP no need to rehash that here, its detection in blood has been gone over in the previous Hirudo thread an atypical blood spectrum post leech would make a stronger connection, If Shroud bloodstains were tested and such antigens are there, then they are there, says this immunologist: the data is the data. Would take more than a bit of explaning to rationalize that one away. The false positive arguments always come down to inclusion & evaluation of the controls these are as important as the test samples themselves, without them, it’s difficult to make any firm conclusions..","date":"2013-11-12","mins":"3:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cementing Over Central Park"},{"id":"comment-51075","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Colinsberry : Leech antigens? It depends on how the blood was harvested from leech. If it was done in a way that extruded leech tissue and their immunological markers, then the latter would have been initially intact,and any subsequent degradation would be no more or less severe than that of the blood cell markers. So if claims can be made that ABO blood group markers can survive centuries, allowing positive tests for AB etc, then surely the same could be said for leech markers. The problem might be in choosing which leech tissue component to serve as marker, purifying it from a modern leech (hoping there are no species specific problems) and then raising one’s antibody to it. But this is your area of expertise, not mine, being more inclined to think in terms of physical isolation of molecules, as distinct from tactile recognition by your immune sera with their miniaturized tunnel vision search and destroy robots, they of the limited vocabulary (like “found” v “not found”, exterminate, exterminate etc ; ). So, back to my more comfortable and better fitting biochemist’s hat, here’s another suggestion. Given the leech secretes an anticoagulant that prevents ingested blood from clotting, then the fibrinogen of the blood should be intact, and may, just conceivably may, hang around at least for a while (assuming it’s not all strained off to the outside like the watery plasma in which case this idea is a non starter). So one tests for the presence of fibrinogen in Shroud bloodstains. If the pro authenticity ideas of Adler and those before him are true, i.e. That what we see is not whole blood, but serum exudates from bloodclots, then there should be no fibrinogen worth speaking of, although there might be FD Ps, ie. Fibrin degradation products for which there are separate tests. Come to think of it, did Adler et al ever test for FD Ps as another authenticity promoting marker for real blood? I don’t recall any mention of those. Would a synthetic organic chemist/porphyrin specialist have known there are standard test kits available (I used them myself to monitor the health status of rats on a lifespan trial of dietary fibre). But that brings us back to the question of horses for courses… Adler is so often referred to in Shroudology as a “blood expert”. Not true, at least not in terms of published work. “Unique” leech antigens was the phrase, this is in reference to potential protests that the make up is similar to our own, and since these are blood meals, you couldn’t just use any expression would have to include the gut. It’s not really a claim that AB antigens can survive, they do, though I’m not really sure that’s a direct comparison to the putative leech antigens, one would suspect these (leech) would be protein based, not carbohydrate based such as the ABO system. I am always careful to discuss the typing results on the Shroud as type AB as determined by forward typing In my opinion, a conformation using molecular biology techniques would be an important extension/conformation. Regarding Adler being a “blood expert”, it’s been discussed ad nauseum hemoglobin is a porphyrin, he was a porphryin expert. One can decide on their own. These were professional scientists at professional institutions, it’s unfair to paint them out as clueless at the controls of a plane in a steep dive. Heller & Adler weren’t immunology experts, but they were able to set up & carry out a series of controlled antisera experiments, either through their own proficiency (easily believable to me) or with some consultation (happens all of the time in science as you know). You chime in on a variety of scientific areas (numerous) in various postings, which according to the Google Scholar club, there may not be a sufficient paper trail. What is one to make of that? Look objectively at the data, results, or comments, if it’s sound, it’s sound. One’s knowledge & experience can extend GS, no? But enough of this bantering about blood or maybe blood as I previously wrote, assume these blood tests, even though reviewed & accepted in journals by other Google Scholars, were so terribly botched that it’s only a maybe at best. What about that eavesdropper, who is asking about the alternative?

First, when looking for someone to service or reconstruct your valuable but falling apart Model T Ford, would your first thought be to employ someone whose main expertise was to do with modern carburettors (or who says he specializes in black cars). Second:if you are invited to referee a paper detailing tests on the Shroud of Turin, do you instantly reject it on the grounds that the data are non quantitative, with no statistical replication, and for the most part spot tests involving colour changes that are possibly subjective, and in any case unrecorded (no video footage)? I probably would not. But I will tell you this. If the author reported tests on sticky tape fibres sampled from a “bloodstain” (that description being provisional and essentially under scrutiny) I would take umbrage at it being described as a coloured serum coated fibre. I’d say that description was begging the question with its reference to “serum”, implying that previous interpretations of the “bloodstains” as serum exudates of blood clots were unproven hypotheses. Indeed, those previous assumptions were to some extent undermined by the curious absence of potassium in the stained areas, and by anomalous atypical haem spectra that had been explained away with assumptions about bilirubin being present, again with no convincing evidence that the light sensitive bilirubin was present. Personally this experienced referee would have sent it back for re writing. (Btw: the Biochemical Journal once sent me a two part paper (I and II) to referee from one of the world’s leading authorities on bilirubin. I went through both with a fine tooth comb, and gradually realized there was so much padding and repetition that the two papers could without much difficulty and no loss of essential content be condensed into one that was just over half the length, and less of a burden on both reader and journal. Later I got a personal letter of appreciation from the journal’s Editor, thanking me for the hard work and the keen eye.

(The true blood of Christ would never solidify this was the selling point of the monks at Weingarten in Germany who had the blood that had come out of the side of Christ and was still liquid to prove it one reason perhaps why the Shroud was never in the top class of blood relics.) Here were have a case, like that of the blood of St. Januarius in Naples, when the blood only liquefies on special occasions but is able to replicate itself on a contact relic that then becomes a relic in itself. Not unusual but good to add to the story of the Shroud. I deal with the medieval blood cults in Chapter Nineteen of my Holy Bones, Holy Dust, ‘The Wondrous Blood of Christ’. I have not as yet come across any member of the STURP tomb ( here apparently still active in 1986) who knew anything about medieval relic cults so I wonder how they dealt with the matter. Anyone know who was involved? You could contact the monastery directly or do a little digging if you sincerely want to know who, what, when I’m no historian, but I did last year “STURP tomb”, I’ll pass the objectivity is obvious; besides, why bother, any tests that were done would be considered incompetent, inconclusive, etc..","date":"2013-11-16","mins":"6:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/copy-of-the-shroud-of-turin-in-new-jersey/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Copy of the Shroud of Turin in New Jersey"},{"id":"comment-51599","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Charles Freeman : So what do you think,Kelly, about ancient blood, apparently dried, that comes damp to such an extent that it can be transferred onto another piece of cloth? It is common enough in medieval Europe to read of such things which is why I feel quite at home with it and don’t think of it in scientific terms at all. But the STURP TEAM (raised no doubt from the TOMB of their disbandment of 1981) apparently did think of it as a ‘scientific’ happening. So if the two bloods are the same,what is the mechanism through which the dried blood of the Shroud transferred itself to the nuns’ copy? What do I think? I believe in science. I believe in miracles. For me, it is not a given that science and faith must be in conflict. I disagree with those who think this is so. I also disagree with the promotion of any type of relic as authentic & miraculous when the science says otherwise. Is it possible that some religious relics are fake and overhyped? Of course it is. But I don’t think this automatically disqualifies everything. This is a subject that has to be considered on an individual basis. God doesn’t need to rely on fakery. He’s much, much bigger than that. A tent of Catholicism is transubstantiation. I am a Catholic (adult convert). I believe in it. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t leave the pew. What is the mechanism? I don’t know. But I believe there is one, though you probably won’t find it looking in a science textbook, even the latest edition. In my opinion, there’s much about science and natural laws that remain to be elucidated, I don’t think we know everything about everything, even in 2013, soon to be 2014. A fighter jet or i Phone would have seemed miraculous or the devil’s trickery 500 years ago. Where do we currently sit on the timeline with our scientific knowledge? 99.999% and counting? I, myself, think it’s naive to think so man was made in God’s image, true, but prepare to catch an atomic bomb when you try to take Him on in a chess match. Back to the Shroud copy in NJ. I’ve been there, I’ve seen it. If the blood on the Shroud is not real blood, then any discussion is pointless. If the Shroud blood were the true blood of Jesus, the mechanism could be a miraculous one. Or, then again, with all due respect, it could just be the humidity. I have no problem either way. For myself, the most important thing about the Shroud is not if the blood is a specific type or if the bilirubin is high or low, or even if the blood is transferred or applied. Becoming interested in the immunology & cell biology aspects that surround the Shroud has allowed me to consider the images in a more detailed way than I ever did. Even if it were a marvelous work of man made art, I would still value its ability to deepen my faith in the sufferings of Christ. In my life, the Shroud has done that in a different way than anything else ever did. I’ve seen the Pieta, I’ve seen numerous paintings & frescos, I’ve seen the Passion on the big screen and on Dv D. The Shroud has made it more real for me. That’s the bottom line. That appreciation will still be there, even if it were demonstrated to be bogus by the evening’s end. Science & faith have together given me a wonderful life. So, what do I think?

I am glad that Kelly has told us that he believes in the possibility of miracles because that helps understand his approach.Any event for which one can not find a physical explanation can potentially be the result of a miracle. So if, as yet, we have no scientific explanation for the images on the Shroud , Kelly can keep open the possibility that they are the result of some miracle. Hard nosed Brits like myself, living in a country that simply gathered up all relics and burned them in the 1530s, take another approach – we don’t understand ‘x’ but there are lots of things we didn’t understand in the past, we do understand now as a result of scientific developments, so why not the Shroud? This does not mean that relic cults, the way they arise and grow and why some become worldwide phenomena and others disappear is not a fascinating topic at least fascinating enough for me to have spent many months researching and writing about it. I repeat that I am delighted that the Shroud has been behaving like a good medieval relic should and transferred itself onto a copy that has now achieved veneration in its own right with a storyline that seems to have been boosted further by Fred Zugibe.

Ah, but there you are clearly mistaken that it is not so important, at least in my beliefs. I do not view it that way. The lack of scientific support for a first century date is very, very important.

When I read the subject written about in such length and in such an authoritative tone, that this is how “science should and can really work”, etc. As a scientist, I take issue with the lack of hands on experience and the presentation of what is (in my opinion) a distorted and misdirected view. I also find it very inappropriate to question the conduct of individual scientists (by name) and groups of scientists as being dishonest and skewing results to be in agreement with their personal beliefs.

John: I think you’re correct in thinking that a body set rigidly in the position of a crucified person, whose arms were pulled out of position with some force to their site over the abdomen, is now fairly well accepted by authenticists. What they do not realise is that this is exactly the same scenario as a metal or wooden crucifix, whse arms were snapped off and placed in the same position – except for the actual site of the breakage, which is fortuitously hidden by some convenient burn marks… What about the ankles/feet, they’re often crossed over (though not always). And the inclusion of a loin cloth, which is certainly more ubiquitous for most metal or wooden crucifixes, this was sanded down and smoothed over? “Convenient burn holes”, “fortuitously placed”, really? No need to answer, these questions are simply rhetorical. I’m not interested in defending why I think it’s not a soldered crucifix. Or a repaired wooden one. So, now we are at the point of not even having a dedicated artist to create a forgery from scratch that was clever enough to fool a panel of scientists it’s the work of a recycler? Again, rhetorical.

If God worked in terms of proof, why not appear in the sky and be done with it.” Thomas was in the inner circle, yet, for him proof was necessary. For some, tangible evidence is part of the equation for some it’s not; for others, it might push them closer than they once were… I don’t know why God doesn’t appear in the sky and be done with it. He doesn’t seem to work that way. I suspect He has His reasons. It is difficult for me to understand how science could prove the authenticity of the Shroud. I don’t think that it can. Science can only take you so far, up to a certain point, after that faith must come in. Perhaps it’s the word “prove” that is a sticking point it may mean different things to different people. In the realm of science, it’s a strong word to use. Religion is about faith, most certainly, but does this implicitly warrant that science must be quarantined in all matters of religion? The attraction of the Shroud for many is, it goes without saying, its relationship to faith. For the believer who is also a scientist, investigation into the physical properties of the Shroud is a natural. For myself, science & faith are an important part of my identity together, the two have given me a wonderful life. I believe that the Shroud once wrapped a human body. It may or may not have been Jesus. I think it probably was. Can science prove this? It’s very difficult for me to see how. I am a Christian who is also a scientist. I am a scientist who is also a Christian. To me, that isn’t contradictory; a conflict between the two isn’t automatic. More often than not, I usually agree with myself. It may be a simplified analogy, and this is not intended to trivialize the subject, but in some ways investigation & discussion of the Shroud may be relatively similar to “proving” an autograph is authentic. Yes, the looping of the “B” and the slanting of the “R” are right where they should be, that’s important…The ink is consistent with the type of fountain pen that would have been used at that time. Records indicate that someone named “George Herman” signed into the Hotel Diplomat during the supposed month actually, there is some discrepancy if it is “Herman” or really “Henmab” apparently the desk clerk spilled coffee on the middle of that page of the register. Several cigar stubs (at least one of them was well chewed, although not sufficiently enough for a dental records match) were reportedly found at a nearby train station. Could this really be a baseball signed by the Babe, himself? There are multiple findings that are consistent with the ball being genuine. It makes sense. Ol’ grandpa really loved that ball…got it from a friend of his…he kept it on the mantle for years, until it rolled off one afternoon and nearly went into the fireplace…Unless you were there, and handed the ball over to Mr. Ruth, and watched him sign it in person, it is difficult to “prove” that the autograph is real, particularly to anyone else this becomes further compounded with increasing time.

This is a different technique than reading a number off of a machine or visualizing a radioactive band on a gel at a specific defined mobility in reference to a standard. Then again, pathologists are trained to critically observe specific details of tissues to decide if they are diseased or healthy. So, certainly within one’s own perspective. In reading the (linked) article, there were figures showing embryonic patterns in scorch/patch areas. If no such fire had occurred, or the cloth had not been folded as such to create a template for the regularity/symmetry of such burn patterns, this would not be an observation. Is this really a property of the cloth, per se or just a result (“artifact”) of the cloth’s storage history?

I understand Dr. Diaz did not have direct access to the Shroud, so how could he examine it for residual EMR? The so called ‘spectral emission line’, presumably, is the result of electromagnetic activity surrounding the Shroud but under what conditions? and when? And what equipment was used to analyze this? As I understand it, the SOT is now kept in an airtight case filled with Argon and some other gasses, would this affect Dr. Diaz results? I got as much info as I could at the local library and the internet about images being produced in cancerous tissue, came up with nothing.

Kelly is perfectly correct that all sorts of things “might” have an effect, and Mike may be correct in his ideas of what blood “may” do, or “would” do. The great thing about Garlashelli and Borrini is that they can say what, in their admittedly very limited experiments, it actually did do. I don’t think it is necessary to recreate the exact configuration of the rivulets and islets, just how to produce some kind of interlaced or zigzag flow. No amount of simple physics is a good as a demonstration. And as for a forger making it red – adding red paint would probably do, such as madder root dye. This is much more of a problem for people who think it is undoctored real blood, as we have discussed before. See http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people and places/history/newsid 8302000/8302446.stm for Lord Nelson’s bloodstained glove, http://gb.pinterest.com/pin/179862578842010008/ for JF Kennedy’s shirt, http://historical.ha.com/c/item.zx?sale No=6014&lot Id No=6169 for Abraham Lincoln’s collar, or http://ornamentedbeing.tumblr.com/image/5318393577 for King Charles I’s shirt. Yes, I applaud the effort to actually do something, but I think these types of situations can only go so far, you get rivulets, you don’t again, I think the variables in trying to recreate this type of thing can be numerous. Even for a single individual, on a singular arm, the relaxed & flexed positions of a forearm, shoulder could alter the blood flow patters due to the absence or presence of furrows at a particular time that blood dripped downward. The pictures are interesting I believe the color of the cloth(s),material including the Shroud, is a consideration to be taken into account as to how this may affect our perception of the blood color. If the blood was doctored, wouldn’t the chemical signature of the additive be apparent in the spectroscopic analysis or perhaps it could lie within certain of the unresolved peaks? In Adler’s protease digestion experiments, would the paint, dye be sensitive, removed together with the blood to evaluate fiber color underneath?.","date":"2014-04-03","mins":"10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures"},{"id":"comment-96114","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh Farey : The official record of Garlaschelli and Borrini’s presentation can be found at: http://www.aafs.org/sites/default/files/AAFS2014 Proceedings.pdf. Three references to the “traditional” horizontal position of the arms led me to believe the setting up of a straw man, but I think I was mistaken. Attempts to get blood to flow down an arm were made from three different ‘exit wound’ sites, at angles from “0° (arm parallel to the groud and perpendicular to the body) to 90° (vertical arm).” It was found that blood would only flow down the arm at “greater than 80°” which is, indeed, a good deal more vertical than any “traditional” position. The idea that there were two blood flow angles, as illustrated above, was explored many years ago. The zigzag pattern was created, it was suggested, by blood flowing vertically down the arm and stopping in minor clots along the way, which, when the arm was more horizontal, then changed direction and dripped straight off. This was quite ingenious, and I experimented with it myself twenty years ago, but was wholly unable to produce anything like the pattern we see on the Shroud. The fact that in all this time nobody has reported success suggests that either the experiment has continuously failed, or that the researches of Garlaschelli and Borrini are long overdue. Mike’s suggestion, that the blood would flow along the sloping arm if the flow was slow, or vertically off it if the flow was faster, also needs experimental corroboration. The authors do state that “further analysis will focus on the position of both arms…” so I don’t think the right arm has been wholly ignored. We must look forward to their further results. I would think the amount of variables that might affect the results would be significant clean skin versus sweaty, grimy skin, musculature, length of the arms, amount of hair on the wrists, forearms, the frequency, duration of movement, etc. If three people were crucified on exactly the same style of cross for exactly the same amount of time, their bodies taken down and wrapped in a cloth, how overlapping would the blood flow patterns be? Would there always be rivulets? In exactly the same pattern. Handling, transport of the body could also be affect the final result, as well as washing, even done hurriedly, which is debatable. . If an artist were skilled enough (or not) to effectively depict blood flow patterns on the cloth is subjective, but if the blood was simply applied by a forger, why is it so red?.","date":"2014-04-03","mins":"7:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures"},{"id":"comment-44355","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Shroudenigma : If the image purported to be a pharaoh or any other character from history, academics and scientists would have not slept until they had answered every question and written every thesis about it to satisfy their curiosity and further their careers.

These are my thoughts, but I’m just one person, I’m sure there are additional opinions, that might agree or disagree this is just what it looks like to me Regarding the application of blood, unless the cloth is suspended in air, working top to bottom, once the cloth is saturated at the base and the fluid encounters a relatively less nonabsorbent material, such as a wooden or stone table, it will begin to spread out at the edges with bandages I don’t know if it’s quite the same though if the bandage saturates, as in a compress being applied, it would spread out once it soaked through (upwards) to the hand.

An interesting idea, yes, but I guess I’m just not that sure, myself, about comparing coloration of photographs with increased contrast/enhancement there seem to be too many variables, the image rests on the very surface of the fibers, the blood soaks through; what about serum that’s dried/soaked onto the fibers underneath the blood that’s flaked does this affect the reflectance/coloring, how does one control for that? When I look at back & forth at the image on the Shroud, before & after restoration, the post restoration image looks much lighter to me is this just my perception based on the differences in the lighting/contrast/enhancement of the photos, or due to the influence of a different backing cloth, etc. I don’t know, but I believe that a spectral tracing of the isolated image fibers before & after the restoration would be the same. Not saying that this isn’t a useful exercise, etc., but I think it’s important to keep in mind the differences between manipulation of photographs and data interpretation by machine.

It might be interesting to compare patterns before and after diiimide reduction to see if one can get more direct evidence on the specific carbohydrates that are modified.

Okay Thanks very much for the reference. Certain non cellulosic saccharides (for example, xylose, uronic acid derivatives) can be relatively resistant to acid hydrolysis mentioned because these are two byproducts of saponin (if one includes saponaria as a potential surface coating of the cloth). I think the type of approach you suggested is important to help characterize the details of (specific) carbohydrate involvement.

Most of the literature where plant material is concerned is to do with cellulose, and with high temperature treatment (with a view to making semi synthetic fuel oils). So it’s back to first principles in trying to guess what kind of products one might be dealing with where discoloration of linen is concerned, especially if as seems likely it is hemicelluloses that are the more susceptible to chemical change. If one were to take as one’s model a fairly mainstream, uncontroversial model, it would be the pyrolysis of xylans to furfural (an aldehyde). First the xylan polymer de polymerises, releasing free xylose sugar. That then loses three molecules of water to form furfural. C5 H10 O5 → C5 H4 O2 + 3 H2 O But there’s a problem. Pure furfural is colourless. However, it does yellow quickly on exposure to air (not surprising, given that aldehydes are reactive, and tend to polymerise etc). So when they speak of carbohydrate dehydration it may in fact be dehydration plus simultaneous aerial oxidation. That would then account for the ability to bleach the product with diimide – by reversing the secondary oxidation – but presumably leaving the initial dehydration step(s) intact. So what are the products of furfural oxidation that are yellow? From a quick literature search: “A problem associated with the use of furfural, however, is its tendency to oxidize in the presence of atmospheric oxygen to form oxidation products such as furoic acid or formyl acrylic acid or formic acid which further, upon heating, forms furfural acidic polymers.” http://www.google.com/patents/US5332842 So where does that leave us? It’s possible that diimide reduction will return us to furfural, or a related aldehyde, and given its volatility, it should not be difficult to detect on glc. But if the yellow product is a polymer, formed with one or more oxidation steps, then it’s possible that while it could be bleached, it would still remain polymeric, and fail to reveal itself on glc. Answer: Approach the task with a completely open mind. Attempt to spot patterns in the data. Or as an Australian boss of mine used to say: “Just suck it and see”. Colin, Thanks very much for your reply. I think the use of a panel of specific glycosidases might also help to sort out what products may or may not be present. Regarding this, might be an interesting experiment to treat image samples (real or simulated) with glycosidases to evaluate which carbohydrate(s), linkages the “image”, coloration was sensitive to..","date":"2013-10-12","mins":"11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/10/responding-directly-to-colin-berry/","cat":"science","title":"Responding Directly to Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-47364","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Colinsberry : Enzymatic action? Glycosidases? I like the idea in principle, Kelly (me being a biochemist by training) to say nothing of fewer losses as by products of acid hydrolysis. But would it be feasible in practice? To reduce a complex heteropolymer such as hemicellulose(s) down to its constituent hexose and pentose sugars on a realistic time scale you would presumably need a cleverly contrived mix of endo and exoglycosidases, the first to act at particular links within the polymer chains to effect a quick reduction to smaller more manageable fragments, and then the second, working inwards from the new terminals, to release the individual sugars.Sounds a tall order to me, if you don’t mind my saying. Colin, I don’t mind you saying at all, it could be a tall order was actually referring to using these in combination with the previously mentioned approach, particularly to help define any species that may be resistant to acid hydrolysis or a more end stage purification not necessarily chopping away at the entire structure from the beginning. Labeled sugar nucleotides used in conjunction with glycosyltransferases to identify particular terminal or individual saccharides might also prove helpful just a thought [I myself, used the latter technique years ago in my first postdoc in Gerald Hart’s lab who studied nuclear glycosylation, O Glc N Ac. I also used this in my own lab to look at trimming & readdition of Glc residues on newly synthesized proteins in the ER I have photos!]. Plant carbohydrates are certainly more involved, but if there’s a linkage there is a glycosyltransferase to make it & a glycosidase to break it; many of these have now been purified & cloned.

In the first one has sialo and other glycoproteins that are cell surface associated and critical for cell cell recognition, as well as binding water at the cell surface. Sooner of later those cells die and the detritus has to be digested by endogenous lysosomal enzymes, using those glycosidase enzymes.Otherwise the organism would get clogged up with its own cast offs. It’s an entirely different situation in plant cells walls. Cellulose provides the fibres for mechanical strength, especially in the secondary cell wall, and hemicelluloses provide a ground substance or cement. The difference is that plants do not recycle their dead and dying cell wall components. After lignification they continue to provide support after death. Finally they drop off, and the only type of organism that can then recycle the carbon are the saprophytic fungi with their invasive feeding hyphae. But fibrous strands, or even hemicelluloses within those strands, are a tough substrate, which is why it can take years or decades even for dead wood and other vegetation finally to disappear. So the enzymes for hemicellulose digestion are not indigenous to the plants that made them, but in an entirely different organism, so are unlikely to show the kind of exquiste selectivity that one might desire if seeking to use, say, purified fungal glycosidases to effect an efficient step by step dismantling of hemicelluloses (and let’s not forget that they they have chains that can have hundreds of sugar residues strung together.). I did a year of botany as subsidiary subject at University (if only because the zoology course was oversubscribed!). Did you do any botany, Kelly? No botany here, I was a bit allergic to anything with a chloroplast I appreciate the difference in chain length & structure, but if there’s a terminal end you might find a key that fits very well put discussion by the way.

I don’t know about the specifics of cosmetic testing.

Several of the labs I have worked in were attached to or located within a clinical setting. Many of the patients there were last chance treatments. I saw their families in the hallways.

I should like to see a concerted programme of experiments with time expired lab animals to see if it is possible to produce Shroud like images by naturalistic means. Whether that is indeed possible cannot yet be excluded. In the meantime, other well meaning attempts to explore the boundaries between science and the supernatural need not be deplored. However, they might be constructively criticised when their unwarranted speculations are asserted as more than just possibilities, and are published as formal papers in scientific journals. They risk the odium of bringing Shroud science into disrepute. Daveb, I agree with all that you said it is a very balanced perspective. A comment relative to the portion I highlighted above. The naturalistic route would seem much more amenable to a concerted effort of experimentation than many of the alternative explanations yet, it seems to lag behind in attempts to collect empirical data. I have always thought Rogers sold himself short in his paper mache hand experiment the system was not the best in my opinion the detail is just not there even knowing the hand was the substrate, it is difficult to appreciate the shape in the resulting image. To an unknowing observer, it would appear more like a Rorschach than identifying it as a hand. Relative to a real hand, I have wondered if the porosity of the skin might help to provide some of the focus, detail that would be important to demonstrate. In designing an experiment using lab animals, a considerable number of variables exist, both relative to treatment conditions of the cloth and the body underneath it. However, compared to trying to develop a system for resurrecting a body, it seems like a bargain. It would be nice to see this idea move more forward experimentally..","date":"2014-02-25","mins":"6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"id":"comment-82492","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Louis : No blood sacrifices in the realm of Shroud studies, please.

This is crucial. With the Shroud, adjacent white (nonbloodstained) fibers serve this function (no antibody reactivity is observed). One would also need to show that an irrelevant antibody (of similar type directly against something unrelated) does not react with the host material, that the antibody binding is truly specific. This is also crucial. In the Shroud studies, certain secondary antibodies were used as well as anti O antisera to function as controls (no antibody reactivity was observed). Perhaps such tests were done in the previous studies and not mentioned. Without such controls, it is difficult to make any solid conclusions about the antibody specificity, i.e. Blood type. You would see exactly the same results (type AB) if unrelated, nonspecific were occurring. Regarding the 1999 result that the sample contained human DNA. This could also be interpreted as the sample was simply touched by a human being at some point. To verify that the DNA truly originated from blood cells (and not simply skin cells), one would have to evaluate immune receptor gene rearrangement (unique to white blood cells). The same is true for the DNA reported on the Shroud. It remains to be determined if such DNA is truly from blood cells or is simply due to contamination.

Scientifically there is no loss of information, at worst keys are scrambled up. That you didn’t find them under the sofa doesn’t mean they’ve magically deasappeared out of space time. No guarantee you’ll always find lost keys there may be places you don’t know of or places you don’t think to look. Scientifically you can’t claim something is true, just because if it wasn’t, it would have been shown to be false by now. That’s not science. These types of arguments lean toward an authentic at all costs approach, not an objective search for the truth. Daveb is correct, there is a lot that remains to be systematically evaluated, grey area on either side of the authenticity arguments, grey area on mechanisms of image formation, and so forth. Too often in cases such as these, arguments based on absence of any “proof” otherwise, the data are overextended to what they really show. For example, you will read widely that the blood is human blood, that it’s been definitively established but list the data that definitively shows this. Adler, to his credit, was appropriately cautious in his conclusions. Also consider that if any non human blood components, yes, even non primate, were (also) present, they would be undetected in the previous experimental designs. Scientifically, you have to be careful about what they data truly show and where there are potential blind spots. Relatedly, it is commonly stated that portions of 3 genes were found in the bloodstains on the Shroud (betaglobin, X, Y), but the rest of the DNA is really too degraded to be useful. This is a general misunderstanding of the method that was used those particular 3 genes were selectively targeted & amplified, like pulling selected letters out of a bowl of alphabet soup it’s not as though that was all that was found after sifting through all of the dregs that remained. Shroud research is still in the early rounds, the first reel. It’s way, way too early to call it a day and say that it’s all been done, or should have been by now.

If you found them in one of the above locations, then you could know for sure (assuming no bilocution). Or you could look directly in the pocket, but perhaps it’s sewn shut, or currently out of reach. This is how science operates. Anything else is considered inconclusive. It’s valuable to look under the sofa, sure, but you have to be careful not to fool yourself into extending the data past what they really show. Science functions by empirical evidence it is capable of proving that the Shroud isn’t genuine, but what is the scientific test for authenticity? Is there an experiment that can be named, previously done or yet to be performed? An authenticity smoking gun? One that would truly nail it? Unlike on the side of authenticity, trying to prove what the Shroud must be, because it cannot currently be explained, a process of elimination approach, there are single experiments that would be major blows to authenticity: If C 14 dating showed the Shroud was 2,000 years old, is this scientific proof? No one can only conclude that it is an old cloth; consistent with authenticity yes, proof: no. If C 14 dating (redo) established a younger date, this could be a smoker If the blood were conclusively established to be human, is this scientific proof? No, it only shows there is human blood on the cloth, consistent with authenticity, yes; proof: no. If the blood were found to be bovine, this could be a smoker It may provide a certain security thinking of certain things as “proof”, but challenge yourself to step out of the cocoon of what’s safe if you want to talk about science, then be willing to accept another viewpoint, from the lab bench how do you think this might operate is it really proof when you don’t understand something?

Giovanna De Liso worked for some 12 years in the seismically active area of Piedmont, experimenting with producing images using all sorts of different cloths treated in various ways, and under different conditions. She seems to have successfully produced 3 D image of a key and a snake. Some have commented that they are the most successful images produced to date; others have commented that they are only of relatively thin objects. Her paper “Shroud like image formation during seismic activity” by Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010, may be found at http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/De Liso Web.pdf and is well worth reading. Note that the PDF is ‘secured’ so I’m unable to copy and paste extracts here. The most successful images were produced in connection with the seismic release of radon gas in the neighbourhood of iron bearing gneiss rock formations, with electrostatic discharges and infra sound emission and with variations in the local geomagnetic field. It seems that the lack of any one of these variables resulted in no image. I have been unable to find out very much about this author, and she has not responded to my enquiries in English. I am given to understand that she may work with Prof Giulio Fanti, and has supported his “corona discharge” hypothesis, so some consider she may be suspect. My own view is that the paper should stand on its own merits. Twelve years of dedicated work resulting in the successful production of 3 D images is not to be ignored. Radon 222 is the longest lived isotope of radon with a half life of 3.28 days, emitting alpha particles, and is a decay product of radium. It is prepared synthetically for treatment of cancer, as the daughter product is Bismuth 214 which produces penetrating gamma radiation. In an earthquake the quantities would be very small. However Radon 222 has been implicated as the most significant non tobacco cause of lung cancer in apartment dwellings in USA. I recall that there have been subsequent papers citing De Liso’s work which you may find on the shroud.com site. The collimation hypothesis is something that requires further investigation, and we shall have to wait for any further information which may possibly come to light in due course. I am unable to comment further on this aspect at present.

His followers, fearing loss of relics, interrupted the dissolution process only to find a body the size of a one year old child suspended three feet of the ground wrapped in an envelope of light. The Old Testament prophet Elijah left this world in a whirlwind accompanied by a flaming chariot. In Matthew 28:3 we read that an angel descended to Jesus’ tomb and his (the angel) appearance was like lightening.
