If it is a powerful argument for yourself (unless and until you have a good reason for thinking you are deluded), it is not an argument based on a logical reasoning, it is not an argument that can convince even an unbeliever. And muslims or hindus can describe the same kind of fruitful transformations. Look at an argument from history. If we use traditional criteria of historical assessment, we can be pretty sure that the Turin shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. But much more that that, the probability that the image is the consequence of the bodily resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth is very high. An extract of the conclusion of my article published this year in the Heythrop Journal: “As judged by our current knowledge, [the Resurrection Hypothesis] is the most likely of the three hypotheses that have come under scrutiny [Garlaschelli Hypothesis and Natural Hypothesis]. Its level of plausibility is high, which is not the case for the other two hypotheses. Its explanatory scope does not constitute a major obstacle, although its explanatory power could be improved. It is less ad hoc than its rivals and offers the possibility of a substantive illumination on related fields of research. This does not mean, however, that the RH is proven to be historical; it is simply the most likely hypothesis when we adopt a Minimal Facts approach to test for the best explanation.” http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/heyj.12014/abstract Of course point 3 isn’t based on logical reasoning, that’s exactly why I think it could convince certain unbelievers (in Christianity or other faiths). A changed life is a powerful witness, much more so than hearing someone just recite words or certain facts. That’s the main point I was trying to make, along with that the Shroud can be a part of the Christian faith, certainly, but faith is much bigger than just the cloth. I am certain that those of other faiths can describe similar fruitful transformations, I personally have no problem with that..","date":"2013-12-22","mins":"6:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam"},{"id":"comment-65109","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh Farey : From John Walsh to Stephen Jones, the bald claim that the Shroud is either a miraculous product of the Resurrection or a cynical money making fraud has nothing to do with the understanding of the Shroud, but a (cynical? surely not) attempt to win adherents to authenticity by emotional rather than scientific grounds. “There is no middle ground,” they trumpet. Well that’s nonsense, as has been demonstrated many times on this blog. One more? Stephen Jones again: “Similarly, if the Shroud were [1st century / 14th century], the science of the 20th 21st century should have discovered that by now. So that absence of proof by modern science that the Shroud is [1st century / 14th century], after 35 plus years of intensive scientific study of the Shroud, is positive proof that the Shroud is [fake / real]!” [Delete at whim.] We end with the most unreasonable, irrational, merely emotional appeal of all, that the Shroud is scientific proof that Christianity is true. This is literally non sense. 1. I think Walsh’s comment about “no middle ground” is in reference to the fact that ultimately the Shroud is authentic or it is not. This blog has demonstrated that there are many opinions about many things, but that’s all in a sense the Shroud is independent of what anyone thinks t’s either real or it’s not there is no in between, while opinions may run the spectrum, swayed (or not)by certain emotional or scientific arguments. 2. I think “35 plus years of intensive study” is not the best of phrases to accurate describe this. It’s not as though large groups of scientists are examining and re examining the cloth in situ daily. And again, the notion of proof by default is misguided. Perhaps that experiment just hasn’t been done yet. Heller & Adler once said (paraphrased), No amount of experiments can “prove” that the Shroud is authentic, but a single experiment could disprove it. Science is best at telling us what the Shroud isn’t, not at what it is. 3. The strongest proofs that Christianity is true are the transformations and fruits in the lives of individuals who have opened their lives to fellowship with Jesus Christ. JP II said (paraphrasing) that the most important thing about the cloth is that it connects one in a unique way to the sufferings of Christ. How ironic would it be if a forger with mischievous or malevolent intentions had the end result of drawing even greater attention to God’s limitless love and mercy whether the Shroud is evidence of Jesus’ physical suffering or just a representation of it those things remain.","date":"2013-12-22","mins":"2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam"},{"id":"comment-65051","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"The claims that science has proven the Shroud is an imprint of Christ’s Resurrection or that the Shroud must be authentic because if it weren’t, then it should have been demonstrated as such by now, are a gross exaggeration of the limitations and power of scientific investigation. It is comforting, perhaps, to believe that science has shown that 1 + 2 = 3 for the Shroud, but bear in mind that in the reality of science “1” may equal a + b + c…, and “a”, in turn, may equal a1, a2, a3, etc. The number of variables that may exist regarding the Shroud are unknown. Any one of those could potentially be a game changer. Consider the experience in reaching a consensus conclusion to relatively ” straightforward” questions like, is it really blood? are the arms the correct length? where exactly, from entrance to exit, were the hand/wrist wounds? One cannot “scientifically prove” the authenticity of the Shroud by default although well intentioned, those who think so have a general misunderstanding of what science can and cannot do.

We have an historical figure Jesus Christs who by five historical accounts (The four Gospels and St. Paul) was crucified circa 30 CE. Tacitus the Roman historian recites that fact of Christ having founded a cult which surprisingly did not vanish when he was executed by Pontius Pilate, What science has demonstrated are facts about the Shroud for whom that fit only one historical figure. Those facts: the blood stains and the diagnosis of the Man in the Shroud as a crucifixion victim are scientific facts. The conclusion that it is Jesus Christ is a conclusion drawn from those scientific facts. Inferences drawn from established facts occur every day in courts throughout the United States. Indeed, Richard Dawkins claims that circumstantial evidence is superior many times to eye witness testimony which can be seriously wrong. I, myself, would be more inclined to use “consistent with” in place of the term “scientific fact”. Also, one could argue a crucified body was involved, but that doesn’t “prove” the identity of the victim. Perhaps it’s just semantics in a sense, or comfortableness with use of the word “prove” particularly in the context of science.","date":"2013-12-22","mins":"1:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam"},{"id":"comment-130704","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"“(personal note : we should have add a precision here to state that the fact in question is the fact that the bloodstains on the Shroud really comes from a real human being), which is incredible, especially when we consider that this is one of the most unquestionable facts regarding the Shroud!” One of the most unquestionable facts: reread Adler’s findings carefully he was correctly cautious in concluding that the data shows the blood is of primate origin. Regarding other studies, the subsequent connection of MNS antigen expression related to non human primates was unknown at the time the studies were performed by BB’s group, and their significance unrealized afterwards until relatively recently. It’s indicative, but it is important to bear in mind that this is only a single, brief report, not published in a typical peer reviewed scientific journal). It is important not to overextend what the data do and do not show. In the analysis of the blood data involving species of origin, one has to disconnect the fact that the fibers came from a cloth containing an image. BTW, the description of the immunological tests in part xiv) of the Stochastic paper is inaccurate. The results do not suggest that it is human blood on the basis of positive results involving human antiglobulin. As written, this would involve antibodies raised in humans, which would most certainly not react in this case!

That’s good enough for me. You can still personally think that there is some missing data to collect before claiming the blood is surely human blood, but I don’t need to wait for this, since I got two experts who analyzed real blood samples from the Shroud and, completely independent of each other, came out with the conclusion that it is real human blood. Again, personally, that’s good enough for me and I don’t need more proof.” You can’t make conclusions about the species of origin of blood by merely analyzing the images of blood and serum stains. Takes immunology or molecular biology techniques. Adler was appropriately cautious in his conclusions. So was Garza Valdes regarding his serological studies concerning species of origin. 99% certainty in a blog rant is not. Try asking other scientists with a background in immunology/serology, get their opinion. Especially those who are non Shroud related. See what they say. Key word: cross reactivity.

Someone could always argue that a forger used real human blood.

Similar to the blood types reported for the Shroud and the Sudarium, the Lanciano host is reported as being type AB. The primary reference for the Lanciano studies is an article by Dr. Lonoli, published in Italian in Quad Sclavo Diagn. 7, n 3, 1971. (A PDF is available on the web). It is often mentioned that subsequent studies were conducted on the Lanciano sample by the World Health Organization in 1973, although I have been unsuccessful in finding a reference or any details from these studies. I am also unaware if any follow up studies to extend and confirm the original findings have been performed if so, would be interested in a reference. In the Lanciano typing experiments, reactivity of the sample with anti A and anti B antibodies is described, resulting in a designation of AB. This situation is somewhat unique, in that unlike the Shroud, there are no “off areas”, which may be used as negative controls. In the case of the Shroud, unstained fibers adjacent to bloodstains are suitable, built in controls to include in the design of such experiments. As reported for the Shroud, when unstained fibers (even those at the bed of the bloodstains) are mixed with anti A and anti B antibodies, no reactivity is observed. This is important as it demonstrates that anti A and anti B reactivity is specific for bloodstained fibers and shows that nonspecific binding of antibodies to the cloth does not occur. Inclusion of positive and negative controls to verify the specificity of binding is an important (essential) component of such serological studies. Further typing studies performed on Shroud fibers using monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that bloodstained fibers failed to react with anti O specific reagents, providing a further control for antibody specificity. This is significant as the O blood group shares the exact same core carbohydrate structure as A and B blood types. Only the terminal sugar is different between O, A, and B blood types (see previous postings on AB typing). Such anti O specific reagents were not available in the past (1971) and could prove useful in the confirmation and extension of the Lanciano typing results it would be important to demonstrate the specificity of the typing reagents that were used, i.e. Does a nonspecific antibody fail to react (negative control), and do the specific antibodies (anti A, anti B) demonstrate selective binding (positive control)..","date":"2013-03-12","mins":"8:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/10/old-video-ancient-secrets-of-the-bible-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Old Video: Ancient Secrets of the Bible – The Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-27211","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Pardon for the misspelling of Linoli appreciate the links; am familiar with the content was hoping for a reference where the data in the follow up studies could actually be viewed, especially regarding the materials & methods were the 1981 studies ever formally published?.","date":"2013-03-13","mins":"12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/10/old-video-ancient-secrets-of-the-bible-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Old Video: Ancient Secrets of the Bible – The Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-46361","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Matthias : Hugh I’ve never personally been convinced of the authenticity of ALL the bloodstains.

It’s just a hunch, without any scientific or historical basis, but I feel that some of the stains are authentic, and some are add ons. Is there evidence to suggest that all the bloodstains are of the same origin ? (ie. Belong to the same being) The typing studies done by B. Ballone included samples from the lower back & soles of the feet. Subsequent typing experiments reported by Garza Valdes involved samples from the left hand.

Everyone expresses 2 forms of the Rh gene, called alleles; they inherit one allele from each parent, which in the case of Rh, are positive (+) and negative ( ). The different forms are written in this format: 1st form/2nd form, with a / separating each form (allele). If you express at least one + allele, you are Rh positive (positive is dominant); to be Rh negative, you have to express 2 negative alleles, (negative is recessive). For Rh positive, the possibilities are +/+ and +/. For Rh negative, the possibilities are only /. If your parents were both Rh positive and you are Rh negative, that means your parents were both +/. They each carried the negative allele, but were themselves positive, because positive is dominant. The alleles segregate (separate) during reproduction & inheritance, so a +/ parent has an equal chance (50:50) of passing on a + or – allele to a child. For each child that is born, the odds are still 50:50. The possible offspring of a +/ father and and +/ mother are: +/+ (Rh positive), +/ (Rh positive), or / (Rh negative). When a Rh negative mother has a Rh positive child, her immune system will make antibodies to the Rh protein, because to her the Rh is foreign (her body doesn’t have it). This predominantly becomes an issue during subsequent pregnancies, because the mother’s immune system is now primed to respond against the Rh the alarm has been sounded. Typically, Rhogam is prescribed in such cases; Rhogam is a solution of anti Rh antibodies, they help to clear the Rh from the circulation, so the mother’s immune system doesn’t respond. A person’s blood type stays with them throughout life, the genes remain, which will result in production of new copies of the (same) protein. Unless a mutational event occurs or a person receives a bone marrow transplant (in which case new genes are introduced), a change in Rh expression should not occur. In pregnancy/delivery, certain mistypings may take place, perhaps this is the case here, and not a true change. Regarding the Shroud, although the blood type is sometimes reported as AB positive or AB negative, expression of the Rh factor remains unknown if interested, there are some additional posts on AB and the Rh factor related to the Shroud can find using search bar at top right..","date":"2013-03-02","mins":"8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"},{"id":"comment-26157","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Quick note: for the phrase “because the mother’s immune system is now primed to respond against the Rh the alarm has been sounded.”, this is a dash after Rh, not Rh negative :).","date":"2013-03-02","mins":"9:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"},{"id":"comment-50336","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"In this photo, Stenger has a partial beard (goatee), where does that lead us?
