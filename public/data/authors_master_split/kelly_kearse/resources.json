I believe they apply whether the science is rated excellent or poor in the judgement of others, including scientists within the appropriate discipline. I have read similar statements regarding Ray Roger’s publications and those of unrelated authors. Change the name, change the title, change the date: same thing. This type of situation, when it arises, typically applies to smaller, specialty journals with a relatively small impact factor rating (1.7 in this case). Why wouldn’t an editor publish (at times) in a journal that he or she was a part of? If this is a frequent or exclusive occurrence, it’s obviously a problem. But it’s by no means unheard of. Paolo Di Lazzaro points out the procedures that exist for such a scenario. Without knowing for certain otherwise, it is assumed such procedures were followed. Questioning the journals’s objectivity, the integrity of the reviewers, what do such insinuations imply? Intellectual dishonesty or bias in publication and/or reviewing? An inside job? Less than professional behavior on the part of the journal or it’s referees? There’s a fine line here.

Makes everyone know the reality and decide if they want to accept the paper or not. Failing to fully disclose makes it appear there’s something underhanded going on – not that it is, but appearances can be serious detractors. I think deciding for oneself whether a paper is acceptable or not should be based on the scientific merit of the results and discussion contained within it, not appearances. If appearances are such serious detractors, bias toward it has already been established, in essence what reviewers, journals are having insinuated towards them. There is no “failure” to fully disclose here and this is a completely separate issue from whether one considers the science to be lousy or not. “Failing to fully disclose” is a straw man, it’s in print, it’s a matter of record it’s not as though someone discovered a hidden file chock full of secrets. That this is in some way being kept under the table, and that the journal should attach a warning label at the top of the page. As Louis points out, no aliases were used; as the Santa Barbara reader notes, identical e mail addresses were given. Should Dan attach a clarifier each time he makes a comment in a thread to “fully disclose” that he is also the editor of the blog? It’s there, if you look for it. Similar charges have been made against the Rogers’ TA paper in the past, which many would argue is a harder form of science than the case being discussed here. Such insinuations of a “failure” imply a deliberate action, not a type of oversight (it is neither of these), and extend beyond just the involved authors.

Does it take an expert to deduce that if there was an earthquake of the magnitude suggested – then the collateral damage would have been equally as massive and this would have been recorded beyond the pages of the gospel. Certainly we need the folks with phd’s when we get into the nitty gritty areas. But for many of the more esoteric ideas merely vetting them on the internet is enough to find the holes. In that sense each of us is capable of ‘peer reviewing’ many of these ideas. For certain of these ideas, anyone capable of grasping the correct end of a toothbrush is more than capable or ‘peer review’ or evaluation. I agree. Where I mainly take issue is when it sounds as though all of the scientists who make their living at it, don’t really know what they are doing, and need to be straightened out by a “real expert”. This is especially the case in relation to STURP, that they couldn’t get anything right. The opposite is true they don’t get enough credit; their efforts are far too unappreciated much of what is discussed here daily wouldn’t be the case without their work. Repeatedly tossing the same issue(s) under the bus with discussion is not equivalent to hard, bench top science. That’s the point I was trying to make, if you want the science to get real, design a set of experiments to support/disprove your points, expand on your own ideas rather than mere (repeated) finger pointing. “Into the nitty gritty”…jumped so high, jumped so high…folks with Ph Ds the NGDB, has a certain ring to it.","date":"2014-02-16","mins":"5:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/16/the-shroud-of-turin-story-brings-up-all-the-usual-issues-about-click-bait-journalism/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Shroud of Turin story brings up all the usual issues about click-bait journalism"},{"id":"comment-80036","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh Farey : Yes.

The arguments about the DSS and JTB are anecdotal. Far too many unknown variables here, only takes one or two to add a potential monkey wrench into such a comparison. Scientifically, you would have to split the artifacts into at least two, place them in & outside of caves, in & out of the quake zone, and compare after the big one hit. There’s also the matter of variable distance(s) from radiation source, quake shake, etc. In any type of comparison. Too many unknowns, too many variables it’s reasonable, yes, but its strength ends there if you want to call it scientific (with a capitol S). Just my thoughts, they’re rhetorical, no need to answer.

However I was never a professional researcher and have never published anything in a science journal. Being a teacher of general science for 40 years has given me an interest in, and a certain experience of, just about every aspect of the subject, and since I took my degree in the old days of the Open University, when it took six years, I could pick and choose any topics I found interesting, including Geology, Oceanography, Physiological Psychology, Evolution, Ecology and various more general ones like Biology, Technology and Organic Chemistry. My final year was spent on biological statistics! I’ve also taught History and have a passion for emphasising primary sources – I think that may be part of my scientific make up as well. I have, I think, practically all the STURP papers, and, which appears almost unheard of, I’ve read them. There are some surprising errors (Bill Mottern’s X ray team thought the Holland backing cloth was made of cotton, for example), but on the whole they are a model of scientific diffidence, and clearly say where their conclusions were tentative and where further investigation should be encouraged.

I think that a rather disturbing proportion of accepted wisdom, even accepted scientific wisdom, let alone esoteric speculation, and not just about the Shroud, is based on insufficiently scrutinised research, which only when it is brought out into the light of the internet, can be properly assessed in detail. But in whom does one trust? “Properly assessed” by whom? The internet is full of “experts”, loaded with them Macgyvers in lab coats, “experts” in all scientific disciplines how often in such cases do you hear someone simply say, “I don’t know”. I’m sorry, but being able to use scientific vocabulary does not make one a scientist. There’s more to it than that. If such comments are perceived as somewhat arrogant flip the coin over how does it work on the reverse side when others decide to “properly assess” a topic, even though their personal experience may be limited to nonexistent? Hear this from the scientific side and see how it rings. An advanced degree is not necessary to make an intelligent, worthwhile, important point(s). That is not what I’m saying. But the “scientific community” to whom you refer is going to respect one thing: Data driven discussion. Period.

Experts! But actually I don’t refer to a ‘scientific community,’ because I don’t think there is one. I sometimes refer to ‘scientific consensus,’ but even there we must be careful. “Most scientists think…..” is often a very subjective judgement based on ones own research partners and a quick flick through Google. This is where a forum like this is so important. A senior academic and Editor in Chief of a respected journal might well be regarded as an expert, while a middle school science teacher might not. However, if the science teacher can demonstrate the invalidity of the academic’s work, then the tables turn. Real experts, in this context, are essentially compendia of experiences and resources, which they can use to demonstrate the value of their opinion. If they don’t do that, but rely on their authority alone, then their opinion is no more valid than anybody else’s. You’re right that “properly assessed” was rather an imprecise term. “Universally assessed” might have been better. Some will go for the “he’s a famous scientist so he must be right” angle, some for the “he disagrees with me so he must be wrong” angle (both held by several commenters here), and a few who will look more carefully at the data and references. Eventually, I trust, the truth will out. “Properly”, ah yes that was the kicker… Being a famous or a respected scientist carries a certain amount of clout for certain, but if the data sucks, it sucks. Typically one’s competitors will make sure everyone is aware of this and will come bearing elephant guns.

I’ve read that there is some debate as to whether the clots were wet/gel like when they first touched the cloth and/or if the clots were disturbed (by washing the body), causing them to be freshly opened, allowing blood to seep out for a more defined imprint. I believe the window is somewhere within a 2 hour time frame Lavoie’s work, if I recall correctly. 2. I’m not so sure you can go from the imprints of the cloth to a collapse. I would think there would be some sticking if the cloth was simply removed from the body, and some tearing away or distortion of the wounds. Their regular outline would suggest something different is involved here, but I don’t really know how far you could take it. 3. I haven’t noticed that type of condition on the Sudarium, interesting idea. With the issuing forth of edema fluid from the mouth & nostrils & also contribution of perspiration, it might dampen the cloth so that not much sticking might occur difficult to say interesting thought.

Though I’d like to see some forensics experts support the conclusions mentioned in the post. I would like to add a few comments, though I am not a forensic expert. I do not consider myself a “blood expert” or a “DNA expert”, either. I do have a working knowledge and professional experience with the methodology and scientific principles. I have also taught the subjects at the graduate, medical, undergraduate, and high school levels. I think the word “expert” is way overused. It implies a certain infallibility that I, myself, am not comfortable with. That being said, I think I have something to add relevant to the topic that may be beneficial (or not). If truly interested in the subject, I would recommend independent validation from multiple sources. Interesting that the premise that real blood exists on the Tunic isn’t protested with a similar vigor as that on the Shroud. Even though AB is the most infrequent blood type in the population and percentage variations exist among certain ethnic groups, having the same blood type is only suggestive evidence, at best. These results are consistent with the idea that the blood on the two objects could have come from the same individual, but that’s as far as it goes (or that the collagen binder could come from the same animal, if you want to go really far). Typing tests are most conclusive at ruling out the relationship between two objects (i.e., when both show different blood types), than ruling them in. The most effective test(s) that could be done to determine the relationship between these two objects is DNA analysis (nuclear and/or mitochondrial). This is the most conclusive set of experiments that would help include or exclude that the blood on the two objects is from the same individual. Finally, it is often mentioned that the DNA on the Shroud is degraded; true, but it is also relevant that portions of 3 genes were cloned and sequenced: a subunit of hemoglobin, and genes located on X & Y chromosomes. It’s been concluded from these studies that the blood is that of a human male. However, it’s not as though portions of these 3 genes might exist and everything else is wasted. It could be, but there is no reason to think that portions/segments of certain other genes or noncoding sequences might similarly exist. These 3 particular genes were able to be analyzed because they were targeted with specific probes that allowed them to be selectively amplified and examined. This is similar to using a large magnet to pull certain needles out of a haystack. Or, if possible, to apply a word search engine to a pile of shredded documents and asking it to find certain key phrases; many other things may be in there, they are just not the object of that particular analysis. Even with a small percentage of the entire genome remaining intact, who knows? If additional, more sophisticated DNA testing could reveal useful information is an if. Contamination could be a issue it might be possible to selectively minimize it. DNA degradation could be a roadblock for certain nuclear genes, because of its relatively higher abundance, analysis of mitochondrial DNA might prove more useful this was introduced into the US legal system in 1985.

Only 5 % (1 in 20)of human population has blood type as AB. Nevertheless, it was found on FOUR alleged relics of Christ!!! 1. Shroud of Turin 2. Sudarium of Oviedo 3. Tunic of Argenteuil 4. Eucharistic Miracle of Lanciano. Assume all four are nothing but medieval forgeries. What are the chances that such coincidence would have come purely by chance? I discussed this in my article: http://ok.apologetyka.info/racjonalista/w potrzasku bredni prawdy i poprawdy na temat poplamionych krwia relikwii pasyjnych,432.htm First I considered: what are the odds that all the relics would have the same blood type (no matter which) by a pure chance? The distribution of blood types is as follow: 0 type 44 % A type 35% B type 16 % AB type 5 % So the odds that by pure chance, all the relics would have the same blood type (no matter which) are like 4:73 But next step is that we determined on one of these relics blood type as AB (chronologically it was first on Lanciano, but it doesn’t matter). So next question arises: what are the odds that on the 3 other relics the blood type is AB? The answer is obviously: 1:8000 All the relics have the same blood type and the rarest in the whole human population! I do see the point scientifically though it is still only suggestive at best. It does not show it is from the same person. I am unsure about the results from Lanciano based on the results I’ve seen. Some, including Zugibe have raised doubts regarding the AB blood type because of contamination by bacteria, fungi, etc. Such antigens are shared by those organisms I have addressed this in my previous articles. When discussing the blood type on the Shroud, I am always careful to say it is type AB as determined by forward typing methods. In a blood bank, a transfusion is only performed if the blood type can be cross checked by an alternative complementary method (typically reverse typing). In the case of AB, particularly with older blood, this is somewhat of a catch 22 see previous articles). Molecular (genetic) testing can circumvent such issues, provided sufficient DNA is intact at that region to evaluate. I am familar with percentages of frequency of expression, even if the answer was 1:80,000 if 4 items were brought into a courtroom, which were thought to be linked to the same person, and all showed type AB blood, would this prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the same person?

Look at this from the other side, could the forgers (who of course knew nothing about blood types) be so lucky? Those are not some cloths found somewhere on the dump. Those are items, which are claimed to contain a blood of a certain person, that is Jesus.And this assertion may be right, or may be wrong. I agree, from the other side, lady luck would have to smile pretty broadly…but, scientifically, it still falls under circumstantial. I am pretty comfortable accepting the typing results on the Shroud studies because of the inclusion of specific and nonspecific controls, and the use of both polyclonal & monoclonal antibodies, in different studies. In the Miracle of Lanciano results I have seen, there is only the presentation of reactivity with anti A and anti B antiserum, no control data is presented. Which specific controls to include are not always intuitively obvious to those who don’t work with antibodies on a regular basis. I remember as a young graduate student getting very excited about isolating several proteins based on their reactivity with specific antibodies. The label on the tube said the antibody was specific for them, so I had no reason to question it. When I went back and ran several irrelevant, unrelated antibodies, I saw exactly the same pattern. So much for specificity in those particular experiments. I have reviewed numerous papers over the years where the controls on specificity were assumed, but not proven. In immunology, it’s a must. From the other side, Zugibe might have argued that the presence of AB antigens on all of these relics was really due to contamination by other organisms. (He mentioned this in his book). These carbohydrates are not unique to red blood cells but are expressed in other microorganisms. I don’t think this is the case for the Shroud because adjacent white fibers are non reactive with anti A and anti B. Shroud fibers have also been examined with anti O reagents and shown to be negative. (The O antigens are the branch from which the A and B are assembled if simple contamination, I would think there might be reactivity here as well). I don’t know if the typing on the other relics is as thorough. I would like to see the actual data. If it were totally air tight, I would still be at the same place: certainly consistent with, but I don’t think you can definitely conclude anything unless the blood types are different..","date":"2013-11-07","mins":"6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-50357","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"O.K. : Kelly Kearse : Thanks are they are specific details as to which markers and if multiple forms (>2 for each gene) were present?

Besides this, traces of urea–a constituent element of perspiration–were found among the many groups of red blood cells. According to Lucotte, this points to a rare condition, known as hematidrosis, in which one sweats blood. The source of this condition is an extreme level of stress, which causes the organism to go into histaminic shock. The American anatomic pathologist Dr. Frederick Zugibe, who is familiar with this phenomenon, claims that it is brought on most often in the face of unavoidable death. This is another indicator that the tunic’s owner could have been Christ.

Thanks very much for providing the scans. The DNA analysis is looking at expression of STR (short tandem repeat) sequences, most of which are found in noncoding regions of chromosomes that show high variation among the population. The FBI in the US utilizes a panel of 13 of these markers (plus the amelogenin genes for X & Y chromosomes) as part of their standard DNA analysis. It would be interesting to see sampling from several sites (on the Tunic) and compare the profile this would speak to the heterogeneity that may or may not be present. (I’ve gone on before about the limitations of proving the DNA truly originates from blood cells from analyzing non blood cell specific gene sequences, I’ll refrain). This data shows there is human DNA on the Tunic. For the Shroud, the claim is often made there is blood from a human male that is present. Yet, at the same time, it is said the DNA is so degraded that it really can’t tell us much. I don’t think you can have it both ways. If the DNA is so degraded, where are such signals coming from, contaminating DNA, if that’s true, then… If some sequences are obtainable, perhaps others are as well.

See Ray Rogers’ FAQ: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers5faqs.pdf The question two: 2) How do you know that there is real blood on the Shroud? Rogers wrote: Several claims have been made that the blood has b een found to be type AB, and claims have been made about DNA testing. We sent blood flecks to the laboratory devoted to the study of ancient blood at the State University of New York. None of these claims could be confirmed. […] It is almost certain that the blood spots are blood, but no definitive statements can be made about its nature or provenience, i.e., whether it is male and from the Near East. And further about aloe and myrrh: Biblical accounts suggested several types of compounds that might have appeared on the cloth (e.g., aloes, myrrh, sebaceous secretions, etc.). We planned and executed chemical analytical methods that could detect them in 1978. Those methods were extremely sensitive, but they did not detect squalene or myrrh. These results could have been confirmed by additional tests on the Shroud, but the “restoration” has totally changed the Shroud’s surface. May I ask: was Rogers even aware about Baima Bollone’s existence? And what about insinuations in the style of: A suspicious person might wonder whether the “restoration” was rushed through to prevent ethical work on confirming both chemical and pollen observations. (still from Rogers’ FAQ). No low blows, really? Such arguments are repeated in one place of the Barrie’s nterview with Górny and I find them distasteful. I don’t really see a problem with any of that, but that’s within the realm of opinion. Maybe there should have been a cage match. The aloe & myrrh bit I have written about before; two different techniques were used, unless the same section of cloth was divided in half & evaluated, who knows? Maybe. Maybe not. Regarding the multiple use of the word “claim”, I don’t pretend to speak for anyone else, but this may refer to the fact that neither the typing studies nor any DNA results (as far as I am aware) have ever been published in a formal, peer reviewed journal. This is a difference between much of STURP’s findings and those in discussion. One could argue that STURP’s findings were more mainstream in the scientific community.

STURP reported a frosty appearance to the surface of the the Shroud, found large quantities of calcium carbonate which is to this day used in making gesso. So we have good circumstantial evidence of an original gesso. A further close up examination is needed.” “Large quantities of calcium carbonate” Is there a value given for what large is concerning the calcium carbonate in STURP’s their analysis, exactly which reference(s) contain this? In the 1980 paper by Morris, Schwalbe, and London, in X ray spectrometry, measurements for calcium, iron, and strontium are shown. They comment “both calcium and strontium are relatively common elements. For instance we might expect considerable quantities of airborne Ca CO3 [calcium carbonate] from the rich marble and limestone regions of northern Italy…Although other explanations are possible, the uniform calcium and strontium distributions might be explained simply as dust accumulations.” Are they other references from STURP that specifically designate large (any) values of calcium carbonate or is this restricted to calcium? Are the STURP findings/conclusions specifically linked to calcium carbonate or just calcium? (see below) In Adler’s “orphaned manuscript”, Chemical and physical aspects of the Sindonic images, published in 2000, it says “All the types of Shroud fibers gave positive tests for only two elements, calcium and iron. However, these elements do not derive from the presence of iron oxides or calcium carbonates in the fibers…” Relatedly, In Heller and Adler’s 1981 paper, in Canadian Society of Forensics Science Journal, in discussing the process of converting flax to linen, retting, it says, “During this process the natural ion exchange properties of cellulose operate and two ions found commonly in natural waters that most strongly bind in this way are Ca and Fe, with the former being more strongly bound, as reflected in the relative concentrations seen in the X ray and present studies.” Ions reflect free calcium (Ca2+) which could be totally unrelated to the presence of calcium carbonate. In their studies, similar elevated levels of Fe and Ca were reported for older (Spanish, Coptic, and Pharaonic) linens as well If the high calcium levels are due to gesso, why is the accompanying protein signal lacking? A valid theory cannot simply discard what does not conveniently agree. This results is an unbalanced view.

Cellulose is not an ion exchanger, having no electrically charged groups. Its use as a chromatography solid support depends on physical adsorption, not ion exchange. As put to Charles late last year (no reply!) the association between linen and calcium probably depends mainly on the pectin content (negative uronic acid derived anions) and that is weakened as a result of retting, given the latter results in extensive microbial digestion of the middle lamellar pectins. Charles is simply not entitled to equate calcium with calcium carbonate unless he can supply HARD evidence to back up that view. I personally doubt that evidence exists, or will ever be found.” Okay, missed it/didn’t catch it no reply, eh? We’ll see if anything surfaces this go round My understanding is that hydroxyl groups (on cellulose) can ionize, although typically very unstable; of course, enhanced under alkali conditions.

He himself had come across 300,000 year old blood of a similarly vivid colour, it always being the circumstances of the deceased’s death, rather than anything to do with the sample’s age, that is responsible for this.” Also on pg. 235, “Quite aside from Dr. Alan Adler’s argument, we have heard ancient blood specialist Dr. Thomas Loy confirm that blood many thousands of years old can remain bright red in certain cases of traumatic death” I tried to contact Dr. Loy several years ago to follow up on this and learned that he was deceased. David Mo mentions outdated scientific methods (hence we shouldn’t believe any such results in the “modern age”, some thirty years later). Exactly which specific scientific methods are no longer warranted/useful? The blood color question is an interesting one. As you know, various explanations have been put forth: bilirubin, CO, saponaria, paint, etc. Totally my own opinion, but I don’t believe the answer lies (solely) in any of the above. Regarding bilirubin, it’s quite unstable I would like to see more evidence for this, particularly quantitative in the Adler studies it is essentially qualitative. I am similarly uncertain about saponaria fine if its hemolytic, but once the cells are lysed, what prevents the hemoglobin from oxidizing to a brownish/blackish color over time? Is there any evidence that the Shroud contains a saponaria coating? The carbon monoxide hypothesis, originally proposed by Baima Bollone is problematic in that it is expected CO would exchange out with oxygen over time. The spectral data from the Shroud studies is not in agreement with the CO bound form of hemoglobin. For anyone seriously interested in the question of blood color and the Shroud, I would recommend looking at the 2014 article by van der Hoeven it offers an alternative consideration from the cloth side of things it’s not for the faint of heart, over 200 pages, several inches thick. I’ve read it through once, but want to go back through and reread it more carefully. The paper contains some original experimentation, which is thoroughly explained. In my opinion, when the blood problem is considered, the possibility that more than one factor could be at play has to be taken into account. Regarding other additional experimentation for some of things you mentioned , Goldini reported that normal blood (with non elevated bilirubin levels) turned red following exposure to uv light. How long this remains (over time) is unclear.

What I have provided is a mass of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Shroud was sealed ( e.g. The image is one the outer fibrils only) as is typical of medieval painted linens (see my other posting),with the pigments now decayed, leaving only the shadowy images ( compare the images on the Zittau veil). The decay of the images is symbolised by the contrast between the enormous crowds able to see the images in the seventeenth century and the close up viewing needed today. As you may know one of my points is that we should be asking what the images were when the Shroud was originally created, not what they are now – this is the biggest wild goose chase of them all. We need to shift the whole focus of Shroud research and work on the depictions and descriptions from earlier times as one would normally with any artefact of this nature. (Why is the Shroud outside the normal approach to ancient objects?) Part of the circumstantial evidence is the examination of the Heller Adler papers by a professor of physiology who is not convinced by them and thinks that some of the findings are compatible with animal proteins ( this was his unprompted suggestion) and this would provide some evidence for a typical gesso mix. The professor has offered to pass everything on to a top haematologist but I have not taken this up. I will if there continues to be a challenge. As my posting on the Zittau veil showed there were many different ways of sizing (sealing) a linen cloth but the way in which the images are on the outer fibrils only are compatible with such a sizing and there are lots of other examples, now tested, that could be examined as a comparison with the Shroud. Calcium carbonate or sulphate is an ingredient of such sizing to this very day. So we need to broaden out research by looking at comparative examples it irks me when people say that the Shroud is unique and then i discover that they have never studied anything about medieval painted linens (as STURP openly admitted they had not!!). The Shroud may or may not be a medieval painted linen but it has many features that suggest that it is one whose images have decayed and to dismiss these out of hand is not serious scholarship. It is the most likely hypothesis for the images and it remains number one until someone provides something better so it is over to those who can provide a coherent alternative.” “A mass of circumstantial evidence” Sure you have. What you have failed to provide, though, is support for your multiple statements that “large amounts of calcium carbonate were found by STURP”. This is an important point.. You are making a key claim that is not valid. Moreover, a reference from the same group (STURP) directly states the calcium signal is not from calcium carbonate. Control older linens used by the STURP investigators (Spanish, Coptic, and Pharonic), also showed high levels of calcium. Were these gessoed as well? I think STURP considered that the Shroud may be a painting much more than you let on. But that’s neither here nor there. It’s not my job to convince you of any of this. “If there continues to be a challenge” [regarding the blood]. I would ask as many people as I could. I do. Some I know, some I don’t. I’ve e mailed/called on the phone/talked in person to numerous scientists/clinical specialists to get their professional opinion. Some say yes. Some say no. Some say maybe. Consider asking chemists, biochemists, immunologists, cell biologists, molecular biologists, forensic scientists, and medical doctors. Include the other studies as well (esp. Baima Bollone), it’s part of the story, though it’s up to you. A lot of the blood characteristics/science interest me apart from the Shroud I ask as many people as I can about lot of things, for example how old is the AB blood type? This is a very interesting question, irrespective of anything to do with the Shroud.I like to ask. I like to learn.

If it’s unequivocally shown to be human blood to any & all experts by all known modern space age tests, then that will take us to the next phase, which is it had to have been blood that was painted on… The studies of Baima Bollone are markedly absent in this series of statements, it’s always Heller & Adler. Garza Valdes reported certain blood characterization studies as well. Rogers did some experiments. Baima Bollone openly discusses the negative findings of the 1973 commission, he found similar results initially as well. We don’t hear much (none) about any of that, yet the 1973 has the spotlight shone on it. All of it needs to be considered..","date":"2015-01-14","mins":"8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"id":"comment-183367","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Typo: STURP found protein in 2.

If so, it was unintentional It may be just a matter of disciplines biochemistry:immunology My perspective (then and now) is one has to consider everything. It’s all important. I don’t believe one necessarily trumps the other. But one has to consider the collective results. I would be shocked if every box on the blood question could be perfectly checked, all black & white, no grey areas.This might raise the most suspicion for me it’s old no matter which way you cut it, 700 2,000 years. Degradation can be an issue, certainly. But components, for example immunoglobulin, ABO have been reported to survive over time, or at least fragments of them, enough to detect them using immunological methods If the result is negative, you don’t know, could be degradation or could never have been there to begin with. If on the other hand, the result is positive and the controls are sound, how does one explain the results? For me, this takes it past just paint, it takes it to at least primate. Yes, mineral salts are (also) important. I believe that if one considers the collective results on elemental analysis (STURP, Baima Bollone) as previously written with Thibault, the findings here are reasonable, potassium is not so much an issue. In the previous context, if a misunderstanding was there, it was the point that K+ alone cannot be looked at apart from the whole. (Nor can it be ignored, either, but I believe as written with TH data show that the potassium isn’t lacking). Whole blood, serum exudates, etc. In STL, I made the point that the most conservative (objective) scientific conclusion is that blood components are present. I distinguished this from the conclusion that blood is present. This is especially relevant to the issues of whole blood vs. Serum exudate that you mention. Yes, certainly a medieval forger would not have been aware of the mineral composition. I think the same goes for addition of serum rings and presence of other blood constituents. Perhaps a forger could have used real blood in his creation I think it would be difficult and would at minimum require the involvement of a body at some point as a template. But that’s another question/set of questions. Colin, I appreciate the effort and time you put forth in writing this. My apologies if there was a misunderstanding on my part. And Thank you for mentioning wanting to use an old fashioned technique….","date":"2015-01-15","mins":"6:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"id":"comment-34542","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Anyone know if/when this is set to be released on Dv D?.","date":"2013-05-23","mins":"8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/23/the-night-of-the-shroud-to-air-on-italian-television/","cat":"video","title":"The Night of the Shroud to Air on Italian Television"},{"id":"comment-28889","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"I happened to see Randy’s post at the right time and was able to watch all but the first minute or two I was pretty impressed at the clarity of the broadcast, even looking at the you tube clip here on the i Pad, it seems exceptionally clear.
