He belonged to the Worldwide Church of God when he was young, founded by Herbert W. Armstrong, whom I met once when listening to a talk he gave. The DNA tests did not exactly provide the results he claims, he ignored Pfann, Spigelman and Rollston. Of course, he also had to emphasise Feuerverger, Kilty and Elliott, providing statistics that have also been questioned. See the review of the book that was published after the Princeton Conference held in Jerusalem to discuss the so called Jesus family tomb: https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot   Part III I would like Dr. Kelly Kearse to comment on the DNA contamination.” My comments: I believe that this is in reference to one of the ossuary sites involved in “The Lost Tomb of Jesus” production in which it was claimed that because two individuals, a male & female, did not share the same mt DNA they were probably married. Take away the speculation & the sensationalism and the scientific data to directly support such a conclusion is lacking. It is difficult to know what the significance of “more surprises” in this follow up means how much scientific merit is involved as opposed to simply suggestiveness. Time will tell if any such studies make it to a first (or even second or even third) tier science journal. Regarding contamination, it’s always an issue with older DNA In the PLIOS 2009 article on the Tomb of the Shroud, samples were treated with UV irradiation to crosslink DNA on the surface of the artifact. Crosslinking helps to render such unwanted DNA unsuitable for subsequent amplification This is an accepted precautionary measure, although my understanding is that it may not be entirely foolproof, and that other issues can arise as well.","date":"2015-03-21","mins":"8:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/21/tabor-a-distinctive-1st-century-weave/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Tabor: A Distinctive 1st Century Weave"}]
