Go to the books first, for the time taken with comments over here is more than could be taken in reading the books. You will be in a better position to comment when this done. To give you an example, I have not seen anyone interested in making a serious study, for instance, of Greek philosophy, relying on commentaries, Internet material and blog comments before reading Plato and Aristotle. All the best. Thanks for the suggestion actually, I hope my ignorance is not too apparent here, but I’ve read most of the major Shroud books in discussion: Barbet, Wilson, Heller & Adler, Rogers, Adler’s Orphaned Manuscript, Zugibe, Marino, de Wesselow, Chase (has Heller & Adler interview @ back), Meachum, others – maybe I’ve missed some major points? I am always open to learning all that I can would welcome any particular titles/articles you think would be worth reading more closely. The commentaries, Internet material and blog comments are part of it, but I would consider the original articles (and certain books as well) the fundamental sources the blog simply provides an opportunity for ongoing exchange I believe think there is a big time value in discussing facts, observations that are not from Shroud literature but that can be applied to it that have been gained through reading/experience due to various backgrounds/career, etc. I’m sure it’s evident that often my position in commenting is rather free flowing, similar to thinking out loud I spent much of yesterday evening’s discussion typing on the ipad while enjoying a cigar out on my deck it was a particularly pleasantly cool evening. Right now I am typing on a laptop at an undisclosed location. Clearly, a serious study does involve more time in reading & reflection, yes I appreciate that. But, I also think such “brainstorming” and exchange is also valuable, it will often trigger thoughts (good or bad, I suppose) that may not occur otherwise. I do appreciate your point, and I think maybe you might also be saying use your time wisely read what will be of most benefit will keep this in mind All the Best to You as Well.","date":"2013-05-29","mins":"11:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35260","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Jesterof : Hugh Farey : Not bilirubin.

In the link provided by Louis (Faccini article), when I look at those images, which are a computerized processing of the TS image, they appear very brownish to me, as well, absolutely, though, to be honest, to my untrained eyes, it looks as though the contrast is dialed way up here, more than in some other photographs.

It kept me wondering how many of these you smoke every day, whether you are like Churchill or John Kennedy, but my guess is that you are like your countryman,the great statesman, when it comes to smoking. It is always good to also read some Shroud history and Wesselow has written a good book arguing why the image can not be a painting, exception taken when he comes to reconstructing New Testament history. Unfortunately the idea of the Shroud being one reason for the belief in Jesus’ resurrection circulating among the first disciples arose in the realm of Shroud studies and the art historian went even further by claiming that it was displayed in the Temple! It only demonstrates absolute ignorance about Jewish customs, particularly during that period, and you can sure that Josephus would have something to say about that and we would know that it was not only James the Just but many others were thrown down from that building’s high walls. It looks like Wesselow’s book helped choose the title of the recently launched book about the “linen god”.

I don’t know how stable carboxyhaemoglobin is, but at least it’s red. I’m sorry I can’t state that colour becomes “bright red.” May I assume that Goldoni et al. Couldn’t state it either, as my words are taken directly from their paper, and quoted by you in the post above this one. Here’s a comment from the previous Brother Hirudo thread I wrote in discussion with anoxie about carboxyhaemoglobin: “The CO:hemoglobin suggestion is from Baima Ballone (2001), The basis behind it is that since CO is a product of hemoglobin breakdown, and CO binds to hemoglobin with 200x the affinity as does oxygen, the CO remains bound to hemoglobin in the bloodstream, and hence the bloodstains. CO associated with hemoglobin maintains a red color this is one of the indicators of CO poisoning. CO containing blood can stay red for over a year if teh tube remains covered (see below comment) The spectra data of Adler suggests primarily methemoglobin (deoxygenated hemoglobin) although he does mention that other species may exist carboxyhemoglobin has a different absorbance than methemoglobin and doesn’t appear to be there to any major extent, although I am by no means very experienced with spectroscopy. Also, in communicating with those who study hemoglobin binding, they estimate that even though CO binding has a much higher affinity than oxygen, such blood would exchange out within a few days at the most when exposed to the atmosphere. Although not mentioned by Bollone, CO binding to the free heme group (separated from the hemoglobin polypeptide) has an affinity 20,000x greater than oxygen it is unknown by me (or several whom I have contacted) if this is superglued in or given in would exchange as well. I do not know, but believe it is not permanently affixed. There would also be the problem of just how many hemoglobin molecules/heme groups would have to be saturated to result in an overall reddish appearance of the blood relative to oxidized species. Just a thought. Related to this, I had also considered that a functional group on the cloth may interact with the porphyrin ring, a CO group, such as a carbonyl group, which are prevalent in carbohydrates (glycan coating as a result of Saponaria), but the structural biologists tell me the electron imprint would appear much different to the hemoglobin molecule than carbon monoxide. Just another thought. So, you’re right in asking why would there be significant CO associated with hemoglobin it was just one of the suggestions that was proposed (in 2001) to account for the color, originally by BB..","date":"2013-05-29","mins":"3:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35287","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Yannick Clément : Important message for Kelly Kearse: I hope you won’t miss my reply to you: https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an important and highly informative guest posting by paul maloney/#comment 35257 I think you will appreciate this answer from me… Yannick, Didn’t miss it.

Regarding female DNA & haploid: What is often omitted in discussions of “both male & female DNA being found on the Shroud” is that these were not the only gene segments evaluated in these studies. Four other, non sex related genes were included: tyrosine hydroxylase, FES, human coagulation factor VIII, & von Willebrand factor. (Sindon 8: 39 47, 1995). These additional genes were chosen because they are polymorphic, that is they show variation within the population not everyone will express the same form of these genes. This will allow you to tell if the DNA comes from one or multiple subjects. The DNA analysis of these targets, separate & distinct from those involving sex related genes, indicated that DNA from multiple individuals was present on the Shroud. Therefore, no conclusion can be made. Although DNA may be fragmented, certain information may be gained depending on the extent & sites of degradation. Paper documents fed through a shredder look pretty end stage, but if one is looking for a particular phrase or keywords, with enough sorting it might be found.

That is true, the step of doubling still has to be demonstrated and the exact area which is responsible for the loss of function is still to be found ( as postulate by the authors) but the possibility of a XX male without SRY gene is more valid than XXY, or any Y involvement. As I’ve said, those are just half serious speculations. I think the main problem is trying to apply the laws of (known) science to one of the mysteries of faith. From a theological standpoint, Y involvement would be the most valid why would God’s Son be anything but a normal, healthy male? To me, this just makes sense. How does this happen with a virgin birth? From a scientific standpoint I don’t know. This would fall in the realm of the miraculous but that’s God’s territory. That’s where faith would come in.

When I attended Dr. Alan Adler’s seminar, he specifically stated the blood was AB. The reason I remember that Jesus’ blood was negative is because my mother had AB+, and when Adler stated, AB , I immediately thought it was opposite to my mother’s blood, and that’s how I remembered the blood type of Jesus all these years. Adler stated it was AB negative. In conclusion, I would ask, when, since Adler’s seminar back in the mid 80s, was it determined the blood on the shroud was not AB ? Just wondering! Best, In a personal communication with Baima Bollone, through Emanuela Marinelli, he said the Rh factor (protein) was not able to be examined because it was too degraded.

I only wish to further echo, as Thibault again pointed out, that it is the collective data which must be considered. In my own opinion, as a general comment, I believe that objectivity can become clouded over to various degrees whenever data relative to the Shroud is presented. Take the Shroud out of it and consider the same (collective) data in the analysis of a toga or metal blade suspected to be 700 2,000 years old, containing what could possibly be bloodstains would the conclusion be the same or different? Would the age and/or condition of the sample be taken into consideration? And all of the collective data dismissed as invalid or inconclusive? Surely, of the numerous people doing numerous tests, some of them must have done some of them correctly. And as has been pointed out in the past, it wasn’t just if blood was present that was evaluated both sides of the coin were examined if it’s not blood, collective data considered, then what is it? This is just a rhetorical question, it is not meant for anyone specifically. To John, I have known Thibault (by correspondence) for several years since I first became interested in the blood aspects of the Shroud.

That is the species under comparison relative to Gilberts’ spectrum. There is no “convenient hypothesized distortion due to age” These are your words, not mine. Sustain your own opinion, but don’t twist mine by using petty words like “convenient”. I pointed this out in relation to a collective evaluation of the data, that it’s incorrect to expect a direct comparison with results one would obtain with relatively fresh blood. This is true no matter what aged object is in question that is being evaluated. It is irrelevant of the Shroud. Aztec knives, paleolithic stone tools were those cleaned in between kills? A one and done or was it a cumulative effect, blood drying upon blood? I think it’s a tough comparison too many variables, too many unknowns, too many differences. BB shows a photo of what may be a red blood cell from the Shroud in several of his books. It can also be seen on the Shroud i Pad app. I don’t know how many were in the magnification field or how many threads he had to look through to find it. I would like to see microscopy done in conjunction with a gold tagged antibody (or something similar) to show RBC specificity. And for more bloodstains to be evaluated. If the object in the photo was just a silica particle I would be okay with that. I’m not wanting to make a conclusion first, then working backwards to find things that support it. In all science, all experiments, all theories, there are grey areas. In my experience, when it’s all crystal clear, when everything stinks (all of the data is useless) or is in total, perfect harmony (the data is all perfect, absolutely perfect, nothing is even slightly off), look out: Objectivity has left the building. BTW, there is a huge difference between the Utzi the iceman and the Shroud. Red blood cells were taken from tissue of the iceman because there is a body to take it from, preserved in the ice. The Shroud contains only the image of a body, either real or intentionally fabricated. I think everyone has to form their own opinion of whether bloodstains are present or not. I would find it odd that everyone who has tested for this was biased or didn’t know what they were doing, or was inept at evaluating results. I believe the best conclusion is based on a consideration of the collective data.

I am not exactly sure, just my thoughts, would be best to verify elsewhere, but in the blood the potassium levels associated with the cellular fraction are substantially higher (around 100 fold?) than those with the liquid portion. The method you mentioned for whole blood would disrupt (release) the cellular portion, allowing everything (the total) to be effectively measured. In a bloodstain, as the blood dries any cells present will dehydrate and die. In speaking to a forensic scientist about this once, he explained it to me as similar to a flat tire having a slow leak and collapsing. The membrane is still “relatively” intact (i.e. Not blown to bits), which allows RB Cs to reseal & rehydrate during preparation for microscopy, resuming a somewhat normal morphology. I do not known if conventional SEM, as used by Dixon (or others) would necessarily detect potassium that may still remain within dried RB Cs in a bloodstain. This might contribute to the difference between a measurement of whole blood relative to a bloodstain. Or maybe much of it (potassium) would still be expected to leak out of the RB Cs as it collapses and dies during drying, I am not really sure.

In that book there are (Appendix A, Part 2, pages 114 115) some word about the presumed replacement of the blood smears by fungi and bacteria … Following Garza Valdes 95 per cent of the blood areas on the Shroud have been taken over by fungi and bacteria … and the small amount of blood still present continues to diminish with the time (and perhaps this question had to do with the safekeeping … in a new container). Garza Valdes indicated also the question about the iron oxide (haematite) in the fibres’ organic deposits as explained by the deposits of the chemolithotrophic bacteria. The same author wrote other words around the cyclic photophosphorylation and the anaerobic phototrops … I presume you read the book. What are your answers about these questions ? What was the influence on previous analyses from that story ? See also the question of the ratio Ca/K. I believe we have to repeat the controls using the nanotools … Am I wrong in my remark ? Yes, I’ve read the book. In my opinion, it is a big leap to go from analysis of a few fibers to “95 percent of the blood areas on the Shroud have been taken over and continue to diminish with time.” Certainly the Shroud is not pristine with a history of being stored under aseptic conditions, of course there will be bacteria present, but in my own opinion this is extrapolation/exaggeration. Again, my own opinion, but the “DNA of God” on the Shroud has yet to be demonstrated that it actually originated from a blood cell, and is not the result of contamination (by humans not bacteria!).

I am not trying to imply that the look of the stains is the same now as before. I think that would be a brave assumption also, if not a fallacious one. Allow me to drop the phrase “remain”, it’s ingrained in most of us that blood starts out red then becomes brown with time for the record, I received a pretty respectable gash replacing the burners on my grill this afternoon I will be monitoring it closely in the next few days. I just want to talk about it being red being red, right now or being red when the samples were obtained. The biochemical side in us (Colin, my degree is in immunology, but I did my first postdoc in the Biochem department at JHUSM), wants to look at the spectra, particularly that of hemoglobin, and try to make sense of the oxidation state(s) and conformation relative to the red color that we perceive. I was trying to make the point that the porphyrin is only part of what should be considered the contribution of other components/fluids as you yourself point out may/will be present, in addition to how the entire mix is perceived by the eye, when soaked into the “background” of a sepia whitish off whitish cloth. That the blood appears red because of a combination of contributions at several levels maybe that has been part of the struggle in trying to “reconcile” the color issue, too much reliance on the porphyrin state in accounting solely/primarily for the color. With fresh, whole blood the porphyrin state is the sole context that we are accustomed to with a bloodstain, that may be of different composition due to the physiological factors you mentioned, and the textile component, we should not limit our reasoning to just consideration of the heme group as the (only) basis.

[“It’s a madhouse! A madhouse!” astronaut Taylor POTA.] Here is a quote from Dr. Alan Adler’s lecture given at the Dept. Anatomy, University of Hong Kong, Shroud Symposia, 1986 this is a good summary of the perspective. “When we examined the blood areas on the Shroud at 30x magnification, it certainly had all of the normal characteristics of a blood stain. Blood is of course a mixture of chemicals, and what one sees on the Shroud at 30x is certainly a mixture, it shows capillarity ( that is it goes through the whole cloth) and it shows cementation. It all looks perfectly acceptable for blood except for one thing it is too red for blood that is supposed to be some 600 to 2000 years old. Everyone knows that blood changes color when exposed to air; it changes to a methemoglobin which gives it a brown color.

Perhaps a little more patient with your explanation, if possible, I am not that sure what is meant by “no coagulation at all” This appears to be at odds with the general conclusion that the majority of the bloodstains represents transfer of dried clotted blood. There’s Also from #9, “My comment on hydroxiproline is in sync with the first one here( in Spanish) – to assume that human body does not have elevated levels after strenous muscle activity ( try to carry a heavy object in scorching sun, uphill and dehydrated and then talk about traces) is to purposefully omit the obvious pathology of the case.” I did translate escipion’s original comment, I got that one, I was just noting the references referred to detection of hydroxyproline in muscle & lungs, not serum. From the #9, follow up comment, I take it to mean that you are saying that, of course there would be elevated levels of hydroxyproline in the serum of someone that had undergone the events described in the gospel narratives, i.e. Jesus? Is that correct or did I misconstrue your meaning? Also, if the sample were from a bloodstain of a non tortured individual, would the baseline levels of hydroxyproline in the blood be sufficient to detect by such methods? #11, I will briefly explain, but it might be best to hear from others as well the point has been raised that the bloodstains look too much like fresh blood, they appear redder than what is typically observed for aged, dried blood that has undergone oxidation. This was one of the first issues that caused many to suspect they might have been painted on.

What would be most helpful, for me (and perhaps others), is for you to comment on the specific peaks present in Adler’s spectra, pointing out the identity of which peaks could be confidently identified as particular species, and which peaks are anomalies (atypical). For the atypical peaks, what could they possibly represent? Treat it as a road map, start on the left of x axis and work through the wavelength. Additionally, it would be helpful, if you are willing, to comment on what your expected spectral profile would look like what you would expect the results to be in centuries old blood. #124, bile pigment could not possibly survive for centuries with intermittent exposure to light, being photosensitive would you expect trace amounts of bilirubin to survive?

I’m just talking about the report that uv treatment can result in the persistence of red color in bloodstains relative to those that are untreated. I find this interesting, on its own, apart from any connection to the Shroud. UV treatment of blood is reported to be a (not well) understood therapy to “boost the immune system” it may have an effect just because of the succeptibility of bacteria & viruses to such treatment, similar to treating water in a laboratory setting with uv exposure. Some have wondered about other (deleterious) side effects where blood is concerned, what else might be affected. A color change, if true, would indicate that the blood components themselves may have been altered. The uv hypothesis didn’t originate with me I included it because I try to give fair audience to all suggestions that have been made. Not to violate the Way of Brother Hirudo, but such constant preaching about what being a “good honest scientist” is all about becomes rather stale. There have also been suggestions from (more earlier writings) that the color of the bloodstains may vary according to the light source, artificial lighting versus out of doors. That could be an interesting question to consider, how might the type of light used influence the perception of the bloodstain color for those that have not observed the Shroud up close, in person, our perception is based on different photographic representations could this be a variable or is it insignificant?

No super rush will be away for the next couple of days, but wanted to hear your comments. 1. It has been reported that (fresh) whole blood applied to Saponaria treated cloth retains a red color, whereas that applied to similar cloth that has not been treated changes from red to brown. The red color on the Sap treated cloth has been reported to persist for 25+ years. In general, even apart from possibles implications related to the Shroud, any thoughts on the molecular basis for the persistence of the red color with Sap treatment? I can understand that Sap is hemolytic and permeabilizes RB Cs, releasing hemoglobin, but why would such hemoglobin not undergo typical oxidation (as indicated from the typical red > brown color change). Could the porphyrin ring be stabilized through an interaction with the (treated) cloth? Or are the differences between the reported colors both within the range of variation, is it oversimplified to base this on visual appearance alone? 2. The side wound in your view, would the fluid that appears to be mixed with the blood in this bloodstain represent released pleural fluid that has built up in the lungs or fluid from the piercing of the pericardial sac or both? Also, what is the main basis for this being classified as a post mortem wound from the appearance of the bloodstains alone is it the blood flow pattern or the fact that just not that much blood flows, indicating that the heart was not pumping at the time the wound was made? Related to the latter, if the wound had been made pre mortem, and then much of the blood wiped away after the person had died, and the blood that you see resulting from post mortem seepage from the wound, would you be able to distinguish this from a post mortem wound, with no wiping away of blood? 3. It has been suggested from viewing the negative images that the man on the Shroud exhibits an extended chest and a distended abdomen, consistent with respiratory distress, difficulty in breathing in your view, is this consistent with the appearance from the negatives, and physiologically does this make sense?

It is not my place to comment on whether or not I am a good scientist, to paraphrase Groucho Marx, “I wouldn’t even think of joining a club that would even consider having me as a member”. I just try to maintain an objective approach and keep my mind open to the ideas of others. Not directed specifically at you, but it does bother me to see certain scientists “attacked” or “semi attacked”, I view as more as disrespected, because they are accused of being religiously biased the irony is, without their efforts it is unclear that the concerted effort to scientifically examine the Shroud would have begun (and continued) in the first place. But anyway, back to our own discussion, I do value your opinion. I might suggest that you try not to be so threatened by any mention of the R word. It’s the Shroud, I think it goes with the territory. If the science is bogus and strictly made to fit, agenda driven, I believe this will be sorted out. Alternatively, there is the bushwhack method, to head it off before it starts. A final comment, consideration of an idea should not automatically be viewed as acceptance. For example, if one believes that the red coloration of the bloodstains is due to some energetic resurrection event, involving some form of let’s say, uv, is it possible that the blood color might exhibit a type of gradient effect, the surfaces of the fibers on the body side of the cloth more red than those on the reverse side of the cloth? Comparing the bloodstains on one side versus the other side, photo’d during the restoration, they don’t appear that different in terms of tone to me, although a spectrophotometric (mechanical) measurement is more objective (scientific). One could argue that the energetic effect permeates (saturates) I suppose, but I think it’s reasonable that distance might attenuate the effect. If bilirubin, Saponaria, CO, etc. One might expect the color to be unchanged on one side versus the other. Which also raises the point about this being blood attached to a cloth different sides different histories , could this itself function as a variable in the coloration?.","date":"2013-04-04","mins":"6:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"id":"comment-30548","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Jesterof, Hugh Thank you for your comments on my recent Q.

Whanger23, Frederick Zugibe24 find at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/docslist.pdf B52) The maintenance of the red bright color of the TS blood with time was observed, but the explanation of why the color is so red is not definitive (Brillante 2002) 2. From N. Svensson’s (MD) 2012 article, “Medical and forensic aspects of the Man depicted on the Shroud”, pg 4 “It is well known, that blood darkens from red to black in few days due to oxidation process. Shroud researchers have long wondered why the TSM blood is still red bearing in mind the TS assumed age of 2000 years” 3. Zugibe, chief medical examiner of Rockland County, NY (1969 2003) discusses the color of the blood in his book on pg. 216. “A question often asked is why are the blood areas that are incarnadine in color like that of fresh blood rather than a reddish brown color of old blood?” He then goes on to mention Saponaria, Adler’s hemolysis (bilirubin), and that others have suggested the effect of bacterial action. Adler was not a pathologist, but a bench scientist, porphyrin specialist, who discusses the red color of blood in many of his writings. Zugibe and Adler were contemporaries I have never read where Zugibe challenged that the red color was ordinary, normal the above would seem the place to mention it. He is also a co author (#24) on the above paper. 4. I am unable to find mention of Bucklin discussing the color his analyses may have been restricted to more anatomical details I stand corrected on that, although others may have heard him discuss the blood coloration I am relatively new in the Shroud crowd, particularly in regard to when regular symposia where held. 5. Pierluigi Baima Bollone is an Italian pathologist who has examined the Shroud in person and was involved in the studies beginning in the late 70s commented that the “stains that surely are bloodstains stand out on the monochrome background of the towel for their carmine color”. He postulated that the existence of a very high amount of bilirubin in the Shroud’s bloodstains could explain the red bright color of the bloodstains, even if this colour is not directly due to the bilirubin. He suggested that CO binding to hemoglobin, produced during the breakdown of hemoglobin to bilirubin, may be responsible for the red bright color. 6. In a different type of reference, apart from the Shroud crowd, Dr. Bill Bass, co author of the book “The Inquisitor’s Key” a historical fiction novel involving the Shroud of Turin, writes on the opening pages of Chapter 14, “…the so called bloodstains. That would explain why those are bright red”…”Since when is dried blood cherry red? Every death scene I see, dried blood’s almost black. Right”. As mentioned the book is a fictional work, but this is mentioned in interviews to publicize the book as one of the criticisms Dr Bass is the creator of the world renowned Body Farm and is recognized as an international expert in forensic science and anthropology. 7. I know that the red color of the blood was a major obstacle for Barrie Schwortz, the documenting photographer of the STURP team he often mentions this in interviews, stating that it took around 18 years for him to this issue to be resolved for his own satisfaction he could probably relate conversations with individuals, including Dr. Bucklin, better than anyone, certainly much more so than me. 8. I do not know if the idea was voiced originally by Barbet & Vignon, I did a quick scan through their books, but didn’t see specific mention of reference to an unusual coloring, although I might have overlooked this. A few closing remarks, when I first looked at the bloodstains, to me, they appeared much redder than typical dried blood, just in my own, everyday typical experience I worked with a lot of mice in the laboratory, and a certain number of rabbits, and even a few rats, but was more interested in what was in the blood, rather than examining the discarded material. Thank you again for input. When I first became interested in the question I searched the internet for pictures of old, dried blood, JFK, Lincoln, Mayan artifacts, most anything I could find most looked brownish to me I also e mailed numerous forensic scientists/pathologists asking for any comments they may have a number did not respond, perhaps they were busy, perhaps it was the Shroud effect (although I never mentioned this was the particular situation it is not difficult to guess with a quick internet search). On the other hand, I have received a number of helpful replies, particularly in relation to hemoglobin chemistry, (de)oxygenation bilirubin levels in blood, etc., but you are the first to directly address that the coloration of bloodstains may not be that out of the ordinary. Yannick, if you’re reading this, I haven’t (as of today) written any pastors or priests for their input :) I haven’t looked at the bloodstained reference you linked, but I will be interested in doing so.

For hundred years atmosphere surrounding the shroud is almost CO free. Anoxie, The CO:hemoglobin suggestion is from Baima Ballone (2001), The basis behind it is that since CO is a product of hemoglobin breakdown, and CO binds to hemoglobin with 200x the affinity as does oxygen, the CO remains bound to hemoglobin in the bloodstream, and hence the bloodstains. CO associated with hemoglobin maintains a red color this is one of the indicators of CO poisoning. CO containing blood can stay red for over a year if teh tube remains covered (see below comment) The spectra data of Adler suggests primarily methemoglobin (deoxygenated hemoglobin) although he does mention that other species may exist carboxyhemoglobin has a different absorbance than methemoglobin and doesn’t appear to be there to any major extent, although I am by no means very experienced with spectroscopy. Also, in communicating with those who study hemoglobin binding, they estimate that even though CO binding has a much higher affinity than oxygen, such blood would exchange out within a few days at the most when exposed to the atmosphere. Although not mentioned by Bollone, CO binding to the free heme group (separated from the hemoglobin polypeptide) has an affinity 20,000x greater than oxygen it is unknown by me (or several whom I have contacted) if this is superglued in or given in would exchange as well. I do not know, but believe it is not permanently affixed. There would also be the problem of just how many hemoglobin molecules/heme groups would have to be saturated to result in an overall reddish appearance of the blood relative to oxidized species. Just a thought. Related to this, I had also considered that a functional group on the cloth may interact with the porphyrin ring, a CO group, such as a carbonyl group, which are prevalent in carbohydrates (glycan coating as a result of Saponaria), but the structural biologists tell me the electron imprint would appear much different to the hemoglobin molecule than carbon monoxide. Just another thought. So, you’re right in asking why would there be significant CO associated with hemoglobin it was just one of the suggestions that was proposed (in 2001) to account for the color, originally by BB..","date":"2013-04-04","mins":"8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"id":"comment-29431","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"#37 Thanks, I also tried to contact the author of the 2nd link several months ago, was unable to do so successfully; flashcard 13/27 looks like the typical red to brown change in the color of aged bloodstains; this is mostly what I have run across when googling phrases like blood stains in forensic analysis, but will keep looking. I do appreciate the point abound staining material and how this may influence color. #38 40 Am familiar with hyper barometric treatment; had a friend in grad school that was treated in a chamber for a time of course we all asked him if he had been under a lot of pressure lately… Regarding the permanent affixation of CO Hb, several of the hemoglobin structural investigators that I have corresponded with ensure me that CO is label in iron hemes and will be replaced by oxygen if not kept under a partial pressure of CO. Once bloodstains are exposed to air, CO should readily exchange with the oxygen molecule. CO may have a higher equilibrium constant, but the CO concentration in air is extremely low. The superglue comment was more directed at CO binding to free heme relative to a bloodstain, not really CO within the body; those I have corresponded with indicate that free heme tends to aggregate; aggregated material doesn’t produce a red color. Interestingly, the red color don’t occur only when heme is bound to a protein if ligands are in place on either side of the iron, which also prevents, aggregation, the red color persists. This was the idea related to the thought that something may be able to mimic CO binding to the porphyrin ring, with sufficient affinity to result in a red(dish) appearance. #41 mine going to bed!

This ONE man being Mc Crone? and is it really just one man? Did the idea really originate form Mc Crone? Mc Crone never examined the cloth in person; Baima Bollone preceded him, has examined the cloth in person and also noted the carmine color. Dr. Curto, Turin Museum of Egyptology I am not exactly sure of the timeline, but believed this may have been around the time of the 1976 Commission Report said “Darker, brownish marks on the body represent the trickle of blood or serum issuing from the wounds; we can also pick out two traces of crimson, simulating trickles of blood which, however, would have turned brown when dry [if they had been blood]. Therefore these marks must certainly have been added later and deliberately” this is from Mc Crone’s book, p. 15 from p. 85 of Ian Wilson’s book The Blood and the Shroud, as we have remarked earlier, the very colour of the bloodflows as they appear on the Shroud proper (as distinct from the negative, where they all appear white), raises some very justifiable suspicions. We all know that if we cut a finger and tie a handkerchief around it, the initial vivid red of the fresh blood will rapidly change to a dull brown, usually within a few hours. Yet at long ago as the early sixteenth century one Antoine de Lalaing deescribed the Shroud bloodstains as ‘clear as if they had been made today’. Vignon, viewing the Shroud the 1930s, described the colour as mauve carmine”. He goes on to add, “Whatever interpretation one makes of them, I would readily endorse both of these descriptions. In the course of my own viewing of the Shroud in November 1973, I was present on occasions when the television lights were both on and off. When the lights were switched off and the room where the Shroud was displayed remained in what may be best described as subdued interior daylight conditions, colour wise the blood marks appeared much different than the body image. When they were switched on the bloodstains took on a very distinctive ‘clean’ mauve carmine color…” The description of the color parallels exactly the phrasing of Vignon, one can interpret that in different ways I suppose, influence or best describes it/agrees. Wherever the idea originated, even if it was the opinion of just one person, would that bias influence/permeate the many who have observed the Shroud in person or studied bloodstained fibers taken from it?

Certainly there are probably many lay people here on the blog who have only seen blood from a finger cut there have also been the reports of those that have been medically trained that have commented on the red color of the blood on the Shroud #33. It is understandable, even by lay people, that “bloody sputum, bloody saliva, bloody gastric contents, [bloody urine], blood stains from the initial cut during the start of the operation and the blood stains afterwards will ALL look differently”, but are all of those types of stains represented on the Shroud, ventral & dorsal? Don’t get me wrong, I value your input and am surely trying your patience, but a couple of the issues I am unsure about are: To me (the untrained), many of the stains on the Shroud appear to have a similar color is this expected, or given the plethora of bloody origins, would more variation be more like it? Second, experience with bloodstains, etc. as some have also pointed out, does this fully apply to aged bloodstains? Maybe you are convinced it does I would like to understand as well.

Are there spectral studies from leech digests available that would provide an example that such chemistry occurs? These are reasonable questions. 2) The samples utilized by Adler to mimic a traumatic clot exudate were created by mixing drops of whole blood (finger stick) with drops of a commercially available (ca) bilirubin/albumin diagnostic standard. Dried whole blood, (ca) bilirubin, and (ca) hemoglobin were used as controls. If one accepts that Adler knew what he was doing, which, correct me if I’m wrong, but it sounds as though it’s leaning that way, then what is the purpose for him having to be so creative resorting to “new chemistry” Is the idea of methemoglobin + bilirubin really that far out? To completely disregard Adler’s idea, for me it might be more convincing if spectral data of (unrelated) aged samples that contain a high level of bilirubin were produced, which don’t match the reported spectra of Shroud samples. I am not an expert in the spectral analysis of porphryins, and have limited experience in spectroscopy in general. For me personally, a basic experiment I would like to see (in Adler’s studies) is spectral analysis of simulated samples where increasing amounts of bilirubin were added. Also, this is somewhat simplified, but parallel spots of such samples that were allowed to dry onto cloth, and observed a few weeks later to monitor the color. Certainly such experiments could have been performed and recorded in a notebook without being included in a manuscript or a presentation it is not a dealbreaker some might also hold the view that it’s really not necessary as the most relevant groups are included. 3) Others have commented on the presence of hydroxyproline in serum Brother Hirudo has taken a vow of silence on this one, or is that an unfair assumption?

As you are aware, I believe it is possible for a science professional to check his or her personal beliefs in their back pocket, locked securely, in the analysis of experimental results the data is the data. I mentioned this in the above only as a personal reflection, at the end. The major focus is on the objective discussion of the science. Bilirubin and Saponaria are 2 potential explanations that have been put forth to explain the reddish aspect of the blood on the Shroud. There are others: CO association with hemoglobin, and ultraviolet stimulation to alter the coloration. Each has their merits, each has their own issues. No visceral reaction to the mention of ultraviolet it has been reported that uv stimulation resulted in prolonged appearance of the reddish color, just as it is reported that Saponaria treatment has a similar effect. Forget any association with theories of image formation, etc. Isn’t it an interesting question on its own, what the molecular basis could be for such observations? Why would hemoglobin, released due to Saponaria treatment, result in the persistence of a reddish color? What would prevent the hemoglobin from becoming oxidized? Does uv treatment alter the association/conformation of the heme group with neighboring molecules? I do not really know at “stage of Shroud science” we’re at the collection of samples was relatively limited by nature, technology has significantly improved over the past several decades different people, including scientists, have different ways of looking at things, different angles. I think there still may be much more to be learned. Thus, I am willing to spend time discussing the science of an idea, even one like the use of leeches in the creation of bloodstains.

A courtroom drama is not necessary. One can simply read Adler’s own words published in his papers I provided two quotes from Adler yesterday. Here is another (different) quote from his book: “Further, in our opinion, the totality of these tests does confirm the blood images areas as blood. The question as to whether or not the blood is human blood is best left to further immunological testing” These are Adler’s words verbatim. I don’t contradict Adler’s claims, he was appropriately cautious in his conclusions I have gone to much lengths to support them. You however, choose to overextend them, largely through confusion about the scientific principles behind such experiments and their inherent limitations, strongly laced with emotion. Many reagents advertised as “anti human” will cross react with related species. Adler went on the offensive with this and directly tested the cross reactivity. The reagents were not strictly anti human this is absolutely no surprise, particularly given the reagents that were available at the time of those studies. Bollone’s experiments never addressed the issue of cross serology. In immunology it is imperative the caveat is there, whether directly examined or not. Here’s one for you: the relation between MNS and human blood was never realized in the Shroud community, even long after the results were reported by Baima Bollone (in a Shroud journal) and it was known in the serology world that MNS expression was restricted to humans. The first time this was ever reported, and the connection made to Shroud studies was by yours truly: Dr. (not Mr.) Pandora. Was that okay or should that have been kept under wraps? Being afraid to critically analyze the data, from any and all appropriate scientific disciplines, is like an ostrich with their head buried in the sand. Very, very deep. The discipline of immunology seems most appropriate here, as these are immunological tests. Fear of what may or may not be learned about the Shroud from any scientific discipline is characteristic of insecurity. Skeptics will always have ammo. You don’t realize this, but you provide a supply line of ammo when you pretend to know what you are talking about (scientifically) and make such bold statements regarding “scientific facts.” Unless you think you really know what you’re talking about (scientifically, immunologically), and Adler, as well as me, have it wrong?.","date":"2014-06-22","mins":"7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/20/everyones-own-facts/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Everyone’s Own Facts"},{"id":"comment-132477","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"The scientific tests to determine that bloodstains are of human origin involve immunological and/or DNA analysis.

Ironically, in the original manuscript (a link to shroud.com is available in the above link) there is a section titled, “Is primate good enough?” “Good enough” will mean different things to different individuals depending on their background, experience, and overall interest in the topic. While the species of origin of the blood and the patterns of the bloodstains are ultimately part of the same larger question, and complement each other, scientifically these are best treated as separate issues. This approach ensures the most objectivity. Ideally, the person running such tests would not even know where the samples came from, although this is not always practical. The current data indicates there are primate, i.e. Human blood components on the Shroud. (For me personally, I try to avoid using just the term “human” without qualifying it in my opinion, from a scientific standpoint, this is the most accurate representation of the existing data).

Pandora’s box? My idea isn’t that maybe the Shroud blood is not human blood. My idea is that if it’s going to be consistently referred to as such, what is the strength of evidence for this? It is important to be scientifically accurate. Is this something that has, over time, been assimilated into discussions, similar to “all old blood types as AB”. Is it the slam dunk some think it is? Providing more ammo, etc., that’s a sign of insecurity. And consider that not being scientifically accurate or precise when talking about what is and isn’t known can be perceived as ammo as well. Particularly for those in the scientific mainstream it doesn’t look good, it weakens the credibility. Here is a quote from Adler’s book that you mentioned: “We were only doing a surface precipitate test; there was no way to quantify it. So we cannot rule out the possibility that this could be some other type of primate blood. In sum, our testing showed that the substance composing the bloodstains on the Shroud is a blood derived material; it is definitely from primate blood, and it is the exudate of a wound.” Here a quote from Case’s book which contains a transcript of the last interview Heller & Adler ever did together: Dr. Adler: “Well you put it on, you tag the antibody with some fluorescent tag so you can see if it sticks to the surface you are putting it on. See if it lights up. And that’s not the world’s best immunological test. We found that a chimp antigen gave almost as strong a test. So our conclusion was a very simple one. We were only willing to say it was a primate’s blood. But we were not willing at that point to declare it was human blood. Like we tell talk show audiences, if you choose to think that the image you see is that of a chimp or an orangutan, you’re perfectly welcome to believe that. Case: But there hasn’t been more recent testing that is specific for human blood? Or can that be done, actually? Dr. Adler: Well it could be. But you’d need more sample. And the ultimate test would be DNA testing. It hasn’t been done.” Sound like Adler was 100% willing to say human blood based on such tests? I don’t think so, but maybe it’s still “good enough” I’m am completely without forensic experience or background to judge the accuracy of the bloodflow patterns, etc., so that, together with the image on the cloth remain separate issues for me regarding the species origin of blood. Also, for me, that is the best way, scientifically speaking, to remain as objective as possible Regarding Baima Bollone’s studies cross reactivity with the “anti human” reagents that were used were never addressed.

(See the crucifixion video above) 3) At any elevation, blood tends to drain from the arm, even when the heart is beating. (Hold one hand out at an upwards angle for a minute or two and then compare it with the other, as specified above) 4) After death, blood continues to drain from the arm under gravity, until it is substantially depleted. 5) After death, the cessation of the pumping heart, and the removal of the nail, there is insufficient blood in the hand to drip down the arm. (There may be sufficient blood to come out if the arm is held hand downward, but that would not drip back up towards the elbow). If the four statements above are accurate, then the apparent blood flows depicted on the shroud arms are inconsistent with a crucifixion. I would be interested to hear what experiments you carried out. A few comments in a real crucifixion, it is doubtful the executioners would be so gentle as those posing as villains in the video, the nails would be larger, and would surely be ponded in with much more force. Is it necessary a major artery be severed? What about a vein? Could the body have been transported to the burial site with the patibulum still attached? If removed at the crucifixion site, rigor established, the body transported by grasping a portion of the arms, would this have an effect? Insufficient amounts of blood in the hand how many mls do you estimate are represented on the wrist, forearm bloodstains?

The Shroud spectrum did not completely match the control spectrum of old blood (which typically turns brown). Rather, certain peaks on the graph corresponded to another known group of compounds the high spin (high iron) porphyrins: breakdown products of hemoglobin bilirubin & biverdin. By creating simulated mixtures of blood exudates with additional bilirubin, Adler was able to create samples whose profiles matched those of the Shroud, hence the suggestion that elevated bilirubin was present. The spectral techniques that were used are semi quantitative; they really only demonstrate that a particular compound (peak) is enhanced or decreased relative to a normal profile the studies were not extended to a more quantitative analysis. Regarding “Adler’s advising the Shroud’s custodians to install extra light protection for the Shroud on the grounds that bilirubin was unstable to light”, this is only one of several factors that was mentioned, together with photochemical damage to the cloth and the images.

The intention was to be objective, not to play dodge ball. It is my understanding that the primary intent of the spectral analyses by Adler & colleagues was to determine if the samples were, in fact, blood as opposed to paint or pigments. These data along with numerous other chemical & immunological tests indicated that the samples consisted of real blood. In the course of these studies, certain regions of the spectral profiles became of interest. I used the phrase “semi quantitative” because for the existing data, I don’t know if you can really take it much past that. Such spectral techniques could be relatively quantitative for fresh whole blood where protein concentration could be normalized to a particular blood volume as in the paper you referenced. with tape lift samples of dried bloodstains, it might prove more challenging. It is possible to tell if a certain peak in the profile is increased/ decreased relative to a control (normal) profile, but I believe that generating a hard number in terms of specific amounts of blood proteins present would require further analysis. I don’t know why the studies weren’t extended and followed up on, but reason suggests that a limited amount of sample to work with would be a contributing factor. I never knew Alan Adler personally, but my guess is that he was not the type to shy away from a challenge. If solid quantitative analysis were possible with the samples in hand, I believe he would have mentioned it.

There are some obvious differences: a fairly well preserved body vs. A cloth that is thought to have once covered a body, but I think there is some applicability, particularly in regards to the methods and technological advances. Since the original STURP investigation in 1978, the field of nanotechnology has continued to grow, allowing studies to be conducted with greater sensitivity and much more detail. For the Iceman, sufficient intact DNA was available from the iceman for full genomic sequencing. These studies showed he was O type blood, Rh positive; also, some other interesting characteristics (carrier of lyme disease, lactose intolerant, and had brown eyes). The images of the preserved red blood cells, and their detail, are quite remarkable. These were performed on sections taken from punch biopsies of the wound area using atomic force microscopy. In addition to microscopic data, some Raman spectra studies were shown in the paper, indicating the presence of fibrin.

Red blood cells have been reported previously in mummies using microscopy (Science 108, 303 304 (1973), Science 192, 374 375 (1976), and on prehistoric rock tools (Science 220, 1269 1270 (1983), although not with the clarity available in the Iceman studies. In bloodstains, as blood dries red blood cells dehydrate, similar to a tire going flat. What is most likely being visualized in such samples are aged blood cells that have resealed with each other during the preparation procedure, representing reconstituted cells, not intact red blood cells that have survived over large periods of time. Because of their distinct biconcave, disc like shape, red blood cells may be identified microscopically with relative confidence. The new Iceman studies help to take this to another level..","date":"2012-05-03","mins":"5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/03/identifying-old-blood-one-corpuscle-at-a-time/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Identifying old blood one corpuscle at a time"},{"id":"comment-49635","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Cliff : Tabor may be onto something concrete, but it needs the critical test of time and the critique of his peers.

Cliff, saw your recent comment & (re)read the main post the boldface phrase caught my eye: “the Shroud of Turin had strangely showed neither X nor Y chromosomes, indicating that Jesus was somehow human, but without normal human blood like the rest of us with two human parents.” “Strangely showed neither”…this appears misleading: it is phrased to sound as though the presence of X & Y chromosomes was looked for, but not detected. As far as I am aware, here is what has been reported: Garza Valdes described (in a book) that portions of both X & Y sequences present on bloodstained threads from the Shroud. Canale and coworkers reported (in a Shroud journal) that they found male DNA with traces of female DNA present on bloodstained threads, with male DNA more abundant; further examination of the samples showed that multiple forms of other, unrelated genes were present, more than could be accounted for by one individual. That being said, I’ve written before about (what are, in my opinion) over generalizations about the DNA on the Shroud. In my judgement, the sex typing of the blood also falls into this category: the data that exists is extremely limited. In my opinion, a scientific panel or journal would not accept the conclusions based on such results. The heterogeneity must be addressed. The reproducibility is an unknown. The conclusions at this stage are much too preliminary. “Strangely, showed neither?” This is at the other end of the extreme. When scientific results become elasticized and stretched beyond what can be conclusively determined from the data, it can quickly become like the party game where you whisper something in the first person’s ear and compare the end result five minutes later.

In the aborementioned documentary, they conclude that because the two individuals didn’t share the same mitochondrial DNA & were in a familial tomb, they must have been man & wife. The example of a cousin was simply to point out how certain family members could be related and not share the same mitochondrial DNA. Two complete strangers wouldn’t share the same mitochondrial DNA either, but it doesn’t mean they are married. According to the reasoning of the documentary, they would/could be. There is zero DNA evidence that the remains found in the box have anything to do with Jesus or any members of his family. Zero. The samples tested showed that the two individuals did not share the same mother (or grandmother). Any inferences/conclusions past this regarding true brothers/sisters versus cousins were not intended. Regarding the virgin birth, how this would happen scientifically is an interesting question. There are numerous scenarios that have been suggested, including some that seem to stretch the imagination: that Jesus was haploid (having half the normal amount of chromosomes + an additional Y chromosome) or that Mary was underwent a type of parthenogenesis (development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg). Others, as previously posted, suggest a more natural solution. Whether one chooses to believe in a supernatural virgin birth in the case of Jesus, is of course a personal choice. I myself, have never had a problem believing in a virgin birth. How a virgin birth might have happened is beyond me that’s where faith would come in. If you believe God created the universe and all that’s in it, then, (for me) it’s not so difficult to believe He might have a few other tricks up His sleeve.

Now Jeter is out for the entire post season. What does this mean? It means I have time to write a more proper response. Charles & daveb, thank you for your comments. This is somewhat lengthy; you may wish to grab a cup of tea, or something even stronger. First, regarding where the skeletal remains and mummies came from, the title of the 1st article is “ABO typing of ancient skeletons from Israel” (should be one of the first hits on a search engine, may or may not have an accessible link). Specifically in this study, the skeletal remains were from the Jerusalem and En Gedi region; of 55 skeletons that were examined, 30.91% were A, 14.54% were B, 50.91% were AB, and 3.64% were O. Similarly, the title of the 2nd article, is “ABO tissue antigens of Egyptian mummies” (should also pop up using a search engine). Specifically, 14 Egyptian mummies were examined dating from the Roman period. The reclassified Egyptian mummies may involve samples in the 2nd study, that is certainly possible. This particular study used three different serological methods to evaluate ABO expression in various tissue samples. Of the 14 mummies studied, only half of them gave concordant typing results (samples taken from different areas such as bone, skin, hair, muscle gave the same result). Of these 7 that were concordant, 3 were A, 2 were B, 1 was O, and 1 was AB. The remaining 7 gave mixed results, 5 of the 7 were AB? B?, AB?, A?, or AB?, O?. True, this reference “is already 23 years old and we have had immense advances in the study of DNA since then!!”, but these particular studies specifically involve serological methods, which evaluate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells, not DNA (see Figure in previous post). It is possible that even “dated” articles contain sound science; of course, it is also reasonable that such results be confirmed and extended using more modern methods. To quote from a recent review article on blood typing of the Shroud (available at shroud.com), “Clearly, serological analysis is most useful when corroborated by additional experimentation, especially molecular (DNA) analysis of blood group genes”. I am in total agreement with you. I have by no means done an exhaustive search, but there does appear to be a noticeable paucity in the studies of ABO blood type of ancient remains in more recent years. As previously mentioned, DNA degradation may preclude confident analysis in certain cases. If DNA sequencing is a viable option, there are many other regions in the genome (besides ABO) that may prove much more tantalizing and informative to investigators that are interested in hereditary relationships and molecular evolution. Together, these two may (at least partly) account for the relative small number of studies that have been done with more modern molecular biology (DNA) techniques. Regarding the 2nd part of the article, as I’m sure you are aware there is controversy about when the various blood types first emerged, much of which has been fueled by D’Adamo’s promotion of the blood group diet theory. To bypass speculation, etc. And cut to the chase, that is specifically why I phrased the e mail question I sent out to various investigators the way that I did. I was interested in knowing, point blank, the empirical evidence for the first (earliest) known AB individual(s) in human history. (I did not feel comfortable citing their names attached to particular quotes without specifically asking their permission; I received more responses than listed, but those quoted were entirely representative). I specifically stuck to molecular (DNA) analysis to complement previous studies that were done by serology. Given that relatively few (DNA) studies have been done on very ancient samples, many of the responses were heavy on the origin and appearance of ABO genes throughout human (and human related development). Please allow me to comment on this a bit further. In the blood diet theory, the suggestion is that O is the original blood type, then blood type A, then blood type B, followed most recently by AB. Structurally, this may make some sense, as type O is a core structure to which A and B carbohydrates are added on. (Individuals contain an A enzyme or a B enzyme, AB individuals contain both, one on each chromosome; those that lack an A or B enzyme are type O). When you examine the DNA region that encodes such enzymes, the theory begins to crack (significantly). Studies at the DNA level that look at the specific sequences in this region in humans and human related primates indicate that the most ancient version of the ABO gene is A (not O). This is based on DNA sequencing and assignment of relationships among similar species. The next blood type that appears by human lineage is B, followed by O (estimated by most evolutionary biologists approximately 1.5 million years after the appearance of B). Type O blood results from a deletion within the A/B region, it makes absolutely no sense at all from a molecular standpoint that O would have come first. Similarly, from a molecular standpoint of the DNA sequence, A must have preceded B (A and B differ by only a few variations in sequence, only 4 amino acids at the protein level). Interestingly, recent studies suggest that A may have at one time been lost in the human lineage, then “resurrected” [check the Abstract their words, not mine!!] by a recombination between B and O less than 300,000 years ago (Kitano, et al., Mol. Bio. Evol., Jan. 27, 2012). The AB blood type does not occur without first having both A and B types in existence. B is thought to have arisen from A through mutation and selection. Those B individuals would be within the A population, surely some of them would have met, and things would have progressed… The selective pressures making AB an advantage/disadvantage (disease susceptibility, etc.) throughout human development, who knows? There are a lot of unknowns. Intangibles aside, theories involving isolation of A and B populations until 1,000 or so years ago, based on the incorrect order of ABO genes during human development seem a bit of a stretch, to say the least. Certainly, science seems to indicate that the potential for AB being present much earlier than food diet theories would suggest is more than reasonable.

Sperm and egg cells have half of the normal genetic material as other cell types (which is called haploid for half); this way, when they fuse, the developing embryo will be diploid (having 2 copies of DNA, one inherited from the father & one from the mother). Diploid is the normal situation. All other cell types in the body (except for sex cells, sperm & egg) are diploid, “di” for two. The suggestion has been made that Jesus was haploid, having 23 chromosomes (half of the normal number, 46) from an unfertilized egg cell, plus a Y chromosome (for maleness), giving a total of 24. This would certainly be unique under normal circumstances, haploid organisms do not develop/survive. A full set of chromosomes is important for viability. Unlike the X chromosome, which contains thousands of genes, there are only 28 genes on the Y chromosome. Of the 28, 15 are unique to the Y, 13 have counterparts on the X. A very small number of males (1 out of ~20,000) are XX, with one of the X chromosomes containing insertion of part of the Y chromosomes. The Y insertion provides the necessary genes for maleness. This type of scenario and variations thereof have also been proposed as a possible mechanism for a virgin birth (Tippler). Parthenogenesis This word actual translates into “virgin birth”. Parthenogenesis is the development of an organism from an unfertilized egg cell. Certain species can reproduce this way, including bees, lizards, certain fish, amphibians, hammerhead sharks, and Komodo dragons to name a few. Essentially, an (unfertilized) egg cell divides into uneven portions, a major portion and 3 smaller ones; one of the smaller portions can fuse with the major cell, creating a diploid embryo, which develops into a viable, normal organism. This type of reproduction is not typically observed in mammals, but types of parthenogenic pregnancies have been known to occur, although very, very rarely. In these circumstances, a virgin female may develop a polyembryoma, a type of tumor developing in the ovaries that may contain XY chromosomes (Garza Valdes describes experience with such a patient in his book). There are other chromosomal permutations as well that some have tossed out there, for example, a XXY male, known as Kleinfelter’s syndrome, all of which have associated abnormalities. I’ve never quite understood the need for such wild speculating and acrobatic tricks with chromosomes. I think it might be an attempt to reconcile a belief in the virgin birth with a way that’s scientifically doable as we currently understand it. In my opinion, it is most reasonable (essential) that Jesus was a physiologically normal, healthy male. From the limited reports of molecular studies that have been performed on the Shroud, X and Y chromosomal DNA appears to be present, although contamination by exogenous DNA remains somewhat of an open issue..","date":"2012-11-27","mins":"7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/25/must-read-cloning-the-man-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ:  Cloning the man on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-19580","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"A brief comment to Senior110: I think crying “wolf” is a very understandable & appropriate response.

The other extreme is to keep science at arms’ length, to not approach issues of faith, to play it safe, such that their validity is not questioned.

There is no DNA profile of Jesus on record to compare any findings to scientifically, you have to take it past engravings on a box. 2.

In my opinion, it’s not just a matter of blood being on the Shroud, but it is forensically accurate with characteristics of correct gravity flow, clotting with properties of serum halos at the edges, only visible under uv light. Also, from an artistic standpoint alone, I think it would be difficult to first create the bloodstains, then construct the image around them. The issue of human versus animal blood is a very interesting one. This would probably best be addressed in a separate post as there are several important points here. The blood does appear to be human, although certain of the original studies stretched the interpretation, in my opinion. Adler & colleagues were always (appropriately) cautious in concluding that their immunological tests only demonstrated that the blood was of primate origin. The problem is that although a test reagent may be labeled as anti human (meaning it was made against human albumin or human immunoglobulin, for example), it doesn’t mean that it reacts exclusively with human blood products. Proteins in other species that are similar will also react. Chimp albumin differs from human albumin by only 6 out of 580 amino acids. Unless the antibody is specific for a region involving those 6, it will most likely react react with chimp (and likely other similar species). In fact, certain antibody subclasses were discovered in chimpanzees using anti human reagents. The AB blood typing results help somewhat here, chimps don’t express the B molecule, gorillas show poor reactivity with most ABO reagents, especially the A molecule. Orangutans & gibbons express ABO similar to humans. ABO is just one of about 30 different classes of blood group molecules expressed on red blood cells. Bollone & colleagues examined the MNS group in 1985, primarily I believe for ethnicity correlations of blood type. These molecules were also examined in the serological studies of King Tut. Anyway, all primates express M,N molecules, but S expression is restricted to humans. No S counterpart is present in other species. The blood on the Shroud is positive for MNS. In my opinion, the blood typing (AB & MNS characterization) is really the most definite evidence that the blood is of human origin. Together, the data lead to the conclusion that the blood is human blood. Potential cross reactivity is too much of an issue in much of the earlier work to conclusively make the claim that the blood is human, although these are the experiments that are typically believed to support this claim. Certain bloodstains on the Oviedo look similarly red to me, although much of the stains around the face appear to be mixed/diluted with pulmonary fluid, issued from the nose & mouth. I don’t believe that the bloodstains on the Oviedo cloth have been as extensively characterized chemically as those on the Shroud, but everything that has been reported seems to be consistent.

In kind, I believe that the totality of the evidence is what must be considered when in forming an opinion about the Shroud. Science is driven by an innate desire to know and objectivity is the name of the game. I believe that skepticism is healthy and the amount of wiggle room that’s there will vary individually. Whether one believes the Shroud is the real deal or a grand fake, anyone interested wants to know/understand how the image got there. In the Heller & Adler experiments, the blood was digested off by proteolytic enzymes, revealing colorless fibers underneath. I’m not sure exactly how many different samples bloodstained areas were tested. Treatment of image fibers with proteases had no effect on color. I don’t know if Rogers ever directly examined the effect of blood on the image. If a negative result were obtained, it could always be argued that in the case of the Shroud, the incubation time was much longer (weeks? months? etc?).

This is a true comparative test. DNA degradation may preclude such tests, but it may not. It isn’t necessary that all 20,000 25,000 genes of the entire genome be intact, just segments of of particular genes of interest. The high copy number of mitochondrial DNA (1,000 10,000 copies/cell) is particularly advantageous in situations where the DNA is in a degraded state. In addition, the restriction of mitochondrial DNA to maternal inheritance makes it extremely unlikely that two unrelated individuals would show identical mitochondrial DNA. Nuclear DNA, although present in much lower copy number, offers the advantage that it can distinguish if such DNA truly originates from the bloodstains or is from contaminating (touch) DNA.

Here’s a combined response to both the original question and the comments that followed. For anyone that wants to cut to the chase regarding the original question, go to 4. There are also some related comments & discussion in a previous posting: Cloning the Man on the Shroud of Turin. 1. DNA from other organisms versus human DNA: It is not so difficult to sort out human DNA from that of other species. One can use tailor made probes to target specific gene sequences that are unique to higher organisms/humans. Regarding the Shroud, Garza Valdes reported this for three genes: betaglobin (a hemoglobin subunit), amelogenin X, and amelogenin Y; the latter two are located on the X and Y chromosomes, respectively. 2. DNA from specific individuals: As Mario points out, this is much more difficult. Most genes expressed in humans are the same from one individual to another. Unless a person has a specific variation (mutation) in the gene, there is no way of discerning whom it came from or if it is actually a mixture of DNA from various individuals. There are a certain genes within the body that are polymorphic (poly = many and morphic = shape or form), that is, they show significant variation among unrelated individuals. Any such analysis would have to begin here. The most polymorphic genes in humans are the class I and class II HLA genes; when a person is typed in organ transplantation for a suitable match, it is HLA expression that is being examined. There are also noncoding DNA segments (that exist in between genes) which are polymorphic, termed microsatellite regions or short tandem repeat (STR) regions. For freshly isolated, intact DNA, such regions are routinely used in DNA fingerprinting analysis. In the case of the Shroud, contamination as well as degradation might preclude an effective (full) analysis, although some information might be obtainable. In addition to nuclear (chromosomal) DNA, mitochondrial DNA could also be evaluated. Unlike nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother, only individuals with the same mother (or grandmother, great grandmother) would express similar mitochondrial DNA profiles. This narrows things down somewhat, but the same problem with multiple contributions (contamination) would apply here also. 3.DNA from a specific individual (Jesus): The main problem here is there is no DNA profile of Jesus on file to compare any results to. Ditto with Mary. Certain markers that are more predominant within the Jewish population could be evaluated, for example, patterns of inheritance of certain HLA markers, but this would by no means approach a slam dunk. DNA tests are comparison tests. To even begin to consider the question of kinship or identity (could this be Jesus?), there needs to be an existing DNA profile for comparison: a master of the Master. In total agreement with Mario regarding the reconstruction of a full genetic profile of an individual from aged bloodstained samples. Such scenarios are more appropriate for comic books and science fiction novels. 4. The Virgin Birth and Chromosome Number: Very briefly, normal, healthy individuals contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46. 22 of these pairs are autosomes (non sex chromosomes), the remaining pair (sex chromosomes) is either XX or XY. In typical human reproduction, half of the genetic material is received from the father, half from the mother. In normal circumstances, the father determines the sex of the child by either contributing an X or a Y chromosome, to combine with the X chromosome of the mother, creating a female or male, respectively. “If the Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus, he was conceived and born of a virgin apart from union with a man. Presuming only one human genetic code/biological material, what would be expected physical evidence found on the Shroud” ” Basically, there are two scenarios that have been suggested: Some have proposed variations on the theme that Jesus was haploid, containing half the amount of normal chromosomes from Mary, plus a Y chromosome (or bits of a Y) thrown in: 23 plus a Y. (see previous post on Cloning the Man on the Shroud of Turin for additional discussion) Under normal circumstances, such an organism would not survive and be arrested early in development. It is hard to imagine how this would proceed. Chromosomal expression is tightly regulated; even a slight variation typically results in the failure to survive or developmental abnormalities. Apart from the scientific red flags, which are flapping heavily here, from a theological standpoint, one might wonder why God would incarnate His Son as a mutant? I vote tinfoil hat territory on this one. Most logical, in my opinion, is that Jesus was a physiologically normal, healthy male. For most Christians, this is implied by the faith statements, “fully human and fully divine”, “true God and true man”. The sticking point for many, particularly in relation to a virgin birth, is where did the Y (or bits of a Y) come from? “Apart from union with a man” and barring any type of artificial insemination involving a man, it comes down to a miraculous event, that resulted in generation/creation of the complementary genetic material necessary for normal development. One’s own belief & faith must decide which way they want to go on this one. To sum up, some might suggest the physical evidence would be 23 chromosomes + a Y (or a bit of a Y). The majority would propose 46, including an X and a Y, derived either through natural or divine means. Realistically, the chances of actually being able to perform a chromosome count, called karyotyping, from the bloodstains on the Shroud is astronomically remote. In aged bloodstains, such tests are not practical as cells become dehydrated and rupture within hours of drying. Any DNA remaining hundreds/thousands of years later is expected to be in a fragmented condition. Interesting questions, Andy, that juxtapose theology & science. Safe to say, in any playbook, that Jesus’ mitochondrial DNA would have originated from Mary.

Hemoglobin is found in red blood cells an increase in red blood cell lysis due to shock would result in elevated serum hemoglobin levels hemoglobin is broken down to biliverdin, which is converted to bilirubin. Hemoglobin eventually loses the oxygen it carries and the deoxygenated form (methemoglobin) is brown, which gives most blood stains their typical appearance. Adler suggested that the combination of elevated bilirubin (yellow/orange) + methemoglobin (brown) together results in the red appearance. A byproduct of hemoglobin breakdown is CO, which binds the porphyrin ring around 200x times greater than oxygen, and can result in a red appearance of blood this was suggested by Baima Bollone to contribute to the red color; in victims of CO poisoning, persistent red blood color in the lab is an indicator of bound CO this can be confirmed by spectral data when kept in the refrigerator under sealed conditions, such samples can remain red for several years; under normal conditions, the bound CO is eventually exchanged for oxygen, and the hemoglobin is deoxygenated to methemoglobin, which the Shroud spectral data indicate is present binding of CO to the free heme ring, not associated with the hemoglobin polypeptide is of much higher affinity, around 25,000x greater than oxygen Adler commented that the spectral patterns at certain wavelengths show scattering with some peak shifts the data are indicative of methemoglobin being present perhaps additional information could be found there as well these are samples of aged, dried blood, methemoglobin is expected to be the predominant form.","date":"2013-02-22","mins":"6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/19/on-the-topic-of-bloodstains-picking-up-threads-of-useful-discussion/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"On the Topic of Bloodstains: Picking up Threads of Useful Discussion"},{"id":"comment-174374","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Dan, Likewise Still miss getting that selfie….","date":"2014-12-02","mins":"10:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/02/paper-chase-a-critical-reevaluation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-blood-data-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Paper Chase:  A critical (Re)evaluation of the Shroud of Turin blood data by Kelly Kearse"},{"id":"comment-21859","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Here is a link to a recent report in Science News, which was published in Dec 12, 2012: http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/345987/description/Human blood types have deep evolutionary roots This describes in relatively general terms the findings of a study by Laure Seguel and Emma Thompson in Molly Prezeworski’s lab at the University of Chicago that was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

It is certainly true that examples of ancient samples having AB blood type in the scientific literature may be considered slight. However, it is equally true that the scientific database of blood typing of ancient samples is, in general, slight. In my opinion, the polls are still open less than a few percent of precincts have reported. This is especially relevant given the small frequency of the AB phenotype in the modern population. Regarding the Shroud, I am always careful to discuss the blood studies as “types as AB using forward typing methods”. When one donates blood, it is first analyzed by forward typing (which evaluates the ABO molecules on the red blood cells). Before being transfused into a patient, it is always cross checked by reverse typing (which evaluates the antibodies against ABO molecules in the serum). Good science always verifies itself in a similar manner. With the AB blood type, no anti ABO antibodies should exist in the serum a negative result, which is what was found with the Shroud studies. However, it can always be argued that such antibodies were originally present but were degraded over time, giving the same readout. So, the cross check is somewhat short circuited: it’s a circular argument. If the Shroud were any other blood type than AB, these results could be distinguished. As Ray Rogers once said “Nothing is ever easy with the Shroud”. I, myself, would very much welcome a confirmatory cross check on the AB blood type, it’s the only way to draw a firm, solid conclusion. If sufficient DNA within the ABO coding region were intact, this could provide a confirmatory test. Suppose such tests could be done and the blood on the Shroud was found to be genetically type O, (which has been verified in multiple individuals using modern molecular biology techniques from 5,300 and even 30,000 and 40, 000 years old), would this then be considered as positive evidence that the Shroud might be authentic, or simply dismissed as irrelevant? The development and inheritance of ABO blood groups throughout human history (and that of related species) is an interesting and complex subject. Numerous questions exist that remain to be answered, apart from the context of the Shroud. Given the relative unknowns on the origin and appearance of ABO blood types in humans, it is probably not the best yardstick in terms of possible evidence for non authenticity..","date":"2013-01-22","mins":"10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/08/positive-for-ab-is-not-the-same-as-ab-positive/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Positive for AB is not the same as AB positive"},{"id":"comment-26120","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Thibault, A question regarding the bloodstains that soak through by capillary action, below the surface, do you know if a demarcation exists in color from a more reddish hue (surface) to a browner color (beneath), more typical of older, deoxygenated blood?

For example, in the experiments by Goldini where samples with increased amounts of bilirubin were treated with uv light, there is the additional variable(s) that the cloth used in this set of studies was treated with aloe, myrrh (& sweat). Any affect that such compounds may have on the system (positive or negative) is unknown. One cannot simply dismiss this by saying that because Rogers did not find any evidence for such compounds (aloe & myrrh) on the Shroud, this must be irrelevant. Is it just bilirubin or bilirubin plus? Experimentally, one does not know. There is also the report that neutron bombardment followed by subsequent exposure to uv results in the persistence of red coloration, irregardless of amount of additional bilirubin. This is an experimental observation just as supernatural beliefs should be fastened in the back pocket, so should any preconceived bias against certain investigators or theories It works both ways focus on the data at hand. Neutron bombardment could disrupt association of certain inhibitory substances or facilitate the aggregation of certain proteins, mimicking what’s observed in other systems. Or it could be totally unrelated. In the saponin system, there is the reported result that the red color persists. The molecular basis for this observation remains to be determined. As jesterof (Mahoney thread, comment # 184) and myself (Mahoney thread, comment #119), have questioned, it is unknown if this effect is unique to saponin or is also observed under other lysis conditions. This would require further experimentation. As mentioned in comments #163,169 of the same thread, relative to certain other detergents, saponin is quite efficient at disrupting cell membranes and perhaps increasing aggregation of specific proteins that could be important in such observations. An additional variable is the method used for saponin extraction different conditions yield different results. To effectively evaluate these effects, such conditions would have to be normalized. Together with Adler’s results, this could all be a case of true, true, and unrelated. Or it could be that there is some cross talk/application between the results. It is too early to tell there is no one size fits all here more experimentation would be needed, variables would have to be experimentally defined & controlled.

The question of whether billirubin by itself, or as part of some combined chemical reaction being responsible for the reddish colour of the blood found on the Shroud is a daunting one. Recently, and several times actually, Yannick Clement has questioned why the blood found on the Sudarium (proposed back of the head area) does not have the same colouring as the blood found on the Shroud and hense has questioned the authenticity of the Sudarium in doing so. This line of questioning along with a couple of comments made in this post has sparked a thought in my mind; Could it be possible that because the Shroud and Sudarium may have been ‘processed’ differently be the cause for this fact? Maybe the specific way the Shroud linen was processed and it’s specific chemical properties, along with a reaction to the billirubin enhanced blood could be the reasoning? Therefore explaining the non reddish blood found on the Sudarium. Thoughts? … Thanks, Ron I would agree: comparing the two like that is as straightforward as it may seem too many (unknown) variables could exist, both before & after the cloth received blood. The most straightforward test to determine the relationship of the two cloths, if doable, is DNA analysis, especially mitochondrial DNA. Even though the blood on both cloths appear to be the same blood type, AB, this is still circumstantial, it doesn’t prove they wrapped the same person. The only solid conclusion that could be made in such tests is if the blood types were different. It’s an interesting point to be raised, but in my opinion, I don’t think you can go by just the coloring the appearance of the blood is not just a function of the blood composition in of itself, but also the physical & chemical properties of the cloth before/after the blood stained it..","date":"2013-06-02","mins":"6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood"},{"id":"comment-35711","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Typo! is not as straightforward.","date":"2013-06-02","mins":"7:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood"},{"id":"comment-35773","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Yannick Clément : It’s not because I don’t have all your diplomas that I’m dumb… And since I follow closely Adler and Barbet’s conclusions about the bloodstains, I think this comment of you (which is based on another comment of jesterof) can be seen as a critic against these 2 great researchers that are much greater and important than you will probably ever be my friend.

For the agnostic or atheist, if the Shroud were “proven” authentic, where does one go then? One could argue the non believer might be more subject to bias, because it simply must be an impossibility. There is no fall back. I don’t think any opinion should be disqualified just because someone is a devout believer or a devout non believer the fervor can and does go both ways. Retouch doesn’t have to be an overhaul and the 1st and 14th centuries could meet.

Teeth & hair are significantly more scaffolded, more dense than blood, even in the dried form of a clot. Within keratin, do the eyebrows significantly image? Can they effectively be distinguished from the presumed bone structure/skin in this region (compare with area underneath eyes)? Is it keratin that’s being imaged or the collective density of it (in the hair around the face), similar with the teeth? I don’t know if the resolution down to cellular debris, protein of hair, teeth versus blood is equivalent. If the imaging mechanism, whatever it is, occurs at that magnitude, detail.

Once located, with a little practice you can clench it in between the thumb and the inside end of the mitt [I’ve done this personally with a water bottle many times, though with a least one eye open, I must admit]. You can always use two hands to trap it in between.

It’s hard to imagine that removing a portion from a bloodstained region would even be considered. Is the sensitivity of radiocarbon dating sufficient to evaluate a scraping or several blood flakes, particularly when divided up among several laboratories? Not my area, but it seems to be pushing the limit of detection. Colin, regarding study of AB antigens in aged bloodstains (as discussed on your website), I’m not certain that intactness or correct sidedness of any resealed red blood cells is really an issue in immunochemical evaluation of ABO antigens. True, reconstituted, resealed cells may be detected microscopically in ancient samples under certain conditions prepared for fixed staining, but it is unclear to what percentage of the total this may represent. Moreover, for immunochemical evaluation of ABO molecules, such experiments are typically performed in buffer systems that would (purposely) lyse and solubilize cell membranes, maximizing exposure and detection of any antigens present. Finally, a comment on the suggestion that [“ There could have been blood residues initially at the time of Shroud’s genesis, that have been ‘touched up’ by surreptitious additions of real blood, possibly blood of a carefully chosen group that best fits with ‘authenticity’ and what better group than AB, an overzealous custodian might have imagined…] The existence of ABO blood groups was unknown until approximately 100 years ago (Landsteiner reported their existence in 1900). Accordingly, any such “surreptitious addition” would had to have taken place relatively recently in the Shroud’s history, by a 20th century custodian…”might have imagined” is a good phrase to use..","date":"2012-07-15","mins":"1:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/15/why-not-carbon-date-the-blood-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Why not carbon date the blood on the Shroud of Turin?"}]
