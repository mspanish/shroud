And Some Comments."},{"id":"comment-28844","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"From comment # 18, “There is no evidence that the “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” paper in Nature, Vol. 337, 16th February, 1989, pp.611 615, was peer reviewed.” Science and Nature are considered by many researchers to be the top two science publications in the world. I am not certain what is meant by “no evidence”, but when any article is submitted for consideration to be published (in any peer reviewed journal, for that matter) it is typically reviewed by (at least) three referees. In the scientific peer review system, most manuscripts are submitted to reviewers anonymously (authors’ names omitted) to remove as much personal bias as possible. Authors may also respectfully request that certain individuals not be considered as potential reviewers due to a conflict of interest, a competitor who might intentionally sabotage a manuscript, for instance. Of course, in high profile studies, such as these, anonymity becomes rather transparent, as may be the case for those who work in very specialized areas, but the system exists to ensure as best as possible, that review and analysis remains objective and unbiased, that the focus is on the scientific merit of the data, irrespective of the author’s identity. In a similar manner, comments from the reviewers are returned to the author(s) in an anonymous fashion. Certainly, many may not be exactly familiar with the specifics of submission and publication in a scientific journal, but to say that “there is no evidence that the manuscript in Nature is peer reviewed” is unwarranted, without substantial documentation to show otherwise. Even for those not familiar with the particular scientific discipline, it is easy to view an author’s credentials/previous publication record, go to Pub Med and type in the last name and first initial. Any reviewer will know this the intent of anonymity is remove as much influence of bias as possible similar to the principles of a “blind study”. Approximately 80% of the NIH budget is devoted to funding of extramural (outside) grants. A major issue that comes up regularly on grant review panels is do they have the support/facilities necessary to carry this out? Thus, the location and identity becomes important, which is often supplemented with letters from collaborators. NIH is currently considering switching to an anonymous grant submission format to more effectively ensure unbiased evaluation of scientific proposals. Relatedly, regarding the objective evaluation of scientific data and opinions on “how real science is done”, I would add that the often heard cries of religious bias tainting various scientific aspects of the Shroud, appear in their own right, substantially biased. It is certainly possible to for a professional scientist to separate personal beliefs from the evaluation of data/results, to recognize where and when the line should be drawn. Pierre Barbet, who is often quoted as one of the main contributors to Shroud science said, “It is certain that this Body, in its glorious Resurrection, could leave the shroud with the same ease as when it entered the cenacle januis clausis “when the doors were shut”. This final difficulty brings us to what is, humanly speaking, more or less a physical impossibility. Science at this point can do no more than keep silence, for it is outside its domain.” He would add though, in the next sentence “But the man of learning at least has a glimpse that here is a palpable proof of the Resurrection.” “Barbet was a man of science and medicine he was also, obviously, a believer in the Resurrection. He could accept and recognize the domains of each. That’s where I think the heart of the issue lies. Many scientists have personal religious beliefs, favorite books, certain types of movies they like to watch, music they like to listen to the most intelligent favor the Beatles favorite foods, etc. It’s part of what makes them human at the lab bench, data sheets spread across the desk, it is possible to focus on being objective; many of the scientists I have known will often pull in an unsuspecting grad student or colleague, show them a result and ask them “so, tell me what do you see/think?” I’m not foolish enough to believe it’s always the case, but it is certainly possible to remain objective when it comes to matters of science that involve artifacts of a religious nature. It makes sense that the interest of the Shroud for many, including physicians or scientists, is because of their belief/faith in the first place. Okay, well that about does it.

The UK version lists him as an editor. I am not sure what Google Scholar says.

OK, so mineral salts are not a specific marker for blood, but they come into their own where degraded blood is concerned, where so many macromolecules will be severely degraded and damaged, losing their chemical, biological or immunological specificity and with it their utility as markers. The mineral salts should still be there, come what may, barring laundry cycles(which would have at least partly washed away bloodstains, or the appearance thereof, which is not the case). So while not specific markers, one can still insist they should be there. So where’s the potassium gone? Then there’s that collagen problem. Rogers detected a peak for hydroxyproline (HP) in Shroud blood, and used it (questionably in my view) to support an otherwise shaky thermochemical argument re scorching – or absence thereof. But HP should be a minor constituent of blood, except in some clinical situations like excessive bone resorption that cause breakdown of connective tissue collagen and subsequent release of HP into blood. But we’ve seen the crucifixion trauma explains all anomalies argument deployed – that it too produced raised blood HP levels by connective tissue breakdown. But collagen, animal collagen that is( boiled bones etc) is such an obvious additive to expect in any “forgery” scenario that a specific marker (HP) for its presence has to be assessed for cons as well as pros. Not to do so is to risk seeming biased and selective with the evidence. I’m still trying to think of the killer marker for ancient blood that everyone else has so far overlooked. I may be gone a while. Killer marker for ancient blood: Hemoglobin? Immunoglobulin? Serum Albumin? ABO antigens? If potassium or mineral salts are such a definable marker, why aren’t those typically used in the forensic evaluation of (dried) blood? Losing their immunological specificity? Antibodies used to detect such products are quite capable of recognizing denatured proteins that may have undergone alterations in their conformation or degradation. Polyclonal antibodies are especially adept at this as they are a mixture of the products of many different B cell clones. Such recognition is the basis of Western blotting.

Intact hemoglobin? If so, one should be able to get it to migrate on electrophoresis gels, or through gel filtration, and show by use of standards that it’s the real Mc Coy. I’m not aware of such evidence for intact hemoglobin, are you? So a crucial link in the evidence is missing, is it not, while anticipating the rejoinder that I’m simply asking too much of the Redeemer’s blood. OK, so let’s jump to the far end of the scale, where there’s still an intact free porphyrin, a very stable molecule by all accounts, which is what remains after globin and iron have been stripped out. A porphyrin chemist like Adler would have known precisely how to extract the free porphyrin of ancient blood, if suspecting that Hb was at intermediate states of degradation. So what’s the next step? It’s easy, because I’ve done it, or rather encountered free porphyrins on TLC plates. One needs only traces there to detect them by their intense red fluorescence under uv, so all Adler and Heller needed to do was run Shroud porphyrins against known porphyrin standards (of which Adler at least must have had a library of variants). Tell me this, Kelly. Did you ever read of such a simple straightforward experiment being done – i.e. To isolate the free porphyrins of Shroud blood, and run them against standards (and maybe do a mass spec fingerprinting on eluted pigment?). I have not (which is not to say the data are not there, but if that’s the case, then why is it not publicized?). What we see instead are uv/visible spectra of pigments which are the bluntest of instruments in tetrapyrrole chemistry (excluding the Soret band of porphyrins) and when an anomalous spectrum is found for Shroud porphyrin, we see Adler immediately rushing to construct exotic hypotheses based on bilirubin and crucifixion trauma, presupposing a narrative that he and his STURP colleagues were supposed to be testing, not assuming, when instead he should have been doing more experiments, like TLC or GLC mass spec to identify it chemically. That’s just hemoglobin for starters. Am I allowed to go back to calling it haemoglobin now? Let me do that, and I’ll promise not to mention my leech hypothesis – at least not in the presence of children. ; ) Colin, I would agree that additional, different experiments would have been helpful to supplement Adler’s analysis. I have never felt this was due to Adler being out of his realm of expertise, but doing what he was particularly specialized in, and also considering the fact that the amount of sample was relatively limiting. If given carte blanche with the forceps following their initial studies, I believe that Adler would have extended his work, including looking into a more detailed characterization and identification of the spectral profile. However, the Soret band to me seems pretty telling. I, too, would have liked to have seen more I once posted on this blog, Ten questions I would ask Alan Adler but I think you have to put in the context of the time this wasn’t his own laboratory where the generation of samples was under his control.

Even more sophisticated tests such as DNA analysis are not able to date the blood to a particular time period. If the DNA is degraded/fragmented (as has been reported for the Shroud), this would be consistent with older blood, but by no means conclusive there are a number of environmental conditions that can cause the same result in more recent samples.

Several tests that should have shown up blood failed to do so and this was after all a speciality of a forensic laboratory which is more than anything that Heller and Adler could provide. I am happy to stick to my view that the question of whether there is blood is certainly disputed. As I understand it, the absence of potassium is certainly an indicator that this may not be blood. But I am not an expert, the only expert personally known to me read a range of work including a long article by you Kelly and concluded that there was no clear evidence of human blood. So let’s leave it open. On page 12 of Heller’s book it says, “…Jackson called. He told me that in 1973 some Italian scientists had taken out a “blood” covered thread, tested it, and could not obtain a positive result. But, they added, it was not negative…” What to make of this? I, myself, don’t know? Heller went on to say in the following sentence that it was “double talk”. Also consider that Baima Bollone, a pathologist, performed blood studies as well, which surely would have contributed some expertise. Alder was a porphyrin chemist this speciality would include the identification of hemoglobin. Most current standard field tests for blood rely on similar chemical analysis as used by Heller & Adler & immunological tests for further confirmation. In first exploring the blood data, I consulted with numerous other scientists, many of whom I already knew personally, others whom I did not. These include colleagues in immunology, blood specialists, and forensic scientists, employed at Yale, Johns Hopkins, the NIH. I wanted to hear multiple, objective opinions, for me, the more the better. “No clear evidence of human blood”, could the same be concluded for the counterpart, paint or pigment? Or that there is positive evidence for such? I think the evidence is positive that the bloodstains contain blood products. I am somewhat hesitant to state that there is strong evidence that it is human blood. For me, primate blood, yes, the evidence is substantial, human blood, it could be better. The immunologist in me bristles a little bit when the phrase “human” blood is tossed around so cavalierly. If the phrase “human blood” is going to be used so repeatedly as a solid fact, there needs to be solid, scientific evidence for it. At the lab bench, the physical characteristics of the blood must be considered apart from the image. So, yes, of course, we can agree to disagree. I welcome discussion with those who have different viewpoints otherwise it would be pretty boring.

Ray Rogers was a charter member of the Coalition for Excellence in Science Education in New Mexico, which stressed the importance of teaching evolution in the schools. He was strongly against teaching creationism in the schools and actively lobbied against it. In one case he wrote a rather strong letter to the editor of the Los Alamos Monitor, the city’s local newspaper. R. N. Rogers 10 Jan. 1997 The Los Alamos Monitor Editor: Sig Hecker is the director of the most famous laboratory in the world, certainly the laboratory that has had the largest effect on humanity’s perception of science since the beginning of recorded history. This is The Laboratory that has shown people that they must take the effects of science seriously. It is also one of the laboratories that could teach the world just what science is and what they can expect from it. I have reason to believe that Sig Hecker is an exceedingly poor choice to represent science. The public largely does not understand exactly what science is, and there appears to he a strong desire not to be compelled to find out either in school or by personal study. A significant fraction of the public has a deep hate for what they think science is. Another fraction feels that its beliefs are threatened. Both groups have launched assaults on science, and the people who love science cannot believe that it is happening. It is! We have seen a very practical result in the State Board of Education that will have long term effects. Science is not “things.” It is a way of thinking. Classical Scientific Method is simply a method for objectively applying logic to the solution of problems. 1) The problem must be stated in clear terms, and obscure words must be defined clearly. The goal sought must also be stated clearly. 2) Everything known about the problem must be studied, and all references must be acknowledged. There must be no “hidden facts,” and it is not clever to “blind side” the opposition. Carefully planned observations should be made. Different methods of observation should be made when possible, and results must be checked for internal consistency and agreement with reported results. All observations must be taken seriously, until some justifiable and clearly stated reason can be found to eliminate any. 3) A “brainstorming” session, preferably with other workers familiar with the problem, should try to develop as many potential explanations (hypotheses) as possible (Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses), All hypotheses must be clearly stated. And 4), all of the hypotheses must be tested equally against the same, complete list of observations and facts. Testing may often involve making predictions on the basis of the hypotheses and testing the predictions by experiment. The Principle of Parsimony (Occam’s Razor) states that the hypothesis that includes the largest number of facts and observations will be closest to the truth. Hypotheses that do not accept many facts without “special pleading” should be discarded. We are now living in a time when the special pleadings have assumed more importance than the facts. An approach that does not include the components of Scientific Method is not “science.” A well tested hypothesis, for which no exceptions have been found, is called a “theory.” The word “theory” in science does not connote “speculation.” Creationists misuse the term to confuse the public. I asked Sig Hecker for help in the defense of science. He has, after all, espoused excellence in science” as his fundamental desire for the laboratory. With regard to creationism, his response was the following: “The lab has no official position on creationism. The media have tried, several times to get me to take a stance, and I have refused.” I suppose that a large government financed scientific organization must be politically correct. It might not be good for the careers of scientific managers to propose an official position on something like science. An individual scientist, however, might be expected to make continual application of classical Scientific Method. He would be expected to keep “truth” as his primary goal. He would be expected to defend his methods under peer review. I believe that Sig’s refusal to make a personal statement on creationism is his scientific position. If the laboratory is managed by creationists who still profess to be scientists, they should be willing to present all of their facts for public scrutiny. If they are not willing to do this, I believe that higher authorities should return the laboratory to scientific management as quickly as legally possible. Persons who value science should insist on it. R. N. Rogers Here is another letter. Any questions now about where Rogers stands? R. N. Rogers 17 Jan. 1997 The Los Alamos Monitor Editor: John Baumgardner’s response to my letter attributes statements to me that I did not make. I was advocating classical scientific method as the best approach to the solution of problems. I did not advocate or even mention atheism. I did not advocate any control over religious expression. Religion is “revealed”: The body of knowledge in science is developed by application of a specific logical process. The two operate in different spheres. Science and atheism are two different things. Trouble comes when a person attempts selectively to accept or deny scientific observations primarily on the basis of religious beliefs. By definition, a “scientist” is a person who uses scientific method. Like Caesar’s wife, a scientist must be above suspicion. The more “renowned” the scientist, the more careful he should be. I was accused of proposing atheism as official policy for the laboratory. I was accused of advocating control over free religious expression. Those are serious accusations. I did neither. The Greeks classified logical fallacies over two thousand years ago, and many fallacies appear in attempts to circumvent honest application of scientific method on any topic. Baumgardner’s accusations against me are a good example of an argument ad hominum, with which you attack a person rather thrums logic (common in politics). Invocation of great theist scientists seems to have as its unstated conclusion that “therefore, creationism is true.” True science should not use hidden premises; however, the type of argument used involves the non sequitur fallacy (argumentative leap). The most common fallacy I see used is “begging the question”: The argument assumes as true what it needs to prove. Hundreds of years of observations and measurements by thousands of scientists have provided the basis for the scientific theory of evolution. Has all of that been a conspiracy? Back to begging the question, can anyone prove that “science has falsified evolution” without first accepting the premise that God created everything, most things, some things, or (fill in the blanks)? In science you state your hypotheses and premises, and I have yet to see all of the creationist premises and/or hypotheses clearly stated. Incidentally, I hated to use the word “theory.” Its use by creationists illustrates another fallacy, the fallacy of equivocation. This involves the deliberate use of the same word or phrase in more than one sense. A scientific theory is more solidly established than a hypothesis. The theory of evolution has seen an amazing process of accretion of facts since it was first proposed, and it has proved to have predictive value. The fallacy of composition has often been used in attempts to disprove evolution. It involves the suggestion of some doubt and the application of that doubt to the attempted destruction of an entire body of knowledge. Each doubt must be critically analyzed, and I do not see that being done. Is it necessary to disprove anything to prove God? Do warped logic and outright lies support God? I admit that I have not read Behe’s book. I have, however, had a son who worked in Melvin Calvin’s laboratory at Berkeley, and I have read many of Calvin’s works. Calvin wrote Chemical Evolution, and he got a Nobel Prize. I have not seen any creationist work of similar stature. Perhaps a corporate philosophy that allows a lack of scientific rigor explains the lack of Nobel Prizes at Los Alamos. I would have to see some scientific analysis of creationists’ claims, made by creationists with rigorous methods, before I organized a symposium with them. I do not enjoy illogical polemics and vague claims. With or without scientific, method, I suggest most strongly that John Baumgardner watch very closely what he says or writes about any scientist R. N. Rogers Dan, Thanks for your effort on this It was interesting to read Rogers’ viewpoint in detail. I must be honest and apologize I was actually making a sarcastic comment, that if Rogers’ assigned some value to evolution (I had a pretty good idea what his views were), then his credibility in studying the Shroud must also be questioned, according to the SEJ school of thinking.

Regarding Charlie Rose’s comment about the current pope’s viewpoint being different than his predecessor, I believe that both BXVI & JP2 were convinced that the Shroud is authentic. BXVI has called the Shroud “An icon written in blood” and JP2 spoke that “The Shroud is an image of God’s love as well as of human sin. The imprint left by the tortured body of the Crucified One, which attests to the tremendous human capacity for causing pain and death to one’s fellow man, stands as an icon of the suffering of the innocent in every age” The position of the Catholic Church has always stopped short of declaring the Shroud authentic, but rather states that the Shroud is an object worthy of veneration, that is an object worthy of love & honor.

S Ince you’ve left the site, I guess you won’t be seeing this, though I don’t think it’s the weasel words and misrepresentations you can’t ignore, I think it’s just the attention. “Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact” Betrand Russel It’s just an opening shot. There will be more later to tell the real story that lies behind Kelly Kearse’s tribute to John H Heller, and the way he chose to lard the introduction with references to us sceptics. The real story is I recently reread the book myself, this past week. I decided to write about it, to recommend the book to others who may not be that familiar with it same for mentioning the interview contained in the last half of the book by Chase. Regarding your original post, “mere” is entirely my word, that is why I did not include it in quotes. Mere (def): being nothing more than what is specified, i.e. A “porphyrin chemist”. Had I wish to quote your own words regarding Alan D Adler, I would have chosen from “pseudoscience”, or “Mickey Mouse science”, etc. PS to Kelly Kearse: Heller did NOT write a textbook on the reticuloendothelial system, and published relatively little of importance in that area. He edited a multi author volume (something entirely different). Editing and authoring are two entirely different things. Heller did not say he was the author of a textbook the is no mention of it in his Shroud book. Those are my words. I was searching for a cover photo of the Report book on amazon, when I first became aware of the book. The US version of amazon lists him as an author. The UK version lists him as an editor. I am not sure what Google Scholar says. The title of editor is even more impressive than author as he is clearly recognized as an authority in the area the publisher recognizes him as having the knowledge & experience to correctly evaluate the writings of multiple authors in the field As to if he published relatively little of importance in that area, others can decide for themselves.","date":"2013-12-01","mins":"4:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/01/remembering-shroud-blood-scientist-dr-john-h-hellera-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Remembering Shroud Blood Scientist Dr. John H.

And what is simply ignored/not discussed, such as the alternate tests by Heller & Adler for the bloodstains being the product of some type of pigment. They looked for both sides of the coin, not just one selectively. Additionally, as someone pointed out in a comment in a previous post (O.K.? sorry, I don’t remember), the studies by Baima Bollone, who through chemical & immunological analysis also concluded that the stains were composed of real blood. BB had the advantage of using material rather than surface sampled tapes he once asked Jackson why they limited themselves to this approach and Jackson replied “because we underestimated the problem.”.","date":"2013-12-01","mins":"9:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/01/remembering-shroud-blood-scientist-dr-john-h-hellera-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Remembering Shroud Blood Scientist Dr. John H.
