[{"id":"comment-72183","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Terrific question. As others have commented, it is the collective evidence that I find the most convincing, but if I had to choose one in particular, it would involve the bloodstains. Particularly the details I am unsure that a medieval artist would have the foresight to include everything to be analyzed by scientists 700 years or so in the future. For example, why not just use the blood of an animal, who would know the difference? The serum halo rings on the wrist & side wounds, visible under uv light, how does an artist effectively create these using clotted blood? or how could they anticipate their detection, if added around the edges at a separate time, after “painting” the bloodstains? The directional flow of the blood, such as off of the elbow and the back of the foot (which aligns with a blood mark of similar size & shape next to the foot on the front side). Together, details such as these help to convince me that the cloth once wrapped a human body. I am not entirely convinced that it was Jesus’ body, although I think that it probably was. For me, I still keep open the possibility that it could have been artificially created although I am unsure exactly how..","date":"2014-01-04","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/04/what-one-single-characteristic-about-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"What one single characteristic about the shroud  . . . ?"}]
