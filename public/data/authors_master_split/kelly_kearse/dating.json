Now, that is the question : ) well, if it was found in the stains – then it has stayed there. Why and how – I don’t know. Yhe treatment of ALIVE jaundiced newborns and fixed stains on the Shroud – is a totally different issue. You do not have to expose the babies to the UV light – bilirubin is cleared from the blood all the time by the very body – it is one of it’s functions. UV light just help to prevent the kernicterus by changing the bilirubin from it toxic form to non toxic ( to the brain) 2. If the Shroud was taken out and uv light was specifically, uniquely filtered out, you would observe a “shift” in appearance from red to brown? If the epsilon stain were examined as such, one side filtered, one side not, you would see a brown/red split? That I do not know – one has to read the description of the experiments for the details. Theoretically if one puts a shield unpermeable to the UV light and then one part is irradiated and observed and the other as well – there should be a split. I do not know how practically possible is it to accomplish this, though – the stains are not large Okay thanks very much no more questions tonight, promise :) Enjoyed this discussion.","date":"2013-05-26","mins":"10:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"id":"comment-35016","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hello again jesterof (& others), jesterof I would like to begin by saying thank you again for the recent discussions more questions to follow below, of course, but I hope you don’t view this as an interrogation it is certainly not meant to be. Also, although it may appear that by asking so many questions, I am trying to challenge your viewpoint(s), this is not the case, I ask questions because I am interested. Respond as time (or patience ☺) permits, this is not designed to be an overwhelming barrage. BTW, a respite is soon forthcoming, at least from me, in a few days I will be away without any internet access for 2 3 days. Some of the posts seem to get bumped around I will number these comments to help keep them straight and make things easier to follow. 1. In the link provided by Louis (Faccini article), when I look at those images, which are a computerized processing of the TS image, they appear very brownish to me, as well, absolutely, though, to be honest, to my untrained eyes, it looks as though the contrast is dialed way up here, more than in some other photographs. This is one of the problems, I suppose, that how an image is enhanced, contrasted, photograph can influence the perception of color. I bring this up not to disagree, just wanted to comment that, I too, see the stains in these images as quite brownish. 2 A. In the other link provided by Louis (Goldini article), the last part of the paper discusses a model in which the differential appearance of the blood color “observed under special circumstances” (sunlight, without protective glass) is a result of a molecular change in the blood, some type of previous “neutron upset” that facilitates subsequent penetration of UV rays. It’s been proposed by some investigators that the blood was affected during the process that created the image. Comments/thoughts on this mechanism related to color and/or persistence of bilirubin over long periods of time? This “charging/changing” of the blood by a uv or energetic burst (Resurrection event) so that it now, upon subsequent exposure to uv light, it appears differentially colored than when not viewed under uv, do you think this “changing” could be explained by the Shroud simply being exposed to the sun throughout its history, including public exhibitions, draped over balconies, etc., similar to the natural effect of leaving a fabric out in the sun for a prolonged period of time? 2 B. In Jackson’s 1991 paper (“An unconventional hypothesis to explain all image characteristics found on the Shroud image”), he proposes that “it is reasonable to ask if analogous chemical changes [concurrent with image formation] might also have been induced in the blood.” He notes that “the off elbow bloodstain is brown, whereas the blood flow to which it is connected on the forearm is red, suggesting a possible chemical difference between on and off image bloodstains” The idea is also discussed in the 2006 paper by Fanti (“RGB analysis of the blood color: on image and out of image”), where the conclusion is made that “the on image blood color is really different from that of the out of image blood”. Any comments/thoughts here? Do you see a relative difference in this area? If so, could this be explained by physical, natural effects, different area/background of cloth, etc.? Does it make sense that the proximity to the body could be an important factor relative to the color perception of the blood? [As an addendum, answer the 2 A, 2 B series as you are comfortable here. I do not have an agenda other than engaging in a discussion this is not an entrapment nor recruitment exercise. Natural, supernatural, some combo for me personally, I don’t want to automatically rule anything in or rule anything out I want to look at the data and try to interpret it as objectively as possible how science measures the supernatural, I don’t have a clue, don’t think it can, other than if something out of the known, natural laws did happen, there must be a definable, molecular basis left as a result. If it’s there, it’s there if it’s not, it’s not. I am comfortable remaining open to considering all of the above possibilities. Anyway, enough said, that’s my two cents worth (again) on that, interested here in your comments. 3. Here’s a paper written by a physician, Nels Svensson, which I think you might find interesting if you haven’t already seen it. Http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Svensson Web.pdf Figures 10 13, Table 1 discusses a bilirubin experiment & blood color. This was performed by dripping whole blood onto cloth. The comment is made that in this experiment, the bilirubin is mainly composed of conjugated bilirubin, whereas in Adler’s hypothesis most of the bilirubin would be in the free form. Thoughts on the results? Also, any affect, influence of differential fluorescent/absorbance of uv with conjugated & unconjugated bilirubin? Does conjugated bilirubin fluoresce more/less with uv relative to unconjugated bilirubin? Would this support the idea of uv influence on appearance of the Shroud bloodstain color? Physiologically, (for the Shroud man) we are dealing primarily/almost exclusively with free bilirubin? The comment is made in the paper that “it is certainly difficult to find blood samples with high levels of free bilirubin.” Experimentally, could one examine the idea of uv > bilirubin: RED, no uv > bilirubin: BROWN using a microscopic approach by evaluating blood containing increasing amounts of exogenously added bilirubin using filters to selectively block the uv? Or a similar microscopic approach (selective filtering on & off) to examine Shroud fibers? 4. A comment on the Rogers’ experiment of spotting blood onto untreated versus Saponin treated cloth in relation to blood color. Saponin treated samples showing persistence of red color, untreated samples don’t. The bilirubin content of the samples is presumably in the normal range and regardless, the blood samples are the same, simply divided in half. Why the difference? I have always found these results interesting even though Saponin is hemolytic, and therefore is going to increase the amount of hemoglobin that’s released relative to the control group, eventually any released hemoglobin will oxidize to a brownish color; and the red blood cells in the control group will dehydrate and rupture and their contents will be released as well, essentially evening things out. Perhaps the influence of the effect that Saponin may have been overly emphasized (at least in my mind), because of the proposal that Saponin has left a thin layer of carbohydrates behind which could be important in image formation. Image formation is a separate issue. Regarding the blood, maybe there’s nothing that magic about Saponin treatment at all any hemolytic detergent, reagent would produce the same effect that was observed by Rogers What’s important is that the rbc contents are released due to the consequence of holes being formed in the membrane as the cells are ruptured on the hemolytic Saponin treated cloth. Everything is spilling out. Hemoglobin, bilirubin could hemoglobin, the porphyrin ring be split by detergent action to create biliverdin/bilirubin? For the rbcs in the non treated cloth, it’s more like a slow leak, eventually the membrane will dry out and collapse onto itself, with relatively minimal damage by comparison. This is why in preparing samples of old blood for microscopy, rbcs can become rehydrated, resealed and return to what looks like a somewhat preserved, typical morphology. As the cells on the non treated cloth dry, it’s like stacking blankets upon one another, most of the contents (hemoglobin, breakdown products) remain “within”, not released. In the case of the Shroud blood, physiologically the rbcs are already being ruptured/breaking down no need for Saponin treated cloth to play any role here necessarily if the cloth was treated, might enhance it over the top, lysing residual intact rbcs. Would be interesting to compare saponin treated cloth with cloth treated with other hemolytic reagents either soaked onto the cloth, or rbcs lysed in suspension, then transferred to the cloth following color with time. Additionally, maybe some similar type of filtering system could be applied here. Okay, there we go.

Hemoglobin, bilirubin could hemoglobin, the porphyrin ring be split by detergent action to create biliverdin/bilirubin? No, I do not think so. First of all there was already bilirubin in the blood and hemolysis as well – because of the trauma and process called rhabsomyolysis – and therefore I would suspect there would be myoglobin in the blood stream as well – the way myoglobin interferes with the color and process of oxidation – I have no idea – that’s to be tested. So by the time the body was covered by the cloth – there was enough bilirubin in the blood and other products as well. Why I assume there would be rhabdomyolysis? well, the extreme torture of the man of the Shroud together with dehydration will certainly result in such a process. You have to realize, that all the described is not occurring instantaneously, including metabolizing of hemoglobin to bilirubin – and the amount and time and conditions are all dependet on individual characteristics – one person have the fulminant process, whereas the other one will have it much slower. One will have an extreme hemolysis, the other one might have the kidney failure due to dehydration more pronounced, the third might have heart insufficiency – and all three subjected to the same torture. Hey jesterof, I was just referring to the blood added to the saponin treated cloth here the Rogers experiment things were spilling out due to saponin.","date":"2013-05-27","mins":"12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"id":"comment-35030","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Jesterof : As a final remark – I do not think saponin was the cause of hemolysis, but it might have been the additional factor for the “fixing” the hemoglobin – in a chemical reaction with it and therefore impeding the oxidation process.

Ditto for this one as the above remark when I mentioned I had found the saponin results particularly interesting, it was precisely because of some type of interaction or “fixing” like this that might be occurring the molecular basis for this is interesting, even apart from any results with the Shroud.

I based this hypothesis on 2 major points: 1 jesterof told us that, in his mind, there is nothing strange with the fact that the blood on the Shroud, that appears brown normally, become redder under the sun or under another source of UV light. 2 Doctor Pierre Barbet is, to my knowledge, the only Shroud researcher who’s also an expert concerning blood who was able to see the Shroud in sunlight during the 1933 exhibition (he said he saw it at less than 1 meter of distance!) and since he never address the issue of the so called “blood appear to be redder than normal” problem in his book, I have to assume that, in his eyes of experts, there was no problem at all with the color of the blood he saw in sunlight with his own eyes. In the end, if the blood really become redder than normal under the sun (I want to underline the “if” here), maybe this can simply be due to the presence of a level of bilirubin much higher than normal and nothing else. After all, maybe Adler was right after all! I also want to tell people to be very prudent concerning the claims made by people like Fanti and Jackson who, this is evident, wants to use every little thing they can to link the Shroud image with the Resurrection of Christ! Personally, since both of them are not expert in blood at all and both are members of the supernatural fringe, I don’t have any time to waste in listening their “theories” concerning the blood because I know this is only biased thinking based on the “I think I see syndrom”… You do what you want but personally, I prefer by far to listen to experts in blood like Barbet and Adler. Both have seen the Shroud in person in Turin (Adler saw it in 1997) and both have conclude instantaneously that the stains could not have been made of anything else than blood, while never seem to have been bothered by the so called reddish aspect of it. This speaks very loud to me. That’s why I think that if the blood is really redder than normal under the sun, this difference must not be thought as being supernatural in any way… Question to conclude my comment: Don’t you think that if the color of the blood would have been so strange, Adler and Barbet (both experts in blood who saw the Shroud at very close range) would have had some doubts before they conclude that this was surely the real blood of a crucified man? Don’t you think that they would have been much more prudent in their claim? The fact is this: When they saw the Shroud live in Turin, both expert IMMEDIATELY conclude that this could not be anything else than real blood… Again, this simple fact is very telling for me. I really don’t think we should start thinking that the blood on the Shroud is so unusual that it must have been submitted to a burst of UV light! Religiously biased science is truly the worst thing that ever happened to the Shroud of Turin… Note: The critics contained in this comment only concern guys like Fanti and Jackson who have publicly stated that they believed the Shroud image to have been formed during the Resurrection of Christ… I would disagree with you I don’t think I omitted that possibility, for example this comment at the end of 2 A, “This “charging/changing” of the blood by a uv or energetic burst (Resurrection event) so that it now, upon subsequent exposure to uv light, it appears differentially colored than when not viewed under uv, do you think this “changing” could be explained by the Shroud simply being exposed to the sun throughout its history, including public exhibitions, draped over balconies, etc., similar to the natural effect of leaving a fabric out in the sun for a prolonged period of time?draping over balconies, etc.” This sound like a totally natural process to me… I would also modify your statement in that I would consider a high amount of bilirubin in the blood an usual situation so things are not entirely normal but of course, with a perfectly natural explanation and physiological basis given the conditions that exist. I simply do not accept the notion that if a scientist believes in the Resurrection, he or she must be disqualified in terms of integrity or honesty or good science practice. The Shroud could be the product of totally natural events or supernatural events or some combination. No one knows, including yourself. Ironically, if not for the efforts of one of those whom you criticize in organizing a research team, guys like you would have a lot more free time and a lot less to talk about. I did not become interested in the Shroud to try to prove the Resurrection. I’m not sure how you would. I don’t know about anyone else. In my opinion, this constant personal criticism is rude it dilutes the discussion from being data driven. It makes me not want to listen to anything you have to say. Please, enough with this constant hounding and attacking of others personal views, including mine.

Not doubting the findings, have heard this referred to in the literature several times, have always been interested to see the actual results.

Yannick, what exactly is the best empirical evidence that the Shroud was once treated with saponin weak background fluorescence? I know historically there is evidence of the processing methods of linen, but am referring in relation to the STURP findings (Rogers). Saponin glycosides were assayed for, but not detected, correct?

Adler, himself puzzled over it and with experimentation told me that he could duplicate the “redness” of the blood by assuming that the Man of the Shroud was a victim of blood trauma where the billirubin was some 500 times concentrated. Dr. Gilbert Lavoie told me that he and Adler were working on this possibility and that Lavoie had, in his refrigerator, a sample of tramatized blood taken from a man who had suffered from a chain gang beating. To my knowledge, little further was done on this because Adler passed away from a severe brain hemmorage–a tragic loss to us all. One might ask Dr. Lavoie for input on this matter. But, to another question put to me by the late lawyer, Benjamin Wiech–why does the blood color appear to keep changing?–I responded that it will depend on the lighting that illumines it. The “true” color is not seen unless the full spectrum of light shines on it. (Sunlight is the best resource for this–but, of course, we do not wish UV rays to damage the Shroud and so that is usually filtered out). Hi jesterof, 1. Was wondering how a bilirubin level 500 times concentrated would compare relative to the levels observed in a patient suffering liver failure or jaundiced newborn? I realize that these are different scenarios that are apart from trauma & torture leading to death, but just looking for something to understand as a relative comparison. Also, in terms of laboratory experimentation to create a blood simulacra, are these the levels that are necessary? Adler remarked in one of his spectra descriptions using finger stick blood samples, that the amount of protein (albumin) they added was too high, so this would be in excess of that. Any numbers on bilirubin levels for normal versus elevated versus extreme traumatic death? 2. Also, your opinion that the color of the blood on the Shroud is not unusual, that it is not redder than expected, based on your experience has been discussed before. You also reference it in this thread would like to just touch on that again, if okay. As quoted above, Adler seemed puzzled by it. I just want to understand your viewpoint, not trying to make you scream or anything. To clarify, do you believe that the color of the blood on the Shroud is not unusual, period, for any dried, aged blood, or that the color of the blood on the Shroud is not unusual for someone that had undergone such experiences of physiological & psychological stress? For those of us that aren’t experienced with observing lots of blood first hand on a regular basis, an issue that has been commented on before by others is the question of relatively fresh blood versus that which is months, years, many years old that is, if observation & experience with one necessarily equates with the other. I don’t view this as a criticism, just an open question. I also think from the discussion above, there seems to be the idea that perception of the blood color can be highly influenced by the conditions in which one is viewing it, particularly when photographs are used. Finally, a general comment regarding Mc Crone and the blood: A few weeks ago I spoke with Dr. Henry Lee, the forensic examiner in several high profile cases (OJ, Jon Benet Ramsey, Lacy Peterson). In the conversation, he mentioned that Mc Crone had contacted him several times about survival of blood proteins (globulins, albumin) and the electrophoretic analysis of aged bloodstains. Don’t know if this was to learn more regarding the tests that he, himself, was conducting he found it difficult to solubilize the samples in general or if he might have had some (private) second thoughts. I have read Mc Crone’s book and especially enjoyed reading the correspondence between him and Fr.

But, how does one accurately determine the relative volume of blood contained within a thread or tape lift from an aged, dried bloodstain? What volume do you normalize it to? A thread that received more blood transferred relative to one that received less will appear to have a higher concentration of that protein per surface area, even though the overall levels in the original blood should be equivalent.

Did Adler hear this originally from Mc Crone or did he reach his opinion independently?

The units used are just the units used, it is an agreed method, the spectrophotometry uses the wavelength absorption and then the y have to use some mathematical conversion tables. I am not the mathematician or statistician and those details are beyond my knowledge. I can dig on line to it, but I just do not see what is the confusion. If we calculate the concentration of the substance it does not matter what we will refer to – a stain or serum of the alive patient. You may calculate it by using the presented method by the dried sample on a paper ( and it will tell you how much of the substance is per volume unit of blood, or serum, since those are commonly agreed values of reference) or by measuring the whole amount in a sample of blood which will be exactly 100 ml – but the latter is just impractical. I believe it is an area of analytical chemistry which I’ve studied back in medical school, but forgive me, I have forgotten it long time ago : ) ” A thread that received more blood transferred relative to one that received less will appear to have a higher concentration of that protein per surface area, even though the overall levels in the original blood should be equivalent. ” No it would not. Because they do not calculate ABSOLUTE amount of any substance in that particular point, but adjust it accordingly to the unit of measurement. For microspottingtechniques: The adjustment is precisely the problem. If you have no adjustment, nothing to normailize it to, then you can’t accurately quantitate the value. I realize they do not calculate absolute amount, it is adjusted or normalized that’s where the issue is how do you calculate unit volume for a thread, tape lift to make the adjustment? It is like trying to calculate speed by knowing how far someone ran, but not having an accurate measurement/value for time. Or knowing how much money someone has in their pocket from work, but not knowing how many hours they were there and trying to determine their wage. For whole blood, serum, or pipetting a known amount of blood as shown in the link, no problem, you can make the adjustment easily. The figures shown express the amount there per unit volume because they know the amount of volume that was used. For a sample dried on a thread, or a tape lift, this is a great unknown you can tell how much is there, but per what unit volume? For spectroscopy, my understanding is that this is semi quantitative at best a relative comparison can be made between heights of particular peaks to evaluate their general representation, but without something to compare it to, can you truly quantitate how much is there?.","date":"2013-05-26","mins":"8:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"id":"comment-34956","author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Jesterof : If you calculate how much does the stain weighs and then how much of that weight is hemoglobin ( as an example) an you get that it is half the weight of the whole stain you may refer to it as hemoglobin concentration is 50% of the stain which is also the unit measurement.

But since this is an area where there is also disagreement perhaps a second examination is in order, whenever that will be possible. Looking forward to reading that when it comes out. Baima Ballone, in reference to an up close visual examination of the blood areas of the cloth, once commented, “We have to bear in mind that under these traces the threads of the cloth appear to be “clean”. This means they do not display the colouring that characterizes the image of the body, which proves that the imprint of the anatomical parts and of the lesions came about in a moment that was chronologically subsequent to when the traces in question were deposited.” Image under blood (or not) is an interesting question.

The text refers to Jesus being raised in the spirit, but in the various post resurection manifestations, he also appears to enjoy some corporeality: the appearance to Thomas, the meal at Ephesus, his being mistaken for the gardener, cooking breakfast at Lake Galilee.

I’ve always been open to the possibility that teeth are visible on the Shroud image; to me, the mouth on the Shroud looks more closed, though. 2. What happened to the rest of the mustache/beard on the veil relative to the Shroud? 3. For me, the main things with overlays is what about control images, i.e. Doing the same analysis on 3 unrelated bearded men there has to be a certain amount of overlap between all of them how much, I think, can be relatively subjective. The cloning enthusiasts show a pretty reasonable morphing/overlay of Prince William & the Shroud, including bearded & clean shaven PW versions.

Is it reasonable to anticipate that some effect of banding/weave might be observed on the veil image if the order is body/Shroud/veil? 2. If the bloodstains protected the image formation on the Shroud, wouldn’t they also protect the image formation in all corresponding locations on the veil? 3. Have you ever seen the veil in person?

The task will be to convince reasonable doubters that they are wrong, not to confirm the true believers in their faith. My advice will no doubt be worthless in this circumstance, but on behalf of the ‘reasonable doubters’ I feel obliged to offer some. 1) An opinion is not evidence. (So and so declares that the blood is real blood) 2) Guesswork is not evidence. (The scourge marks match the ends of a Roman flagrum) 3) A question is not evidence. (Who could have painted such an accurate portrait?) 4) Incredulity is not evidence. (An artist would never have painted a nude Jesus) 5) Ignorance is not evidence. (No one knows how it could have been painted) Larry Schauf’s entertaining article in Catholic Answers, featured here a little while ago, postulated the trial of a fictitious thief, whose conviction depended on the Shroud being authentic. I was pretty sure I could get him aquitted. Stephen Jones appears to be collecting evidence for the prosecution of a real person, working for the Arizona Radiocarbon Laboratory, whose conviction also depends on the Shroud being authentic. I’m pretty sure I can get him aquitted too. [As a bit of a sideline, Stephen’s “fraud” hypothesis has shifted from a single KGB mastermind hacking into all three computers via the internet to three KGB operatives each working in their own labs. However, only one of these is currently the object of his accusation. I do hope he will look carefully at (and of course accuse one of them) Rupert Housley, Ian Law and Colin Perry, of the University of Oxford and also minor signatories of the 1988 Nature paper. They are all still alive and working, and their email addresses are easy to find…] I, too, am in favor of objectivity and systematic scientific investigation in anything regarding the Shroud and support reasonable doubt, I think it’s healthy. However, postulate 1 differs from 2 5 in that empirical evidence carries more weight than a mere opinion or guesswork unlike the others listed below it, there is some scientific data available here, you know and it is the collective evidence which should be considered. Both those from chemical studies & immunological studies. It is unknown if other components might also be present in addition to those characteristic of blood. It has not been scientifically established if such blood was transferred from a body or applied at some later time, or both.
