[{"id":"comment-4207","author":"suzanne","post":"I’m a recent Survivor of Domestic Violence and was feeling down. God has been a tremendous source of comfort for me over the years and still is. He has always done many miracles also. One of the miracles is using these comments today I have seen on this site to encourage me when I needed it most. I have been through so many things and one of the problems was listening to Religious Leaders who tell us to put up with things we don’t need to put up with but I will say this… even in the midst of the trials… My Heavenly Father through Jesus has never ever let me down when I need comfort and peace as long as I tell Him my sorrows and read His Word He comforts me… so I urged those who doubt to simply talk to Him. He will reveal Himself to you..","date":"2011-10-17","mins":"2:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
