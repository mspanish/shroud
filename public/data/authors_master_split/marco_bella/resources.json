The parks at M=96 it is not furfural, but just one of these peak. Therefore, the two spectra in Rogers paper differ only by the peaks of the contaminant.

In the 2005 TA paper by Rogers you can read: ———– “…The chemical ionization system used was the most sensitive MS at the time, sufficiently sensitive to detect parts per billion traces of oligomers from the polyethylene bag that Gonella had used to wrap the Raes threads…” ———— Therefore, it appears that Rogers was aware about the presence of a contaminant in the spectra (not “spectrograph”), and this contaminant would give a mass spectra (cluster of peaks differing by 14 atomic mass units) quite similar (identical?) to the one actually observed for his mass spectra of Raes sample. He did not mention these foreign peaks due to the contamination in his discussion of the spectra. Moreover indicated that the peak at M=96 was due to furfural, while it is clear that it is instead due to the contaminant. In my opinion, the word “misleading” is justified..","date":"2015-09-09","mins":"11:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/09/significant-response-to-the-preview-of-the-thermochimica-acta-editorial/","cat":"article","title":"Significant Response to the Preview of the Thermochimica Acta Editorial"}]
