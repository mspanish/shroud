Vidal and Testore (textile experts who have personally examined the Shroud) have chosen that corner to take the C14 sample. Vercelli and Flury Lemberg (textile experts who have personally examined the Shroud) found the same corner homogeneous with the rest of the Shroud. If Professor (?) Marinelli or others have a problem thinking that this is a bad location, I do not know what can convince them. —————— Professor [?] Rogers pointed out that thymol use in cleaning the Shroud container could compromise the accuracy of a new radiocarbon dating of the cloth. —————— The C14 date might change marginally using a sample contaminted by thymol , but in order to move foward the date by 1300 years (what sindonologists wish) the amount of thymol (which is a white solid) in the sample should weigh more that the linen. Furthermore, C14 samples are cleaned with organic solvents before the C14 determination, and the traces of thymol would be removed anyway. Actually, the late Ray Rogers also said (this time correctly) that a new C14 analysis could be performed using the charred material from the 1532 fire removed during restauration of 2002, since fire does not alter the ratio between carbon isotopes..","date":"2015-11-27","mins":"3:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/25/finally-an-explanation-for-the-exclamation-mark/","cat":"lectures","title":"Finally, An Explanation for the Exclamation Mark!"},{"id":"comment-196234","author":"marco_bella","post":"Since it appears you really like the subject: http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/04/13/sindone quando la storia puo essere rigorosa quanto la scienza/1584100/ PS please do not use google translator.
