First of all, we should consider that the peak seen in mass spectrometry are not correlated in a linear way with concentration. A peak can be higher than another but actually be less abundant.

However, oligomers of polyethylene would actually give compatible spectra. 2) ——— >more precise determination would require an >identification of the other peaks, in particular peak m/z >131, which you have not identified its provenance. —— Correct, but the fact that this peak is present as the major peak in both spectra (not considering contamination) points towards identity of the two samples, therefore actually denying the “medieval invisible mending” theory. Please notice that it is Rogers which should have given evidence about the “invisible mending”. Let’s assume you affirm that there is a “pink invisible dragon” in your garage which only you can see, giving only a very confused photo. Your job is to demonstrate this statement; my job is just to say that the photo is really confusing and that there is no evidence. 3) ——– >But more importantly, your determination of the >abundance of m/z 96 coming from the “contaminant” >is unproven in your publication..etc ……….. This is unproven in Rogers’ paper. Surely, the contaminant would have this peak, and we do not have any element to say it is furfural.

If the relative abundance of a peak is too low, it would not be quantified in mass spectra. Rogers, in order to show the absence of the peak at M=126 should have taken a cleaner spectra, where the major peak would be in both the one at M=131. Since this was not done, again we do not have any evidence.

No other part of the shroud shows such a coating. The early thermal evolution of furfural during pyrolysis/ms analyses, the relatively easy water solubility, the yellow color formed with iodine, and the easy hydrolysis suggest gum Arabic. Gum Arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal and is composed of pentose sugar units. Its presence as a major component in the coatings on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is not a surprise, because it has long been a common vehicle in tempera paints. The radiocarbon sample had been dyed. Dyeing was probably done intentionally on pristine replacement material to match the color of the older, sepia colored cloth… ————– So, the presence of Arabic gum is “suggested” by: 1)“thermal evolution of furfural [peak at M=96] during pyrolysis”> the peak at M=96 belongs to the cluster of the contaminant and, as said many times, could be many different things. A single peak in mass spectrometry is not enough to confirm anything. 2)“Relatively easily [relatively respect to what?] water solubility”, you tell me which significance that has. Millions of substance dissolve in water, starting from salt and sugar. 3)“yellow color formed with iodine” Millions of compounds form a yellow color with iodine, therefore it is used in most chemistry laboratories around the world to stain the TLC spots. You tell me how reliable this identification is. You also wrote: ———– >On the other hand, the spectrum is not very far from >what Rogers concluded, in particular, furfural [the >peak at M=96] appears present in that spectrum and >the intensity at m/z 126 is negligible. ——— Please refer again to the “pink dragon argument” illustrated above. Find someone that knows how mass spectrometry works and ask how confident would the expert be to say that “…the spectrum is not very far from what Rogers concluded…” ———— >My second point is that you made an error by over >interpreting that spectrum… ———— The title of our editorial is “There is no mass spectrometry evidence that the C14 sample from the Shroud of Turin comes from a “medieval invisible mending”. Please refer again to the “pink dragon argument”. What about the interpretation of Rogers? Can we speak of over interpretation here, should we use your standard? Do you really think he did present convincing arguments to dismiss what the textile experts stated after direct analysis of the Shroud? ———— >You also made a clear call on m/z 126, stating that it >would become a value similar to the spectrum from >the image only sample once the contaminant was >removed. But, this is arithmetically impossible if you do >some simple calculation, whatever that contaminant is. >(multiple by 4 (the ratio for m/z 131 between the two >spectra) the near zero value of m/z 126, and you >certainly cannot get close to 25 as in the image only >spectrum.) ———— Again, go to an expert in mass spectrometry and ask. Briefly, response is not linear in mass spectrometry, and the ratio of peaks intensity changes with pyrolysis temperature (which Rogers did not report), so your argument is meaningless. Don’t DIY in science. ————— >In other words, something else appears at play with >that spectrum and it could be what Rogers concluded… ————– Nothing can be concluded if you do not have enough evidence. The pyrolysis mass spectra have been taken in the eighties and left in a drawer for about twenty years. They resurfaced only to support the “invisible mending” theory. Why? Reasoning in the same way Rogers did in his paper I could easily say that there is an invisible pink dragon in my garage. About pseudoscience, here it is what is written on Wikipedia: ————— Pseudoscience is a claim, belief or practice which is incorrectly presented as scientific, but does not adhere to a valid scientific method, cannot be reliably tested, or otherwise lacks scientific status. Pseudoscience is often characterized by the use of vague, contradictory, exaggerated or unprovable claims, an over reliance on confirmation rather than rigorous attempts at refutation, a lack of openness to evaluation by other experts, and a general absence of systematic processes to rationally develop theories. A field, practice, or body of knowledge can reasonably be called pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms. ———— Decide by yourself what can be considered pseudoscience among “invisible mending theory”, Rogers’ paper and our editorial, using as benchmark the above definition. Why not just accepting the statement/title of the editorial “there is no evidence etc.”, forget about whatsoever “invisible mending” and let Rogers rest in peace?.","date":"2015-09-25","mins":"1:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/14/the-chemist-rogers-and-plastic-bags/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Chemist Rogers and Plastic Bags"}]
