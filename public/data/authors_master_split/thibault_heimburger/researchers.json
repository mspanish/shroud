This paper is only about IMAGING. In the paper we can only see some photographs of the distribution of Ca, O, Cl and K on Shroud fibers and some comments. No spectrum. Therefore the reference itself is misleading. However, it is true that later Levi Setti did the positive and negative secondary ion mass spectrometry of the samples for Kohlbeck and Nitowski. I have read that someone (I can’t remember who exactly) asked him if it was true and that he confirmed this fact but never published himself anything on the subject. I do not know if the sentence about the “good match” is from him or rather from Nitowski or Kohlbeck. Looking at the spectra in high resolution, the good match is obvious (at least for me).

He confirmed he was the author of the SIMS spectra included in the BAR issue (New evidence may explain�” by Kohlbeck and Nitowski). The spectra are the original even though they are labelled with “Adapted by E.Nitowski” But the most astonishing answer from Dr. Levi is that he never analyzed several samples of limestone from the nine Israeli sites. According to him, this is not true…” In “the environmental study of the Shroud in Jerusalem”, Nitowski/Kohlbeck are referring to the “Levi Setti’s charts” of the other sites. 1) Levi Setti never performed this comparison 2) The tool used for the comparison was not SIM but energy dispersive electron microscopy (certainly performed by Kohlbeck) and the quality of the graphs is very poor 3) The energy dispersive graph of the Jerusalem tomb is simply not shown for comparison with the other sites in this paper. Too bad …. What can we conclude for sure from the “aragonite studies” ? 1) Some of the calcium containing particles found on the Shroud are very likely aragonite 2) Some of those particles have a chemical signature consistent with that found in the limestone of a tomb in Jerusalem (SIMS spectra from Levi Setti). No more and this needs to be confirmed. Nevertheless, if confirmed, it should be difficult to explain how and why a medieval forger would have placed on the Shroud some dirt containing aragonite (from France ?) having by chance the same composition than the aragonite found in Jerusalem !.","date":"2012-08-30","mins":"9:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/barrie-schwortz-announces-latest-changes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-website-stera-inc/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz Announces Latest Changes to the Shroud of Turin Website (STERA, Inc.)"},{"id":"comment-142806","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Anoxie No, I did’nt try to contact Di Costanzo.

Actually, all of Rogers’ discoveries (the strongly anomalous cotton content, the dye and, last but not least, the vanillin tests) were performed on several threads coming from the Raes sample adjacent to the C14 samples. Those Raes threads were given to STURP (in fact Rogers) on the order of Card. Ballestrero himself. No secret here. Since the Raes sample and the C14 samples necessarily shared at least some threads, Rogers thought that the entire Raes/C14 corner was not representative of the bulk of the TS. However, as a true scientist, he wanted to verify specifically this point. Later, he could obtain 2 tiny pieces of threads coming from the center of the C14 dated sample. He could confirm the presence of dye as well as the very high amount of cotton in these 2 threads. To my knowledge, for some reasons (lack of time or smallness of the samples or..) he did not perform the test for the vanillin on these C14 pieces of thread. Shortly, Rogers’s discoveries re the anomalous characteristics of the Raes/C14 corner came from the detailed study of an arguably representative genuine sample (Raes piece 1). He confirmed them on 2 small pieces from the center of the C14 sample. Those pieces were truly from the center of the C14 sample and there is a clear “chain of custody”, although unpublished for understandable reasons. One can discuss endless each of his observations but taking them together they point to the only scientifically acceptable contestation of the C14 results. I agree that it’s difficult to accept knowing the opposite conclusions of the textile experts (F.Testore, G. Vial and M. Flury Lemberg). But read carefully what follows: My friend journalist Brice Perrier, after a detailed investigation wrote a book in 2011: “Qui a peur du Saint Suaire ?” (in French, Ed. Florent Massot, 2011). This is simply the best serious investigation that includes many interviews of most people (pro and cons) involved in the TS. He wrote (p.126): “I went to see one who was recommended to me by both archaeologists and Lyon textile museum experts as the best expert in ancient fabrics, Christophe Moulherat.” Brice told me that, at the time, Moulherat did not know that the C14 samples came from a single location rather than from three different locations as he thought. He was shocked and added (p.242): “for this kind of fabric, I would have at least chosen to test separately warp and weft threads coming from at least two different locations” Brice: “I asked him if there were actually invisible repairs. [Moulherat’s answer]: ‘No, they can be seen if you have the means to see them. Just do a thorough analysis. But for that, you must have access to the fabric and do not look to the naked eye because there you’ll see nothing (..).You need microscopes. If one has tampered threads with the desire to hide something, you have to think about that before and you have to be equipped to see that. Otherwise, if the repair is well done you can miss it. You really need a detailed analysis’. G. Vial and F. Testore are/were beyond any doubt competent textile experts but the conditions of the C14 sampling were far from those necessary to detect a repair..","date":"2014-08-07","mins":"8:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/05/5050-colin-berrys-most-outlandish-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"50/50  :  Colin Berry’s Most Outlandish Proposal"},{"id":"comment-75778","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Thank you Colin, Some years ago, I studied in depth the complex problem of lignin/vanilin.

In this sense, Colin is right about the superficiality at fabric level. But the time/temperature parameters needed are very narrow. There are also other facts that I found in Jackson’s paper (I had it) which I can confirm that are hard to explain with this hypothesis. But today I did look at the threads under the microscope. I will not explain here why, but I am now sure that the scorch hypothesis do not match the observed FACTS on the Shroud. Yes Paulette : not only heat (whatever the mean) “could not have produced the sort of superficial discoloration that exists on the Shroud image” (I will show that in detail) but even a very mild heat produces something that does not exist on the Shroud image. If Colin is going to write an open letter to the Royal Society, I simply suggest him to wait for the paper I’ ll write here (the difficulty is not what I see under the microscope but to obtain good photographs).

Before explaining why (although the reasons can be easily found in my paper), I would like to see a demonstration of your hypothesis..","date":"2013-01-27","mins":"9:19 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres)."},{"id":"comment-1790","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"CB wrote: “TH chooses the crudest “bas relief” template imaginable – a metal plate with a shallow, steep sided recess to represent “relief”. He gets some scorches that not surprisingly have excessive differences in scorch intensity and contrast between the two flat iron like planes, and then proceeds to enunciate general principles for why the Shroud cannot possibly be a scorch”. Apparently, CB did not read my paper. Otherwise he would have seen than the major part of it is dealing with the microscopical characteristics of ANY KIND of scorch at fabric and thread level and not with the problem of contrast or relief. Because my model has no slightly rounded relief, CB thinks that all my observations and photographs are not reliable. Does CB think that with a slightly rounded relief rather than with a flat template, the microscopical characteristics of the color distribution (and all my observations) at fabric, thread and fiber level should be very different ? In order to produce an imprint one have to apply a hot surface on the linen. I did it with the kind of “crudest bas relief” I used because it was the only mean to test different temperatures, different pressures and different contact times. Using a “better” bas relief (in the sense of CB), one can certainly obtain a better “image” but its characteristics at fabric, thread and fiber level cannot be different than the characteristics showed in my paper because the fundamental mechanisms are similar. And in any case, these characteristics are very different from those observed on the Shroud. Looking carefully at the slightest King George VI horse brass picture (on the right), I can predict what follows: With a microscope: 1) In the darkest parts (nose, hear, crown etc.) one will find all the characteristics of the “scorch” as described in my paper; 2) in the lightly scorched areas, one will find all the characteristics of the “light scorch” as described in my paper 3) In the white areas, one will find..no color (contrary to the shroud) or perhaps some fibers described as “very light scorch” in my paper. To summarize, with a “good” template, one will find all the characteristics I found with my “bad template” but on a single image. I challenge CB to prove that I am wrong but now with photographs at fabric and thread level. We will see who is agenda driven.

Charles you wrote: “Thibault. Please give me your estimate of the proportion of the total sample submitted to the labs that was cotton. Your own estimates suggest it was very small and not enough to sway the date significantly. But if there was also linen in the reweave, then why did there need to be cotton as well? I have never bought the Rogers thesis because it does not make sense to me but perhaps you can enlighten me. So that is my problem and any clear answers would be much appreciated!” Barrie has already answered: cotton is known to retain the dye much more than linen. The presence of the dye in this area is an indisputable fact. So the presence of cotton makes sense. If there is a repair, we are necessarily speaking of threads. The new pieces of threads were SPUN with a mixture of linen and cotton so that they looked like the threads of the Shroud (thickness, Z twist etc..). The only thing the weaver could not imitate was the sepia color of the surrounding fabric. This might explain the dye and consequently the cotton. Regarding the proportion of “new threads” versus “old threads” I can not answer since I do not know when the repair had been performed. If, as Sue Benford (RIP) and Joe Marino suggested the repair was made during the 16th century the proportion of “new threads” is about 66%. If the repair was made in the 19th century (see Max post) the proportion of “new threads” is of course much lower. You wrote: “The problem is that no one has yet found that cotton THREAD was interwoven with linen in the specific samples used by the radiocarbon labs. I have not seen as yet a piece of weave from the Shroud with the cotton threads shown interwoven with the linen. What Raes found was cotton fibres that he though had drifted in from a previous weave.” What do you mean exactly by “interwoven”?There is NO cotton THREAD either in the main part of the Shroud or in the C14/Raes area. But there are at least several threads in the C14/Raes area which have an abnormal high cotton content and the cotton fibers are also found in the CORE of those threads. It means that the cotton found in those threads is likely not a contamination as described by Raes but more likely the result of a voluntary action: some of the Raes/C14 threads are “new threads” with both “new” linen and cotton fibers spun together. Gilbert Raes found some cotton fibers in his Piece 1 (from the main part of the Shroud) but no cotton in Piece 2 (from the side strip). We know that the side strip (Raes Piece 2) was woven at the same time as the main part of the Shroud and that it was actually a part of the Shroud fabric.

So Raes found “traces of cotton” in some threads of his piece 1 (main part of the Shroud) but no cotton in some other threads coming from the same piece 1. The cotton is “not superficial” and Raes was sure that those cotton fibers were not a surface contamination but were part of the original Shroud yarns. This is consistent with Rogers findings and also with my own findings (Raes#7) except for one thing: the term “traces of cotton”. Rogers wrote (A chemist’s perspective on the Shroud of Turin, p.66): “I did not attempt to make a quantitative cotton comparison between Raes and radiocarbon threads and Shroud tapes, because there was too little cotton of any kind on Shroud samples (..) We could not find more than traces of cotton on the Shroud. The cloth appeared to be pure linen”. I can not add anything to my own study of Raes#7 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdf It is clear (at least to me) that in the same small area (Raes), there are threads with many cotton fibers (probably “new” threads) and threads without cotton fibers (probably genuine Shroud threads)..","date":"2014-08-09","mins":"3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"},{"id":"comment-142856","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Anoxie: “who said reweaving was done exclusively with cotton ?” Charles: “No one is saying that but was reweaving done in both linen AND cotton?” Yes Charles.

The idea that it was drawn clearly both so as to fit in with the technicalities of engraving, and to show people who bought it what they should have seen had they only got close enough does not explain the differences in posture and apparel very well. Did none of these eminent artists actually see the artefact they were representing, and did they all copy something else?” You give yourself the reason for which the TS image is clearly drawn with sharp outlines on the depictions of the Shroud during the exhibitions (engraving). The differences in posture? Legs and feet. The feet are not seen on the TS image, except the sole of the right foot on the back side. Looking at the TS from far, what do you see? Mainly the bloodstains. There are two clearly separate bloodstains on the back side. Those bloodstains are the only markers that could be seen from far during the exhibitions. Two bloodstains, two separate feet. Since the feet on the front side are not seen, most if not all of these artists did represent them the legs turned outward. The differences in apparel ? If you mean the loincloth, Charles himself gives the answer: the council of Trent. But it was not the Shroud image itself on which a loincloth was painted: do you really think that such a sacrilege could occur? No, but this explain why many of the depictions show a loincloth.

My interest lies in finding out what the Shroud images looked liked originally.” Yes, and it can be proved that your premise is wrong. Why don’t you comment the many true copies (copies painted from the original and very often put in contact with it (see Luigi Fossati)? Or did I miss something ? – Faintness of the image ? See the 1527 Noalejo copy (a wonder !) where it is obvious that the artist tried to reproduce the faintness and the lack of borders of the image. There are other examples showing that the artist tried to reproduce this property with less success: Guadalupe 1588, Rome 1605(?), Rome 1643. I add that in the Museum of the Shroud in Turin, I have seen 2 months ago a small (perhaps 20 cm in length) reproduction painted on a cloth (16th or 17th century, I don’t remember). It’s obvious that the image had been painted in order to reproduce the faintness of the TS image: it is nearly invisible! Unfortunately, it’s forbidden to photograph in the museum. – Thumbs: contrary to what you wrote elsewhere, no thumb is visible in any of the copies. – Crown of thorns: in most of the copies, it is not seen: Santiago 1585, Naples 1652, Lisbon, Laguna de Cameros 1790, Alcoy 1571. – Loincloth: it’s true that a loincloth is clearly depicted in most of the copies. In some cases it is difficult to decide if a loincloth is present or not (Alcoy 1571, Moncalieri 1634, Rome 1643). Probably not. But the oldest copy, the Lier copy as well as the Lisbon copy clearly show the rounded shapes of the buttocks. No loincloth. So what ? According to Charles, the TS is a painting from the 14th century. The image we see today is “of a very different kind from the original creation.” because of century of decay. At the beginning the image was not as faint as it is today. I do not know if it was exactly as faint as today. But I do know that during the 16th and 17th century, some artists tried to reproduce the faintness of the image. Why, if the image was not faint? At the beginning, there was a loincloth. In this case, how to explain that some of the earliest copies show the buttocks (no loincloth), exactly as we seen them today ? The loincloth was added later and then again disappeared? Is it credible ? The same is true for the crown of thorns, the thumbs etc.. No, the image we see today is not very different from the original creation. The study of the copies shows that..","date":"2015-06-13","mins":"4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist"}]
