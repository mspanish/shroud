[{"id":"comment-36220","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Why not? From Zugibe’s book: “The controversy as to whether or not the man of the Shroud was washed prior to being placed on the burial cloth has far reaching significance in terms of authenticity of the TS. The concept that the crucified man was not washed prior to being placed on the Shroud would not be readily acceptable by the forensic pathologist whose expertise also includes studies of antemortem and postmortem bloodflow patterns on fabrics in forensic reconstructions. Acceptance of the hypothesis that the victim was not washed would therefore place the authenticity of the TS in serious doubts”. “It is also of importance to note that scourge markings were made many hours prior to removal from the cross, so that incrusted clots would have formed in the wounds, therefore making it difficult to understand how the scourge marks could have left such precise imprints. Every forensic pathologist I have consulted has agreed that the wounds would have caused a large ammount of bleeding and that the body had to be washed, to account for the preciseness of the wounds on the Shroud. On the december 1980 issue of Medical World News, dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist and a former Chief Medical Examiner of New York City, agreed that if the Shroud is genuine, the body must have been washed. He also added that if the body was washed, there might be some oozing from the wounds”. “Therefore, if the body was not washed, there would have been an absence of most of the body image in patchy distribution all over the Shroud because there would have been large amounts of blood all over the Shroud, preventing the image production mechanism”. “During my observations of rabbinic washings in trauma cases, especially in circumstances with sundown rapidly approaching, the rabbis would quickly wash the body, sometimes washing the front of the body and sitting up the body to do the back, initiating blood flows in wounds that were present on the face and the torso. Anything that flowed after the washing was considered unclean blood, and they ould not wash again”. Hope that this can help.

In Gilbert’s paper it is true that there is no peak at about 400 nm. There is only a flat graph between 350 and about 520 nm. But you forget 2 important facts: 1) Heller and Adler published in “Blood on the Shroud of Turin” the transmission spectrum of a brownish red stained fibril from one of the blood areas of the Shroud (in the Orphaned manuscript, p. 31). The peak at about 410 nm. Is obvious. This peak is simply the famous Soret band (400 450 nm.) indicative of regular porphyrinic material. In addition a very small peak at about 520 nm. Is also visible in their spectra. 2) Pellicori ( in “Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin”, Applied optics, Vol;19, N)12, 15 June 1980, Fig.4, p. 1916) have shown the results of several experiments. On a 4 days old bloodstain on linen the Soret band is clearly visible. But after artificially aging (60°C, 7.5 hours) this bands become much less obvious. Pellicori thought that the lack of the Soret band [in Gilbert’s spectra] was probably due to the poor Signal to Background ratio. I completely disagree with your sentence: ” The Gilberts’ spectrum is definitely not typical of methemoglobin, nor of blood of any description, and its very partial resemblance to a blood spectrum over a small range of wavelengths is entirely coincidental.” Coincidental? Really ? The Gilbert’s spectrum is typical of methemoglobin in the range 500 700 nm including the band at about 630 650 nm. (Don’t you see it ?) The fact that the 400 450 nm. Strong Soret band is not seen in Gilbert’s spectra is not truly significant because Pellicori has shown that ageing of blood on linen strongly lowers the Soret band and because of the poor Signal to background ratio. More generally, what Kelly and myself tried to show is that if we have to think about TS blood, we have to take into account all the data from Heller and Adler, STURP data, Bollone, Pellicori etc..and not from a single source..","date":"2013-12-17","mins":"5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-61109","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Yes, whole blood;.","date":"2013-12-17","mins":"5:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-29805","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"From Schwalbe and Rogers :” Heller and Adler have noted that there is no specific spectrum for blood per se: the spectral characteristics depend on the chemical state (coordination and decomposition) of the hemoglobin and also on its state of aggregation.

But…. “If bilirubin starts greening up on TLC plates within hours, – and verdins are just one class of photoderivative – then what chance is there that it would or could survive centuries on linen, exposed to light and air?” According to Adler, he found in the samples taken at the margins of the bloodstains (serum) many “olive” (green + yellow) shards (verdin ?) The TS was very rarely exposed to light. In addition the bloodstains are completely dried. Do you think that taking into account these conditions, the bilirubin would have been completely destroyed ? Adler used the Erlich’s reagent using the method of Jendrassik (microspotting technique). “Using the same microspotting technique as described above, characteristic blue azobilirubin colors could be positively detected in reflected light on the surfaces of the olive colored shards, the orange globs, and also, weakly on the more orange colored red coated fibrils. The test was sensitive to acid, turning a paler purple, and was discharged by 10 minutes of short wave UV light as is characteristic of this color test. In the previous spectral work it was noted that a peak does appear both in the whole cloth reflection studies and in micro spectrophotometry of the tape samples at about 450 nm. This is quite typical of bilidienes and similar bile pigments structures…” I understand that the Erlich (classical) test for bilirubin was positive and that the spectra were consistent with the presence of bilirubine. For me, taking into account all the parameters (the bood on the TS is real blood, olive color of some of the “objects” mainly found in the serum areas, the results of the Erlich tests on these objects, macro and microspectrometry data) are self consistent. If you think that there is no bilirubin, you must interpret the Erlich test results as a false positive.

This is amazing! Nevertheless, there is no doubt that “the Italian contingent” means Baima Bollone and his team. May be Barrie could confirm that. In other words, Baima and his co workers worked on genuine TS threads and your previous sentence: “These findings were made by using fragments that were removed from the Shroud by vacuuming, were kept illicitly, and tested without permission.” is completely wrong (sorry!) No “vacuuming”, not “kept illicitly” and not “tested without permission”. Do you agree now? Whatever the personality of Baima Bollone, his work is worthy of consideration. For example read again: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/bbk 7.pdf You wrote: “Where am I going? I’m not sure. Throughout S Tu RP literature, the minutest details of investigations into microscopic fragments are covered in intense detail, while the finding of “the Italians”, who appear to have had orders of magnitude more to work on, with much more definitive results, are almost entirely ignored, their authors being grudgingly admitted to a list of references rather than highlighted in the text. Why is this? Heller makes little secret of his contempt for Italian scientists “who had no idea what X ray fluorescence was.” Did S Tu RP put no faith in Baima Bollone’s findings? Were they justified in doing so? I don’t know.” “Why is this”? Because at the time (1978 and later), the Centro (Baima Bollone and co workers) considered the TS as its own property. Moreover, Baima Bollone never published his findings in peer reviewed journals but only in the journal of the Centro. The whole context explains the attitude of STURP. It was not a scientific problem but a “political” problem. Knowing that, what do we have to do now? In my opinion, to look at both STURP’s and Bollone’s findings.

Preliminary conclusion: if a medieval forger painted the Shroud, he had to perform some preliminary experiments with real blood on a person in order to paint the blood on the Shroud, including the “out of image” blood stain. In fact, the problem of the bloodstain pattern is much more complex… And my experiments were very preliminary experiments. Here is what Dr. Frederic Zugibe wrote (SSG, October 3, 2005): ” Dear Dr. Thibault,and others THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE! I would like to comment concerning your blood flow theories. I don’t wish to be an iconoclast but you are delving into a very specialized area of forensic reconstruction that takes years of specialized training and experience. As you perhaps know I have been studying blood patterns on deceased individuals on a daily basis for over 34 years, I have testified in court on numerous occasions regarding blood patterns and have published papers in the area of patterned injuries. I enjoyed reading the experiment you performed on yourself in a sense of self sacrifice. First of all, there is a complete difference in blood pattern reconstruction in the living versus the deceased in most instances. In addition a knowledge of Human Anatomy and Physiology is of paramount importance in understanding how the one way valves function within the blood vessels in the circulation through the arms and legs. Also, as I previously related, in violent type deaths, fibrinolysins and altered clotting factors are produced causing a fluidity of blood. Moreover there is an absence of the normal contractions of blood vessels that play a prominent role in bleeding control. After death, when the arms are held above the head in the position of crucifixion, the blood in the arms would not flow backwards because the flow is governed by one way valves unless they are defective as in varicose veins. If the arms of the decedent are above the head in crucifixion, at the time of death, the ventricles of the heart ejects the blood into the circulation causing the veins to be filled (creating pressure in the veins of the arms on the one way valves). In this scenario, when the nail is initially pulled out of the hands during removal from the cross, blood would flow out of the hand wound down the arm. The nature of the flow is governed by many variables of position in detaching the victim from the cross and in the act of lowering him where a number of positions are assumed. It is also of paramount importance to know that the amount of blood on a victim appears many times greater than it actually is. I have investigated numerous murder scenes with blood all over the victim, on the walls and floors and when forensic calculations are made, the amount of blood extruded is found to be many times less than it appeared to be. It is difficult for the uninitiated to understand these simple forensic concepts that only come with training and experience. If I were to title this scenario, it would be THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE! …” Comments welcome.

Some years ago the “bloodstain questions” were discussed on SSG (even with Dr. Zugibe). We were not able to reach a consensus. Let’s try again! I would like to begin with Hugh’s excellent question, that can be summarized so: How can we explain the blood rivulets seen on the small of the back ? There is absolutely no doubt that these rivulets are made of blood. Looking at the Lirey badge made before the 1532 fire, we see that these blood marks were larger than the image. Today, we can see blood and charred blood bellow the patches, i.e. Where we don’t see any image. What does it mean ? I am waiting for you thoughts and conclusions. In any case, the blood rivulets of the small of the back are not easy to explain. I can perform some experiments with my own blood. Yes, I can. I did it some years ago. Fortunately, no crucifixion is necessary !! I am waiting for some propositions of experiments.

I do not not if the term “stochastic” is the best one. The main problem comes from the fact that the surface distribution of the color in the Body image areas is not easy to describe. With the help of the analogy with the effect of low doses of radiations in a large population, one can understand what the authors have in mind. It is true that low doses of radiations have the properties described by the authors: 1) There is no minimal level of radiations (except zero, which does not exist) without effect 2) The number of tumors increases with the time/level exposition 3) it is impossible to predict who will have a tumor in this population. This is only an analogy. Is the TS image color distribution like a “stochastic “process ? In my opinion, not exactly. Why ? It is true that the color distribution in a given image area depends only on the number of colored fibers having the same density (+/ 10%) and not on the density of the fibers (the half tone effect). But the colored fibers are not randomly colored. In a colored thread, there are BUNDLES of colored fires adjacent to bundles of uncolored fibers If there is a stochastic process, it is at thread level and not only at fiber level. In other words, a stochastic process at fiber level does not explain the fact that the colored fibers are bulked together in bundles adjacent to uncolored bundles of fibers in a given image thread..","date":"2014-06-14","mins":"4:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/14/paper-chase-a-natural-stochastic-process-may-explain-the-coexistence-of-bloodstains-and-an-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Paper Chase:  A Natural Stochastic Process May Explain the Coexistence of Bloodstains and an Image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-25970","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I do not understand the problem.

Remember that the protease have absolutely no effect on image only fibers. All the blood covered fibers, after digestion by the protease do show the characteristics of image free fibers. For me the protease test is reliable. To the contrary, the test proposed by CB on his blog is meaningless because he does take into account the fact that the blood did seep into the cloth.

I simply notice that the protease tests were performed at least in 2 different occasions. No doubt that at least 10, 15 or 20 fibers were tested. It is true that the blood on the surface fibers has almost completely eroded away leaving most of the red encrustations in the interstices. But the threads and fibers left behind are not at all white or yellow, they are reddish (in fact a color made of red, grey and olive green). Certainly a mixture of serum, hemoglobin and (bilirubin ?). A sticky tape applied to the surface of this area would give us many red coated fibers, golden yellow fibers and many shards and red to orange micro concretions as described by H and A. You wrote:” I cannot say if the serum has also rubbed away, but if it has, then any blood/image coincidence would become less common than your 50%, and more like my 5%”. But even if all the blood and the serum has rubbed away (which is not the case, see above), this has nothing to do with the “blood/image coincidence”. Finally, the only true problem is: how many “image fibers” do we find in a given image area and particularly near the blood samples? Your 5% are certainly underestimated. It depends on the location of the samples (half tone effect). Looking carefully at the ME collection, I “think” that the number of image colored surface fibers range from 25% up to 90%.

It is not possible that the trickles down the arms were post mortem issues, and they were clearly not washed.” No. The arm blood flows were not washed, because, according to Zugibe they were post mortem blood flows. Why ? 1) When the TS man was crucified, the hand/wrist was compressed against the crosspiece of the cross by nailing, “thereby preventing any discernable blood flows. In addition (..), the blood pressure was very low and the arms were in elevated position” (FZ, the crucifixion of Jesus, p. 222). Remember that, after scourging, the blood pressure was likely very low and the blood itself very “viscous”. 2) “It is obvious that the blood flows on the arms occurred right after removal of the nails (which had sealed the wounds during suspension from the hand areas, causing the blood that contained fibrinolysins to flow down the back of the arms from the nail exit wound while the arms were suspended above the head still in rigor at the same angle in which they had been nailed to the crosspiece (…) Forensically speaking, the reason for the small amount of blood on the arms is due to the fact that the heart was not beating when the nails were removed and the arms were in a suspended position. Moreover, the arms would have been free of blood prior to death because the large nails would have sealed the wounds, the blood pressure was very low, and the arms were in elevated position” (FZ). “Zugibe is anxious to show that the bloodflows from the wrist and spear wounds were post mortem, but his illustration, of a tiny drip of blood taking four hours to emerge from a cadaveric wrist, is hardly justification of that”. Yes. FZ is very confusing here. The illustration shows that AFTER WASHING, some blood from a wound of a deceased victim appears at the surface of the skin.

He simply forewarned that, in the context of the conservation of the TS, “OVEREXPOSURE to ultraviolet and/or visible radiation could modify this color,(2) as bilirubin can be readily and quickly photodecomposed under a variety of conditions”. The best evidence is found in the following sentence: “Alternatively, if the red color of the blood is due to the presence of vermilion, i.e., mercuric oxide, light exposure will blacken the image, as has been evidenced in many older paintings.(l2)” As you know, Adler knew that vermilion had nothing to do with the blood stains. Nevertheless, he wrote that. You failed to consider the context. Adler (and Schwalbe) wrote this paper about the conservation of the TS, taking into account ALL of the hypotheses.
