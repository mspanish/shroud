[{"id":"comment-173805","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"There have been a interesting discussion in Saint Louis about this question. I agree with some of you that there is absolutely no scientific reason to turn down the radiocarbon dating method in order to date the Shroud. In the conclusion of my paper, I ask for a new radiocarbon dating of the Shroud. On one side, we have data strongly suggesting that the 1988 sample is not representative of the main shroud. On the other side, we have the evidence of the textile experts assuring that the dated sample is truly representative of the main shroud. The only mean to know the true age of the shroud is to perform a new radiocarbon dating. Today, small pieces of threads are sufficient. Taking into account all of the criticisms about the 1988 dating, the new radiocarbon dating must come from at least 3 or 4 samples/pieces of threads from different parts of the shroud. 1) Each sample must contain warp and weft thread dated separately 2) The samples must come from “clean” areas (no scorch, no waterstain, no blood,no image) that are at a different distance from the image. This will tell us if the image forming process has an influence on the C14 content. 3) Each sample must be first analysed using microscopy, micro chemistry and spectroscopy. 4) A multidisciplinary approach (textile experts, radiocarbon experts, Shroud experts…) is necessary for the choice of the samples as well as for the whole procedure. 5) The cleaning of the samples must be as “strong” as possible in order to date only the cellulose of the flax. 6) The scientists and laboratories must be chosen carefully and it is preferable not to choose the laboratories involved in the 1988 dating, in order to avoid any kind of. Conflict. The results? – All of the results are similar, giving the same age (1st century, 7th century, 14th century …): we must accept this result. – The radiocarbon results are very different and not compatible: for some (unknown) reason, the shroud can not be dated by the radiocarbon method – The radiocarbon results are really different but there is some kind of relationship between the dated samples and the image: the image forming process has an influence on the C14 content..","date":"2014-11-30","mins":"9:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/29/a-guest-posting-by-joe-marino-if-another-c-14-test-is-ever-done/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Guest Posting by Joe Marino:  If another C-14 test is ever done . . ."},{"id":"comment-193144","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Charles, Nobody (Rogers etc…including myself) said that the high amount of cotton alone in this corner is a sufficient proof of it being strongly anomalous. As I wrote, the evidence comes from ‘the whole picture’: – Cotton – Unique dye – The ‘splice’ in Raes 1 glued with a terpene like material – The lignin. – the anomalous UV fluorescence – The statistical anomalies of the radiocarbon dating. Cotton: you wrote: ” I have never understood how Rogers was able to dismiss so easily the possibility that there were cotton fibres elsewhere on the Shroud. When was the necessary examination done? If the cotton was within the structure of the weave it would not have been found on the STURP tapes.” The “necessary examination” was not done (STURP was not allowed to do that). Rogers studied many STURP samples and could not find cotton (or only few modern cotton fibers). Paul Malloney studied several samples from Max Frei and his conclusions were similar (see my paper). Both Max Frei and STURP samples were ‘surface samples’, that’s true. However, if you apply a sticky tape to a thread containing many cotton fibers, you certainly will found many cotton fibers in your tape. Your hypothesis:” The flax with which the Shroud was woven was spun in a a place where cotton was also being spun (we know that this happened) and fibres of cotton became embedded in the yarn” or “The yarn was woven on a loom which had previously been used for weaving cotton and at the edges of the weave there were therefore traces of cotton fibres that were not found further into the cloth.” is reliable. It is in fact Raes’ hypothesis. I can’t rule out this hypothesis. However, what is the probability to find by chance several threads with a high amount of cotton in a very small area of the shroud if many samples coming from many different parts of the shroud do not show any kind of cotton or only a very small amount of cotton? Again, cotton alone is not a proof. The question of cotton makes sense only as an element of the whole picture as described above..","date":"2015-03-11","mins":"4:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-193076","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Charles, 1) “which of these sources shows that threads of cotton, not just fibres, were spun or woven into the Shroud?” None. With all due respect, your question makes no sense. To spin and to weave are two different operations. There is NO 100% cotton thread in the shroud, even in the Raes/C14 corner. I do not understand your question. 2) “How and why had the cotton got there? Is there any reason to believe new cotton was woven in alongside new linen – if so why?” ” ..new cotton was woven in alongside new linen – if so why?” “Alongside” ?? Once again your question makes no sense. See 1) 3) “what percentage of cotton is there in the make up of this area of the Shroud? Would it have any significant effect on the radio carbon date?” In Raes 7 about 10 20%. In the main Shroud probably no more than 2%. The difference is strongly significant. Cotton itself is only a SIGN that at least some THREADS (new linen fibers and new cotton fibers spun together) in the Raes/c14 area are different from the threads of the main part of the shroud (linen fibers only with no more than 2% of cotton). Please understand that is is NOT only the cotton that is “new” but the threads, including new linen fibers (cotton+linen) In this anomalous part of the shroud, with about 2/3 of “new” threads (new linen + new cotton) and about 1/3 of “old” threads ( old linen), the result is consistent with the radiocarbon dating. 4) ” if the cotton is only to be found as fibres, what do you thunk of Raes” view that it drifted in during the spinning or weaving process at a time when cotton and flax were being woven in the same workshops?” It is possible. At least, Raes demonstrated that cotton fibers were not a surface contamination. But how to explain the differences with the main Shroud? It is not easy to understand such a difference in cotton content with Raes’ explanation. In my opinion, it can explain the 2% cotton fibers found in the main shroud but not the 10 20% cotton fibers found in Raes 7. Taking into account the unique dye found by Rogers as well as the lignin, the whole picture is clear. The Raes/C14 corner is strongly anomalous with regard to what is known about the main part of the Shroud..","date":"2015-03-10","mins":"4:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-193365","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"No comment ?.","date":"2015-03-14","mins":"4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-47919","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Hugh, It is impossible to exclude a reweaving (particularly if it is based on some kind of splicing technique) just looking at some photos.

You concluded that the body image forming process could not involve only the PCW (or an impurity layer) but also the SCW, the main part of linen fibers that contains about 15 % of hemicellulose. I agree. 2) You add that the lack of color in the SCW of image fibers does not mean that there is no change in the chemical structure of the SCW. Hemicellulose in the SCW can be “broken” in the SCW with no effect on the cellulose itself. This should explain point 1) and the lack of color in the SCW.

False. She did not look carefully at the C14 corner because she was not there in 1988. And her paper is full of mistakes re Rogers’ findings. She obviously did not understand anything about Rogers’ claims. She did not look (to my knowledge) at the threads of the border of the C14 sampling area in 2002 with a microscope. She did not took any piece of threads and she did look at them through a microscope. CF: “The areas for the radiocarbon dating that were examined microscopically found some fibers of cotton which were removed”. False. Oxford found a “rogue fiber” at the surface of his sample. Probably the labs did look quickly at the surface of the samples with a microscope. No more. I repeat: it is ABSOLUTELY impossible to know anything about the number and the location of cotton fibers in a thread without separating the fibers of the threads. This was NOT done by the labs. CF: ” An impression, backed by no evidence at all, is left that the reweave was largely cotton but we know from the microscopic examination of the C14 samples that is not the case.” Microscopic examination? By whom ? By the labs? No. Did they remove some threads of their samples? No. Did they divide the threads into fibers ?. No. Did they perform any kind of chemical investigation? No. CF (171): ” I still want to clarify the problem of the cotton. There simply is not enough cotton used to sway the carbon 14 date so if there was a reweave that swayed the date it could not have been as a result of a cotton reweave. But why would they have mixed cotton and linen in the reweave?” Probably because cotton is much more able to retain the dye found by Rogers than linen. And: CF (177): “If you want to sustain the ‘cotton reweave’ claim, please provide us with a PERCENTAGE, with supporting evidence, of how much cotton was in the samples actually tested in the labs you can base it on material from the surrounding area if you want.” Please, (re)read http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdf (and parts 2 and 3) It is a complete misunderstanding of the problem.

There are also the hilarious contributions of Barbet, Zugibe, Vignon, Delage, Bollone, Cameron, Lavoie, Judica Cordiglia etc.. 3) Moreover, CB is a famous historian who thinks ” … that the image is that of the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, ie. Jacques de Molay. Why no others? Have you seen the price of linen currently? Making it is labour intensive, you know. Imagine what that length of herring bone weave must have cost, even in the 14th century when labour was cheap (though not that cheap in a prosperous medieval France).” History, as a science, is based on documents. But in this case we don’t need any document connecting Jacques de Molay to the Shroud image. The argument of the price of linen is irrefutable…. 4) CB: “How did he die?

Morgan III’s paper ‘Digital image processing techniques demonstrating the anomalous nature of the radiocarbon dating sample area of the Shroud of Turin’ at http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380798975 Morgan.pdf, where he shows that the radiocarbon samples are increasingly contaminated the closer they are to the corner….” No Hugh. Morgan’s paper has nothing to do with the amount of ‘contamination’ of the C14 corner. It has to do with the surface chemistry as shown by the UV Vis fluorescence photograph. The problem comes from the term ‘contamination’. What Morgan demonstrated is: 1) that the mean surface chemistry of the C14 sample/region is truly (statistically) different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area. 2) that the mean surface chemistry of each of the Arizona #1, Zurich and Oxford samples is truly (statistically) different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area. 3) that there is an almost perfect correlation between the calendar C14 age of a given sample (Arizona#1 etc..) and the surface chemistry as measured by the z score in the UV Vis image. It means ONLY that the surface contamination of Arizona1 is smaller that the surface contamination of Oxford. Surface chemistry (UV Vis photograph analysis) is likely correlative to the Dye found by Rogers (as Morgan wrote), NOT to the composition of the fabric itself. Therefore, I completely disagree with your claim: ” “We can say with authority than any contamination of the radiocarbon corner of the shroud made it appear older, not younger, than it really is.” You are confusing surface contamination (likely Rogers’s dye, which has been eliminated by the C14 standard cleaning procedures) and “contamination” of the fabric itself by “new” pieces of threads.

That’s why it’s always necessary to read what he wrote about the same subject in different papers in order to avoid false interpretations. Let me explain: The sentence: “Incidentally, the pyrolysis/ms spectra of samples from apparent blood spots showed hydroxyproline peaks at mass 131, a pyrolysis product of animal proteins” is the only allusion to hydroxyproline (and blood) in the entire Rogers’ TCA paper. Moreover, the term “incidentally” is important. You are right: peak 131 is found in all of the samples analysed. Here is what Rogers wrote re the “problem” of peak 131 and hydroxyproline (from “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin”, p.56 57): ” When animal proteins are heated, a major pyrolysis product is 4 hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline’s signal at m:e 131 appeared very early in the pyrolysis of the Zina samples that showed distinct red spots on the fibers…Indeed m/e 131 was the major organic pyrolysis product detected between masses 100 and 150 at the lowest temperature that gave any detectable products (figure VIII 7)” Fig VIII 7 (Zina sample) shows an almost empty spectrum, with peak 131 intensity at about 20% and only 5 other signals less than 10%). He adds: ” Mass 131 peaks appeared AT MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURES in all of the spectra, but those are in the ranges where cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses are decomposing. The spectrum gets very complex at those higher temperatures. None of the images fibers, control fibers, or Raes fibers showed mass 131 at low temperatures. Although mass 131 products can appear from materials other than animal proteins, if animal proteins are present mass 131 MUST appear in the pyrolysis products. The lower the temperature at which mass 131 appears, the more likely it is a result of the pyrolysis of an animal protein”. The interpretation of Rogers is now absolutely clear: Rogers pointed out the different meanings of peak 131, taking into account the temperatures. – In the Zinna (blood) sample it is probably ( please note that he is speaking of high probability) a protein – In all the other samples, Rogers clearly interprets pic 131 as a decomposition product of the material itself (…”but those are in the ranges where cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses are decomposing..”) What is your mistake? In the sentence in your Fig.1, which is the spectrum of a Shroud image fiber, “that was taken when the first decomposition products started to appear over a sample of image fiber” wrote Rogers (“A chemist perspective…”, p.54). Your sentence: Peak at mass=131 (SUPPOSEDLY HYDROXYPROLINE). This is the most abundant ion in the mass spectra and according to Rogers, correlated with animal protein (blood spots?)”. No in this spectrum and the others, Rogers did NOT say that peak 131 is correlated with hydroxyproline. In fact, he wrote exactly the contrary ! I hope I am clear enough.

Nevertheless, as I wrote earlier, even if one has no knowledge of the clear explanations found in Rogers book, something very simple must come immediately to the mind of the reader of Rogers’ TCA paper: if peak 131 is only associated to hydroxyproline/protein/blood how is it that it is found in the two spectra (image fiber and Raes sample, both without blood) shown in his paper? This alone, should be enough for the reader to understand that there is something wrong in this reasoning. And then, if this reader does really want to truly understand Rogers, he has to do what I did: to try to find a clear explanation in all of Rogers’ papers, including his book. Apparently, this work has not been done made by the authors.

Rogers believed that it is furfural: ———— …When the first pyrolysis products appeared during heating, the Raes fibers showed a signal for furfural at mass 96… ————— Actually, it is very clear that it is not furfural, but a peak arising from the decomposition of the contaminant.

All the results are statistically consistent. The final result of all the tests gives a result in the first century for the TS (I can’t provide the details). From a strict scientific point of view, these findings have to be discussed among experts and I don’t know if the results will be published in a peer reviewed journal (I hope so).

There are: the side strip, the missing corners, the Holland cloth (which itself consists of 3 different parts (why ?), the 1534 patches etc… The structure of the TS is complex, particularly in the C14 corner.. ” At the 3 MV Tandetron accelerator of the LABEC laboratory in Florence, we have analysed textile relics by both Ion Beam Analysis and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (…)” This was never performed on the TS. The radiocarbon concentrations of all the samples coming from a given frock are self consistent. In a given frock the samples came from different areas separated by 20 or 30 or more centimeters. This is not the case for the Shroud dated samples which were only separated by some centimeters. Moreover we do know that the Raes/C14 corner is strongly anomalous. – The Quad Mosaic (QM) is significant. Yes it is. I studied the full size QM photos and I compared them with the High Res Photos taken by Barrie Schwortz at the same time (1978). – The fluorescence is significant. (Hugh this photo truly comes from the STURP fluorescence studies) – The cotton question is significant – The dye is significant. – The Rogers’ results re vanillin are significant. Riggi (who cut the samples) himself wrote that he had to eliminate the thin band between the side seam and the C14 samples because he saw some extraneous fibers….

Morgan’s paper has nothing to do with the amount of ‘contamination’ of the C14 corner. It has to do with the surface chemistry as shown by the UV Vis fluorescence photograph. The problem comes from the term ‘contamination’. What Morgan demonstrated is: 1) that the mean surface chemistry of the C14 sample/region is truly (statistically) different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area. 2) that the mean surface chemistry of each of the Arizona #1, Zurich and Oxford samples is truly (statistically) different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area. 3) that there is an almost perfect correlation between the calendar C14 age of a given sample (Arizona#1 etc..) and the surface chemistry as measured by the z score in the UV Vis image. It means ONLY that the surface contamination of Arizona1 is smaller that the surface contamination of Oxford. Surface chemistry (UV Vis photograph analysis) is likely correlative to the Dye found by Rogers (as Morgan wrote), NOT to the composition of the fabric itself. Therefore, I completely disagree with your claim: ” “We can say with authority than any contamination of the radiocarbon corner of the shroud made it appear older, not younger, than it really is.” You are confusing surface contamination (likely Rogers’s dye, which has been eliminated by the C14 standard cleaning procedures) and “contamination” of the fabric itself by “new” pieces of threads.

It should perhaps (I repeat perhaps) be possible if the experts did not have in mind this possibility and look at it specifically. They probably looked at this corner to verify the weave, the lack of obvious anomalies and extraneous threads etc.. They also saw the Shroud for the first time. In other words, to my knowledge, with due respect to them, they were not prepared to eliminate this possibility, simply because at the time they could not imagine such a hypothesis. Christophe Moulhertat (probably the best expert in ancient cloths in France) wrote :” Si on a des fils trafiqués avec une volonté de cacher la chose, il faut déjà y penser, et être équipé pour pouvoir voir ça. Sinon, si le réparation est bien faite, on peut passer à côté. Il faut vraiment une analyse fine”. The important words are “il faut déjà y penser” (you must first have to think about that [invisible mending]). However, I agree that it is difficult to accept such a mistake from true experts. But the fact is that the properties of some of the Raes/C14 corner threads are not similar to that of the main cloth (cotton, dye and vanillin). There is also the possibility that the Raes/C14 corner consists of a mixture of portions of ancient threads spliced together with portions of modern threads. In this case, it would be truly invisible. Moulherat was shocked by the fact that the radiocarbon sample came from a single small area of the Shroud. This was the big mistake. As I wrote in my presentation in Saint Louis, there is a conflict between the findings of the textile experts and Rogers’ findings. Both of them are reliable.

You are right about the facts. But… Remember my own study of Raes#7. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdf – Many cotton fibers obviously mixed with linen fibers: it is NOT a surface contamination. – Cotton fibers are not at all evenly distributed: taking in account only the more or less “complete” cotton fibers (i.e., fibers forming long bundles or sometimes “nodes” or individual relatively long fibers) there is about 15% of cotton in the outer part (from 0% to 28% depending on the location studied) and about 10% of cotton in the core of the thread. In addition many short pieces of broken cotton fibers are found everywhere. Now, if you apply a sticky tape on this Raes thread, what do you expect to see under the microscope? Many cotton fibers. I am right? In other words, if the main Shroud had the same linen/cotton content than the Raes/C14 corner, all or most of the STURP sticky samples (which were much larger than a single thread) would show a large number of cotton fibers. But Rogers did not find any “old” cotton fibers in the STURP samples (except some modern fibers probably coming from the cotton gloves used in 1978). This explains why Rogers wrote that the shroud is almost pure linen. Paul Maloney did look at the Frei samples (surface samples), as well at some STURP surface samples. Here is what he wrote in a message to SSG: “As many of you know I spent more than 500 hours at the microscope studying Max Frei’s sticky tapes. I conducted my studies first using an E. Leitz and then on a Nikon Optiphot. So, let me say first that on all of those tapes there is, in fact, cotton. BUT this statement, as put, is hardly scientific because I have not identified for you the sources for the cotton on the Shroud or on the tapes versus cotton IN the Shroud. Please note that I am making a distinction between cotton ON the tapes, cotton IN the Shroud, and cotton ON the Shroud. First, cotton ON the [Frei] tapes. I found ample amounts of cotton, white, clean cotton located SOLELY on the leads of the tapes. But there is a ready answer for this source. Max Frei borrowed the gloves from STURP–I believe it was Bob Dinegar, at Frei’s request, who got the cotton gloves for him. Those cotton gloves came from the United States and are not made of Gossypium herbaceum. This cotton came from the tips of the cotton gloves as Max Frei took his samples. So we can rule out any new cotton fibers on the leads of the tapes as being relevant to our discussion. Second, cotton ON the surface of the Shroud. I found trace amounts of cotton, randomly positioned, on the BODIES of the tapes. Nearly all of this cotton was colored in some way (i.e. Dyed). Thus, it must be interpreted as originating from the clothing of those who were in contact with the Shroud during its history–including its recent history (1978 or prior). Third, cotton IN the weave or IN the spun threads of the Shroud. I have categorically NEVER attested cotton anywhere on any of the Frei tapes, either bodies of the tapes, or leads of the tapes, that was co spun with linen fibers which, to me at least, would constitute some evidence for a co mixture of cotton and linen on the main part of the Shroud and existing there as part of the original weaving of the cloth. Furthermore, I accept Ray Rogers’ own research that the cotton co mixed in the yarn is of relatively modern origin and limited to the area that Joe Marino and M. Sue Benford had originally identified as a repaired area: the so called “Raes Corner” of the Shroud. Finally, independently, I had the privilege of examining three of STURP’s tapes which came from the main body of the Shroud cloth. Those tapes are 6 AF, 3 BF, and 3 EF. Nowhere on those three tapes did I find ANY cotton! All of the fibers are linen! So far as I can tell, there should be no argument as to whether the Shroud was entirely the co mixture of cotton and linen because there is simply no factual evidence to support it”.

I don’t know exactly where and when. Obviously,they looked at the sampling area with a microscope before giving their agreement. ” As for invisible mending, I agree that to my knowledge nobody has ever carried out the procedure I described, namely the unravelling of individual threads, merging them by bringing the unravelled threads together, and then twisting them back up together again to produce a true spliced extended thread. I also think that this would need an unravelling of at least 1 2cm of each thread, which is why it would be impossible to produce such a splice wholly within the radiocarbon sample area.

About cotton in Oxford sample: ” The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old.” What are the criteria for establishing that a cotton fiber is Egyptian? Is it possible to distinguish a fiber of Egyptian origin from a fiber originating elsewhere in the Old World? “And quite old”. How much old? ” I agree with Gian Marco Rinaldi. The British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd found that these fibers were cotton fibers from the ‘old world’. This means that these cotton fibers were not modern cotton (G. Hirsutum), but Gossypium herbaceum or Gossypium arboreum. There is no mean for establishing that a cotton fiber is Egyptian. Cotton from the ‘old world’ simply means that it is not modern cotton, the kind of cotton likely found in the gloves of STURP. It is not a modern contamination.

But she had some excuse. There have been so many muddles until the 1989 CIELT Symposium… In the Nature report, we read: “The shroud was separated from the backing cloth along its bottom left hand edge and a strip (~10 mm x 70 mm) was cut from just above the place where a sample was previously removed in 1973 for examination”. This was a big mistake. In a letter from Tite to Gonella (dated 18 April 1990) from the Gonella collection, I read: «I am writing regarding the current discussion about the size of the sample taken from the Shroud for radiocarbon dating. I find the very obvious discrepancy between the actual size of the sample taken (16 x 81 mm) and the sample size quoted in the Nature paper (10 x 70 mm) somewhat embarrassing. I myself kept no record of the size of sample removed from the Shroud. Therefore, when I came to write the first draft of the Nature paper, I used the sample size that we had plan to remove rather than the size actually removed….” In the Gonella’s collection, I have also found a drawing from Gonella with the actual sizes and weights of the samples as well as a letter from Testore to Siliano. Shortly, – The entire first sample cut by Riggi was 8.4 cm in length and 2.2 cm in width on one side, 1.35 cm in width on the other side. The difference came from the previous Raes cut. The weight of this sample was 479 mg (Riggi) or 478.1 mg (Testore). It is impossible to calculate the actual density because this sample was not a perfect rectangle. Obviously, its density was much higher than that of the Shroud but it’s not a surprise given that this sample contained a part of the hem. – Then, Riggi eliminated the borders (including the hem) and obtained a strip: 7.9x 1.7 (still 1.35 cm in width on the “Raes side”). Weight=300 mg. Again it was not a perfect rectangle. This is not different from the dimensions of the “actual size” quoted in the Tite’s letter above (8.1×1.6). Of course, these data included the Reserve. If we do not take into account the very small missing part of this sample (Raes), the density can be calculated: Weight=300 mg, surface= 13.43 cm2, density= weight/surface= 22.33 mg/cm2. Adding 5 10% for the small Raes missing part, we have a density of about 24 25 mg/cm2, which is consistent with the known density of the shroud. Therefore there is no difference between the density of the main shroud and that of the radiocarbon samples( Reserve + dated samples) The error of Mrs. Siliato comes from the fact that she considered that the dimension of the radiodated sample was 7.00 x 1.00 cm (Weight= 300 mg, density: 42.85 mg/cm2), while it actually was 8.1x 1.6 cm (density: 23.15mg/cm2) or 7.9×1.7 (density: 22.33 mg/cm2)..","date":"2014-11-24","mins":"3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/23/paper-chase-the-shroud-of-turin-and-its-radiodating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase:  The Shroud of Turin and its Radiodating"},{"id":"comment-144237","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Thank you Colin, I have to understand your experiment (some diagrammatic drawing should be useful) and to test again my samples..","date":"2014-08-16","mins":"3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter"},{"id":"comment-32501","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I assume that Hugh is referring to Fig. 1 of the paper showing the very precise measurements (in millimeters) of the C14 samples.

This further implies the two sections of sewing threads (C 14 region versus main Shroud) were applied at different times and by different artisans with the main Shroud stitching possibly from the same time period as Masada (21)” I am unable to see this significant change of technique in Fig;8.

In the two instances where experimental ‘evidence’ has been proferred, the authors of those inappropriately designed and/or misinterpreted experiments, made in both instances on Dan Porter’s shroudstory.com should do the decent thing and withdraw their claims.(…) If they fail to do so, then Dan Porter ought in my view to take the initiative, and excise their misinformation from his blog. That’s assuming he has no wish for his site to be seen as a repository of fatally flawed so called science, supposedly mounting a robust defence of authenticity while in reality finding entirely imaginary errors in the opposition case”. “DUFF claims” (!!), “mis AND DISINFORMATION”,… I am supposed to do “the decent thing and withdraw my claims” ?

What is really shocking is what follows: 1) the authors try to make believe that in Rogers’ paper “According to the Author [Rogers], however, the key evidence to support this thesis is the analysis of two pyrolysis spectra”. Rogers never said that. His analysis of the Py MS spectra is just one of several evidence (cotton, vanillin, chemical testing). Rogers, contrary to the authors gathered several data before writing his paper. The authors worked only on 2 spectra and concluded that Rogers was entirely wrong ! 2) The authors did not take into account the proofs I gave regarding peak at mass= 131. They do not hesitate to repeat in their final paper their mistake based on a misunderstanding of a single sentence in Rogers’ paper. More seriously the authors wrote: “No diagnostic peak in the pyrolysis mass spectra indicates a significant difference in the two samples, besides hydrocarbon derived contamination. Therefore, none of the presented data supports the conclusion by Rogers”. “No diagnostic peak in the pyrolysis mass spectra indicates a significant difference in the two samples, besides hydrocarbon derived contamination.” Rogers would agree apart from the nature of the contaminant. About the nature of the contaminant: As a proof of their conclusion, the authors show an example of “mass spectra from a molecule with a long aliphatic chain(exadecan 1 ol), which fragmentation pattern is similar to the contaminant presents in the Raes sample (sample b)” They concluded that the contaminant in Raes spectrum IS an hydrocarbon derived molecule. This conclusion is simply pseudo science. It’s very easy to find many molecules from other species with a mass spectrum almost exactly similar to the Raes spectrum. It is a hard work and I am currently working with somebody who has much more knowledge of MS than me.

More seriously, regarding the “Scan/mass/intensity map” (Fig. VIII 6 in Rogers’book: Raes sample), Rogers wrote: ” The m/e 96 peak for furfural appears relatively early, and it disappears quickly”. Whatever m/e=96 is, this is an important observation:this peak “disappears quickly”.

The fact that the 3 D scan/mass/intensity maps begins at m=50 in Rogers’ book does not mean, contrary to what I wrote, that no data were acquired bellow 50. The other possibility is described by Marco: “Since there is absolutely no other peak below M=49, it is most likely that the instrument was set to not acquire this part of the spectra. This is very common, because the peaks at low masses have little diagnostic value and their intensity might interfere with the other peaks, so it is better to cut them. If you see the spectra above, (fig 4), this is recorded without the zone below M=49. To be absolutely sure, one must see all instrumental setting (Which Rogers did not report).” This argument is specious. The abscissa in Fig.4 (Shroud sample 1 EB) begins at m=50 and ends at m=220 (in fact data were acquired up to 500 or even 750). The abscissa in Raes spectrum begins clearly at m=40. If the instrument was set not to acquire the part of the spectrum between 40 and 50, why would Rogers show the part between 40 and 50 (without any signal, except at m=49) ? This abscissa should begin at 50, as in Fig.4. Moreover, if there were strong peaks around m=43 (like in the spectra of any molecule with a long aliphatic chain), they would certainly have been showed by Rogers. He would not have “cut them”. The FACT is that in the Raes spectrum there is really absolutely no signal between m=40 and m=48, something which is a huge problem for the hypothesis of the “long aliphatic chain contaminant” hypothesis. We have the spectrum of the Raes sample. We must examine it as such, without any kind of “ad hoc” speculation..","date":"2015-09-19","mins":"1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/14/the-chemist-rogers-and-plastic-bags/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Chemist Rogers and Plastic Bags"},{"id":"comment-210734","author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Yes.

Bravo !! The quad mosaic question is complex.

The pictures show discolorations in these areas. This has been the inducement for the hypothesis of the mending in medieval times.[…] Rogers attributed the colour change of the one area of the shroud to medieval repairs to which he was unable to give further indications”. I respect Mrs Flury lemberg but obviously she did not understand Rogers at all. Infrared pictures ? No. UV Vis pictures. Very different. “This has been the inducement for the hypothesis of the mending in medieval times” No. Rogers first looked at his Raes threads (and later C14 threads). For Rogers, the UV Vis pictures were only additional evidence. In my opinion, there is little doubt that the C14 corner is anomalous also with regard to the quad mosaic pictures.
