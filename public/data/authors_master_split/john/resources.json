It is a fact, revealed first by x rays, and available for you and anyone else to see for themselves, that “every thread in the weave of the Shroud is continuous through the seam and matches its corresponding side strip thread in position, thickness, and intensity” (Adler, A.D., 1997, “Concerning the Side Strip on the Shroud of Turin“). LUPIA: You are mixed up about this report Stephen since the late Dr. Adler was attempting to prove that there is not cut and sewn seam but one continuous cloth with a tuck. STEPHEN: And it is a fact that Flury Lemberg personally examined the Shroud during its 2002 restoration and found that the Shroud’s main body and sidestrip are two separate pieces of linen joined by a seam. It is Flury Lemberg’s theory that the main body of the Shroud and its sidestrip were cut and then rejoined at the same time from a larger piece of cloth. And it seems to be the only reasonable explanation of those facts, which as far as I am aware all leading sindonologists (including Wilson and Whanger who originally proposed a completely separately woven sidestrip theory) now accept. If your theory depends on the sidestrip being a completely separately woven piece of linen added to the Shroud at a later time, then you would have to explain how two separately woven pieces of linen match so perfectly across “every thread … in position, thickness, and intensity.” LUPIA : Agreed. And the proof of this is in the book explained by (1) the asymmetry the added on side strip creates with the original Tallit arm slits. These are visible and measurable and the left side is 2cm farther from the selvage than the right side. This is a verifiable fact. Details of this are explained in my book which you will be able to grasp once you read it. (2) the threads are different in Yarns in Tex measurements. The side strip cloth is denser and heavier than the main cloth, so they actually do not match in the same thickness, and intensity (3) and the main cloth has cotton fibers inside the threads whereas the side strip does not. Please see below for a fuller explanation. STEPHEN: >The Greek lexicons you have do not put sindon = tallit for some reason. Thanks for conceding it. The “reason” is that sindon means “linen” not “tallit”! >All you have done is shown that certain Greek lexicons do not have it, which is no proof at all. They are among the leading NT Greek lexicons, including BAGD which you personally recommended to me. That you have not yet cited a NT Greek lexicon which defines sindon as “tallit” (even as a secondary meaning) indicates, given your claim of extensive research over many years into the meaning of these words, that there is no NT Greek lexicon that defines sindon as “tallit.” LUPIA: That is incorrect. I have now pointed to the sources that do show this to be the correct meaning of sindon after the reviewer cited them in her review; Lightfoot and Jastraw and you still have not yet checked those sources but continue to deny the truth and insist it is wrong. Why? Please do yourself a favor and check out Lightfoot and Jastraw. This is now the third time. First when you read the review and failed to check and now twice I am asking you to do the same. STEPHEN : >… you refer NOW to the dimensions of the Shroud from the Restoration in 2002 something you NEVER knew until I pointed it out to you. The same is true about the theory proposed by Dr. Flury Lemberg, which you NEVER knew until I pointed it out to you. And I thanked you at the time for your correcting me on these points. But it is not true that I “NEVER” knew them. As I stated later in a previous comment: But Googling on “Turn [sic] Shroud: Past, Present and Future” and “seam” I found a report (which I already had on my computer but had forgotten) on this in the BSTS Newsletter of June 2000 … That is, I actually had previously read that dimensions and side strip information in the BSTS Newsletter, No. 51, June 2000 and had saved it to my computer but had temporarily forgotten it. Anyway, this is another of your ad hominem fallacies of irrelevance. Although I had read this information previously and saved it to my computer, but had temporarily forgotten it, it is irrelevant to the truth of this matter, whether I personally did or did not know about it before you pointed out to me. LUPIA: Not really. Anyone claiming to be a Shroud expert would not have made that mistake regardless. Do not take it personally. It is not an ad hominem, just an observation. STEPHEN: >Raes … is the expert who did find cotton inside the threads at the time of spinning NOT weaving. Agreed. But it was only minute traces of cotton that he assumed was due to the Shroud being woven on the same loom (quotes can be supplied), not to the Shroud being intended to be a mixture of linen and cotton. And further research has suggested that the cotton in Raes’ sample, which was from the same contaminated corner of the Shroud as the radiocarbon dating sample was taken, was part of a rewoven patch, and there is no cotton in the Shroud itself. LUPIA: Stephen you have it all wrong about the two published reports by Raes. This error is widely published in Shroud literature as cotton got on the threads from the loom. This is completely false. That was never published by Raes but it did manage to widely circulate in Shroud literature as misinformation. According to Raes two reports which I have read he definitely says the cotton got into the linen yarn as the thread was spun. The cotton is inside the threads of the main cloth of the Shroud but not in the side strip. Anything else you have read is misinformation. Also, independent researchers have also confirmed that the Raes samples of the main cloth do contain cotton fibers inside the threads. Please read the two reports published by Gilbert Raes. Additionally, some of the independent researchers who found the cotton no longer hold the invisible weave theory as a strong argument but see that it is contradicted by other scientific evidence. I thought the patch theory was viable at one time but after lengthy discussions with Dr. Flury Lemberg I abandoned the patch theory completely. STEPHEN: >All biblical evidence supports my thesis since my thesis is based primarily on the biblical evidence. But you would need to read my book to find that out. Gail has read your book and I was responding to her review. If she got it wrong, then take it up with her. LUPIA I do not follow what you are saying. I did not find the review claiming I did not base the thesis of my forensic study on biblical evidence. True, it is not solely based on biblical evidence since science that supports the identification is not biblical. STEPHEN: >It is rather curious that a so called proponent of authentication of the Shroud of Turin is so driven to disprove a viable thesis that proves the Shroud is authentic. I am “driven” to follow the truth wherever it leads. It is of the utmost importance that proponents of the Shroud’s authenticity, test all theories about the Shroud, whether from anti or pro authenticity theorists. The Shroud pro authenticity cause would not be helped but harmed by uncritical acceptance of a false theory about the Shroud, on the basis of that if it were true, the Shroud would have to be authentic. Apart from the ethical problem of knowingly holding a false theory because it is most convenient or effective, anti authenticity critics would eventually discover the falsehood and the Shroud itself would be discredited, especially if it were discovered that Shroud pro authenticity theorists knew about the false theory but kept quiet about it. LUPIA: I do not follow your conspiracy theory. It is an outrageous allegation that Shroud researchers would push a false theory in the news to win favorable publicity that the Shroud is authentic. This sounds more like the skeptics point of view. I know of no Shroud researcher in any country that would do as you suggested. That you think they would tells me and readers here much. STEPHEN >One is wondering whose side you are really on. You have no need to wonder. I am on the side of Him who said, “I AM the Truth” (Jn 14:6). And one of my guiding Bible texts is, “Test everything. Hold on to the good.” (1 Th 5:21). You are evidently confusing your theory with the truth, such that anyone who disagrees with your theory is not on the side of the truth. LUPIA: I wrote on March 4th “Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be no understanding.” — Benedict XVI, Jesus of Nazareth, xxiv.","date":"2010-03-21","mins":"10:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"}]
