Currently, and customarily, participants drop the wine into saucers, but I think that Rebecca says, or implies, that 2000 years ago, the participants would have simply dropped the wine on the table — or table cloth. – Then, I’m thinking that even if table cloths were not traditional back in those days, there are at least two possible reasons for a cloth covering the table of the Last Supper. Maybe 1) They were used for Seders in general so as to catch the wine. And/or 2) This cloth was a Pharisaic Sacerdotal garment worn by a high priest (as suggested by Adrie — a follower of this blog — at http://www.jesusking.info/John%20 Mark.pdf) and, for one reason or another, used for this special occasion. Maybe, Jesus asked for it… – Whatever, I’m wondering if anyone might have something to add to, or subtract from, my meanderings above..","date":"2011-08-31","mins":"10:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/31/paper-chase-was-the-shroud-of-turin-also-the-tablecloth-of-the-last-supper/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Was the Shroud of Turin Also the Tablecloth of the Last Supper?"}]
