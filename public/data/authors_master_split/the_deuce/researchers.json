[{"author":"the_deuce","post":"Hi Steve,This is pretty interesting. In addition to reading your blog, I've also been poking around Dan Porter's blog, where you posted on this hypothesis here, as well as the finding that the Shroud actually does have a faint image on the back side of the front image, as predicted by Jackson.I think it's increasingly obvious that, at the bare minimum, the Shroud image *must* have been caused by a real human body, and that skeptical arguments, if they are to have any merit at all, must start with that premise. We already went into the sheer absurdity that results when you try to imagine what it would require for some medieval artist to forge such an image.With that said, what do you make of Ray Rogers' hypothesis of some kind of \"naturalistic\" image formation caused by some sort of chemical reaction of the Shroud to the corpse of the man on it? Personally, I find several things wrong with it. First, if the image was created by the Shroud folding into the crevices of the dead man's body and undergoing some sort of chemical reaction as it made contact with his skin, it seems to me that you would expect the image to come out distorted when the cloth was removed made flat again.Second, it strikes me as wildly implausible that such a \"naturalistic\" process would just happen to occur on the body of Jesus, and nobody else in history that we're aware of. Alternatively, if we wish to propose that it's not really Jesus' body, but some other body, we must suppose that some forger knew about this mysterious \"naturalistic\" process that still eludes us, found some guy who looked like Jesus in the artwork, then whipped him, crucified him, stuck a crown of thorns on his head, and speared him in the side to make his injuries look like Jesus', then put what would become the Sudarium of Oviedo on his face, then removed the Sudarium and put the Shroud over him, and performed whatever type of chemical wizardry was necessary to make the man's image transfer to the Shroud (but unknown to everyone else of his day and still unknown to us), then somehow passed the Shroud and Sudarium off as legitimate.Still, from reading Dan Porter's blog, there seems to be some disagreement between Ray Rogers' description of the image and the ENEA's, with Ray Rogers claiming that the image only exists in some sort of film of impurities on the surface of the Shroud, without perturbing the actual linen fibers at all, and the ENEA team postulating that the image is burned into the primary cell walls of the linen fibers. Do you have any insight into this?.","date":"2012-01-24","mins":"5:32 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html","title":"\nJohn P.

Hamon attributes it to \"more pressure\" on the cloth by the hands and face. Personally, I find Hamon's idea problematic because if the reverse side image were the result of more pressure, then there should have been a *much stronger* image of Jesus' back on the reverse side of the back image than there is of his face and hands on the reverse of the front side. After all, the back is the side of the Shroud he was laying on, with the full pressure of his body weight! And, finally, why do we see Jesus' hair so clearly on the Shroud, which shouldn't have exerted any significant pressure at all (actually, it occurs to me that the hair is just as serious and maybe fatal a problem for Ray Rogers and any other possible \"naturalistic\" explanation involving chemical reaction with a dead body as well)? In any event, the idea that the reverse image was caused by pressure presupposes that this is a real body we're talking about. In fact, the existence of the reverse side image puts further paid to the notion that this was some sort of paint job.Btw, I got a bit of a chuckle out of sciencebod's objection that started the thread at Dan Porter's blog that I linked to. He tries to argue that the image isn't really 3 D because the burn holes create a 3 D appearance under topological analysis as well, and he seems to think that this is some sort of major revelation. Um, duh. Isn't it obvious that the 3 D image arises from differences in hue caused by the different intensities of \"burn in\" on the image, so that anything else that causes a gradation of hue (such as a burn mark) will produce a \"3 D effect\" in an analysis that estimates depth based on hue? What was sciencebod expecting? An actual hologram on a linen cloth?! Anyhow, by making the argument that the 3 D image is fake, and that it's actually some sort of 2 D image masterfully made to look 3 D, he's implicitly committed himself to precisely those absurdities that we covered earlier. In fact, he seems to compound the insanity by insisting that the image was made with \"a converging lens, concave mirror, or even pinhole camera\" (just try to imagine a medieval forger performing such a feat)!.","date":"2012-01-24","mins":"5:33 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html","title":"\nJohn P.

With this, the single solitary piece of evidence against the Shroud's authenticity, the one thing the skeptics had to cling to, has been shattered. And just in time for Easter!I doubt many skeptics will be persuaded by this, or any possible evidence no matter how strong. If they won't believe Moses and the Prophets, after all, they will not believe even if one is raised from the dead.However, I expect we're going to see a lot of even loopier theories about the Shroud from them, as these findings paint them into an even smaller and more untenable corner than they were already in. In particular, I think we're going to see a lot more Wesselow style \"real but fake\" nonsense, where the skeptic admits the Shroud was the real burial cloth of Jesus, but tries to explain away the image as somehow an accident rather than a miracle..","date":"2013-04-01","mins":"11:06 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2013/03/new-experiments-on-shroud-show-its-not.html","title":"\nNew experiments on Shroud show it's not medieval\n"}]
