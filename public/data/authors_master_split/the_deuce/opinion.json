Between sciencebod, Bad Archeology, and the reader Dan mentioned who denied there was any image at all, I’m reminded of that story about Galileo’s scientific contemporaries who refused to look in the telescope, or did look and claimed to have seen nothing but smudges. When someone wants badly enough to not know something, their will can overcome their very senses. If he’s truly interested let him put his money where his mouth is and make a copy of the shroud with all the same properties and submit it for analysis. Actually, to make it relevant to what he’s claiming, he needs to create an image (photograph or painting) that creates a realistic 3 D shape of a human face and body when the brightness of the image is translated into elevation, but without doing it on purpose..","date":"2012-02-01","mins":"1:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/31/badder-still-bad-archaeology-at-bad-archaeology/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Badder Still: Bad Archaeology at Bad Archaeology"},{"id":"comment-7808","author":"the_deuce","post":"Sciencebod, are you seriously this dense? *Obviously* any photograph or painting will give you *some* result or other if you map brightness to elevation. But, like that Einstein photo (which came out mostly flat and with lines and inverted eyebrows), the result will not be anything like the actual elevation of a real human face. That’s the whole point. Actual photographs and paintings produce garbage when you run that sort of algorithm on them, whereas the Shroud produces an accurate elevation of a real human face. Hence, either some super skilled artisan deliberately encoded 3 D information by “painting” the image in such a way that elevation would correspond with brightness, or the image was somehow produced by a real human body (or model of a human body) such that elevation would correspond to brightness. Showing us examples of how photos and paintings produce garbage results merely illustrates our point for us that the Shroud is not a painting or a photo, but an elevation map..","date":"2012-01-31","mins":"8:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/31/badder-still-bad-archaeology-at-bad-archaeology/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Badder Still: Bad Archaeology at Bad Archaeology"},{"id":"comment-7820","author":"the_deuce","post":"And your willful, obstinate, invincible ignorance of the most basic data disqualifies you from courtesy..","date":"2012-02-01","mins":"1:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/31/badder-still-bad-archaeology-at-bad-archaeology/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Badder Still: Bad Archaeology at Bad Archaeology"}]
