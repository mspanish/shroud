[{"author":"the_deuce","post":"I don't get Porter's point. *Obviously* the square isn't strong evidence for the Shroud's authenticity all by itself, and could be discounted as a strange but not too extraordinary coincidence in isolation, but nobody has ever suggested taking it in isolation in the first place. Obviously the point of the Vignon markings argument is that lots of odd little coincidences, which wouldn't be all that significant in the absence of the others, add up together and reinforce each other, in combination with all the other evidence for the Shroud's authenticity.Particularly for someone who already believes the Shroud's authenticity on other grounds, or even strongly suspects it, the neatest explanation for these coincidences would be that they're based on the Shroud itself..","date":"2014-05-02","mins":"12:35 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/04/how-valid-are-vignon-markings-my.html","title":"\n\"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?\": My response to Dan Porter\n"},{"author":"the_deuce","post":"That there is NO such comprehensive and internally consistent forgery theory, is itself evidence that the Shroud is NOT a forgery.Indeed. In fact, it's logically impossible for there to EVER be a theory on how the most prominent features, like the photo negativity and 200nm depth of the image, were formed, since those things were completely unknown at the time of the supposed forgery, and couldn't be detected or known until hundreds of years later.So there can never be a Shroud forgery theory. At best there can be a \"How some guy forged an elaborate image on a cloth, and ended up producing all these amazing puzzling features he couldn't see or know about completely by accident.\"Of course, the anti authenticists aren't even at the point of being able to produce on purpose what was supposedly produced by blind luck..","date":"2014-05-02","mins":"8:24 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/04/how-valid-are-vignon-markings-my.html","title":"\n\"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?\": My response to Dan Porter\n"},{"author":"the_deuce","post":"Hi Steve!I'd never been able to make out the square with open top or the triangle underneath it before, but I just realized that's because I've always been looking at the contrast enhanced negatives of the Shroud, which actually obscure those details. On the original image (which of course is what 6th to 12th century artists would have seen) they're as clear as day!And you're right. The repeated, uncanny reproduction of such details, which are the result of flaws in the cloth rather than part of the actual image that's on it, demonstrates, all by themselves and beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Shroud existed at that time..","date":"2012-03-21","mins":"9:43 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/03/four-proofs-that-ad-1260-1390.html","title":"\nFour proofs that the AD 1260-1390 radiocarbon date for the Shroud has to be wrong!: #2 The Vignon markings (4)\n"},{"author":"the_deuce","post":"How can people cling on too and repeatedly use the 1988 c14 dating as proof or evidence for the Shroud being medieval?The anti authenticists cling to it because it's pretty much the only thing they have to cling to.
