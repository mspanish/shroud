It’s from that Joe Jackson paper Stephen Jones put online: “There are, in addition, other aspects of the Shroud which indicate that the cloth enveloped a real body. This is demonstrated by the numerous bloodstains, labeled B F in Figure la, which correspond to distinctly [328] different flow directions, consistent with a vertical crucifixion first, followed by a horizontal burial of a real corpse. Several examples that illustrate flows in the vertical position are the wound in the side (Feature B), trickles along the forearms (Feature D), puncture wounds on the head (Feature E) and the wrist wound (Feature C). Conversely, the bloodstain across the small of the back (Feature F) and the trickle at the dorsal foot (Feature G 1) correspond to a body oriented in the horizontal position. The latter set of bloodstains depict liquid and, therefore, presumably late time post mortem flows. In contrast, the vertical bloodstain set corresponds to clot transfers and, hence, earlier flows that had dried to some extent. Thus, the bloodstains are consistent with crucifixion followed by burial.”.","date":"2012-02-17","mins":"2:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly"},{"id":"comment-8481","author":"the_deuce","post":"Here’s another interesting paper that summarizes a lot of the interesting features of the Shroud as of 2000, including the blood and why we know it’s blood: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ford1.pdf In particular, from page 7: “Adler and others answer Vignon’s question and Mc Crone’s objection in the following manner. For one thing, not all the ‘blood’ material is red, for its color ranges from yellow to orange to red to brown. Also, the ‘blood’ is not whole blood, but exudate from a blood clot (when a blood clot dries, it contracts, exuding liquid blood material). The ‘blood’ moreover is blood clot exudate from a beaten, traumatized individual.A traumatic beating would destroy red blood cells, and the red cell debris would go to the liver, which in turn would take the debris’s hemoglobin and convert it to the bile pigment bilirubin. Bilirubin levels in the blood would rapidly rise, meaning that should a cut form, the resulting blood clot’s exudate will contain serum albumin (a protein found in blood serum), and that albumin will bring with it bilirubin. The clot exudate’s hemoglobin oxidizes to become “methemoglobin,” which is reddish brown/ brown; this reddish brown/ brown + the yellow orange bilirubin = red.” In other words, many of the various puzzles regarding the blood are actually further evidence of authenticity. In this case, we have evidence that it’s not just any human blood, but blood from a heavily traumatized individual, and furthermore that it’s partial blood exuded from already drying blood clots, rather than whole liquid blood painted on..","date":"2012-02-19","mins":"5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly"}]
