No one who thinks that the shroud is real should have any fear of the truth from wherever. The Royal Society would be fairly good at such an undertaking. I also think we might start with the question Colin raises about bloodstains and go from there. Eventually, the question of C14 will need to be addressed. Maybe the Royal Society can get Oxford involved. I do think it is a bit naïve to think that a letter from Colin will do the trick. I therefore propose to start a petition campaign at change.org. The whole shroud community including SSG, BTST and readers of this blog could electronically sign the petition encouraging Paul Nurse to become involved. We could invite CSICOP and other skeptical organizations to sign the petition as well. Get enough groups involved and the media will get involved. BTW: I’m a bit confused. Colin tells us that the “Royal Society’s [has a] current policy of confronting and exposing pseudo science.” As evidence of this he quotes the BBC saying, “Sir Paul believes strongly that scientists have a duty to speak out about science in public life and challenge pseudoscience.” I was not aware that what Nurse opines is ex cathedra policy for the entire society. He must be one powerful dude. Actually, Royal Society policy and policy work including confrontation “is organised around the following four themes.” 1)Sustainability, 2)Diplomacy, 3)Innovation and 4)Governance. I guess we could petition the society to add 5)Icons and Relics..","date":"2013-03-05","mins":"11:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/defining-pseudoscience-it-takes-a-rocket-surgeon/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Defining Pseudoscience:  It Takes a Rocket Surgeon"},{"id":"comment-35852","author":"paulette","post":"Has the shroud ever been in Rome?.","date":"2013-06-03","mins":"6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/every-year-millions-travel-to-rome-to-view-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Every year, millions travel to Rome to view the shroud . . . ???"},{"id":"comment-214750","author":"paulette","post":"There is of course the Critical Summary of Silliness 3.0 for the strident dematerialists..","date":"2015-11-17","mins":"2:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-44622","author":"paulette","post":"Perhaps we should stop boasting with the term peer reviewed.
