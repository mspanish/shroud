[{"id":"comment-101936","author":"paulette","post":"This is not how facial matching works at all. Dayvault should know better. Moreover you are comparing art to art, a primitive mosaic to what may be an idealized painting. Give me a break. Even the best facial matching software, which is not what Dayvault is using, is vastly inferior to a human being’s ability to identify faces. Having said all that, I think Akiane’s painting looks like the man on the shroud. The ISA Mosaic is a slight maybe to my eyes and brain. The St. Catherine icon is a much better fit, I think. So let’s say Akiane had a vision via a model. So let’s say Burpo saw Jesus in his NDE and it looked like the Akiane painting. It could be, just could be, a human gut feeling match to the man of the shroud, assuming much, that is. Nothing more..","date":"2014-04-21","mins":"8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-191489","author":"paulette","post":"That the 1532 burn marks and water stains match a 1355 bas relief is proof that time runs backwards..","date":"2015-02-21","mins":"10:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/21/a-bas-relief-match-to-the-shroud-of-turin-image/","cat":"art","title":"A Bas Relief Match to the Shroud of Turin Image?"},{"id":"comment-25617","author":"paulette","post":"I just read Colin’s first posting for day 7 shroudie alert. He seems to think we get upset with his theories and his skepticism. No we don’t. We get upset because we have learned that to disagree with him is to invite his wrath and insults. That is why so few make comments on his blog. That is why Thibault stopped commenting. Colin is his own worst enemy, not ours. And we are not his enemy except in his imagination. If he would just lighten up I think things would be much better all around..","date":"2013-02-25","mins":"10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/24/cluny-medal-versus-lirey-badge/","cat":"art","title":"Cluny Medal versus Lirey Badge"},{"id":"comment-102430","author":"paulette","post":"What is the scientific definition of a point of congruence?.","date":"2014-04-22","mins":"1:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-40825","author":"paulette","post":"Yannick, you may be right.

I think it is because for a significant number of well informed people the resurrection drawing is irrefutable non scientific evidence that the carbon 14 dating of the shroud is wrong. That is threatening to others who cannot muster a sufficiently convincing argument that it nothing of the sort. Who is right? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. It makes for widespread and reasonable doubt about 1988 tests. Short of finding some non interpretive and non speculative proof that it does not contain elements from the shroud, it will remain a playable trump card for those who believe the shroud is authentic..","date":"2014-07-01","mins":"11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-77067","author":"paulette","post":"I learn something here every day.
