I’m not doubting you. I just don’t understand. Can you explain? I do think the banding means that a scorch is almost certainly out of the question since I think is very doubtful that scorching can produce halftone effects at the fiber level.

Chemist Colin Berry is critical of Al Adler and John Heller because they only did chemical analysis on shroud samples and did not go to Turin and examine the shroud directly. Actually Adler did look at the shroud in Turin. Yet Colin Berry who has never been to to see the shroud or done any chemical analysis whatsoever on any material taken from the shroud is able to argue that the blood from leeches was applied on top of the images. And he knows this from looking at low definition pictures on the internet. Talk about pseudoscientific twaddle..","date":"2013-03-25","mins":"11:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/22/three-new-shroud-of-turin-websites-to-watch/","cat":"history","title":"Three New Shroud of Turin Websites to Watch"}]
