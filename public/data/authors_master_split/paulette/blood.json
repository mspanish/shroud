It was many years ago but I remember that every bullet hole, every knife wound, every car wreck was different. I imagine that every crucifixion was different in more ways than we imagine. I would ask my students to list as many factors and variable as possible. Hammer forged spikes come to mind. Do they use those in Mexico? If you want an expert get a CSI with field and courtroom experience. G&B wouldn’t last three minutes against a good lawyer. Hugh, be the skeptic you really are.

Authors may still request (in advance) that the editorial office waive some of the handling fee under special circumstances.” I guess the special circumstances, according to Dr. G. Fanti, is “due to the importance of the argument.” What argument is that? The scientific argument that Jesus rose from the dead? That should go over well with the other authors and readers of this journal. Readers? Does anyone read SRE? Are there any stats?
