The small piece from the lower left corner of the cloth which was tested by 3 laboratories in 1988 is not representative of the shroud. The piece was taken from a corner that had been repaired in the 16th century. Here’s the proof: o 3 different textile experts saw discernible differences between the sample area and the rest of the shroud, including an “invisible” mending technique used by Europeans of old to mend damaged linens, which made both the reweave and its reattachment “invisible” to the untrained eye. O Retired Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Raymond N. Rogers examined 14 strands from the test sample under a high powered microscope:  He saw clearly distinguishable cotton fibers (flat, tape like) spliced into the linen fibers (round, like tiny bamboo shoots). His findings were published in a 2002 co authored paper, “Scientific Method Applied to the Shroud of Turin.”  There was a brownish coating on the cotton fibers, which had been applied as a liquid and had flowed down the threads. Chemical analysis showed it was madder root in a gum arabic base—a classic dye mixture to blend in the newer mending patch with the rest of the cloth, applied after the patch was weaved.  In 1978, Rogers inspected the shroud itself with even more probing technology and confirmed there was no cotton elsewhere interwoven with the linen.  Rogers also performed a test for vanillin, found in flax, the plant from which linen is made. Vanillin is known to dissipate slowly over centuries. Rogers found significant amounts of vanillin in the Carbon 14 tested sample..","date":"2011-03-31","mins":"1:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/30/new-3d-rendering-of-the-shroud-of-turin-face-by-john-chen/","cat":"image_theory","title":"New 3D Rendering of the Shroud of Turin Face by John Chen"}]
