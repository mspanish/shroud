We have no idea what was in the mind of the artist of the HPM, whether or not he/she had even seen the Shroud or was just producing an image from hearsay. For me, any representation of Christ lying in his burial position showing crossed arms with missing thumbs (where thumbs really should be visible) indicates something very specific that the artist has seen or heard, and it must be from a significant relic/icon otherwise why copy it? There must be a source for this kind of representation. The question becomes is the Shroud that source or is it just another representation?.","date":"2014-06-21","mins":"12:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-132568","author":"chrisb","post":"How did the HPM artist arrive at a naked Christ with arms crossed and thumbs missing?

I think any discussion concerning Shroud and HPM needs proper context addressing. Did the HPM artist see the Shroud or not? This fact could drastically affect your probability weighting. Some aspects of the HPM are more certain than others when comparing to the Shroud. E,g. 1. There are certainly missing thumbs on the HPM and Shroud. 2. It is uncertain whether or not the HPM depicts a tomb lid with a zigzag pattern or whether it is the Shroud with its herringbone weave. How do you go about weighting these perceived similarities when calculating probabilities? It seems to be highly subjective and not amenable to this type of comparison..","date":"2014-06-21","mins":"12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-132168","author":"chrisb","post":"The most telling part about the HPM is surely the four fingered hands.

It bears too much resemblance to other works with a similar scene, e.g the Champleve Armlet in the Louvre. The lid in this scene is the same shape as the one in the Pray Codex, and Christ is shown stepping out of the tomb holding what appears to be his shroud. However, there are other works which show Christ lying on his Shroud on top of the tomb lid pre entombment, so perhaps the Shroud is somehow affixed to the tomb lid in the Pray Codex?.","date":"2013-09-10","mins":"1:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"}]
