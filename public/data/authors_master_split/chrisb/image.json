[{"id":"comment-649","author":"chrisb","post":"Hi Colin, thanks for referencing my comment on your blog. One thing that strikes me about your theory about how the Shroud image was formed (effectively plunging a 250c statue into a sand bed covered with a linen sheet as I understand it) is that there should be on the Shroud a correlation between the superficiality of the image and intensity of grey scale. On this point, for your theory to hold, it seems to me the image depth should be greater on places like the tip of the nose than on the side of the nose for example, as you pointed out more pressure would be exerted there. I don’t know if this is the case with the Shroud as I’m not sure where image samples were taken from..","date":"2012-09-10","mins":"10:13 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/how-long-before-the-grey-scales-fall-from-peoples-eyes-and-the-shroud-image-accepted-as-a-thermal-imprint-scorch/","cat":"medieval_hoax","title":"How long before the grey scales fall from people’s eyes, and the Shroud image accepted as a thermal imprint (“scorch”)??"},{"id":"comment-92398","author":"chrisb","post":"The last thing I would expect to see is a crease of this nature resulting from a hot template being applied to a piece of cloth. Or, as in Colin’s experiments, the linen being applied over a hot template. Creases like this are usually ironed in which is counter intuitive to the LOTTO method. I’m not convinced that they are creases in the first place. Do we have any data showing a continuous deformity in the weave which would be characteristic of a crease, or is it simply because it looks like a crease?.","date":"2014-03-23","mins":"5:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/23/baked-in-creases-really/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Baked-In Creases.

Also, there’s far more of the image missing compared to the Shroud. I’d also like to see how superficial those feet scorches are. Do you have any microscopic images Colin?
