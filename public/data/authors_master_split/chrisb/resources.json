[{"id":"comment-83135","author":"chrisb","post":"Many of us agree that the man on the Shroud is indeed Jesus and many of us believe that miracles are associated with him. I think therefore, that is entirely logical to make the assumption that the image is miraculous, and we shouldn’t be afraid or embarrassed to say so. As for exhausting naturalistic explanations, I think that in the main they have been. The chances of vapours arranging themselves to form a virtually non distorted image is highly improbable, and this method should be discounted. Scorches, applied substances such as pigments have also been discounted scientifically. There isn’t a great deal left apart from radiation models. I don’t buy secondary miracles as it just doesn’t seem to do justice to God’s majesty, and this comes back to my point about being embarrassed about professing a proper miracle. I believe that Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead without any naturalistic factors being involved, and that he walked on water without the aid of a strong wind for example. I also believe that he emitted pure light at the Transfiguration to show his true glorified state..","date":"2014-02-27","mins":"3:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/26/giulio-fantis-book-launched/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti’s Book Launched"},{"id":"comment-83190","author":"chrisb","post":"Can you explain how vapours can cause a near non distorted image on an object as deep as a human body? It may well work on a pressed flower, but not I think on an object with significantly more depth. I also mentioned that it is not unreasonable to assume the image is miraculous because of its association with Jesus.

I myself have no time for any kind of supernatural explanation for the formation of the shroud, not because such an explanation is not possible, but because, should I ever become convinced of it, then no further scientific exploration of the shroud would be sensible. A miracle does not need radiation, vapours or any kind of biochemical process to produce an image. Or a thousand loaves and fishes for that matter. Doesn’t nature come from the supernatural, and yet it is still scientifically explored? And is this not the reason that Jesus could perform all manner of miracles and indeed be resurrected? I’m sure the disciples who witnessed the Transfiguration called it a miracle, where he shone brilliantly..","date":"2014-02-28","mins":"5:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/26/giulio-fantis-book-launched/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti’s Book Launched"},{"id":"comment-20644","author":"chrisb","post":"Your test misses a third option – an image of the Passion and death of Jesus Christ AND an image of the Resurrected Christ.
