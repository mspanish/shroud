[{"id":"comment-17304","author":"chrisb","post":"Unless Jesus was buried naked contrary to the Gospels, there were definitely some burial cloths of his, and ones that bore his blood. Given the magnitude of the resurrection, I doubt the apostles/disciples would have promptly incinerated or disposed of his burial cloths. So it is reasonable to assume that they must have been/still are in existence. No early references to them is moot..","date":"2012-10-07","mins":"5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/07/davor-aslanovski-sindonology-a-heresy/","cat":"history","title":"Davor Aslanovski: Sindonology a Heresy"},{"id":"comment-16623","author":"chrisb","post":"He is fully God and man. If he had a wife, then what need was there for him to be born of a virgin, whom we are told was free from original sin? It is heresy and attempts to deny the Son of God his rightful place.

It strikes me that you tend to go for more naturalistic explanations which leads me to think why you would accept the accounts of the resurrection as opposed to the body being stolen?.","date":"2012-09-22","mins":"6:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/19/hot-new-topic-the-wife-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Hot New Topic: The Wife of Jesus"},{"id":"comment-16569","author":"chrisb","post":"Does it matter?
