[{"id":"comment-98078","author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"AS far as I can recall from anatomy if Dr Pierre barbet is right, assuming that the wrist nail pierced the palmar (volar) face of the wrist iabout the middle of the palmar crease, no major arterial vessel is damaged. Actually,, radial artery,, ulnar artery and superficial palmar arch are spared from injury, meaning that no major arterial bleeding will occur. Curiously, if nailing was at the palm in the intermetacarpal spaces,, small arterial vessels (common digital) could be damaged with bleeding ,but even so as it was previously asserted on this blog, Philippines crucifixion volunteers don’t show relevant hand bleeding If we analyze left wrist exit nail wound as depicted on the Shroud image it seems it fits Dr. Barbet’s description of an area at the level of Destot’s anatomical space of the carpus (it’s a virtual space between te lunate, triquetrum capitatum and hamatum bones ) The nail didn’t damage major arterial vessels during his way through the wrist because on the dorsal aspect of the wrist there are no important arterial vessels either. We can conclude that wrist hemorrage originates mainly from damage of the wrist network veins, and blood pouring from the wound had to be slow, but when the nail was removed there could be an increased transient bleeding ,,this time post mortem blood. I utterly agree with Dr. Kelly Kearse and Paulette that many unknown factors like sweat, hair , abrasions etc. Can modify the direction of blood trails on the forearms, nevertheless the blood flow we observe on the Shroud clearly indicates that blood moved proximally (from wrist to the elbows) so iit’s not unreasonable to conclude that it occured in a crucifixion position with arms forming an angle about 60 degrees with vertical line of gravity. Dr. Gil Lavoie has done an extensive research on this issue ,where the important fact of the outside elbow stain is analyzed in the context.

On his comments because they make sense nevertheless I’d’like to add: It’s very difficult to analyze the conditions on which the blood rivulets we observe on the Shroud were produced let alone to reproduce them in any kind of experiment. In a real crucifixion by nailing through the wrists and accordingly to Dr. Barbet’s claim no major arterial or venous blood vessels would be injured it seems that along with small venous vessels only tiny carpal branches from the radial and ulnar arteries would be pierced. So being a mixture of arterial and venous blood would be slowly exiting from the carpal exit nail wound. We have also to consider movements of superior limbs while hanging on the cross and the exact position of them relative to the gravity line during those movements. Contact transter of bloody exudates from forearm clots and washing or not washing he body before wrapping in the Shroud are certainly other aspects to be considered. The bloody rivulets of the experiment were obtained in different conditions. Concerning the side wound, the bloody material on the Shroud is surely post mortem blood from the right atrium and superior cava vein and a serous fluid from a traumatic pericardial or pleural effusion. The «blood belt» would form by gravity when the Man of the Shroud was moved to the suppine position with a little inclination to the right side and residual blood flew from inferior cava vein. This is of course an hypothetical scenario perhaps the closest to reality and it seems to me that the conditions of the experiment of Dr. Matteo Morrini and Professor Luigi Garlaschelli did not take into account these and perhaps other unknown conditions. So it turns out their conclusion «Taken together the results of these tests are therefore not consistent with the general trend of the rivulets of blood on the Shroud of Turin and seem to refuse to testify in favor of their authenticity, but rather in an artistic or didactic.» was drawn in a hasty way.( fact that does not surprise me) regards Antero de Frias Moreira Centro Português de Sindonologia.","date":"2015-04-13","mins":"12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/11/new-garlaschelli-and-borrini-study/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"New Garlaschelli and Borrini Study"},{"id":"comment-209589","author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Dear Louis I appreciate your kind words but I don’t consider myself «a very serious scholar» I’m just a humble Physical and Rehabilitation medical doctor fascinated by the Shroud who seeks to learn more and more about the Shroud and I learned a lot from your comments and from the ones of many bloggers in this wonderful website I thank all of you Antero de Frias Moreira.","date":"2015-09-04","mins":"10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

Antero points out that as no major blood vessels are, pierced (and I might add that with the wound level or above the head blood pressure is minimal anyway) very little blood would come out at any time, although if the wound were continuously agitated, perhaps sporadic flow could be stimulated until death, when no more blood would be expected, even after removal of the nail This time I agree with Dr. Hugh Farey that conditions like sweat aand possible particles of dust on the surface of forearms could also have some influence on the aspect of the blood trails. Actually if a normal individual elevates his superior limb above head level there is an instantaneous blood pressure dropping at distal level but soon homeostatic mechanisms from the sympathetic nervous system adjust blood arterial vessel tonus to the new postural condition so blood pressure dropping is well compensated or minimal. Only in pathological conditions like anomalies of thoraxic outlet or arterial diseases is blood flow to the extremity compromised when one elevates the arms above head level, Although blood pressure dropping in superior limbs due to the state of hypovolemic schock and crucifixion position of superior limbs( inclination at about 60 degrees to the vertical?) are important aspects to consider, these would not preclude at all some blood exiting from the dorsal (and volar) wrist exit nail wounds. Nevertheless these conditions would possibly cause a low or very low velocity blood flow and the aspects of the blood trails would also be related to the time the body was hanging on the cross by the progressive adding of small quantities od blood. As we see from previous considerations it is not easy to reproduce in a single experiment the gathering of ALL the conditions present when the Man of the Shroud was crucified and the conclusions of this skeptic experiment are worthless. This does not mean that new experiments shoul not be tried, but not in such a simple approach.

Despite all the naif arguments presented by skeptics and partisans of the swoon theory reliable forensic evidence regarding the image and bloodstains pointing to the fact that the Shroud did wrap a corpse is overwhelming. Is there human blood on the Shroud? Spectroscopic chemical and immunological tests namely ABO and MNS blood typing allow us to give a positive answer.( I understand that absolute scientific exactness allows us to state that there is primate blood on the Shroud possibly human…) What are main blood changes after death? Biochemical analysis of blood show that within a period of 96 hours there is a Ph decrease and an increase in blood concentration of lactate NADH and nitrogen containing metabolites like hypoxantine, uric acid and ammonia http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082011 Have these metabolites been found in conducted blood analysis on colllected Shroud samples? NO BUT IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE EXISTENCE OF POST MORTEM BLOOD. Remember the difficulties in proving the presence of blood on the Shroud.not to mention that the mentioned study on this subject was performed on blood samples within 96 hours after death NOT CENTURIES or MILLENNIA !!! Blood cells also experience metabolic and membrane changes and die. Although few blood red cells have been found on the Shroud and there is a reasonable explanation why, I recall that bloodstains on the Shroud are not whole blood but blood exsudates from clots, the cells remained trapped by the fibrin network Professor Baima Bolllone and Dr. Gerard Lucotte found red blood cells with altered shape. So the presence of ante mortem and post mortem blood when applied to the Shroud cannot be approached by analysis of metabolites or blood cells BUT BY THE MACROSCOPIC OBSERVATION OF THE BLOODSTAINS ON THE SHROUD BY EXPERIENCED FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS this is my humble opinion and my mind is opened to advices from experts on forensic and biochemical sciences.. Are Professors Judica Cordiglia, Sebastiano Rodante,, Pierluigi Baima Bollone, Frederick Zugibe,, Dr. Robert Bucklin Dr. Delfin Villalain experienced forensic patholgists? YES THEY ARE. What is their opinion? I’ll quote only a few Dr. Robert Bucklin: Upon examining the chest, the pathologist notes a large blood stain over the right pectoral area Close examination shows a variance in intensity of the stain consistent with the presence of two types of fluid, one comprised of blood, and the other resembling water. There is distinct evidence of a gravitational effect on this stain with the blood flowing downward and without spatter of other evidence of the projectile activity which would be expected from blood issuing from a functional arterial source. This wound has all the characteristics of a postmortem type flow of blood from a body cavity or from an organ such as the heart. At the upper plane of the wound is an ovoid skin defect which is characteristic of a penetrating track produced by a sharp puncturing instrument. Dr Delfin Villalain (and orthopedic surgeon Professor de Palacios Carvajal): 5.2 The separated blood of the side wound Comment to § 3.2. Would the side wound reveal that the blood circulation was still active? The side wound resulted from a blow with a sharp instrument, like a spear, driven through the 5th intercostal space (Barbet, 1954; 1970; Baima Bollone, 1990, 2000). It consists of an oval, elongated mark (4 x 1.5 cm, Fig. 3, in yellow) corresponding to the area where the spear entered, plus a bloody outflow 6 cm wide and 15 cm long. The injury shows that the skin has been sharply cut, having pointed extremities and rectilinear wide open lips as if the damaging agent had deeply penetrated (Baima Bollone, 1994). The wound does not show signs of vital retraction, as should happen in the case of a living person, and the blow must have been inflicted on a corpse (Baima Bollone, 1990, 1994, 2000; Zugibe, 2005). The outflow is composed of some rivulets of red liquid (blood) plus a clearer liquid (serum), as revealed by UV photos (made by G.B. Judica Cordiglia 1988 and V. Miller 1981). See Fig. 3 and the graphic elaboration of TS high resolution photos (Bedon et al., 2008). Such kind of stain is possible if internal body structures have been wounded. In addition Baima Bollone (1994) observes that wounds of a living person bleed actively, whereas this outflow has all the characteristics of a passive drainage. Fig. 3. On the upper left, ultraviolet photograph of the lance wound which enhances the serum contraction rings around the bloodstain (courtesy of V. Miller 1981 and A. Adler, from The Orphanated Manuscript, 2002, Fig. 2). On the right side, wound bloodstain as seen on the TS. The main blood rivulet has been enhanced in red. INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE SHROUD OF TURIN PERSPECTIVES OF A MULTIFACETED ENIGMA: COLUMBUS – OHIO AUGUST 14 17, 2008 7 A possible source for the blood is liquid accumulation in situ (within the thoracic cavity) and subsequent separation of its components after a hemopericardium (most probable), a hemothorax (Baima Bollone, 1990; 2000) or a huge thoracic trauma (Battaglini, 1987, 1990; Pisano, 1991). The blood separation into its components is considered a sign of death, because the blood must rest still for a certain period of time and blood circulation must be obviously stopped to allow it (Baima Bollone, 1994, and references therein, Zugibe, 2005). The repeated bleeding of this wound does not mean that the heart was beating and the man was alive, but can be easily explained by passive flowing of blood during body transport (Baima Bollone, 1990, 1994; Coppini, 1992), probably responsible also for the blood belt on the dorsal image. In «The death of the Shroud Man an improved review» http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p07.pdf Professor Baima Bollone has a similar opinion regarding the side wound and states that blood flow from the feet left an imprint of mixed vital and post mortem blood. In The Forensic Characteristics of the Blood Marks, International Scientific Symposium Torino 2 5 March 2000 I could cite more examples but not to make this comment too long I’ll end here. SO DESPITE ALL THE FUSS IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS POST MORTEM BLOOD ON THE SHROUD regards Antero de Frias Moreira (Centro Português de Sindonologia).","date":"2015-08-27","mins":"3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

The added blood theory is ludicrous Red stains on the Shroud are not whole blood they are rather blood clot exsudates that imprinted on the fabric by a contact process with a body. I As a general denomination red stains comprise «blood rivulets and blood trails from the venous and arterial injuries from crucifixion and the cap of thorns,, the «blood flow» from the spear wound and the «blood belt» on the dorsal body image. Regarding the scourge marks no doubt they correspond also to a blood exsudate as evidenced by the serum ring surounding them which appears on U.V. Fluorescence photographs but these marks may also result from contusion of soft tissues by scourging with a «flagrum» whip. Forensic medical experts concluded that «blood» marks are consistent with injuries resulting from scourging and crucifixion. Although not every red stain was studied( I mean sampled and observed on micoscope/magnified) Shroud researchers would surely notice differences if some whole blood had been added later in Shroud history let alone the fact that brush srokes would be apparent.to a careful examination. Why and how would a forger or a Shroud caretaker add or retouch «blood marks» with hematic material derived from a clot exsudate? Did a Middle Age forger have the knowledge of clotting physiology? The answer is straightforward NO!!! So it turns out this «theory» is just another time waste on Shroud studies, It’s only usefulness is fueling discussion on this blog and the possibility of learning something more from the content and links provided by some commenters. Putting aside this as a far fetched «thought» I’d appreciate to know what is really observed on the Shroud that led these people to elaborate such an absurd claim.
