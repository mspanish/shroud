[{"id":"comment-195562","author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"As far as I remember the Sudarium of Oviedo was radiocarbon dated once more in a spanish laborator (/ I guess in Madrid) in 2008. The results confirmed a previous dating from the seventh century A.D.although this was not a surprise at all for scientists of Centro Español de Sindonologia because it is well known that the Sudarium has a high level of contamination. When I attended 2012 Valencia Shroud Congress I remember to listen to a presentation by a member of Centro Español de Sindonologia who explained those results because there was enrichment of the fabric with new C14 from tiny carbonaceous particles stuck to the fibers which could not be removed in cleaning pre dating procedures. Actually he showed interesting images where everyone could see those tiny black spots stuck to the fibers, as he explained resulting from previous fire in the cathedral. I got the idea that a correct radiodating of Oviedo Sudarium was thus impossible. This is all I can share with you. I think this paper is entitled «Dating the Cloth by C14 Method The Oviedo Sudarium by Felipe Montero Ortega but it’s not available perhaps the Magazine Linteum from Centro Español de Sindonologia has already published it P.S.

He stated that the results of 2007 radiocarbon dating the Sudarium of Oviedo around 700 A.D. Had to be explained by some factor(s) that skewed the tests, namely contamination. So a study had been done by scientists from Centro Español de Sindonologia and microscopic examination of the fabric whose images were shown on the screen to the attendance determined the presence of many tiny carbonaceous particles over the threads,resulting from a previous fire in the Oviedo Cathedral, he called the particles the black particles Accordingly to this scientist the presence of those carbonaceous particles which were impossible to completely extract from the sample by the cleaning procedures were responsible by the younger dating than expected. If anyone has something to add I’d appreciate. Regards Antero de Frias Moreira.

Maybe if you contact Centro Español de Sindonologia they will give you the anwer to your legitimate questions Nevertheless I got the idea that radiocarbon dating of Sudarium of Oviedo would never provide accurate results because of the impossibility to remove those carbonaceous debris.
