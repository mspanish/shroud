Anyway the image is not a radiograph and can not be compared to a plain wrist/hand X Ray so any measurements done on it are but approximative. Nevertheless if I draw a line in correspondence to the axis of the fourth metacarpal bone the exit nail wound is quite near to it in the medial carpal área possibly on the so called Destot’s space(between the lunatum, triquetrum capitatum and hamatum bones) as described by Dr. Pierre Barbet. Thus I think that from an anatomical point of view, nothing contradicts the hypothesis of the exit wound be on the carpal área.
