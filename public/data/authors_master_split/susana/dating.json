[{"id":"comment-9788","author":"susana","post":"Dawkins doesn’t have the qualifications to carry out this work. He’s simply a biologist a little too in love with a theory that while elegant and absolutely valid, is not meant to answer every question in the universe. Moreover, he lacks a little something called impartiality.

Why in the world would any of us care what he thinks?.","date":"2012-03-30","mins":"9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"}]
