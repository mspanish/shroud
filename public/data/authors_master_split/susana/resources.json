I did appreciate the fact that he uses the word “plausibly” a lot more than Dawkins (actually I don’t think Dawkins knows that word), thereby conceding that the doesn’t actually really, seriously know for sure. I found this statement interesting and reminiscent of something I have read somewhere else: “What’s amazing to me is that we’re now at a point where we can plausibly argue that a universe full of stuff came from a very simple beginning, the simplest of all beginnings: nothing.” Oh, right, I know where I’ve seen that before: “Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.” Gen 1:1 3.","date":"2012-04-30","mins":"6:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/krauss-i-dont-really-give-a-damn-what-nothing-means-to-philosophers-i-care-about-the-nothing-of-reality/","cat":"books","title":"Krauss:  I don’t really give a damn what \"nothing\" means to philosophers; I care about the \"nothing\" of reality.\""},{"id":"comment-10261","author":"susana","post":"Annie, you’re so right. I have noticed that particularly on You Tube there seems to be a critical mass of these young air heads. They’re so abysmally unprepared for any intelligent discussion, yet they immediately jump on any pro faith videos that are posted, antagonizing the believers and inciting arguments. I think they’ve assumed that all people of faith are dumb and that there is no need to know anything to prove their superiority of intellect. I recently did engage in a sort of argument with a couple of them. I’m not prone to wasting my time like that but the blasphemy they were spouting was so offensive. They immediately proved they had nothing of substance to argue. I gave up and left them to work their way out of the wet paper bag they’d willingly climbed into. But some people do get really worked up by them and I guess that’s what they’re after. Sigh. I will not click on that link and give them the satisfaction..","date":"2012-04-10","mins":"12:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/26/%e2%80%aaan-invitation-to-discuss-the-shroud-of-turin-youve-got-to-be-kidding/","cat":"video","title":"‪An invitation to discuss the Shroud of Turin.
