I don’t dispute what she or Colton saw when in heaven. My question is did Jesus have any color in skin? Jesus is always depicted as a white man. Given the region where he was born, lived,traveled and died, is there a possibility that he was not white?.","date":"2012-02-05","mins":"11:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
