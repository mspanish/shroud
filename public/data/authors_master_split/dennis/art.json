When a small child looks directly into your eyes and is so trusting, and a persons spirit, you can immediately sence the presence of good and bad people in an instant. When I think of what Jesus did for all people and how he suffered for us… it blows my little mind. Jesus shows Himself in little and big ways so often, especially when I don’t expect Him to be in my time of need!. The fact that Israel is a major country literally a garden in a barren land is reason enough for me to believe in Jesus. Thank you Father for your son Jesus...","date":"2012-08-13","mins":"7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
