[{"id":"comment-70286","author":"dennis","post":"Where is your evidence for that? Your position is that the disciples touched a cloth, spoke with a cloth,and ate with a cloth that contained an as of yet unexplained image of Jesus. The apostle Paul converted when he was made blind by a cloth? The disciples gave their lives believing the Shroud was the Risen Christ? Thomas was poking his finger in the Shroud when he needed convincing of Christ being alive. There is no factual basis for this belief. Think what you will about the authenticity of the Shroud, the disciples believed they saw, touched, and experienced a walking, talking Jesus. Their actions post Crucifiction cannot be explained otherwise..","date":"2013-12-30","mins":"7:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/29/new-video-discovering-jesus-in-his-holy-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"New Video: Discovering Jesus in His HolyÂ Shroud"}]
