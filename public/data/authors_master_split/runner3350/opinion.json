[{"id":"comment-190395","author":"runner3350","post":"Dan, thanks for highlighting my blog, which has been up for only a few months and has approximately as many readers as the 1994 Winnetka Telephone Directory. The Shroud is merely one of many areas of intense “weirdness studies” in which I’ve engaged over the past six decades. The post you highlighted is likely to be the only one about the Shroud. When 40 years of interest must be condensed to one 1500 word post, there is obviously little room for nuance. Since your views about the Shroud (i.e., what it probably is) seem virtually identical to mine, I’m puzzled by what seems to be a tone of dismissiveness in your comments. It’s also clear that Paulette has completely misunderstood the thrust of my post (as described by you). Most everyone has heard of the archetypical Trickster. I have no idea whether the Trickster is “real.” As a Christian, it would be easy to equate the Trickster with Satan and his minions, but I don’t believe this would be helpful in the context of my blog – the goal of which is to at least pique the interest of those who think spirituality in general and Christianity in particular are only for mindless dolts. The Shroud post appears about half way through what I am calling My Journey; my beliefs will become more explicit toward the end. My Journey is a description of how I arrived at those beliefs. Throughout my blog, I use the term “Trickster” not in any technical sense but as shorthand for “Whatever It Is that mysteriously causes every area of potentially serious paranormal research to devolve into silliness.” I have experienced this with ufology, psychical research, Near Death Experience studies, reincarnation studies and, yes, Shroud studies to some extent. The Trickster seems to have infected each of these with enough silliness to prevent the phenomenon from emerging from the shadows and being taken seriously at the mainstream level. The silliness provides a foothold for those who are inclined to be dismissive toward such phenomena, meaning the vast majority of people. The consistency with which this occurs seems quite mysterious – indeed, supernatural – to me. Something like the Shroud thus is consigned to the dustbins of lunacy by folks who would surely benefit by taking it seriously. In case it was lost on you or Paulette, the title of my post (“That Old Fake”) was entirely ironic. Interestingly, perhaps, I ran my post past Barrie Schwortz several weeks ago, and he seemed to have no difficulty understanding what I was saying or any problems with it. You ask, “Or has the Stumbler been tricked by the Trickster?” This is, of course, a possibility insofar as the Shroud is concerned. But the Shroud is merely a piece of evidence tending to support my Christian beliefs. My Christian beliefs do not hinge on the Shroud. Even my belief in the Resurrection does not hinge on the Shroud. If I have been duped by the Trickster, it has been at a far deeper and more fundamental level than my beliefs about the Shroud. You also say, “It would help if we had a better understanding of what tricks the Trickster can do and which tricks he cannot do.” Indeed, it would – but the Trickster (or Satan, as the case may be) is at a higher pay grade than you or me. As conceived by me, the Trickster is a mysterious entity bent on steering people away from the truth, fascinating and intriguing them until they realize too late that they have been led off the spiritual path and far out into a wasteland of nothingness. All we can do is be aware of the Trickster and stay constantly alert to the possibility we’re becoming caught up in its game. The Trickster may or may not be at work in Shroud studies. I believe it is and that there is a possibility of the Shroud becoming an impediment to truth rather than the beacon of truth I believe it to be. If the Shroud is what I believe it to be, it would obviously be a prime target for the Trickster – but likewise, I would hope, an object of special protection by God. Your views may differ, but in any event thanks again for highlighting my obscure blog (somewhat intentionally obscure, I might add). As for Paulette’s comment about “Trickster Excuses Theology,” I really have no idea what this is even supposed to mean; spend an hour or two on the blog, and you’ll surely see than “excusing theology” is several light years away from what the blog is about or my life has been about.

If that were true, I think I’d throw in the towel on my spiritual quest. As you suggest, it operates at the level of manipulating human nature. It takes a perfectly legitimate subject of inquiry, such as the Shroud, and makes it too silly to be taken seriously for most people. Whether we’re talking about the Shroud, the Resurrection, or the assassination of JFK, the great mass of people seem to be looking for simplistic, unchallenging explanations that allow them to get on with the routine of their lives. “Nothing to see here, move on.” If the Gods of Science say the Shroud is a 14th Century artifact, then it is and the case is closed. If the lunatic fringe of Shroud research starts claiming to see things on the Shroud that simply aren’t there, or making claims about the Shroud that are goofy on their face, those who are predisposed to dismiss the Shroud (or the Resurrection, or whatever) now have a foothold. I’ve seen this happen in every area of paranormal studies with which I’ve been associated (and I’ve been deeply immersed in several of them). It’s a small remnant of humanity that is able to say, “Yes, the Shroud research community has its own lunatic fringe that plays right into the Trickster’s hands, but the Shroud remains an object worthy of study that reveals profound truths (or at least may do so) after you filter out the silliness. I’m not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater.” One of the greatest challenges for me (hence the existence of my blog) has not been the daunting challenges I face as a believer, but rather the difficulty of getting non believers interested enough to do even a bit of investigation and educating themselves to a level where they are even capable of having an intelligent discussion..","date":"2015-02-09","mins":"3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/09/maybe-the-trickster-did-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Maybe the Trickster Did It"}]
