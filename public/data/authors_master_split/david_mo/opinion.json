Dr. Frankestein felt responsible himself of the crimes of his monster. And he didn’t know in advance what kind of murder was creating. God knows! 1.a. “Indeed, to do so, would be to abrogate man’s responsibility in the matter”. 1.a.1. God knows that the killer goes to kill. God knows he will be responsible of a crime before the crime was done. Why he needs the “responsibility” of a killer in return of the most unbearable pain of a single child? 1.a.2. I assure you that I never would try to kill anybody, even thought I knew that something would stop me. Do you like to kill children? I don’t think so. I don’t know how many people wish to kill children. I think it is a minority. But I think the world will be better if the men were incapable to do it. Wolves have inhibitory mechanisms that impede him to kill another wolf. Why not the men? 1.a.3. “Otherwise, one might construct a scenario whereby man could do whatever he willed, secure in the knowledge that God would correct any consequent evil arising from such an act, and could then abdicate from the responsibility of his actions”. Stopping to kill doesn’t imply “abdicate from the responsibility”. Freedom doesn’t ends with the killing. Freedom can be used of different ways. You could be a big egoist and not to kill any child. And we can construct other scenarios in which serial killers have the illusory idea to have made a crime they have not actually made. God is omnipotent and the possibilities for him are infinite. Why he need the pain of the killed children? 1.b. “For whatever reason” he choose do not stop this crime. What reason, please? What (comprehensible) reason do you have if you are able to stop an awful crime and you don’t do it? It seems to me that you are implicitly admitting that you don’t understand God. It is my point. 2. Knowledge, technical resources, economical power and culture are causes that in the First World the natural disasters are less harmful as in the Third World. 2.a. Knowledge, technical resources, economical power and culture have nothing to do with human individual freedom. These are unintentional circumstances and children are innocent victims of these circumstances. 2.b. Accidental events also kill children in the First World. Yes, it is the way as our world works.

We are not speaking of finite men and totalitarian systems but about a perfect entity called “God”. ”Here you stated that the all good, all powerful God tolerating evil (ANY evil) is a contradiction => such God (esencially the Christian God) doesn’t exist”.

From the God’s all powerful perspective all, even the most terrible evils of this world may be just “moderate” and very easy to fix and amend in the future world.” This is the most absurd sentence I have read to you.

You have said that “God” is incomprehensible to the human mind.(“ It is nice to see that we have such moral authorities knowing better than God from His throne what is good and what is bad, what is “extreme”, and what is “moderate” evil in the cosmic perspective…”) I agree. It is incomprehensible for moralists, for me and for you. But if you say that you can assert something about “God” (“God exists”, “God is good”, “God is omniscient”, etc.), you are an irrationalist. There is not a logical problem with irrationalism, but it is an open door to the wishful thinking and its effects on History have been often disastrous.

You cannot give a single evidence or indication about the five alternatives I put above. This is not my ignorance, but human “ignorance” that cannot solve the problem. ”And we don’t need to understand fully some entity to state something about it. We don’t fully understand star evolution, or functioning of living cells, yet we can state something about those matters.” I have explained you this fallacy. I will do it again: Men can know that there is a problem and to know also that they can solve it or not. Human beings do not know “fully” a lot of things. But it is impossible to do any assert about the exact subject that they ignore. If you ignore a particular circumstance of the living cells you cannot assert anything on this particular circumstance. A scientist never will do any assert about the previous second to the Big Bang. When we are in front of a factual problem we can do a hypothesis and search a way of contrast it with facts. But the problem of contradiction between God and evil is different because it implies facts and logic. Facts: the existence of sufferings. Logic: contradiction between good and evil. We have no means to test any hypothetical solution. Suppositions are all the theologists can do. “May be”, “is possible that”, “perhaps”… I repeat you: I have put here five possible solutions to the problem of evil and God.

The retouch: you added “intact” skull where Hachlili says nothing. However, the point is not whether the skull was intact or not, but its location. Jericho D3 is a secondary burial, it is to say, a tomb where the bones are translated and replaced (p. 504). In D3 the bones are not replaced in coffins, but piled on the floor, as you can see in p. 505.

See p. 267 8. You cannot conclude anything based on this false supposition. The alleged practice to place coins in the eyes is not supported by any evidence.

I will try to explain my position. 1. I am not scientist. I can not to check out the scientific reliability of some sindonist statements, by Adler or Rogers, for example. I let this matter to more qualified persons here as Colin, Hugh and others. 2. But I can see some scientific features from the perspective of the sociology and the philosophy of science. Both not too much sophisticated, of course. 3. From this outlook I consider that a concept becomes scientific when is widely used by the scientific community. More specially, when it is integrated in a theoretical corpus with practical implications. This is the unique way to contrast its evidence. 4. Some sindonists claim that they have successfully used some innovative technics in certain areas with huge implications. Adler and Heller on detecting ancient blood, Rogers or Fanti on some methods to date ancient textile (vaniline and mechanical), and so on. 5. If they were truly scientific these methods and its theoretical basis, they would be widely discussed and used by the scientific community in specialised books, congresses and papers. If it would be so, we had a wide series of experiments on their bases. This would allow us, the non specialist people, to asses if these theories would be scientific or not. 6. The sindonists’ revolutionary methods are absolutely overlooked by the scientific community. Their theories had a marginal presence in a handful of peer reviewed journals and no more. Despite of its potential importance they hadn’t had any effect on the Archaeometry of the last fifty years. 7. This is why they cannot be considered as “scientific” from my point of view. (“Pseudoscientific” needs an ulterior explanation). 8. I have applied this scheme to the historical field that I know better. 9. If scientifically confirmed, the existence of a more or less miraculous shroud of Jesus would be the radical importance to the problem of the “historical Jesus”. It would be expected that some of the believer historians mentioned it in the context of their debate against the mythicists. 10. This is not the case. I don’t know any reference in the work of the most relevant historians or exegetes, neither contemporary nor in the past. And I have read enough on the subject: Meier, Brown, Sanders, Dunn, Ehrman, Crossan, Bultmann, Vermes, Winter, Renan, Hurtado, etc., apart from Spanish authors as Piñero, Puente Ojea, Montserrat, Bermejo, etc. 11.
