This is stated by Flury Lemberg and some Bendford and Marino’s informants without hesitation. The French reweaving is the last bastion of the theory of “invisible mending”. It is only possible in holes about 1cm, on thick fabrics, with threads extracted from the original fabric and clearly visible in the back. Cfr. Mr. Ehrlich, who was Benford and Marino’s main informant). Do you have any normal explanation to why a single inter weaving of threads had never been found on Shroud samples? Do you think that Vial, Testore and Flury Lemberg were absolute incompetents? Rogers’ vaniline test has never been contrasted in better conditions. A valuable method of dating has to be contrasted by different teams over decades to be sure. Cfr. Radiocarbon dating between 1960s to 1980s. I think that we have no reason to think that Testore, Vial and Flury Lemberg were incompetent, but we have some reasons to think that the vanillin test performed by Rogers is uncertain. It has not been appropriately contrasted, at least. I think that the AIM (“absolute invisible mending”) is a sindonist myth. AMI=UFO, I am sorry. Nevertheless, I have to consider the possibility that a UFO would land a day on my garden and that an expert will find some AMI in the main body of the Shroud. Science is open knowledge.

Different bands of the yarn may well have had different proportions of cotton as they would have been spun at different times and even in different workshops 2) The yarn was woven on a loom which had previously been used for weaving cotton and at the edges of the weave there were therefore traces of cotton fibres that were not found further into the cloth”.

There is not any official statement that says directly that the Shroud is a true relic neither that the radiocarbon dating is valid. The official statement of 1988 plays with a calculated ambiguity. It recognizes that the results of the radiocarbon dating are “compatible” (with what?) and that the scientific advisor that had peered the report of the labs confirms the 95% of certainty… but the report also adds that the origin of the image continues to remain a mystery that needs to be investigated.

I wrote: “We already knew that Raes’ samples were rejected by the radiocarbon team because they were not reliable.” Your answer: “Yes but the question is why? On what basis? Yes, I wrote that Gonella had some doubts. But why? I could not find any reason except that Raes did not keep his sample in safe and ” “… then he [Raes] held them for years on his desk where they were seen and handled by several people. (…)” or ” that a relative of Gilbert Raes had been overhead to say, “We all have pieces of the Shroud now” .(Gonella). This fact does not imply any kind of substitution”. There are other reasons to mistrust of some samples: bad conditions of storage or manipulation. This was the main reason to the radiocarbon dating, according to Riggi di Numana, Rapporto Sindone1978 87, Edizione 3 M, Milano, pp. 148 9. You: “Yes, but I have detailed “the hands”. And I have also explained that there is a very precise chain of custody”. No. You have detailed the “hands” according to a “confidential letter” of a sindonist.

The same suspicion you cast over the comments of Nitowski are valid to the “confidential letter” of D’Muhala. “How do you explain that ?” And you? You can see Lombatti’s article I quoted. I am not expert in chemist or microscopy. Neither in textile conservationism. Now then I add some personal remarks: I only know a thing: the appeal to an invisible mending is impossible because the invisible mending is an entelechy. If you give some explanation, it has to be coherent with the facts and you cannot invent inexistent entities. When we are speaking of doubts about the authenticity of an artefact every precaution must be taken. The radiocarbon team did the correct thing when rejecting Raes’ samples.
