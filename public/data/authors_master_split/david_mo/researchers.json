Gospels are written too late to have been written by some direct witness. Historical and geographical fails and inaccuracies suggest that the authors were not native of Palestine. “John” is the last of the four. Scholars date it about 100 a.C. It is usually considered the less historical of the gospels. But in some points it seems more exact that the other four gospels. As in the case of burial cloths, for example. The author of John speaks of othonia. This word is usually translated by “bandages” or “strips”. It is plural. This coincides with the archaeological data. The Jews buried the corpses wrapped with several pieces of cloth tied with strips, as in Akeldama example.

The evidence shows that the image came after the blood stains and I proceeded to logically demonstrate how this could be devastating to the position that holds forgery or artistry as the cause. Thank you. Your answer is clear. I think the bloodstains nature is not the main problem with them. My objection is maintained even if it was shown that the bloodstains are actually blood. The main question arises in other terms: Independently of their nature, are the bloodstains natural or painted? The subject was presented by “a leading forensic pathologist (Michael Baden, deputy chief medical examiner of New York for Suffolk County) [who] says(…) «Blood never oozes in nice neat rivulets, it gets clotted in the hair. The anatomic accuracy is more what Michelangelo would have done in a painting than what actually happens to a body».” (Cfr: Marvin M. Mueller, reply to William Meacham “The Authentication of the Turin Shroud: An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology”, http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm ). The reply came by hands of several sindonists. The referential work for all them is G. Lavoie. I shall comment his “Turin Shroud: a medical forensic study of its blood marks and image”, (http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Lavoie Web.pdf). Lavoie accept the starting point (namely, drops of blood can’t flow over the hair), but he found an ingenious answer: the bloodstains do not really flowed over the hair. The blood drops were done by contact with the cloth when it wrapped the body. Later the linen became plane and the body prints on it by another different way. It is necessary to superpose the two images for an accurate location of marks. So, the bloodstains don’t flow over the hair, but on the face. This reply is widely accepted by sindonists (Fanti et allia). Do you agree with Mr.Lavoie? Or have you another way to explain the anomalous blood trails over the hair?.","date":"2012-06-15","mins":"9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12518","author":"david_mo","post":"Menedemus : But E.Poulle does accept that the Turin Shroud was in Constantinople.

A lot of stupid things and fakes have been published (and they will do) in peer review magazines. Frequently, these things hadn’t been answered because no one has considered valuable to lose his time with them. Some prestigious scientists as Stephen Hawkins never publish in peer review. I think the peer review is not a great argument in favour of the truth of an assertion. I think the authority of Flury Lemberg is higher than Fanti, because she is a true textile expert. And in this case her opinion is also more valuable because she has done her study directly on the cloth. These are not definitive arguments, but they tip the balance in favour of Ghiberti und Frau Mechthild. Moreover, the vision of things is a subjective issue, no matter the “technical” means that are used in it.

It infringes several norms of peer review. A genuine peer review can’t be designed by the person under investigation. Furthermore, a proposal of ideological orientation is unthinkable. If Fanti wants his work to pass an authentic peer review he must present it in a specialized journal (not directed by some of his friends or similar) and submit it to the set of the usual conditions in this kind of publication: format, subject, size, bibliography, etc. This is the usual form to present a work to the scientific community who warrants its normal verification. This would be the first step. (But not the last, of course). But the Fanti’s proposal touches surrealism when he imposes some particular conditions that sound more like obstacles than proposals. The Vatican has asked long time ago that if somebody had got a sample from the Shroud he should return it to the rightful owner, i.e. The same Vatican. Nobody answered. And now, Professor Fanti declares he has a piece of the Shroud but it will not go out of his office. Is he trying an accord or making a declaration of war?

We have already spoken in this forum about the Zugibe’s refutation of Barbet’s claims. I copy here some remarks about the fantastic “respiratory gymnastics” that, according Barbet, the crucified man had to do for breathing. “Experiment One demonstrates that the position on the cross of our volunteers corresponds to the sagging position hypothesized by Barbet and that it is not physically possible to straighten from Barbet’s sagging position. This appears to be due to the fact that with both feet secured to the stipes or with one foot on top of the other and the knees bent , the range of motion limitation for straightening has been exceeded which precludes any type of straightening or pushing mechanism. It is also obvious that it would be virtually impossible to straighten the body from the sagging position since the arms of the crucarius were so far extended. This experiment also demonstrates that if volunteers who were in good physical condition were unable to push or pull up to straighten themselves no matter how hard they tried when the feet are secured to the stipes or with one foot on top of the other, how could an injured, exhausted person particularly one in severe pain and nailed through the hands and feet have the strength to straighten from a sagging position. This should completely repudiate the theory of straightening and sagging as proposed by Barbet. Therefore, it doesn’t matter how long the crucarius was on the cross and in what physical condition he was in, because it is not possible to straighten as proposed by Barbet and even if it were possible, there would be no reason to straighten because simply stated, there is no problem breathing in the sagging position (…) Another fact to mull over is that the average respiratory rate is 12 to 16 per minute and in the scenario proposed by Barbet, the crucarius would have had to straighten himself by pushing against the nails in excess of 360 times during the 6 hours on the cross even if he took only about one respiration per minute”. Frederick T. Zugibe: “EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES IN CRUCIFIXION: INTRODUCTION”, http://www.crucifixion shroud.com/experimental studies in crucifix.htm Conclusion: The subtle brushed of the median nerve imagined by Barbet is impossible in the very conditions imagined by him. Nothing “irrebatible”, Carlos. But, once again, I advertise that this debate can be interesting from the point of view of forensic medicine but it is absolutely irrelevant to the matter of the authenticity of the Shroud. The medieval painters used to represent the crossed hands with the thumbs hidden. Dan Porter was kind enough to put one of my comments with pictures in this forum. So, even if Barbet’s theories were correct, we cannot say if the hidden thumbs of the Shroud are a perfect copy of a human corpse or an artistic convention..","date":"2015-07-30","mins":"12:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-206994","author":"david_mo","post":"Carlos: Sorry, but you have not understand correctly Zugibe’s objections.

I only know his book that is a mixture of scientific experiences and religious exaltation. I suppose that Zugibe did not repeat the experiences of Barbet for some technical reasons and because he considered that he needn’t to do this: he affirms that the median nerve is not placed in the position that Barbet had supposed. “The missing thumb on the Shroud was due to injury to the median nerve by the passage of the nail. Barbet indicated that each time the nail was driven through Destot’s space, the median nerve was severed either halfway or two thirds of the way causing the thumb to be drawn into the palm. This of course is untenable because as we demonstrated above, the median nerve does not pass through Destot’s space but runs along the opposite side (thumb or radial side) of the wrist. Even if the median nerve was injured causing, mechanical stimulation as Barbet claimed, this would still not cause the thumb to be drawn into the palm of the hand. Dr. Ernest Lampe, one of world’s leading hand surgeons who in discussing injuries to the median nerve, relates in his book, Surgical Anatomy of the Hand, that in severance of the median nerve…… “THERE IS INABILITY TO FLEX THE THUMB, INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGERS”. This was confirmed to me by several hand reconstruction surgeons.” (PIERRE BARBET REVISITED, http://www.crucifixion shroud.com/Barbet.htm ) NOTE: “Technical reasons”: it is not easier to play the Frankenstein game in our times as in the Barbet’s times..","date":"2015-08-01","mins":"3:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-207379","author":"david_mo","post":"Sehnor Frias Moreira: “You’re free to believe whatever you want, despite all evidence, and against all evidence” Is there any evidence about an injure similar to that alleged by Barbet in contemporary medicine?
