It is more, I don’t know any “National Museum” in Madrid. I know two previous dating made by the well reputed labs of Toronto and Tucson. It would be useful to know where these scandalous results of the test were published. In the official webpage of the “Centro Español de Sindonología” nothing is said about the radiocarbon dating, that is a subtil way of lying. Antonio Alonso was the unique independent participant in the scientific enquiry about the Sudarium of Oviedo. He is member of the Instituto Nacional de Toxicología y Ciencias Forenses (National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences). He is contrary to the position of Barta and had said: «La única evidencia científica es la del Carbono 14 y dice que la reliquia es falsa».”(“The 14 carbon is the unique scientific evidence we have and it says the relic is false”.) “…no estamos dispuestos a mantener un bulo».(“ We are not willing to support a hoax”). I don’t know any radiocarbon dating made after 1988 with a failure of 700 or1300 years. This is possible when some contaminant circumstances are detected or when the test was made in previous years, when de radiocarbon test was beginning. This is not the case of the Shroud of Turin. When two (or are they three?) labs coincide in the dating of a piece archaeologists are clear: this is strong evidence and no hearsay or indirect hint can contradict it..","date":"2014-12-07","mins":"3:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/05/paper-chase-new-observations-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Paper Chase:  New observations on the Sudarium of Oviedo"},{"id":"comment-215527","author":"david_mo","post":"I do not understand the sympathy of some sindonists for the sudarium of Oviedo which only complicate things. For example: The possibility that three radiocarbon labs commit the same error is very unlikely (Ramsey). The possibility of an error with seven datings (3 Turin plus 4 Oviedo) makes the margin of error very, very unlikely.
