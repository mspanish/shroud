When it comes to the Shroud being a painting or not scientific evidences indeed point to it’s image not being a paintig as Dr. John Heller and Dr. Alan Adler concluded in several peer reviewd papers. The question of the presence of flower images on the Shroud is still a matter of controversy even between sindonologists but their true existence remains a strong possibility. If someone wants to get real scientific information about the Shroud one of the easiest ways to do it is searching the wonderful website of Dr. Barrie Schwortz http://www.shroud.com scientific articles and papers or «google» Ohio Shroud Conference, http://www.shroudstory.com http://www.sindonology.org and so on. Don’t forget the Shroud of Turin is the most studied relic in the history of mankind regards Maria da Glória Centro Português de Sindonologia.","date":"2012-02-02","mins":"1:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory"}]
