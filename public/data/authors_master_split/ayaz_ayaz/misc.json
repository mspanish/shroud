[{"id":"comment-911","author":"ayaz_ayaz","post":"Hello Maria da Gloria, I am very much pleased to hear about the Exhibition 2010 of Shroud of Turin. I am of the opinion that this is the genuine cloth in which Holy Jesus Was wrapped after removing from the Cross. The picture was formed by the Special Ointment rubbed on the body of the Jesus. This ointment is said to have some volatile components, which evaporated by the heat of the body and were absorbed or deposited on the cloth. This further indicated that The Holy Jesus was alive at that moment, otherwise cold body had not evaporated the ointment rubbed on his body. Only a hot body can do it. The appearance of negative image on the shroud is the scientific proof that he never died on the cross and Romans / jews failed to kill him. His prayer was accepted by the Father God and he was spared from disgraceful death. Please read the book ‘Jesus Papers’ which details life of Jesus after crucifaction. The Jesus lived about 120 years, as per some stories and died in Kashmir India. His Tomb has been discoverd in Sari Nagar Kashmir, India. Best Regards, Ayaz..","date":"2010-01-02","mins":"12:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/08/20/dates-for-2010-exhibition-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"2010","title":"Dates for 2010 Exhibition of the Shroud of Turin"}]
