So the results should have been within experimental error. The specimens should have been taken from near the burnt part of Shroud and from the area which was never repaired. These samples will certianly give totally different results. God is so forgiving.

The formulation of this ointment is also mentioned in some literature. This was made from some herbs. After application of this ointment, the body was wrapped in the cloth,(shroud of Turin). The body heat was enough to evaporate some valatile components of the ointment, these vapors got deposited on the fibres of the cloth and generated a negative image. This is a simple test that the same ointment be produced and applied to a human body. The body be wrapped in a similar cloth and kept wrapped for about three days. The cloth is to be aged under duplicate conditions and later examined for any negative image is produced or not.
