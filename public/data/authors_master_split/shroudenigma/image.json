Dan is right, it was Goliath who issued the challenge, but Dawkins has and continues to challenge every thinking deist. I have a hunch that, in the long term, the Shroud may well be the stone that topples him. With the momentum gathering for this challenge, we shall see. The timing of the conference in Valencia, attended by representatives from Turin, could not be better. Another very auspicious event has been the publication of Thomas de Wessellow’s new book, The Sign, which I am still working through. De Wesselow’s qualifications as an art historian are impeccable. His conviction that the Shroud cannot be mediaeval is forceful. (Not much of a surprise to sindonologists, of course, but impressive to the secular world). It would appear his tome rests on the Maillard reaction. As a foundation, quicksand is probably better.

This layer reacts with the ammonia based products associated with the process of putrefaction and discolors to produce an image. It is an interesting and indeed ingenious theoretical construct in many ways. One of its attractions is that it can be seen as an entirely natural process without recourse to more esoteric explanations. Indeed, from my own discussions with Ray Rogers, it is clear that he set out to find some kind of theory for image formation that was a natural process to counteract the claims for the “miraculous” that he felt had tarnished the reputation of STURP. He succeeded in finding a theory. However, as anyone who has any technical experience of creating images will quickly testify, the possibility that the process could account for an image of the size, complexity and, above all, homogeneity of the Shroud image is zero. I would gladly raise that numerical estimate if anyone, anywhere can cite a meaningful image of anything created by a Maillard reaction..","date":"2012-07-11","mins":"6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/11/rejecting-all-the-energetic-hypothesis-for-the-shroud-of-turin-image/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Rejecting all the “energetic” hypothesis for the Shroud of Turin image"},{"id":"comment-16979","author":"shroudenigma","post":"I hope someone will be forthcoming with a critique, additions, suggestions…indeed anything that will aid Denis Mannix in formulating a methodology to test the Maillard theory in principle.

My first job was to photograph 10″ steel plates that had been coated with the latest battleship grey and then subjected to the equivalent of 10 years at sea. My (5×5) plates had to capture every nuance and minute crack that may have been present. The development process required mechanical agitation to ensure that it matched the precision of the photography. Even then, it was difficult to ensure an even graduation over that small size. The Shroud confronts us with a 14ft cloth with an image (not a photograph, admittedly, at least not in any normal sense) that has an entirely even graduation over the entire length. When you consider this in the light of all its other attributes, and, bearing in mind, if it is authentic, then you might expect something “miraculous” or, at least, mystifying, any open minded person would, at least, give that possibility a fair hearing. You seem hell bent on ignoring the wood and only focussing on the trees. It’s the big picture, in every sense, that is key to understanding this mysterious cloth. Step back a bit.

The Resurrection accounts certainly speak of something outside our world of experience. They speak of something new, something unprecedented — a new dimension of reality that is revealed. What already exists is not called into question. Rather we are told that there is a further dimension, beyond what was previously known. Does that contradict science? Can there really only ever be what there has always been? Can there not be something unexpected, something unimaginable, something new? If there really is a God, is he not able to create a new dimension of human existence, a new dimension of reality altogether? Is not creation actually waiting for this last and highest ―evolutionary leap, for the union of the finite with the infinite, for the union of man and God, for the conquest of death? J. RATZINGER: Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance into Jerusalem to the Resurrection, Ignatius, San Francisco 2011, translated by Philip J. Whitmore from the original German Jesus von Nazareth: Zweiter Teil: Vom Einzug in Jerusalem bis zur Auferstehung, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Vatican City 2011, pp. 246 7. This opens the debate to the issue of the Resurrection, obviously, but so, too, to other possibilities. The speculations of Dr. Andrew Silverman and “New Physics” is a good example. Http://www.lightoftheshroud.com/Presentations.html Yannick, have you given any consideration to how Ray Rogers might have accounted for the homogeneity of the image? The theory might account for a few square inches. Perhaps even, say, the area of the face. But to assume that the impurity layer and the transfer mechanism was homogenous over 14ft x 4ft and (probably) acting over parallel planes is stretching credulity further than any alternative. You paint a picture of a scientist proceeding without any motivation other than to reach a conclusion based only on the available evidence. All scientists in my experience claim this. In practice, they, at best, can impose the strictest self discipline on themselves to minimize bias. Ray was “furious” (his word) that STURP was “hi jacked” and came to be dominated by Jackson’s (in his view “unscientific”) collapse theory. His avowed motivation was to produce an alternative “rational” explanation. He was fighting a highly charged “war” with a rival. Chemistry against physics, and science versus (his view) pseudo science. That is a very different reality..","date":"2013-09-04","mins":"7:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"id":"comment-7650","author":"shroudenigma","post":"Hello Colin You must not be too downhearted about a lack of comment. Now that Dan Porter has hung up his mouse there is no one to whistle up much of a controversy. The other thing to bear in mind is that, as far as 99.99% of the population is concerned, what you are attempting to prove they already believe. I.e. The Shroud is some kind of clever fake. And, frankly, while that remains the case they are not that interested in the details. What would get some attention is how you might explain how the medieval forger used something like invisible ink to create the image he did and bestow it with so many other features that give the semblance of authenticity. I have taken the liberty of setting out my description of them below: A letter of congratulation to the medieval forger who created The Shroud of Turin Your choice of an image left on a Shroud is a perfect encapsulation of the mystery that surrounds him. After all, it is the reporting of his death by crucifixion that is the principal independent corroboration that Jesus lived at all. Congratulations. Here lies a man that died in the most vile and cruel way yet devised by mankind. The awful details reveal it was what we now know to be a Roman crucifixion. This is uncanny because when you were commissioned you had no knowledge of these details. Congratulations. Your depiction makes real the one description we have of the man’s death in that it bears the minute forensic details that makes sense of what is written. Congratulations. You have echoed the bare facts we have about the man’s life by making it ethereal but perceptible enough for it to be recognised for what it is by crowds at a distance on a glaring hot day when thousands flock to see it held aloft in the open air. Congratulations. By restricting yourself to a monotone you have emphasised the singularity involved in the event of this man’s life and death. Indeed, the image is its own singularity as it has no comparison or equal. Congratulations. This tone, so sparsely applied, has, centuries after your work was completed, yielded to the new science of photography an image of even greater perceptibility just when the world had almost forgotten it. Congratulations. You have maintained such evenness of hand of the single tone along its entire length and breadth that stellar science has been able to translate your pains into a homogenous lifelike three dimensional representation of the man in death. Congratulations. Somehow, although making sense as a two dimensional depiction, you have applied the blood and arranged the position of the limbs to enable it to make sense when wrapped around a corpse even to the soles of the feet. Congratulations. By applying the blood first and leaving no image beneath you have confounded further anyone who might seek to imitate you. Congratulations. You have been faithful by depicting him unmistakably in the likeness as the Jew he was. Congratulations. Your canvas has been a linen cloth of dimensions used at the time and woven on a loom that worked under the laws that governed the man’s world. Congratulations. The cloth is nothing like the rough linen grave clothes discovered in the excavated tombs in the hills of Jerusalem. Its quality matches the esteem in which those who followed held the man it must have wrapped. Congratulations. Despite our preference you have been brave enough to leave him naked and kept him devoid of any artefact that would allow one group above another to claim him for themselves. Yet, you have kept his dignity and repose. Congratulations. Indeed you have excelled even this. This savagely tortured man in death is at peace with himself and with us. Indeed, he appears, somehow, to have transcended his fate and cheated death. Congratulations..","date":"2016-08-22","mins":"4:20 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/08/16/might-invisible-ink-technology-mere-childs-play-have-been-superbly-fine-tuned-to-achieve-whole-body-imaging/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Might invisible ink technology (mere child’s play) have been superbly fine-tuned to achieve whole body imaging?"},{"id":"comment-183480","author":"shroudenigma","post":"I was only addressing the issue of the creation of a negative image in medieval times.
