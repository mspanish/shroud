In referring to Ian Wilson’s theory, Dr. Williams was simply affirming that a case for one particular provenance can be made. I am sure he does not do so at the exclusion of others. They simply have not been made in any detail in his hearing and they are unlikely to be while the C14 shadow excludes illumination. He finds the general arguments for the Shroud persuasive and the C14 less than perfect in its application. Therefore, a potential injustice may have been done. That’s why he has come out on the subject the way he has. The question of the Shroud does not hang on Edessa. I personally find it persuasive but I am prepared to take into account the work of Max Frei. Having trekked round the Middle East and Anatolia with him on two trips totaling four weeks I got to know him well and give credence to his identification of Anatolian pollens. His methodology for removing such samples from the linen cloth was much too rough for STURP and that may explain why their own delicate application of the tape failed to pull out what would have been very deeply embedded. Debates as this are likely to remain the equivalent of “Angel Dancing” until the Vatican allows a properly structured re examination. That is what my own campaign of The Shroud Affair is hoping to bring about. Despite the endorsement of the man who puts the case for the re examination to the Vatican, Dr. Bruno Barberis in Turin, and now the former world wide head of the Anglican Church, less than .05% of what one might call “shroudies” can be bothered to raise at least a $10 finger of support.

It was also quite a shock to see how much more subtle the image is to the eye in natural light. The nature of any image reproduction process tends to accentuate the inherent contrast of the image. When copies of the Shroud are reproduced there is an even greater tendency to accentuate contrast to enable the viewer to perceive the image easily. All ordinary computer screens vary in their contrast so I cannot predict what may actually be seen on any individual screen but I have tried to recreate an image that can be downloaded here: http://we.tl/YG9i VX Hwy D that more faithfully shows the actual colours. The background cloth is almost ivory and the image, even for someone as used to seeing its photographs as I am, is barely perceptible and – close up – is almost impossible to decipher. However, as we well know, once “unlocked” by photography, so much more depth and contour becomes readily seen. My other main thought about the image in line with its “perfection” is its nakedness. As such it is devoid of any single thing that would betray an attribute that might identify the body with a specific culture or, indeed, faith. It is “Everyman”.","date":"2013-08-25","mins":"10:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-43463","author":"shroudenigma","post":"That may be.

My hope is that as I am primarily a producer, once armed with some independent financial backing, I can navigate through to a successful conclusion. I did it with The Silent Witness all the way to a worldwide theatrical release. It was made possible by some initial funding secured from the heir to the Millers beer empire and that was negotiated by the wonderful Salesian priest and Shroud scholar the late Fr. Peter Rinaldi of the Holy Shroud Guild of America. Some of the films profits seeded STURP. Approximately 8% of those who view the campaign video become contributors. The average contribution is: $91. On that basis I need to get just under 2,500 more to watch the video to reach the initial target. (Assuming they come from a sympathetic audience segment. Either active Christians or others interested in the Shroud for its own sake). I am about to move the debate into the Twittersphere. It’s not something I am fully up to speed with but theoretically it looks encouraging. My initial group of Shroud Affair followers (22) have well over 100,000 potentially sympathetic followers between them. If they retweet the message I send them only 2% need to respond. As I am recruiting followers daily these figures should improve. You can tell that, as a producer, I am fundamentally an optimist..","date":"2013-09-06","mins":"6:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"}]
