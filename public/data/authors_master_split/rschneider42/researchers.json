[{"id":"comment-162318","author":"rschneider42","post":"The French reweave theory is not “contamination” in the sense that John Jackson uses it, but “substitution” so his teetertotter diagram should show that possibility as a reduction in the 1st century material and a corresponding increase in the contemporary (likely 16th century) material. So the kinds of biases we could have are: 1) Contamination (i.e. Contemporary material added) 2) Substitution (i.e. Contemporary material swapped out for original material) 3) Selective enrichment (i.e. Mechanisms that increase C14 selectively) 4) Irradiation, or 5) Combinations of the above. All of these are in principle open to verification by testing. Bioplastic may be present as could contemporary material of other biological kinds that wasn’t subject to effective removal by the methods used by the labs. We know there are intrusives (i.e. Substitution material) is the form of cotton and evidence of dyes and manipulation in the area. There could be some enrichment due to various natural radiation if the shroud was stored in locations subject to prolonged low level neutron flux, or perhaps (more speculatively) a burst of neutrons could have accompanied the resurrection and skewed the whole cloth and the sudarium as one paper at the conference simulated. The matter is not at all simple nor “one answer fits all” but it is subject to verification. You can hardly ask for more..","date":"2014-10-14","mins":"8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/14/dj-vu-squared/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Déjà vu Squared"}]
