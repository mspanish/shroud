[{"id":"comment-192066","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Hello Louis. It’s at this point I too am lost. I think the major problem is the nomenclature used to explain blood,myrrh,iron oxide, blood and etc. Heres an excerpt from the HSG archive page. In Dr. Nitowski’s “Conservation report” she writes, “If two different fibers are woven together into a material, linen and cotton as in the Shroud, one may actually contribute to the destruction of the other – the cotton contains starch (as observed by Kohlbeck) that could interact with the dye of a cloth like red silk covering the Shroud during storage”. In another report, Dr. Kohlbeck asked Ray Rogers permission to remount the sticky tape slides in cargille oil. The oil is used for better resolution to increases the resolving power of the objective when photographing the sample slides. Dr. Kohlbeck set aside these slides for over three months and re examine them. To his astonishment he noticed that the once red particles have now turned black and exude a yellow color. “This certainly could not be iron oxide”, he tells Harold Nelson in a letter. He continues and writes, “Dr. Heller is no doubt right,”? ” I’m no blood expert but I know the particles are not iron oxide”. Dr. Mc Crone writes in “Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud” page 82 on Dec 26 1978, starting with 3 CB a heavy image area, blood from the lance wound using low magnification (10% +10% oli) I could see a heavy crustacean (of blood?) – too red”! Page 84 on Feb 2 1979 he writes, “I have spent a lot of time looking at the tapes especially the red particles. There are a lot of them and they are definitely inorganic. Hundreds of fiber are well coated with these deep red particles. They are the same particles Pellicori and Evans show in their low power photomicrographs they say this is blood I say it is an inorganic compound. In our archives I have more notes written by Dr. Mc Crone which was not published. ” Dr. Mc Crone writes on June 13th 1979, “Sample 3 AF (finger image) shows the largest percentage of colored fibre examined it closely the fibers are un uniform colored over lengths exceeding weave units hence the color is not a surface effect possible mechanism includes heat or liquid treatment. There are in this sample and others a number of yellow amorphous tubular flaked like a material resin. ( I thought in the part they could be aloes or etc).” The yellow amorphous tubular flaked like material resin was possibly also the same thing Dr. Nitowski saw and was convinced it was Myrrh and aloes just as Dr. Mc Crone first thought. Steven Schafersman is also correct when he states the madder root was first announced by Dr. Mc Crone. This is also confirmed by Paul Maloney, President of ASSIST at a Talk given at the “The Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi Faceted Enigma” conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14 17th 2008, when he states, “Walter Mc Crone had sent him in 1981 several Kodak transparencies of photos he took of Shroud linen fibers. “On those slides, (Guild also has them) Mc Crone had written the following note: madder rose, linen fiber, medium (blue) sample 3 CB” 4 and sample 3 AB. Mc Crone was referring to photomicrographs made on STURP sticky tape samples 3 CB and 3 AB which came from the blood flow across the back nearest the side strip side of the Shroud and directly adjacent to that flow on linen, itself. It was on that side where someone would have been working their repairs if the re weave theory is held to be correct. Mc Crone, of course, due to his belief that the Shroud was painted by an artist, was trying to prove that the Shroud had been in an artist’s studio.” Source: Maloney, Paul C. “What Went Wrong With the Shroud’s Radiocarbon Date? Setting itall in Context.” Talk given at the “Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi Faceted Enigma”conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14 17th 2008. Comments: Regarding the presence of madder rose on the cloth, Maloney says, “There is now a new way of looking at the presence of that madder rose. Although this is some distance from the “Raes Corner” such trace amounts can now be conjectured to explain the dye that was used, along with the aluminum mordant and the gum Arabic as a binder to create the wash to finish the re weave. Thus, it may now be seen not as a contaminant from an artist’s studio, but rather a contaminant from the weaver’s workshop.”.","date":"2015-02-28","mins":"10:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"id":"comment-192035","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Piero, I would like to inform you, yes I passed and received my degree. Thank you for asking. By the way the paper clearly states, and I quote, “The research observed two distinct populations. Both groups were asked to read two abridged versions of two manuscripts, and answer five questions on each of the subjects. The readings are factual, but not impartial. They were designed to lead participants to a controlled response. If the readers deviate from the expected controlled answers, an analysis would be performed to evaluate if confirmation bias was the cause”. The Serelini’s manuscript clearly showed that something triggered the participants to respond against the readings. Could the trigger be Monsanto?.","date":"2015-02-28","mins":"12:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"id":"comment-192036","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Louis that’s the underlying message pertaining to my paper. Life’s inference, culture, religion, shapes your believes and you will only extract from life lessons what supports your existing believes. For me it’s a “DIS” not to return the threads back upon Giovanni Saldarini request. And besides, any testing of these threads would be disowned and not recognized by the authority Personally, regardless of scientific demands, If the Turin authority decided to use three labs instead of seven, it’s their choose. To Italians, the Shroud belongs to them as well as Catholics and preservation was their top priority. Many well intended scientists wrote to Cardinal Ballestrero, advising him against the change of the protocol. This too was considered a “DIS” amongst the the Turin authority and to the Guild who was the instrument to access to these studies. To put it bluntly, they felt, it was none of their business once the final decision was made. Regardless of the “new world enmeshment process”, I’m not so sure it’s intrinsic to man’s ability..","date":"2015-02-28","mins":"1:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"id":"comment-192033","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Maybe the first sentence will be helpful for you. But again, this is my opinion formed by the much correspondence material I have in my possession from the Guild; resulting to confirmation bias. (LOL) (from the HSG archives) It was during the Albuquerque meeting in 1989, Alan Adler received the cuttings from Prof.Gonella. Based on Thiebault’s evidence, I believe his presentation accurately demonstrates where the threads were extracted. Adler, observed that not only part of this area was from the re weaving but the samples also contained “starch” that the three labs failed to notice. However, Adler failed to produce a desire C14 result in an unauthorized testing (verbally communicated). (from the HSG archives) According to documents from the Guild, the Mc Crone’s Germany C14 testing was from the Oviedo cloth. However, it was eventually agreed upon that in fact it was from the Raes sampling. (from the HSG archives) According to one individual, he insisted that only half of Raes samples were returned to the Centro. (from the HSG archives) A previous post I uploaded on this thread shows a letter from Prof Raes to Fr. Kim. Prof. Raes’ goal was to correct any misinterpretation of his 1974 report. I believe he did publish an article in the Spectrum in 1991 to do just that..","date":"2015-02-28","mins":"12:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"id":"comment-192032","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Joe, I’m impressed.

I guess the best answer I can give you comes from this sentence from the readings, “In 2000, Rogers received reports from a long time Sindonologist researchers, Joe Marino and Sue Bedford. They hypothesized that the radiocarbon dating were not from threads excised from the main body of the Shroud, but rather from a location contaminated with dye cotton used in the restoration of the Shroud”. I also have to point out there will be limitations to the data collected based on language barriers, and load questions that the controlled group who approved the wording may have overlooked. You are correct about double entries however, when I tally the responses I am able to sort duplicate IP address and eliminate any duplication. Of course that has to be mentioned in the limitation section of the research since the duplicate responses may have come from 2 members or more from the same household, or the second response had different answers to the questions. As far ar the 1977, Albuquerque procedures I know I do have that in archives. If I have already scanned them I can certainly upload them on the HSG site where you can retrieve it. However, if it is not scanned, you’ll have to give me time (March) before I will have time.
