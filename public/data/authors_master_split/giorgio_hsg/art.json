That’s it. (I’m discussing only the markings pointed out by Filas). I’m sorry if I sound like Dr. Mc Crone and relying on my heuristic inference in film, but after 42 years in the industry and still counting, I’m confident in my statement..","date":"2015-06-20","mins":"9:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/20/the-eyes-have-it/","cat":"pareidolia","title":"The Eyes Have It?"},{"id":"comment-202973","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Research showed that Fr. Filas read a report from Jumper, Stevenson, and Jackson titled, “Image of coins on a burial cloth?” Using the VP 8 image analyzer the report states, “revealed objects resting on the eyes, objects which resembled small disks or buttons”. They further investigated the customary of jewish burial customs and were told that it was customary to place objects over the eyes of the dead. The report also stated, “With the photographic work, we hope to obtain very fine quality pictures which, among other things, can be used to take much of the noise out of the image, noise present, for example, from the weave pattern of the cloth”. Based on this report, Father Filas used it as a resource and conducted his own experiment after he believed that he too saw an object from an Enrie copy given to him by the Holy Shroud Guild. Andy I recommend you start with Haralick’s “Analysis of digital images of the Shroud of Turin”. The Spatial Data Analysis Laboratory was given an 8×10 copy negative produced at Gamma labs. And 5×7 prints from a 20×24 print that was manufactured from the 8×10 copy negative. Figure 8, from “Analysis of digital images of the Shroud of Turin”, shows a severally reduced gamut from the original fiber base print. At this point there is no longer a relation from the original photograph to this copy. Any further investigation now needs to evaluate the differentials of the characteristics of the original image to the copies; which would include, film curve characteristics, processing characteristics, lens and film dynamic range, optical resolution, film fog from bellows extension, reciprocity and so on. All of these effects were overlooked which, makes the Haralicks report, virtually useless. As we say in the industry, GIGO.","date":"2015-06-20","mins":"4:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/20/the-eyes-have-it/","cat":"pareidolia","title":"The Eyes Have It?"},{"id":"comment-202997","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"I am providing a link of 4 images inside one document of the section of the eye where the lepton coin is present.
