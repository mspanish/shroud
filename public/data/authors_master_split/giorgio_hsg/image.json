[{"id":"comment-211726","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Hello Thibault. I think it is very important to discuss halftone when using Ernie’s positive image. The reversal film clearly distinguishes the Shroud’s image by dot amplitude modulation rather than screen builds. Ernie’s original negative which yields a positive print one can distinguish the screen values that are not present in the positive negative image that OK is using. If you observe Durante’s image, the photo’s resolving power alone is not detailed enough to present amplitude modulation but instead it resembles stochastic screening with trapping (overlays of color) to create the photo image. This is why it’s difficult to produce a 3 D effect with Image J. “how can we scientifically define a 2 D image having intrinsic 3 D properties (“encoded” 3 D data)? I can only answer your question as an enduser. By converting correlating screen values (distant to cloth as an example) to dots amplitude modulation and with displacement mapping you will achieve 3 D rendering. Simple techniques can be see on youtube using “After Effects” and other rendering programs. The question I have is how the amplitude modulation dots are abundantly centered on the linen without falloff giving the illusion of lensing which is why we have dots in the first place..","date":"2015-10-03","mins":"4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"id":"comment-211794","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Hello Hugh, Here is my observation, The original negatives were made from glass plates 40×50 cm; roughly, 15.75 x 19.7 inches. The plates were a very fine grain orthochromatic film designed for copywork due to it’s exceptional resolving power, high contrast, linear characteristics, visual development inspection and good dynamic range. The second generation negative was made from duplicating the glass plate. I do not know what type of film was used but visually the film was probably the same orthochromatic type used for his original photograph. Using the same type of film to create the negative image to produce a positive print greatly reduced the dynamic range giving the second generation print a “litho look”. “This image (UPLOADED) was created from the Enrie’s full size enlargement made from the duplicate negative from the original glass plate. I applied noise filter only on the extreme shadows which ranged from 90% to 100% K reading”. As you can see the image does resemble AM modulation varying in frequency sizes. If you zoom in and out you can see how the different frequency size effects the image. Again, this uploaded image is not from a offset publication scanned, but from the actual Enrie collection of BXW fiber base prints.

I know it has been around for many years dating back to 1979 when Fr. Filas used the half tone idea as an artifact (noise) that has to be removed in order to see the Lepton coin. What I found interesting in both first generation prints (Pos & Neg) from the Enrie’s collection is how the “image” falls off in density abruptly following the uniformity of the herringbone weave. Without the herringbone weave as a substrate, the image would not appear like it is lensing (Based on the photos), which is why the dot patterns appear. This tells me that 3 to 1 herringbone bone weave is very important for the image formation and if any other substrate (smoother in texture) was used, a more continuos tone would have appeared, diminishing the details we see on the Shroud. I do have in my possession some 35 mm slides of Mark’s close ups that were released to the Guild. Observing them, some densities follow the regression pattern (abrupt fall off in density based on the herringbone weave) seen on the Enrie’s image and some do not. But the problem I have is I don’t have an idea what the markings are. If they are the water stains, I would not expect them to have the same regression as the image formation. And if this is the case, it is possible a substrate (receptor) was added over the shroud to help in the formation. The substrate concentrated on the highest ridges of the weave producing the lensing effect during the image formation. To answer Charle’s question, Orthochromatic is not relevant to produce the 3d. According to a few color experts I associate with at work, they all agree that the 3d effect has to do with the lensing like appearance of Enrie’s prints..","date":"2015-10-05","mins":"5:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"id":"comment-211822","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"I forgot to add that I might have came up with different observation if I only use Mark Evans images and never saw the Enrie’s.

Photographic unsharp masking “Simplified principle of unsharp masking The technique was first used in Germany during the 1930s as a way of increasing the acutance, or apparent resolution, of photographic images.[citation needed] For the photographic process, a large format glass plate negative is contact copied onto a low contrast film or plate to create a positive image. However, the positive copy is made with the copy material in contact with the back of the original, rather than emulsion to emulsion, so it is blurred. After processing this blurred positive is replaced in contact with the back of the original negative. When light is passed through both negative and in register positive (in an enlarger for example), the positive partially cancels some of the information in the negative. Because the positive has been blurred intentionally, only the low frequency (blurred) information is cancelled. In addition, the mask effectively reduces the dynamic range of the original negative. Thus, if the resulting enlarged image is recorded on contrasty photographic paper, the partial cancellation emphasizes the high spatial frequency (fine detail) information in the original, without loss of highlight or shadow detail. The resulting print appears more acute than one made without the unsharp mask: its acutance is increased”. I define this definition above, “apparent sharpness”. Offset prints have a high degree of acutance. I’m assuming the cover that OK used was printed at either 133 dpi or 175. That means there are either 175 or 133 halftone dots in a line per inch. By definition, an offset print at 133 or 175 dpi is far from high resolution. But in his defense, I believe OK is correct to state that the Shroud acts as a half tone. The results of the half tones do increase the image formation contrast and acutance. If the image mechanism produced a continuous tone, most of the body’s details would be lost..","date":"2015-10-06","mins":"10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"id":"comment-211972","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Hello Hugh, I think I am getting what your saying about the image bearing fiber. You state ” Finally, regardless of any of the photos or reproduction styles used, the half tone hypothesis says that no image bearing fibre on the Shroud image is lighter or darker than any other image bearing fibre. This is demonstrably untrue, just by looking at them in Mark Evans’ micrographs”. I think I understand what you mean. However, I am considering the absent of image fiber in conjunction with the image fiber as the total summation that makes up the image that gives the appearance of halftones (AM). By the time you scan an image or reproduce an image it will be impossible to maintain the purity of the original dynamic range that will result too a gain in contrast and a loss in the tonal range. This is why the AM (halftone) appearance occurs..","date":"2015-10-07","mins":"12:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"id":"comment-211964","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Hello OK My response “Offset prints have a high degree of acutance.

By definition, an offset print at 133 or 175 dpi is far from high resolution” Your response, “I think it is a little bit higher. But this is largely irrelevant. As the average Shroud thread diameter is about 0.3 mm or 0.01 inch, the max practical resolution of the Shroud image is about 100 dpi. And if photographs can reach further, this doesn’t matter actually”. It does matter. Lets use your histogram as an example. I would expect a major difference in dynamic ranges when one compares offset reproduction vs continuos tone images. As you recall, fingerprinting has to be done since my image came from a second generation negative scanned from a fiber base print. The second generation negative has lost it’s dynamic range compared to the original negative which I do have also a 1gig scan of. Your image came from a half tone printed book that inherently has much less resolution and dynamic range to any normal photographic process including the second generation print I used. Any comparisons between the two files can’t be done without a standard. Wouldn’t you agree the target has to be the Actual Shroud and if so any reproduction becomes only a representation that simulates correlations but in reality have no relations whats so ever with each other? So at the end of the day, we’re comparing reproductions that have no real relation with the Shroud. You may be saying that, and the problem is our heuristics in our interpretation is what’s causing the confusion. As for your halftone hypothesis, I never doubted that. The halftones (AM) from the reproduction is what gives the unique lack of dynamic range causing a lensing effect. I do see lensing effects on many areas of Mark Evans images but the wider dynamic range from his photos makes it harder to distinguish and the water stains will undoubtedly not have any correlation with the actual image making it harder to evaluate.

I would like the viewer first read this quick explanation how we perceive images compared to still images. Http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/cameras vs human eye.htm Now allow me to explain visually by this uploaded file, why I conclude that there is AM modulation on the image formation. I come to this conclusion based on heuristic experience of over 40 years in film and digital industry and still at it. One might think that can be an advantage but in fact that may be my downfall. I am entering this discussion with a preconceived notion why AM modulation exist based on years of experience with film and scan characteristics. However, I can be totally off base because there may be no relationship comparing my work and studies with this hypothesis. If you observe my reconstruction simulation .png file which is not at all scientific, only being used to visually explain the hypothesis of AM modulation in the image. Important to note, I used filters and curves to achieve the results of the background images of Dr. Mc Crone so I can simulate dynamic range and resolving power. The image is divided in three panels. The first shows a Dr. Mc Crone macro photograph of the Shroud. The image shows blood on the left side and image formation on the right side. The background simulates the same image photographed (stepped and repeated) at a further distance that would result in a major reduction in resolving power and dynamic range (that is why in my IMHO, any observation must include these factors). The background image is converted to black and white to achieve the lose of dynamic range more easily. The center panel is the same as the left panel only inverted. The Right panel illustrates the mask in halftone, and a scanned positive fiber base print of the Enrie glass plate negative of the nose bridge. If you notice, the Enrie’s image seems softer than the mask image, but I can assure you, the Enrie’s resolution is far greater than the mask. Also very important to note is that the most predominate feature in the AM modulation is not the image but the shadow of the over lapping 3 to 1 threads that combines with the image if the characteristics are correct. So I conclude, based on my own preconceived notion, that the dot by dot body to cloth correlation is flawed, since the cloth is convex and concave..","date":"2015-10-09","mins":"8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"id":"comment-212169","author":"giorgio_hsg","post":"Fair enough. We both agree there is no target. So my questions are, is your look up table depended on the degree of blur the operator applies? Wouldn’t you expect different calibrations from a photograph shot on a 40×60 cm film at 8.17 meter from the target than a 35 mm macro film at a few inches from the target? Did you apply a formula for this calculation in your look up table? Another confusing element is your certainty that it is bleaching that has caused the banding. How do you explain that the banding appears when the stitches alternate. Are you saying that every time the threads alternate in different directions the threads are from a different lots, or they have been naturally bleached many years later because of the diverging symmetrical angles?
