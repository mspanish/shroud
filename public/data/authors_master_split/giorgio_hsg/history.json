The Guild has a massive historical archives from a gentleman named Donnelly who has sited an enormous amount of books that I have yet tally, and he is convinced that the weave is of the 13th century based on his research. I have noticed you have been a recipient of some of his letters. Can you tell us briefly his hypothesis in this matter? I hate to read thousands of pages pf his archives that contains no pictures– especially the back inside cover spread that folds in thirds. You remember, Mad Magazine!
