That’s what faith is all about. You believe something even in the face of impossible evidence, like when they said the Carbon 14 testing was conclusive. In spite of even that, I believed the cloth was the burial cloth of Jesus. Then when they said the Carbon 14 testing was flawed, I smiled because I knew I had been right. However, in order to prove the cloth is without a doubt, truly that of Jesus, we would have to take blood samples from the shroud and do DNA testing on it. That being said, if we do get the DNA, we have nothing to compare it to. We don’tr have samples of Christ’s blood. As a Catholic, I believe, without a doubt, that the Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus the Christ. Would I be willing to die for this belief? Emphatically YES!!! That’s what faith is. Stephen should realize the Church is protecting itself because people are too willing to condemn our faith in a relic. The Church knows we have nothing to compare it to. We as Catholics believe, we don’t need hard evidence, that’s what science wants because scientists will not believe unless they can see and feel the burning bush. Again, we do not need that evidence and we believe..","date":"2013-10-07","mins":"6:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/07/what-did-stephen-jones-just-say/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What did Stephen Jones just say?"}]
