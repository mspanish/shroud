[{"id":"comment-6890","author":"bob_smith","post":"If you had actually read the bible and understood it in the jackfruit of those days you wouldn’t be making such an incredibly ignorant claim. What the bible is referring to is the sweat cloth that was wrapped around Our lords head when he was still on the cross, and this is why Peter saw the sweat cloth by itself away from the shroud. By the way that separate head cloth is called the sudarium of Oviedo and it is in a church in Spain. The blood stains match perfectly with the blood stains on the head image of the shroud, and the pollen found on both the sudarium and the head image of the shroud and both come from a thorny bush that is only found in the Jerusalem area. I would expect this kind of ignorance from an atheist but not from a fellow Christian. Please study the peer reviewed articles fro The top scientists on the sterp team and also the great ancient Hebrew burial information given from Debbie Jackson , the wife of NASA scientist John Jackson, who converted to Christianity from Judaism because of the shroud and sudarium. God bless.","date":"2012-01-13","mins":"3:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/29/political-pistachio-some-scientists-claim-shroud-of-turin-is-authentic/","cat":"books","title":"Political Pistachio: Some Scientists Claim Shroud of Turin is Authentic"}]
