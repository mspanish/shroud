[{"id":"comment-6956","author":"bob_smith","post":"Sorry, but Philip mathias is another example of why owners of newspapers shouldn’t give the right to any ignoramus to write articles. He like most skeptics of the shroud keep bringing up the old and tired argument of the bible itself proving the shroud isn’t authentic. How many times must I keep swing sudariummmmmm of oviedoooooo. The bible itself shows the authentic of the shroud because that separate head cloth is the sudarium that’s in a church in Spain. Forensic pathology experts like max frie and others proved the shroud and the sudarium both touched the same body at close intervals of time. The blood stains on the shroud matched perfectly with the blood stains on the sudarium. The one difference being that the blood stains on the shroud are from when the man was dead and the blood stains from the sudarium are from a man that was very wounded but still alive, and forensic experts also found out that the shroud was wrapped probably 45 minutes after the sudarium was taken off. The pollen found on the sudarium and the head image of the shroud match perfectly and come from a specific species of thorny bush only found in Jerusalem and judea area. I have been studying the shroud and sudarium intensly for over 2 years. After all of this study, how can this not be the burial shroud of Christ. I can go on and on about the vanillin tests, but the fact that mathias brought up Walter mccrone shows me that either mathias hasn’t d One any credible research on the shroud or he is biased against it..","date":"2012-01-14","mins":"4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/03/opinion-reliability-of-shroud-of-turin-fails-on-faith-not-science/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Opinion: Reliability of Shroud of Turin fails on faith, not science"},{"id":"comment-3713","author":"bob_smith","post":"Pekka, you have posted this nonsense all over the net and in several forums, and I can understand how most christians, if they read your post and the article would think that your actually telling the truth, but this nonsense has been disproven many times, and now I will disprove this info here. Http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Fulbright Akeldama Web.pdf There are many other examples but i couldnt copy and paste from the pdf file. This provides the truth on the evidence of your false accusations my friend. This article totally destroys your claims on all grounds. The fact that your even posting info from Gibson shows me that you have done little to no research on the shroud or this particular area at all. The claim by Gibson that akadelma tombs site in jerusalem disprove the authenticity of the shroud is completely refuted on the basis of ancient textile evidence from the judean desert and elsewhere. Pietro Savio published a cloth woven in a herringbone pattern dated to 130 C.E. Discovered in the excavations of the necropolis at Antinoe. Plus there pre dynasty burials described by Petrie and Mackay involving large textiles with the characteristic selvedge fringe. In one example a long cloth lay below the body and was folded over it in the same manner as the shroud of turin. Twill weave textiles of shroud fragments and nearly intact shrouds have been found at various excavation sites in the judean desert and all around in egypt to europe from even before the era of Jesus that have shown this type of weave..","date":"2011-08-28","mins":"4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/18/shroud-of-turin-presentation-coming-to-fayettes-summit-church-near-atlanta/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Shroud of Turin presentation coming to Fayette’s Summit Church Near Atlanta"}]
