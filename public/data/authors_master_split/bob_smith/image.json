He knows that if he could replicate it there would be a zillion atheist organizations that would fund him yet he won’t do it. If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck it is a duck. This is the lamest excuse not to do it.in other words alot of hot air.","date":"2012-02-25","mins":"8:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8693","author":"bob_smith","post":"Let’s also not forget the unique xray qualities on the hand, mouth and parts of the skull.

The fact that not even organizations he’ll bent on disproving the shroud are even giving your theory merit says it all, believe me if it did they would be knocking down your door with no need for u to try to sell it to them. It’s convenient that you didn’t even answer my question on the xray aspects of the shroud. That alone debunks your theory even if your theory is true (which I don’t believe because you refuse to put your money where your mouth by reproducing it for us, oh I forgot, you don’t feel like doing that). So now we have a theory which you refuse to put into action, and which even the staunchest skeptics of the shroud won’t even bother with? Colin what’s wrong with this picture? Oh yea I forgot, they are all wrong and you are right? Is this what you would call good science Colin?.","date":"2012-02-25","mins":"8:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8695","author":"bob_smith","post":"Another thing that debunks this is the sudarium of Oviedo. The Hungarian pray codex pushes the shroud back to the late 1000’s but the fact that forensic experts determined that the sudarium and shroud both covered the same body makes your theory even more rediculous. The sudarium’s history is indisputable going all the way back to the late 500’s. Your theory starts to look even less plausible then it allready is. It’s rediculous that skeptics who have been trying to debunk the shroud for years don’t understand yet that what makes the shroud unique is all of it’s amazing aspects put together..","date":"2012-02-25","mins":"9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8727","author":"bob_smith","post":"Again, Colin has failed to answer my question on the soft xray aspects of the shroud image. Is it because it blows his theory right out of the water? Again, Colin failed to answer the question of the indisputable forensic evidence of the connection between the shroud and sudarium the pushes the shroud date to theate 500’s. Again Colin failed to answer the question of the vanillin test of the shroud which convinced ray Rogers that this could very well be the shroud that wrapped the body of Christ. Colin the only thing I agree with you on is that if a theory is rediculous that it will died out. I’d say that this theory is ready to be relegated to the dust bin alongside the Davinci and Walter Mccrone’s paint theory. So what will your next theory be on the shroud image ? :).","date":"2012-02-25","mins":"4:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8698","author":"bob_smith","post":"Ron thank you for pointing out the lack of 3d detail in the coins. Let’s also throw in the vanillin tests as a final blow to this pseudo scientific theory of colins. The fact that it tested negative for vanillin showed ray Rodgers that the shroud was much much older than the now invalidated c 14 dating test. In fact the vanillin tests match up to much older date (ray rogers stated between 1300 and 3000 years old and stated that this could actually be the burial shroud that wrapped around Jesus. This matches up well with the dead sea scrolls that also came back negative on the vanillin tests. I know Colin, maybe little green men from mars with advanced technology did it..","date":"2012-02-25","mins":"9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8745","author":"bob_smith","post":"Colin again professor emeritus whanger stated that those aspects seem to be caused by long X rays. Please forgive me if I take his word for it since he is an expert in his field and has seen many xray photos over yours since you are not an expert in this field at all and just making baseless conjectures with no evidence to back it up. I know maybe you can submit your assertion for peer review. Do you have even one research paper or theory on the shroud submitted for peer review ? As a large photo of the shroud was brought to Ohio university many dentists recognized this aspect instantly , especially looking at the sinuses, teeth and gum. The fantastic part of this is that when they talked about how they made X rays of the inside of the mouth they had to place the object inside the mouth and have the X rays go from inside out. This right here gives a compelling reason to think that the source of xray emission had to have come from the inside of the body coming out, in the same way a dentist takes an xray of a persons mouth. I don’t get the remark about recycling old bed sheets , but then again if denying the work of experts that all have peer review work done on the shroud and you don’t even have one peer reviewed work done and you can’t even put your theory to the test what does it say about your theory. Remember the shadow shroud theory? He claimed it was how the shroud was done, but he like you couldn’t pass the muster when it came to putting the theory to work in the real world. I’m not putting you down buddy, I’m putting this theory down because it’s just filled with anecdotal wishful thinking and nothing solid. If it was you would have millions of dollars of funding from atheist organizations alone. You the saying “put up or” well you know the rest. By the way the retractable thumbs were also talked about by medical and forensic experts who are known in their field and all agree with the findings as to why the thumbs retracted and this knowledge could not have been known by anyone back then much less to have the nail mark through the wrist instead of the hand. You still haven’t answered my question about the vanillin tests and the indisputable connection between the shroud and thevsudarium of Oviedo taking the shroud back to a minimum 500’s and possibly to the time of Christ..","date":"2012-02-26","mins":"12:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8766","author":"bob_smith","post":"Colin again the experts have examined the shroud and haven’t found any problems with the anatomical figure, and since you don’t have any peer reviewed literature on the shroud please excuse me if I take the side of peer reviewed science over an amateur that is pretending to be an expert who won’t even put his money where his mouth is and demonstrate a working model live. Now allow me to correct myself when I claimed the hands and skull show xray qualities because it is much more then just the hands and skull in fact if you go through some of the peer reviewed work such as Gus accetti MD, and John jackson of NASA here. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/accett2.pdf Accetti was brave enough to swallow radioactive material to show this aspect of the shroud. He and Jackson show that the human radiation model is very compelling in showing how this particular aspect of the image could have come about. It’s funny Colin that all you have been presenting are theories and conjecture and no peer reviewed literature while the shroud experts have the peer reviewed literature to back them up. Your theories seem to parallel the theories of shroud skeptics like Walter Mccrone, and Joe nickel in that they (like you) refuse to submit your work for peer review. At least mccrone started submitting his work for peer review, but took them off when he didn’t like what the peer review board was saying. Colin it’s easy to prove me, e ergo e else here and the peer review passed work of the experts. Just recreate that image based on you highly imagined theory. To me a scientist that’s so interested in proving a fraud yet won’t put his money where is mouth proves that he doesn’t really believe the malarkey that he is saying..","date":"2012-02-26","mins":"9:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"}]
