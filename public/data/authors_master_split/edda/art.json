[{"id":"comment-6643","author":"edda","post":"Something for the atheists to ponder: If you were to die tomorrow, are you sure about the end of your story? Is that the end? Are we just born to die? Why bother living then? What is the point? You have only two choices. You either accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, or you don’t! Those are the only two options. Non negotiable! You can only sit on the fence for so long! You may die and there is nothing after death. You just turn to dust. Accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior wont change anything! You have nothing to lose. However…. When you die and you are standing before the King of King’s without accepting Him…. You lose EVERYTHING!!! I KNOW the end of my story!.","date":"2012-01-07","mins":"11:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
