[{"author":"gabirol","post":"Thank you for your support to Ian Wilson. I fully agree with you.I am finishing his new book and, in my opinion, it’s a very interesting, honest and well balanced book (although his English is a bit difficult to me).Also in Spain most media never deal with shroud matters seriously (and many times making jokes). At the bottom, they don’t want to recognize the authenticity of the shroud because, if they do it, they would also have to recognize the resurrection of Jesus.Thanks again..","date":"2010-04-22","mins":"1:42 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2010/04/ian-wilsons-turin-shroud-theories-are.html","title":"\n`Ian Wilson's Turin Shroud theories are the worst kind of junk history'\n"}]
