If the Discovery Channel is using his weird theory they are falling into the trap the History Channel has gotten into like UF Os and crop circles..","date":"2009-02-21","mins":"8:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die"}]
