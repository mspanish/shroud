As for the medical experts, they all disagree with each other to some extent, and surely cannot be treated as Gospel. Fred Zugibe, for example, wrote an entire paper entitled “The man of the shroud was washed.” I don’t want to get into a “My medical expert is better than your medical expert” squabble, but, as I say, they do disagree, sometimes profoundly.

When they reached the cross some time later, they pulled this cloth off his body. Pulling this cloth off the body would have undoubtedly opened up many of the wounds again. Maybe not all, but many. ” Re opened” wounds tend to take forever to close up again or to stop oozing, in my experience, and is a simple answer to all the blood or exudate of blood found from the scourge wounds. Like David Goulet mentioned above, I like the idea of God sending rain to cleanse the body of Christ, but, it would not explain the absence of dirt on the body by the time they had reached the tomb! If we take the studies on the Sudarium somewhat, and scriptures into account, and maybe a little common sense, Jesus hung on the cross for some time ‘after death’ and before taken down. He was then laid on the ground for a period of time, (possibly in the removal of the nails and/or from the cross). They did not have cobblestone or tiled ground, it was dirty/sandy or possibly muddy ground! He would have been covered in a excessive amount of dirt with no doubt. Enough dirt to cover most, if not all the body. Hence I still believe a ‘PARTIAL’ washing is evident. Washing does not necessarily mean scrubbing/ wiping, washing would have been a delicate procedure of ‘dabbing’ with a wet sponge or other cloth, which would be essential if trying to avoid lifeblood in the procedure. This could account somewhat for the dampness which existed within, once the body was enshrouded, especially since time was of the essence and the body would not have had time to dry. R sounds reasonable.","date":"2013-07-17","mins":"6:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"id":"comment-39045","author":"jesterof","post":"Hugh Farey : Hi Jesterof. No I’m not a physician, but I am a biology graduate, so perhaps gave that impression. The point about my nosebleed remark was not that any of the marks were made by a nosebleed, but that if any of the blood was added by a forger for verisimilitude, he would not need any technical knowledge, just a sponge. Jones’s claim, which attempts to refute the possibility of a Medieval artist on the grounds of lack of microscopical or ultra violet knowledge, doesn’t make sense. Regarding your point about the difference between blood from a dead body and a live one, the picture is extremely complex, and the shroud is not clear enough for an apples/oranges distinction to be made. As I mentioned, it is possible that the body was washed clean shortly before being laid on the shroud, and that the scourge marks on the back are the result of wounds reopening, or simply seeping. These might be characterised by a lack of red blood cells and an excess of plasma (as you might find by removing a dressing from an open wound before it heals). On the other hand, a forger with a bowl of blood (maybe from a patient who had recently undergone bloodletting) would find he too would have to use it quickly before it too became more plasma than red cells. My own experiments indicate that blood is not at all an easy medium to paint with… I agree totally that it looks like the body was washed before laid in the shroud. On the point about whole blood vs all other bloody material – those are apples and oranges. Whole blood can come and stain only from ALIVE person. A dead body would not sip whole blood ( even if that looks like one)of the same structure as in a live person. The reason I am repeatedly pointing this is that people who are not used to blood and it’s functions tend to project their own experience with bleeding( usually the whole blood) onto the character of staining on the Shroud.and this is not only apples and oranges but apples and beef : ).","date":"2013-07-15","mins":"9:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"id":"comment-32074","author":"jesterof","post":"Juliet Faith : To Max Patrick Hamon…very interesting comments…have you ever seen a picture of the Cameley Head?
