In any instance, the Resurrection occurred at ~ 3 am in the morning, which makes it exactly 36 hours after death – by any means it is absolutely within the necessary time frame to still have very rigid body.

Was his body FIRST in NON rigor mortis laid flat on the stone bench in the burial chamber and THEN, most miraculouly, has rigor mortis developed so much so as to restaure his position on the cross to the sole exception of his arms crossed over the pelvic region? Just guess? I was not there to say how was it wrapped. Rigor mortis develops very fast at some conditions – when there is a lot of lactate accumulated in muscles before death ( which is the case here) so the body taken from the cross could already been in the rigor mortis state ( not full, probably). Since the image and the stains on the Shroud point to the position as above statue is depicted, it is difficult to expect the body was flattened if the image does not depict the flattened body. On the practical standpoint it is very difficult to flatten fully rigored body. So what is your take – why there is a discrepancy between what one would expect for the burial ( flattened body) and the image on the Shroud which is not the flat body?.","date":"2013-08-30","mins":"4:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42418","author":"jesterof","post":"Max Patrick Hamon : Doc, Is it a most extraordinary case of ‘inverted resurrection/return to life”? don’t understand the question..","date":"2013-08-30","mins":"4:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42420","author":"jesterof","post":"Max Patrick Hamon : Jesterof as a MD (?), you should have heard of neuromuscular paroxystic tetanization aka rigor statuaris and its immediate post mortem setting in.

Plus he jests himself and often in a vile way, but does not see it. This causes the confusion of misunderstanding even from the people who are not hostile towards his ideas. This particular instance is a classic example – as I understand, Max thinks that the body became rigid already on the cross and was covered in Shroud in not flattened position. Which I never objected to, btw and actually confirmed by mentioning that buildup of lactate can cause almost immediate rigor mortis. Would he state this in those clear sentences – there won’t be any discussion. Instead Max started to question my knowledge of forensic pathology and the timings of establishment and resolution of rigor mortis ( which is variable). This convoluted approach just to state one sentence – I think, Jesus Christ was buried in a flexed position since by the time He was taken from the cross His body already developed rigor mortis and therefore the image is as it is – resulted in lengthy and absolutely unnecessary discussion. But instead he has chosen the path to go through collateral bushes in order to achieve – WHAT exactly?.","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42518","author":"jesterof","post":"Max Patrick Hamon : Meguess Jesterof is just jesting.
