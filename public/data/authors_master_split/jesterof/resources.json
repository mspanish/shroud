The surgeon is quoted as saying… Should I have said “The surgeon is quoted BY THE JOURNALIST as saying…” ? And is there a youtube video of the doctor talking? The only “Anil Dhawan” I can find is a Bollywood singer. Here is the Daily Telegraph (UK) on the subject: “Dr Dhawan, who is leading research into whether liver cell injections can replace transplants, said: “There was a 90 per cent plus chance that he wasn’t going to survive without a liver transplant. But he survived. “Furthermore, he improved on his own. Acute liver failure in children is quite a devastating illness. The majority of them die. Scientifically I do not have an explanation for this child’s recovery.” It does not mean he said EXACTLY THOSE WORDS. It means that what the journalist attributes to him being said. Which 1) might be his words ( unlikely) 2) might be what the journalist have understood from his words 3) might be the journalist confabulation altogether. Option 2 has the highest probability. You clearly have too much faith in the integrity and intellect of the media community )))).","date":"2013-07-03","mins":"5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"id":"comment-38589","author":"jesterof","post":"Louis, I do not dispute the case. What I have disputed is the journalist’s representation of the doctor’s words, which does not mean he did not say the child was cured miraculously, I was only referring to the ambiguity of the statistical representation of possibilities, which Hugh made ironic comment on. Since I have a first hand experience with media community and know how they work and what do they know and what they aim at – therefore my comment.

There are also other phenomena related to saints that could be attributed to divine intervention, but this will be taken up on another occasion. Best. That is exactly why I am considering that the words of the hepatologist were somewhat transfigured by the journalist.. I am not objecting to the very issue of the healing and that the liver failure was an imminent death threat – I know what it is, I only object to the way the statistics are presented. However, description “90% chance of dying” does not mean that 10 people out of 100 survive. Personally, I think without a liver transplant that child have had more like 100% chance of dying, but that is just me : ).","date":"2013-07-03","mins":"8:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"id":"comment-38595","author":"jesterof","post":"Louis : One candidate for sainthood being studied is Charles I von Hapsburg Lothringen, last Emperor of the Austro Hungarian Empire, who did his best to stop World War I, and died as an exile in Madeira island, Portugal, at the age of 34.

I hope to find the other factors mentioned in #24 because they refer to other causes that may cause incorruption. It seems that depending on what kind of medicine they took previously, that is, in the days preceding death, some people remain incorrupt, As a physician perhaps you have heard about that? I have not heard about this in particular, since I was not very much into researching the incorrupt bodies ( I just take the word in face value) but one might assume that some medications taken for a long time and in higher concentrations might be a factor. However, I can’t think about anything immediately to have a balm effect. Most of the time whenever the incorruption is mentioned, the physical conditions around the body ( temperature, dryness, air flow) is considered, but as I’ve stated before, this is just memories what I’ve heard or read sometimes somewhere. I would wait until August or September if you will have the possibility to post anything then – I will highly appreciate it. In a meanwhile I’ll try to find something over the web – you got me interested :).","date":"2013-07-05","mins":"8:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"id":"comment-38672","author":"jesterof","post":"Thank you, Louis and Dave.
