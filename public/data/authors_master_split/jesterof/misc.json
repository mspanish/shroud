I have just this minute added the contrast enhancements to the tail end of a posting I did back in July last year.

I now need to sit down and have a long think about everything in that comment of yours. Incidentally, a snapshot from my archive of some fresh blood I had dabbed onto linen did not go yellow under added contrast, so if it’s an artefact, it’s not a simple straightforward one to do with the behaviour of red pigment under added contrast. Shroud blood seems to be atypical – yet again. The extra corporeal bloodstain shows a hint of the effect too, yet to be posted, but perhaps not as clearcut as one would have liked. But that was a Shroud Scope image. If the App fails to show the effect at all, as you report, then it may not be the unmasking effect that I had rather hoped for. Such is life – and sciencebizz… You win some, you lose far more… the stain on your experimental cloth is clearly unwashed whole blood stain, and looks like one, where the Shroud stain does not appear to be a whole blood stain at all.

I did a series of some dozen or so postings last year, based on Shroud Scope, doing just that, so feel entitled to “speculate”, on the grounds that if it is to be written off here by the knocking brigade as mere speculation, then it is at least informed speculation. Example – here’s a link to one of those many postings that noted evidence for flaking off, but with partial retention (“hang up”) – an entirely different signature from your “washing out” or never having been there in the first place. Http://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/lets take a closer look at one of the peculiar blood stains on the shroud the one in the hair shaped like a question mark/ I say it’s interpretation – the sort that is used routinely by those who employ microscopes in pathology and botany labs. To describe it as “speculation” when you probably haven’t taken the trouble to read any of my postings is just idle and gratuitous sniping. So what else is new? setting aside your pompous tone I will go through your blog ( which is not equal to the postings on theis one, since you do not post any objections, just your views). Well, let’s start – this one is already a bogus remark: Yes, one might ask how blood could trickle down hair as if the latter were a smooth surface like skin, crossing effortlessly from strand to strand The answer is – very simple – if there is a vessel damaged, which is a very easy option on the head, as it is highly vascularized, the blood can trickle down hair as if the latter were smooth surface, like skin – anybody who have seen the cutting of the skin in the head have seen how quickly and to any direction blood trickles through the hair. Ok, reading further, one can easily see that you are interpreting what you see not as what you see, but what you WANT to see – mainly to fit it your theory of the Shroud being a painting forgery. So called gap could not be flaking off at all – flaking off at one spot is not flaking off, but purposeful scraping off ( which is possible), but rather than being scraped off it looks much more like a stain of some liquid over the blood, which just dilutes it. The other part – if the body image is not a whole blood stain – why do you expect it to flake off? nobody knows how the image appeared on the cloth, but there is absolutely no reason to expect it to flake off, or wash off, or watever, so it being there does not prove ANYTHING in the domain what is been on the Shroud first – and you clearly want the image to be first. Same is pertinent to your description of the “wishbone” – those spots, or gaps which you want to be flaking off look more like diluted by other liquid spots, not even scraping of the dry blood, but clearly wet dilution.Change of color clearly proves that – flaking or just dry scraping off won’t make such a change in the coloring, wet dilution or washing out – will. Overall, from your block it is clear that you WISH to prove that image was painted ( though you do not have any idea how) first, and then blood stains were forged over it. But your arguments have no validity in proving that, because you can not prove it experimentally – not knowing HOW the image appeared. There is also no proof that the image can not be superimposed over the stains, without interfering with them – all these speculations about flaking, scraping off ( which do not look like ones at all) are not proof to what was there first. The image might have appeared together with the blood – did you ever thought about that?.","date":"2013-04-14","mins":"3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-30751","author":"jesterof","post":"Colinsberry : Most of the original blood has probably flaked off, or was washed out.

The days of ‘no salvation outside the Catholic Church’ are not so very far behind us. In the original post I was disappointed to see remarks being made about religious matters not directly linked to the Shroud (the subject of this blog). It seems that even here, in the face of this wonderful mystery, we look for division rather than humble unity. If children end up fighting over a gift would it not be better to not have given them the gift in the first place? No, I do not. But this is not the site to discuss one vs the other and I am not going to. My remark on the other thread was driven by constant preaching of one of the members and even in that thread it was present – the man has nothing to do with the Church he is so adamant to reform. It is not his business at all. Somehow that did not cause your peacemaking at all ;) Generally I could not care less who are you in your religion – this site is not about religion and their comparison.
