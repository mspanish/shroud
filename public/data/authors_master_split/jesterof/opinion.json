But they’re closely related. You refer to “when a person experiences DEATH”. But the definition of death is disputed, and ND Es occur under a wide variety of circumstances. For example, they sometimes occur when death is being anticipated, but prior to the event that’s expected to cause it (e.g. A falling person leaving his body and seeing it fall before it hits the ground). Or they occur during the normal course of surgery, when the body is shut down in some way, but the person is expected to survive. To cite one study mentioned in the book by Greyson, et al. That I referenced above, “Whereas 82.5 percent of persons having the NDE believed they had been near death, medical records confirmed their claims in only 45 percent of cases.” (27 28) And having been “near death” isn’t the same as having died. The study of felons that I cited is noteworthy because of the involvement of felons. They’re a class of people who tend to have low moral character. But the same type of result (the nature of the experience not corresponding with the moral character of the experiencer) has been demonstrated in ND Es as well. Even if we were to set aside the felons study for the sake of argument, the same conclusion would remain. You can be a good person by common human standards, yet have a negative NDE. You can be a bad person by common standards, yet have a positive NDE. It happens frequently. And some of the ND Es are mixed (partly good and partly bad) or neutral in some significant way. If the person is not in clinical death stage I find it hard to relate his/her experience as connected to death – deep coma but with heart beating and perfusing is physiologically totally different state than clinical death( that is why I do not include Dr.Alexander’s experience as the most valid of ND Es). The European studies on ND Es excluded the experiences of other situations, except the valid clinical death – to cut off possible accusations of possible confounding bias – and rightfully so, Death visions BEFORE actual death are not even close to described ND Es – at least not those in the link to the study you have provided – in terms of actual basic conditions they have to meet. Seeing relatives and experiencing calm is a common note, but it is not the same as the core elements of the classic features of ND Es – leaving one’s body, going through a tunnel, floating and so on. Deathbed visions do not have the experience of LEAVING THE BODY – and that is a fundamental difference, in my opinion..","date":"2013-07-27","mins":"10:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/26/near-death-experiences-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Near Death Experiences and the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-39862","author":"jesterof","post":"Those are THEIR personal IMH Os, nothing more.

It has nothing to do with NDE – neither of the felons experienced NDE, but a near death visions and obviously, those can have some resembling features, but they can not be equated to ND Es as they are a different category whatsoever. The importance of this understanding this distinction is necessary to not be tempted to base the conclusion made earlier, that negativity of the ND Es is not connected to the person experiencing it. Felon study about deathbed visions absolutely can not be considered as a proof of this assumption since deathbed vision in no way are equal to ND Es.

This type of “proof” is false on many levels. First – those experiences are NOT the ND Es, I would rather call them Pre death experiences, which obviously, ,involve supernatural phenomena but could not give us any valuable insight into the nature of post death road for the people involved. Another aspect in all of this ( in a perspective of absence of “hellish” experiences) – nobody actually researched the issue how many of the felons were actually real criminals, not a mistake of judicial system – and that might be a huge confounding bias if one wants to make an absence of negativity in pre death experience by convicted felons as a proof of non discerning nature of ND Es.","date":"2013-07-27","mins":"10:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/26/near-death-experiences-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Near Death Experiences and the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-39990","author":"jesterof","post":"I am disputing only the assumptionthat the negative character( “hellish”) of the ND Es is not connected to the nature of the person experiencing it and the proof of this thesis to be a felon study.

Jesus is discussing the destruction of the temple and he says: ‘Destroy this temple, and in 3 days I will raise it up.’ The Jews then said, ‘This temple has been under construction for 46 years, and you will raise it up in 3 days?’ But he was speaking of the temple of his body (John 2:20 21).’ John points out that later, when he is crucified, Jesus’ disciples remembered his prophecy of the 3 days; however, no one seems to recall the 46 years. Taken at his word, Jesus is clearly saying that he is 46 years old, and that when he dies, he will resurrect in 3 days. If Jesus was 46 years old when he died in 36 A.D., it means he was born in 10 B.C., which is theoretically possible, although 6 B.C. Is a more probable date. * Can you, please, explain the logic of deriving the 46 years of the “temple of body” from the Jews saying that the temple ( of stone) is under construction for 46 years? I think you mixed it up – from the 46 years of construction of the stone temple nobody can make the conclusion that “Jesus is clearly saying that HE is 46 years old”.","date":"2013-05-11","mins":"7:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33526","author":"jesterof","post":"We find further proof that Jesus is in his 40s from the Gospel of John.

Were he in his 20s or 30s, they would have chosen a different year, but by saying that he is not yet 50, they clearly identify him as being in his forties. The other logical mistake – from one saying “you are not yet 50 years old” does not the conclusion that he is in his 40s logically follow. The same might be said to somebody in his 30 and in his 20s as well – if the mark 50 has it’s own meaning.

It is generally accepted that Jesus was born within two years of the death of the Judean King Herod, which has commonly been put at 4 B.C. But that date has been called into question in recent years. Dr. Jack Finegan, an emeritus professor at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif., and author of “The Handbook of Biblical Chronology,” a standard reference on the subject, now puts Herod’s death more likely at 1 B.C. John Mosley, program director at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and an expert on the Star of Bethlehem, said that while it may never be possible to know what the star was, “when Herod died was an actual event and should be knowable.” And if Herod died in 1 B.C., he added, “you can’t stretch the birth of Jesus back to 6 or 7 B.C.” If this is correct, then the age of Jesus Christ in mid 30s is even more substantiated Luke 3:23 Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli, and we know that Jesus Christ was crucified during the reign of Pontius Pilate which is known to be from AD 26–36, so if the Herod’s death is pushed to 1 BC, than jesus Christ birth is also pushed to maximum 3 BC, which makes the latest possible date of his crucifiction by 36 AD and his latest age at 39 and the earliest at 29.

This date is KNOWN and not speculated.
