It is extrapolating but who would not? We’re talking about linking mt DNA to human groups, the first question a journalist would ask would be about the TS man’s blood and to which extent we can link his DNA to an actual human group. What is the probability that we have the mt DNA of the TS man in this sample, what is the amount of DNA material from white blood cells (visually the amount of blood seems huge) we can expect… People have been focusing on the C14 question, but maybe the big one is DNA and white blood cells’ DNA as you pointed in your article..","date":"2015-10-13","mins":"12:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin"}]
