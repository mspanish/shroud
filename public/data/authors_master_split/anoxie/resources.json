The C 14 dating failed, not to say it turned out to be a scientific fiasco. Rogers was the first who discovered precisely and directly why the C14 dating failed, the first to put scientific study of the shroud back on track. The first to give a modern, naturalistic, credible explanation of image formation. The first to claim scientifically, that the shroud could be the actual burial cloth of the historical jesus.
