Also, the picture in #134 is with Hb:O2 with 2 concentrations of fresh bilirubin added? Or is this incorrect? This is not from Adler’s papers, but a separate experiment (yours, others?) 4.

But the shoulder in the 428 480 range on the picture, comment #134, is directly correlated to the level of bilirubin.
