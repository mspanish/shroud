After an axillary block, the hand is still alive, the blood flow is still present, but it mimicks an amputated hand as long as the central peripheral nerve transmissions are blocked. What happens? no contraction after direct mechanical stimulations on the motor neuron, yet, with peripheral electrical stimulations you may get contractions. What is responsible for contraction on an injured hand/forearm is the nociceptive stimulus, absent in a blocked/amputated hand.

Once again, evidence based medecine is that a damage nerve results in a motor deficit, even after a trauma. In order to directly study the mechanical stimulation of crushing, Barbet should have crushed the median nerve in the forearm, not in the wrist just beside/through the ligament and the carpal bones. “Obviously law and ethics now preclude such experiments so we must rely on Dr.Barbet’s honesty describing the results and frankly I see no reason for doubting him” Obviously you can take a freshly amputated limb from a rabbit or a cow, and squeeze/brush/pierce the sciatic nerve for example, at distance from an articulation.
