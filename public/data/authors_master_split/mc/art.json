[{"id":"comment-4174","author":"mc","post":"10/14/11…Picked up this book “Heaven is for real” at Costco in Sacramento. Read the back of the cover and was skeptical, but for the fact it was from the words of a four year old, I wouldn’t have bought it. Being of a scientific mind and one who says if I can’t see it with my own eyes or experience it, I have a very difficult time believing anything. Also, one who has Catholic parents and a Jewish Grandmother, and raised on the “guilt factor”, I turned away from religion. I also don’t believe there is a higher being, because prior to truly not believing he existed, I did turn to him for help. My pleas and prayers were not answered or as I liked to say, not even acknowledged. Nevertheless, long story short, after reading this book in one sitting today, it brings out curiousity and possible renewed faith about this topic…God. I guess this might be meant to be, as on a recent vacation, for some strange reason I was overwhelmingly fasicinated with all the churches in the city I visited and insisted on photographing them. My thanks to the Burpo parents for expressing their Faith in a non pushing way so the lay person could possibly believe and try again to have faith.
