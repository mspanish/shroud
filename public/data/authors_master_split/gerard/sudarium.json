He makes his presentation and puts out a statement like it shows x and y but doesn’t provide any compelling data to back up his hypothesis. I want facts or details that I can shred with Occams Razor and then use to beat sceptics about the head with. I don’t think it’s here. No one else has reviewed his findings or done a seperate study on the stains that I’m aware of. Please do correct me if I’m wrong, but spooky music and half hearted searches don’t do it for me..","date":"2013-04-24","mins":"1:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/23/new-video-on-the-sudarium-of-oveido/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Video on the Sudarium of Oveido"},{"id":"comment-31780","author":"gerard","post":"And, A little point to clarify after I read back my post. I don’t wish to imply that Mark is in any way a crackpot. I just wish he presented a stronger arguement. If this is the head cloth then they each corroborate each other and are thus almost irrefutable..","date":"2013-04-24","mins":"1:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/23/new-video-on-the-sudarium-of-oveido/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Video on the Sudarium of Oveido"}]
