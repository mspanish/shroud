Apologies. I still can’t believe the KGB or anyone would care what the result was. It just wasn’t that important to them. The only thing I take from this is: “Each of which had the same AMS C 14 dating system.” Something I hadn’t realised before. That explains why the got the same results and casts even more doubt on the result. 3 labs using material taken from the same place using the same dating system is hardly rigorous..","date":"2014-03-18","mins":"9:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/the-computer-hacker-hypothesis-is-short-on-factual-material/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Computer Hacker Hypothesis is Short on Factual Material"},{"id":"comment-88695","author":"gerard","post":"Stephen, in 1988, no one even knew what the internet, or a computer virus, or hacking was. The 3 labs were 1000’s of miles apart, the machines were not “online” in any way so as to be “hacked” locally or any otherwise. I doubt there would have been any interface capable of transfer of the data let alone able to input a “hack”. I’m sure the Labs would have taken great care to protect, test & calibrate their equipment considering the subject of the test & what was at stake. I stick by the nonsense statement above.
