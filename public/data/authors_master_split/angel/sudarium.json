[{"id":"comment-197087","author":"angel","post":"Hi, Kelly! Hope you are well. I have a question. There are many who believed Ron Wyatt was a fake, but I do not believe this to be the case. Although Ron is now deceased, what is interesting is that he found the cross hole where Jesus was crucified and digging beneath the cross hole into Zedekiah’s cave, he supposedly found the Mercy Seat (altar) that contained dried blood. Isn’t it strange that the blood Ron attributed to Jesus had 24 chromosomes (XXY), same as that of the Shroud? Here is an excerpt of someone familiar with DNA analysis, referencing the blood Wyatt found. A Scientist Analyzes Mr. Wyatt’s Chromosome Theory Dr. Eugene Dunkley, Geneticist August 1999, England “Ron was convinced that the blood of the altar was in fact the divine blood of Jesus because the chromosome count was 24. If Jesus was ONLY human we would expect 46. In fact, if he found 46 chromosomes I would have my doubts, because the argument would be that it was simply the blood of a human being (except of course that the white blood cells were re vitalized after almost 2000 years….). Russell is wrong about the frequency of chromosomal diseases in humans: a number of conditions involving either 47 or 45 chromosomes have been well characterized, besides Turner’s, such as, Klinefelters, Down’s syndrome, Pateau’s syndrome, Cri de Chat syndrome, XYY, XXY, etc. And in fact there was a case in which a young man was found alive with only 24 chromosomes.” http://www.arkdiscovery.com/chromosomes.htm My question is Ron found this blood, before the Shroud DNA analysis. Why are the results, (XXY chromosome) exactly as that found on the Shroud of Turin? See also the photos of Zedekiah’s cave where Ron found the blood.
