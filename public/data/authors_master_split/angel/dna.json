[{"id":"comment-216916","author":"angel","post":"I found the quote below from the opening article, by Maria Hsia Chang, “The Virgin Birth: Where Science Meets Scripture” to be quite amusing. “Jesus was an XX male with no Y chromosome because Luke 1:26 35 tells the truth: Jesus was born of a virgin and has no human biological father.” My response: God, the Creator, was Adam’s father and he and all his descendants had both the X and Y chromosome. God blessed Adam and Eve with a purpose… procreation. “Be fruitful and multiply.” Why did Adam have a Y chromosome, when he had no biological father? Further, has it been conclusively determined that Shroud Jesus was 46 XX, (de la Chapelle syndrome) as opposed to 47 XXY (Kleinfelter syndrome)? One of the salient features of males diagnosed with de la Chapelle syndrome, 46 XX, is they are short in stature. As well, some have short webbed necks, among other things. Jesus of the Shroud, by comparison, was quite tall for a Hebrew male of that time. Males with Kleinfelter, 47 XXY, syndrome present as tall in stature with long arms. This appears to be more representative of Shroud Jesus. Yet, there are also 47 XXY MALES that DO NOT HAVE Kleinfelter syndrome. Two quotes from males with 47 XXY that are not diagnosed with Kleinfelter syndrome are found on the patient link below: Quotes: “Physique; tall (6ft), 75kg, underdeveloped, long arms, no musculature, no fat, sparse body hair, infertile, ( yeah got that result 22 years ago).” “I am 6ft 4 (my family are genetically tall) and weigh around 13stone to 13.5 stone. I have pretty normal musculature as I’m a runner and bike rider but generally fit with a probably typical swimmers’s build (wide shoulders).” http://patient.info/forums/discuss/when is 47 xxy not klinefelter s syndrome–38295 Best,.","date":"2015-12-20","mins":"7:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Jesus, the XX Male"}]
