Lansa’s translation of the Holy Bible from the original Aramaic and was surprised to find the Gospel of John, concerning the linen burial clothes, did not mention “strips.” See the following: ARAMAIC John 20:5 7 And he looked in and saw the linen clothes lying: but he did not enter in. Then Simon came after him and entered into the tomb; and he saw the linen clothes lying there. And the burial napkin which was bound around his head was not with the linen clothes, but was wrapped up and put in a place by itself. At this point in time, I own the King James Version of the Bible, The Jewish New Testament translated from the Hebrew by David H. Stern and the Aramaic translation of both the Old and New Testaments by George M. Lansa. The Hebrew translation of the NT by Stern, referring to John (same section as above), indicates the following: HEBREW John 20:5 7 Stooping down he saw the linen burial sheets lying there, but did not go in. Then, following him, Shim’on Kefa arrived, entered the tomb and saw the burial sheets lying there, also the cloth that had been around his head, lying not with the sheets, but in a separate place and still folded up. Neither of the two versions, Aramaic nor Hebrew, refers to “linen strips,” but instead, linen clothes or burial sheets.

Is it not possible that Jesus, in fact, did wear a loin cloth during the crucifixion, but it was completely blood soaked and for this reason was removed just prior to Him being wrapped in the shroud and the placement of the head napkin? The Shroud image indicates the body was naked, but does not guarantee Jesus did not wear a loin cloth on the cross and If this was the case the clothes may refer to the shroud and loin cloth.

In 1907, Mac Dougal weighed human bodies, in his hospital, at the moment of death, and he claimed each body had a reduction in weight by an average of 21g. Dr. Mac Dougal concluded this reduction in weight was attributed to the human soul leaving the body. Therefore, the human soul weighs about 3/4 of an ounce on average. He repeated the experiment with dogs, and there was no reduction in weight. His conclusion, with respect to dogs, is they did not have a soul..","date":"2012-09-28","mins":"4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/28/losservatore-romano-weighs-in-on-the-coptic-papyrus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"L’Osservatore Romano Weighs In on the Coptic Papyrus"},{"id":"comment-198741","author":"angel","post":"James Randi says: “This huge rag.” My reply to the “Amazing Randi.” Poof, be gone! :).","date":"2015-05-09","mins":"8:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/09/james-randi-visits-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_sites","title":"James Randi Visits the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-17031","author":"angel","post":"Yannick, you have probably seen this image previously, but what are your thoughts on the NASA Chandra telescope image, B1509, titled “Hand of God.” Go to Google images and type B1509 Chandra image.
