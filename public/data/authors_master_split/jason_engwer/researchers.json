[{"id":"comment-195279","author":"jason_engwer","post":"Hugh Farey is on the wrong side of the authenticity debate, but he handled his side of the program better than Alan Whanger handled his. Whanger tried to cover too much ground, brought up a lot of dubious arguments (e.g., the appeal to alleged images of coins, crowns of thorns, etc.), and often wasn’t responsive enough to the questions he was being asked. I was glad, though, that Whanger brought up the dating tests done by Giulio Fanti and his colleagues. But he brought it up too late for it get much discussion. Any mention of the 1988 test should be accompanied by mention of things like the 1982 and Fanti tests and Ray Rogers’ vanillin argument. And Hugh should have mentioned how closely the 1988 test coincides with the Shroud’s first explicit appearance in the historical record, which I don’t think he did. I wish all of that had been laid out, followed by a discussion of how to best make sense of the totality of those dating methods. The 1988 test gets too much isolated attention. It’s superior to the other dating efforts in some important ways, but the other ones have some significance, especially cumulatively. One of the problems with programs like this one is that they tend to spend too much time reinventing the wheel. Instead of giving so much attention to introductory issues and matters of such common knowledge, most of the time should be spent breaking new ground or discussing issues that tend to receive much less attention than others. There was some of that during the program (mostly because of Hugh’s efforts), but not enough. More of the program should have been spent discussing Fanti’s tests, Charles Freeman’s arguments, and other issues of a newer and less common nature..","date":"2015-04-03","mins":"10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"}]
