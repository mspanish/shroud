I recall a contemporary who obtained his doctorate in an aspect of the subject in Auckland. Prof Fanti has attempted to apply the methods of ‘Materials Science’ to a single minuscule fibre of the TS. However linen is a particularly variable material, see the article on Linen even in Wiki. Not only will its properties vary between different cloths obtained from different processing methods, but also between fibres within the same cloth, more so I would expect in ancient cloths because of hand processing, spinning etc. Fibres are extremely brittle, inelastic, will not stretch, and with frequent folding be inclined to break. Its softness increases with frequent washing. The different histories of individual cloths even from the same batch will increase the variability of their properties, so that these cloths from the same batch end up with different properties. With this inherent variability, it is hardly surprising that Prof Fanti finds that there are large variabilities and scatter in his calibration curves. To then make an assertion about the age of the TS based on one single solitary fibre is going beyond what I think is good science. It is compounding the errors made in the lack of proper sampling protocols in the C14 fiasco. Providing that adequate sampling protocols have been followed in deriving the calibration curves, it may be possible to obtain a credible range for the age of the TS, but only if an adequate number of proper samples are tested from the TS. However because of the inherent variability of linen cloths, their history and so on, a large error in any confidence interval would seem unavoidable in any age assessment. In my view the present case has to fail to persuade because sampling of an extremely variable material was inadequate..","date":"2013-04-06","mins":"5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/05/a-committee-far-removed-from-padua/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Committee Far Removed from Padua"},{"id":"comment-16044","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Gabriel, Thanks for introducing me to Benford’s Law which I hadn’t come across before. Stat Math was once a significant part of my working life, so I guess I must be getting fairly rusty on it now, not keeping up. I was intrigued by the many applications. I found even the Wikipedia article amazing. That it could have election fraud, and auditing applications makes it a potentially powerful tool, and I see that courts have accepted its use for persuasive evidence in cases of fraud. I suppose it’s fairly simple when you think about it. Many non normal populations of datasets will have a uniform logarithmic distribution, which immediately implies an exponential distribution in the data. I hadn’t come across Zipf as such either, although it seems to be related to Pareto. I was amazed that Riemann’s Zeta function seemed to be part of the theory, as this is also tied up with the distribution of prime numbers. The notions of order and chaos in the intial posting above, sent me back to a one time popular work (1983) “The Mathematical Experience” by Davis & Hersh. It has a chapter ‘Pattern, Order and Chaos’ and gives iterative maths examples of Order from Order, Chaos from Order, Chaos from Chaos, and would you believe Order from Chaos.

I suspect that the reasons for this may be that much of research has to do with the underlying agenda of promoting new products for profit. In the case of scientific research on a religious relic such as the Shroud, the only product to sell is a philosophical stand point, either the religious agenda that the object is authentic (Fanti’s position), or the agnostic viewpoint that all such relics are necssarily bogus. There are few with the integrity who can put their personal viewpoint in their back pocket as Yannick might express it. It seems to be an unfortunate fact of the human condition and will continue to be the bane of those seeking the truth about this remarkable object. The Rinaldi review of Fanti’s book is an excellent piece of work. The hypothesis that cellulose will degrade over time has much appeal and would in principle seem to be a rational proposition. It may be significant that the original unmodified date placed an age on the TS fibre of 752 BC (+/ 400 years). This must raise a serious doubt on the allegation that it is medieval, irrespective of the actual site source of the fibre. The fact that anything on the Shroud can be attributed with such an age has to be significant. However it is also clear that there are many unsatisfactory or at least unknown aspects to the work, questions on the provenance of the fibre, the agenda driven nature of the research, and some of the wilder assumptions made. I would add the inclusion of the Peruvian sample in deriving the calibration curve when it is known that South American flax is unrelated to Old World species. The variations in the individual histories of the fabrics would seem to have resulted in a wide scatter in deriving the calibration curve. Despite all these reservations, Fanti may well have hit on something worthwhile pursuing further. If ever there is further scientific work to be carried out on the TS at sometime in the future then this set of experiments should be included in the programme. At least it may give better results than the C14 tests that Gabriel has often queried as worthwhile on this type of object..","date":"2013-04-05","mins":"4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/05/a-committee-far-removed-from-padua/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Committee Far Removed from Padua"},{"id":"comment-127510","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Earlier this evening on the 50th anniversary of the D day Landing in Normandy, I listened to a recording of General Eisenhower’s message, ‘D day statement to soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force’. At the end of his message of encouragement, it concluded: “And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.” I wonder how many western generals nowadays would invoke God’s blessing on such perilous undertakings as the Allied forces were about to face in 1944. I shall not weep for the decline of belief in biblical literalism. I would rejoice if it were to be replaced by a more meaningful religious ethos. The old gods die, it was always ever thus.

Possibly Paul had in mind the diverse cults of gnosticism already then prevalent. However it is true that it is a more prevalent and recurring tendency. Later developments were Arianism, Monophysitism and Nestorianism, among many others. “The old gods die.” The case of Ancient Britain is particularly interesting “The Sacred History of Britain” by Martin Palmer. Agriculture reached Britain about 5000 BC, and the Neolithic peoples developed ceremonial burial rites and communal centres around ‘long barrows’, a particular example being at Waylands Smithy. Overuse of farmlands led to crop failures, consequent famines and the barrows were closed off about 3200 BC. It was succeeded in turn by the ‘Stone Circle’ culture, initially by wood henges and eventually by stone circles which spread right across Europe. With the building of the Great Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain in 3100 BC, the other stonehenges fell into disuse. There were three distinct phases at Stonehenge, each being a falling into disuse, and then a remodelling. In 1150 BC an Icelandic volcano erupted, blotting out the sun with widespread crop failures and famine, and the last attempt at remodelling Stonehenge remained unfinished and the circle culture with its ceremonial burials was abandoned. From 500 BC Celtic ideas emerged focusing on springs and wells, originating from a Mesopotamian Ainu cult. In turn it gave way to early forms of Christianity. Palmer traces the religious development of Britain right up to modern times. Community crises, famines, plagues, often resulted in changes in religious thinking. We are seeing at present mass extinctions of species, the forerunner of yet another global crisis brought about by climate change. It seems likely that antibiotics will also fail, and there will be a mass succumbing to incurable diseases with major impact on populations. How humanity might eventually react to these crises can only be guessed at. What will the Christianity of the future look like? A remnant only, or a reawakening. What will be the place of Islam? Will it become dominant, or will it fail? These things are for the present hidden from us!.","date":"2014-06-07","mins":"5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/07/a-decline-an-uptick-and-a-rise/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Decline,  an Uptick and a Rise"},{"id":"comment-127941","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Mike, I should be very cautious in attempting to read Revelations as an oracle foretelling specific events of the distant future, as a few extreme sects do. Did you know that most of the Eastern Orthodox do not even accept this book as canonical. I spent the best part of a year discussing this specific book with my Bible Study group under a well informed scholarly priest. Essentially Revelations is an Apocalypse, as is the book of Daniel, both using similar imagery, and both written under threat of intense persecution. Both have the specific purpose of encouragement to those threatened. An apocalypse can work on a number of levels. There is the immediate threat at the time of writing, and the style will be in the form of a simple code easily recognised by those for whom it is written, but so as to be hidden from the enemy. Much of what is said of the beast applies specifically to Nero, including the number 666. [Greek uses an alphabetic numerary system,] Having said that, an apocalypse may also contain certain cosmic truths which are forever perennial, and can apply to various extreme circumstances in history whenever God’s people are persecuted. It is hardly a difficult matter to identify the beast with the likes of Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin for example. It can equally apply to certain extreme forms of philosophy, involving exploitation of the weak and vulnerable, or in the consequences of selfishness. I see the beast at work in the extinction of species, and in climate change, much of which is being brought about by human greed. Indeed, sometimes we are our own worst enemy, and the enemy of our posterity. I should not attempt to divine specific future events from it in any kind of literal way. I think that is to misunderstand the function of prophecy and of the prophet. The prophet is not an augur or an Oracle of Delphi but proclaims his message to the people of his time, although his message may also contain perennial truth. The specific future remains hidden from our eyes, and we must be satisfied with the consolation of hope and the promise.

In Wellington we’re regularly getting temperature day time highs of around 10 deg C (that’s about 50 deg F), though so far we haven’t had any snow here as we did last year in August. Of course there’s snow on the high country, the North Island Desert Road gets regularly closed over winter, and they’e getting snow way down south on the low country, and the farmers regularly suffer stock losses as a result. Stock is rarely ever kept indoors here. I first came across the idea of Parallel Universes from the book of that name by Michio Kaku who I think you see a lot of on TV in North America (Doubleday 2005). He explains it very well. It seemed to me it could be a stepping stone in coming to grips with the ideas implicit in the supernatural, which could find a response in the modern mind with our greater understanding of how the universe works. Under modern avant garde theories of matter involving string theory and M(membrane) theory, our universe comprises 3 dimensions of length, one of time, and several more which are supposed to be “rolled up” so we don’t directly perceive them. Maybe there’s 10 or 12 of them. In a parallel universe, these extra dimensions might not be rolled up, and it would appear very strange to us indeed, and the physical laws would be quite different. The main thing that I found attractive in Michio Kaku’s book, is his excellent treatment of so called “Goldilocks zones”, which is the subject of his chapter 8, “A Designer Universe?” You can find quite a lot about Goldilock Zones on the web and elsewhere. But it is quite a controversial topic.

As one commentator pointed out, Baldacchini’s matter antimatter suggestion for the disappearance of the body would have resulted in a massive nuclear explosion, which plainly never happened, and would have surely blown any burial cloth to smithereens. I suggested a parallel universe hypothesis was a rather more plausible explanation of the resurrection than matter antimatter annihilation, if an explanation in comprehensible physics were to be considered at all. The reference to Teilhard was an incidental throwaway comment, as he is one of the very few theologians who has ever attempted any kind of synthesis of science and religion. Yannick may prefer a naturalistic explanation of the Shroud image, but for all that he has ever written on the matter, no one has ever come close to matching all its properties, There is little evidence that any experimentalist is pursuing a programme to test naturalistic explanations (refer challenge to Dawkins), and we don’t have to wait until doomsday before accepting the proposition that the Resurrection is as good an explanation as we’re ever likely to get in our lifetime!.","date":"2012-07-11","mins":"10:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/11/a-modern-conceptual-idea-of-the-supernatural-world/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A modern conceptual idea of the \"supernatural\" world?"},{"id":"comment-13747","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The maintenance of life and rejuvenation of body cells are seen as “natural processes”. Explanations of the causes of these processes depend on what perspective we adopt and out personal belief systems. A purely spiritual approach, such as those by mystics and primal peoples, might explain them in such terms as the providence of God, or the Great Spirit, whereas an agnostic might explain them in terms of natural evolutionary development from some kind of primordial soup of organic matter. Others, such as a modern informed religious person, could be prepared to accept some kind of synthesis including both viewpoints. If parallel universes do in fact exist, then a religious person has to say that they are part of God’s creation. It may be possible for some Being, an angel for example, to travel from one of these universes to another. The Resurrection of Jesus might be seen as Jesus going to some kind of “super universe” of which our present universe is but a component. An analogy is a flat two dimensional table top which exists in our three dimensional space. An ant crawling on the table top has only a two dimensional perspective, with no up nor down, but we can reach out from our 3 D space and touch the ant. In a similar way, Jesus may reach out from his super universe and touch our lives. God may be much closer to us than we can imagine. The evidence for parallel universes is scanty, but the concept could explain a few mysteries of quantum mechanics, such as super symmetry and the spontaneous appearance of sub atomic particles in perfect vacuums. It therefore seems to me that the concept might have some useful kind of role in a modern mind coming to terms with the existence or reality of the supernatural or spiritual world of the divine, in contrast to the materialists’ view of “All you can see, is all that exists – there is nothing else.” “There are many rooms in my Father’s house; if there were not, I should have told you.” John 14:2.","date":"2012-07-11","mins":"5:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/11/a-modern-conceptual-idea-of-the-supernatural-world/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A modern conceptual idea of the \"supernatural\" world?"},{"id":"comment-38353","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Our NZ winter sport is Rugby Football, a hard physical game at which we excel. Unlike American Gridiron no sissy body padding is worn, and head protection gear is not compulsory. Also unlike the more popular Association Football played elsewhere, there is hard body tackling as players seek to capture the ball from their opponents. Our international games commence with the posturing of the traditional haka, a war dance of defiance which is how you will be welcomed to our Maori marae, and indeed you will be made very welcome if you pay the traditional ‘koha’, for it is a “quid pro quo” society and ‘utu’ is important. At the club level, despite the bruising, and occasional more serious injuries, and even sometimes ill tempered fisticuffs, the teams get together afterwards in camaraderie, the contest over, for a few beers and sing rowdy rugby songs. A whistle blowing referee controls the game to ensure compliance with the Laws. Our women folk also play a hard physical game of Netball against the Aussies and Jamaicans, and the ref’s whistling is even more frequent. Some of us imagine we can play cricket, a gentlemanly game much less boisterous, but even there the umpire’s word is Law. Our Parliamentary debates are also robust, and the House Speaker regularly sends the worst prima donnas out of the chamber for unparliamentary behaviour. A much rougher game is ‘Hardball’ where the rules of fair play are ignored and the only objective is to win at all costs. One version of the game is to attack the credibility of the opponents, using whatever arguments you can dream up, and when they retaliate you can cry “Foul!” and the umpire or moderator then steps in. You can play this as a long term strategy, the pay off being that more benign players no longer turn up for the next fixture, and you can eventually succeed in killing off the enjoyable discussions among those whose views differ from your own. Another version is to resort to incomprehensible technical jargon, and when this fails to persuade, you can act aggrieved, taking it as a personal insult, the pay off being that your ego has been massaged.

If they are not, then they are as likely to be the bones of some other contemporary Christian martyr anyway. The Pope’s action were limited to opening the box, wafting incense towards them, and holding the box aloft, but he did not otherwise refer to them. In 1968, the archaeologist Margherita Guarducci persuaded Pope Paul VI to say the bones had been “identified in a way we can hold to be convincing”. She had translated adjacent Greek graffiti as “Peter lies here”, tests on the bones showed they came from a man in his 60s. Her conclusions have not been accepted by fellow experts involved in the dig. A Latin inscription on the box states that they are “considered” to be St Peters.

You can find them on Wikipedia: XX Male Syndrome Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX male syndrome Extracts: “XX male syndrome (also called de la Chapelle syndrome, for a researcher who characterized it in 1972[1]) is a rare sex chromosomal disorder. Usually it is caused by unequal crossing over between X and Y chromosomes during meiosis in the father, which results in the X chromosome containing the normally male SRY gene. When this X combines with a normal X from the mother during fertilization, the result is an XX male. This syndrome occurs in approximately four or five in 100,000 individuals, making it less common than Klinefelter syndrome ” [XXY , There are also XXYY ]. “Symptoms usually include small testes and subjects are invariably sterile. Individuals with this condition sometimes have feminine characteristics, with varying degrees of gynecomastia but with no intra abdominal Müllerian tissue.[4] According to research at the University of Oklahoma health science centers, most XX males are not stereotypically feminine and are typical boys and men[citation needed] although other reports suggest that facial hair growth is usually poor and libido is diminished, with notable exceptions.” The article gives citations. So it does occur! Whether it occurred in Jesus in this form, or whether he had some other chromosome arrangement, we have no way other way of knowing, except the papers commented on above. I still maintain there is a theological difficulty. If Jesus had XY chromosomes, and that this was part of his human nature, then he had to obtain Y from a human father. It still creates a theological difficulty if you say he had them from the Holy Spirit, as he is supposed to have his human nature solely from his mother. Doctrine of the Virgin birth dates only from the 4th century. The early doctors of the church postulated that Jesus’ brothers (named in Mark) and his sisters were from an earlier marriage by Joseph, or were cousins. However, John P Meier, a highly reputable Catholic biblicist is insistent that the Greek word used for brothers means precisely that. A further explanation, which I tend to favour is that they may well have been adopted, as adoption of orphans was very common in those days because of high mortality rates, and adoption gave exactly the same rights as birth, both in Roman and Jewish law. You may believe that the doctrine of the Virginal birth was metaphorical, and there are other non Christian religious traditions also asserting that it occurred elsewhere, (e.g. Siddhartha Gautama = Buddha).

Not incredible! The mother of Jesus would normally have no XY chromosomes to pass on to her progeny. I have heard that it is remotely and rarely possible for a woman to inherit and contain XY chromosomes from her father, but knowledgable medical geneticists may be able to supply more authoritative comment. There is a “medical/theological” problem with doctrines of virgin births coupled with doctrines of incarnation. The birth of Jesus is one such example, and in history of religions, there are also a few others. The problem is this. If Jesus was truly man, he must have had XY chromosomes, and the question is “Where did they come from?”. The standard Catholic doctrine is that Jesus inherited all of his human nature from his mother. But she could not normally provide XY chromosomes. A liberal stance would be to deny the doctrine of the virgin birth. This could not be accepted by Catholic theologians in good standing. It seems that Mr Frank Tipler, is attempting to get around the problem, by asserting that Jesus only had XX chromosomes. But only women have XX chromosomes. And the logical conclusion from Tipler’s assertion would be that Jesus would therefore actually be a woman. However there is a gospel account in Luke that Jesus was circumcised when he was about 8 days old. But I don’t think that this would be an adequate reason for the Vatican to consider that it might now permit the priestly ordination of women! The doctrine of the Virgin birth was only formulated around the 4th century, and is derived from the gospels of Matthew and Luke. The question is now: “When did Jesus become God?” For Mark it was when he was baptised by John in the waters of the Jordan. For both Matthew and Luke, it was at his conception.

D’Arcis may have been on good terms with King Charles Vi. No less so was Geoffroi II de Charnay. The bailli Venderesse had a letter signed by Charles VI to retrieve the Shroud. Who drafted this letter? Had Charles actually bothered to read the letter or was it in a stack of “unimportant correspondence” for his routine signature? At the very time that Venderesse was seeking to retrieve the Shroud from Lirey, Geoffroi II was in Paris with a celebratory party to mark the arrival of Isabel of Bavaria as preliminary for her coronation as Queen of France. Geoffroi II took part in the joustings as did Charles VI himself, all a very cosy party for the lads and mates of the king. And Venderesse was all too easily discouraged from his assigned mission, directed against a fellow bailli. D’Arcis himself may well have been confused about the matter. He may have been aware that the genuine Shroud had perhaps once been in Besancon, and that there was said to be a shroud still there. Unknown to him, this was the replacement shroud that had been painted and the poor fellow had probably confused one with the other, as the replacement had been done in secret. He had his own interests and problems to think of as well. Here the lucrative pilgrim tourist traffic was heading off to some little insignificant village church in Lirey, while his own seat was in a state of disrepair. During the Christmas period in 1389, the entire nave of Troyes’ cathedral collapsed, and shortly afterwards the rose window of the north transept fell out. D’Arcis had to hire 30 labourers just to clean up the mess. A bishop needs to think of his priorities and where the money should be going. Now coming to the matter of the relationship between Antipope Clement VII and Geoffroi II: Was it merely a question of disturbing a lucrative tourist trade of a relative, as David Mo would suggest, or were there in fact higher motives? Is it not possible that Clement, as a family relative, in fact had inside knowledge of the true origins of the cloth that Geoffroi II was displaying? Did he know that in truth the Shroud had been captured from Constantinople, and that therefore there were rather bigger issues at stake. On 5 January 1390, Clement sent his stern letter to Bishop D’Arcis. On the same date, he sent a letter to Geoffroi II, stating that he could continue to hold the Shroud expositions, though he should limit the lavishness of the accompanying ceremonial. There was not even any mention that Geoffroi II was required to describe the Shroud as a ‘figure or representation’ of Jesus’ shroud. Did Bishop D’Arcis send his memorandum to Clement VII with all its accusations against the de Charnay family? I think not. That is an invention of Ulysse Chevalier, echoed by his co conspirator Herbert Thurston, who wrote lies for the Catholic Encyclopedia. As David Mo says, “To speculate is free”, but I think my own are closer to the mark!.","date":"2014-10-26","mins":"6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty"},{"id":"comment-192460","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There is much that could be stated on the history of biblical criticism, too much to encapsulate here in a brief comment. Much of the New Testament itself includes an attempt to interpret the ancient scriptures in terms of the new Christianity, to see those who had accepted Jesus as Lord and Saviour as the new People of God, supplanting the exclusiveness of Judaism by extending salvation to the gentiles. In the first few hundred years of Christianity, the patristic period, the preferred method of interpreting the scriptures seems to have been an allegorical approach (Clement & Origen in Alexandria). Thus Origen claimed that the most meaningful aspects of divine revelation could be extracted only by allegorization, a view echoed by Clement. Later from about 350 AD, Theodore of Mopsuestia (c. 350 428/429) and John Chrysostom (c. 347 407), patriarch of Constantinople, developed an exegesis that took more account of literal meaning and historical context. But the allegorizers could claim that their method yielded lessons that, while arbitrary, were more relevant and interesting to ordinary Christians. In the West, the Alexandrian method was adopted by both Ambrose and Augustine. Augustine, though not primarily an exegete, composed both literal and allegorical commentaries and expository homilies on many parts of Scripture, and his grasp of divine love as the essential element in revelation supplied a unifying hermeneutical principle that compensates for technical deficiencies. Jerome paid close attention to the grammatical context, often appealing from the Greek Septuagint to the “Hebraic verity”. The scholastics made further progress during the medieval period. Thus for Thomas Aquinas, the literal sense, expressing the author’s intention, was a fit object of scientific study; the figurative senses unfolded the divine intention. There is much more that could be said on the contribution of the medievalists. The Protestant Reformation, with its emphasis on scripture as the sole source of divine revelation could hardly have occurred without the contemporaneous invention of printing. However both Luther and Calvin reverted to favouring the literal approach as that to be preferred against the allegorical. Hence it is hardly surprising as a strategy that the first steps in modern biblical criticism to recover from this position were those by German Protestants. Perhaps the first steps were taken by Griesbach in 1776 who printed the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke in parallel columns, giving them the name synoptic. Others also made their various contributions: Bengel, Lowth, Lachmann, Wellhausen and others. Major breakthroughs occurred at the start of the 20th century from both Schweitzer and Bultmann. Butlmann in particular seems to have been particularly concerned at the apparent conflicts between science and religion, which he attributed to the mythological world view current at the time the scriptures were written, and which he saw as inessential to the fundamentals of faith, but which in the modern context masked it. Other Protestant scholars followed on, such as Karl Barth with his existential approach. The Catholic response was much more slow, anchored as it was in the Greek Septuagint, as prevalent in New Testament times, and in Jerome’s Latin Vulgate. Perhaps the first breakthrough occurred with the 1893 encyclical of Pope Leo XIII “Providentissimus Deus” ‘On the Study of Holy Scripture’. There followed the war time 1943 encyclical of Pope Pius XII “Divino Spiritu Afflante”, ‘ On Promoting Biblical Studies’. Both encyclicals are reproduced in a 1955 Douay Rheims translation I still hold of the Latin Vulgate. I recall reading both encyclicals there as a young man. Perhaps the greatest impetus and encouragement to modern Catholic Biblical Studies arose from the 1965 Vatican II Council document, “Dei Verbum” ‘On divine revelation’. Thus the footnotes of the Jerusalem Bible version (a translation from French to English) provide a critical commentary in themselves for the general reader. Catholic scholars in biblical studies had a lot of catching up on their Protestant colleagues. However in some quarters, it is now considered that they have well overtaken them. And even yet I have said very little on the various types of criticism whether: textual, philological, literary, form, tradition or historical criticisms.

Unless the statement meets certain rigid criteria, it can I think be only given the same weight as any such statement by a well informed Catholic theologian, and such statements are not necessarily deemed to be infallible. The doctrine of infallibility, officially defined at the Vatican I council of 1870, says that when the Pope is officially defining church dogma, the Holy Spirit is also. There are three requirements for infallibility to be invoked: 1. The pronouncement must be made by the official successor to Peter. 2. The subject matter must be in the area of faith and morals. 3. The Pope must be speaking ex cathedra (from the chair) of Peter, and must be intending to proclaim a doctine that binds the entire Church to assent. If any one of the above 3 requirements is missing, the papal declaration is not considered to be an infallible doctrine. Not everything the Pope says is infallible. Thus any Pope may consider the Shroud to be the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, or else he may prefer to refer it to as an icon, and he may write as such whatever. As the matter is hardly to be considered one of “faith and morals” it is unlikely that even an official position would ever become binding as a matter of Catholic doctrine, regardless of whether the cloth’s authenticity be ever conclusively proved or not. In such matters, it is to be expected that the faithful will come to their own conclusions about where truth may rest according to how well they may be able to inform their individual consciences. This implies a duty to become as well informed as may be reasonable for the particular individual..","date":"2013-04-09","mins":"7:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/09/an-important-distinction-in-catholic-theology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An important distinction in Catholic theology"},{"id":"comment-30075","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Concentrate, Colin, concentrate!.","date":"2013-04-09","mins":"3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/09/an-important-distinction-in-catholic-theology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An important distinction in Catholic theology"},{"id":"comment-30300","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Charles Freeman has cycled his 900 AD Hungarian theory as the source of AB blood types previously.

He is justly credited for his idea that the missionary must adapt to the customs and language of the people he evangelizes, and for his advocation of an educated native clergy—initiatives not always followed by his successors. His poverty that had so won the Paravas and Malays often repelled the Japanese, so he abandoned it for studied display when this was called for.

There is a considerable amount of detail about AAI already on the web, and there was little point on expanding on this. My personal position is that I consider AAI, and indeed much of the pedantic rigorous type of philosophy is only of limited value in arriving at the truth of matters. The Russell/Whitehead programme with its “logical positivism” was directed at developing a rigorous type of logical deduction. There are clearly equally valid reasons, for a softer approach in coming to a rational belief as contrasted with the rigorous deducitve approach aimed at certain knowledge. Much of reasonable human activity has as its basis, rational belief, without worrying about the baggage of rigorous logical deduction for every little matter that may occupy our minds. Thus rational belief for most reasonable people is derived from the weight of circumstantial evidence as they may interpret it. The limitations of the Rusell/Whitehead approach was effectively demonstrated following Russell’s massive work “Principia Mathematica” when Godel published his theorem of “undecidability”. The uncertainties associated with Quantum Mechanics is another example demonstratinig the limits of certain knowledge..","date":"2012-07-24","mins":"6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/23/argumentum-ad-ignorantiam-mea-natibus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Argumentum ad Ignorantiam, mea natibus"},{"id":"comment-14118","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There is certainly a considerable amount of commentary available on the Argument from Ignorance. Wikipedia cites Bertrand Russell’s over simple example that no one has proved that there is not a teapot (American readers may prefer a coffee percolator) orbiting the sun. Therefore the argument from ignorance would say that there is in fact a teapot (coffee percolator) orbiting the sun. However, the problem with this example is that there is no good reason for saying that this phenomenon occurs. To say that the Shroud is authentic because no one has proved that it is not, is I think, an insufficient argument by itself, and another more detailed analysis, or a different approach must be considered. For example it might be argued that our technology is far superior to anything that was available in the fourteenth century, and if a 14th c. Genius was capable of a technology that could create the Shroud, then a modern technologist would also be capable of creating the Shroud. But we know of no technology that could create it; therefore it is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that there was a 14th c genius capable of creating it. Futhermore, unlike the tea (coffee) pot example, there is strong circumstantial evidence why the Shroud may very well be authentic. This will not satisfy the philosophic pedant, who will still say that the case has not been proven, and the reasonable Shroudie would then say PSHAW! to the pedant. He would say that there are many aspects of life that we accept on merely reasonable grounds and circumstantial evidence, and that undue rigour is not required to sustain what is a reasonable belief. In the early 20th century, it was the objective of Russell & Whitehead to derive a rigorous and indisputable logical derivation for all of mathematics. After some 300 pages of arcane Set theory, Russell was able to satisfy himself beyond any shadow of doubt whatever, that indeed he had proved that when one entity was added to one other entity, the answer was indeed two entities. However the Russell/Whitehead project was doomed, and came to an abrupt end when Kurt Godel proved that within any rigorous mathematical system, there would be propositions within that system that could not be proved. The Russell/Whitehead symbolic logic system that they derived is now barely of antiquarian interest. An analogous situation to Godel’s theorem also seems to occur in quantum physics. Thus the philosophic assertion may be made, that unless a fact is observed, then there are no grounds for accepting that fact. It was on some such grounds that Albert Einstein was most uncomfortable with the probabilistic approach that seemed so necessary to the laws of quantum physics. He felt certain that there had to be underlying causative variables. However there are no causative variables, they have never been discovered, and despite the so called fallacy of the “argument from ignorance” it is asserted that they never will be! I personally think that the Deity likes to have his little jokes with his creatures. He seems to have wanted to teach Russell & Whitehead an important lesson in humility, and have said to Einstein, “Don’t tell Me what to do with My dice!”. As far as the Shroud image is concerned, I think He may be saying, “Bet you can’t discover how I did it!”.","date":"2012-07-23","mins":"7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/23/argumentum-ad-ignorantiam-mea-natibus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Argumentum ad Ignorantiam, mea natibus"},{"id":"comment-36881","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I regret that Mr Hamon considers that I have ‘mocked(sic)’ some of his ideas concerning the image formation.

Nevertheless, Urban exercised his prerogative of clemency to Galileo in setting aside the Inquisition’s sentence. Dr Hamon (if that is how he prefers to be so titled) might discover a valuable lesson in Galileo’s failure in human relations. Galileo’s own views on the relationship between scientific research and biblical interpretation have been endorsed by the Vatican since 1893. In 1979 Pope John Paul II reiterated this view and stated that Galileo had suffered injustice at the hands of the church. A statement by the pope before the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1992 is interpreted by some as a rehabilitation of Galileo. Nevertheless, Johannes Kepler was never able to pursuade Galileo that planets moved in elliptical orbits rather than circles, as it seems that Galileo himself still retained some vestige of a Platonic idealism, rather than committing himself to the more accurate mathematical model devised by Kepler.

In a comprehensive standard text by Koontz & O’Donnell “Principles of Management”, as early as p.19, the authors include a section on the Roman Catholic Church when reviewing Early Contributions to Management Principles. “If one is to judge by age, the most efficient formal organisation in the history of Western Civilization has been the Roman Catholic Church.” They continue with comments on appeal of its objectives, effectiveness of its organization, and management techniques, hierarchy of authority, scalar territorial organization, specialization on functional lines, early use of the “staff device” etc, all imitated by by other organizations, but only in latter years.

Predictably, Vatican spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi refused to “run after fantasies and opinions” and warned reporters “Don’t expect comments or rebuttals on what is being said on this issue.” La Republica, (citing the usual source), quoted a man described as “very close” to the authors as saying the information was “all about the breach of the sixth and seventh commandments”.

One can muster several examples where “official statements” of conservative positions once firmly held, have been modified over the course of time. One does not have to go back to the case of Galileo to find such examples. One simple case is in the Church’s attitude to the faithfuls’ study of Holy Scripture. From the various Tridentine anathemas, there was a singular breakthrough in Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical Providentissumus Deus of 1893. Breakthrough though it was, Pope Leo’s encyclical today still looks quaintly cautious. Pius XII’s “Divino Afflante Spiritu” of 1943, addressed to all, gave further impetus to the promotion of Biblical studies. The Vatican II document “Verbum Dei” on divine revelation bears little relationship to the counter reformation Tridentine position. The Pontifical Academy of Biblical Studies comes lately to their subject compared to Teutonic Protestant studies, but very likely have now surpassed them. There has been a similar evolution in doctrine concerning human reproduction from the more recent time.of Pius XII’s “Humani Generis” as recently as 1950. I maintain that the Church’s present position on a solely male priesthood.is more likely based on certain anthropological considerations, than on any theological position, Even today, many traditional patriarchally based societies would find a female priesthood difficult to accept. One partiular difficulty is the tradition of certain pre Christian religions in associating female roles in worship to that of temple prostitution. However that tradition has no palce in cosideration of a proper role in the Christian priesthood. St Paul’s Galations 3:28 makes it clear that there is to be no distinction between male and female, Jew or Gentile, freeman or slave, etc, but all are one in Christ, without distinction. I consider that it will only be a matter of time, and further development of doctrine, before we will eventually see an evolution towards acceptance of a female Roman Catholic priesthood, in those societies where it may be found acceptable..","date":"2012-11-17","mins":"3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion"},{"id":"comment-19180","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Female roles in the temple prostitution of Roman, Greek, Egyptian and other Middle Eastern religious practices, would have been well within the collective memory of the early Christian church, and may well explan why a female priesthood was at that time a non starter.

At the Last Supper He instructs those present to repeat the words over the Bread and Wine as a memorial. The formulae of the words the evangelists put into His mouth very likely come from an early liturgical practice of the first Christians. We do not know who else was or was not present,apart from the apostles. Obviously someone had to set out the table and clean up afterrwards, and we can easily guess what gender they probably were. It is not unreasonable that both Mary his mother, Mary Magdalen, and possibly other women were also present. Being women, the evangelists would see no need to mention them. After the Resurrection and before His Ascension, He bresthes on them so they receive the Holy Spirit and He imparts the power to forgive sins. Again we do not know who was present apart from the Apostles. I suggest that in these cases, the evangelists silence is insufficient to assert that any others were absent. The Apostles’ laying on of hands to effect ordination is recorded in the Acts. The cultural attitude towards women can easily be adduced from a commentary by John Gill in relation to Gal 3:28: “The apostle’s design is to show the common right of believers, of every nation, condition, and sex, and to encourage the Gentiles, and demolish the pride, vanity, and boasting of the Jews, their men especially, who valued themselves upon these “three” very things which the apostle here makes no account of; as that they were Israelites and not Gentiles, freemen and not servants, men and not women; and in their public prayers they give thanks to God in this form,” “blessed be the Lord our God, the King of the world, that he hath made me an Israelite; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a Gentile; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a “servant”; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a “woman”;” instead of which last the woman say: “blessed be the Lord who hath made me as he pleased” Gill’s commentary, illustrates well the cultural attitude of male Jews towards women, and in my view goes a long way to explaining the evangelists’ and others’ silence about their roles in the early church, Jewish Christians in particular. Paul demonstrates a slightly more enlightened attitude. I maintain that these are an inadequate reason for the Church in the 21st century to maintain a similar attitude.

You need to appreciate that doctrine can evolve away from existing positions, even though strongly held at a particular time. I have given an example above on the question of the faithfuls’ reading of the scripture, which at one time was almost sanctioned by penalty. You should read the anathemas from the Council of Trent, to appreciate the changes that have occurred since those times.

The Tawa Union parish (Presbyterian, Church of Christ etc) has a lady pastor, who is also effective. As for disenchanted Anglicans joining the Catholic Church, all that will do is make it even more conservative than it is already! Deaconesses were appointed in the early Christian Church, check the Acts of the Apostles, and despite what St Paul has to say about preferring women to be silent in Church, women were still prominent in his ministry. Mary Magdalen was very likely a prominent missionary in the early church, but the cultural milieu of the time was reluctant to acknowledge it, to the point of suppressing it. As for whomever Jesus may or may not have ordained, we are not told in the gospels. Doubtless He may well have had to take into account the dominantly male culture of the time and place.

Motion won required two thirds majority in two groups – Bishops and House of Clergy – but failed by six votes among laity. Proposition cannot be considered again until 2015. Not only have women been bishops in Canada and elsewhere since 1993, but there have also been two women Anglican bishops in NZ, my earlier posting noted above. Concerning apostolic succession debate above (Dan & Andy). The Anglican Church traces its succession of the Archbisop of Canterbury back to its first bishop, St Augustine of Canterbury. The Anglican Church in its history, has faced many conflicts between the Archbishop and Monarch in its history, including for example Thomas a Becket, and even Cardinal Wolsely vs Henry VIII. – there have been others. The last mentioned when Henry set himself as the Head of the Church in England resulted in a break with Rome. Following the Oxford movement in the 19th century, an attempt was made at rapprochement, when the validity of Anglican orders was examined in Rome. The decision given by Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical Apostolicae Curae, was that during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and afterwards, there was a clear decision not to ordain priests for the purposes of consecrating the eucharist as practised in both the Roman and Eastern Orthodox churches. It was considered that this constituted a break in the apostolic succession. Very many examples could be given of the hunting down and execution of Roman Catholic priests, who deigned to celebrate Mass in various houses of the aristocracy many of whom still clung to the old religion. By the time the Anglican Church resumed an acceptable FORM of the eucharist, it was considered that there were then no longer any validly consecrated Anglican bishops who had apostolic powers to ordain. The situation has since been further complicated by a number of Anglican bishops being consecrated by validly ordained Orthodox bishops as part of the consecrating group. The situation is therefore very much more complicated than Andy Weiss has asserted. We can all hope and pray that there may come a time when both the Roman and Anglican churches may once again be in communion. I note from the Globe & Mail posting mentioned above, that there are 3500 women Anglican priests worldwide. Concerning Andy’s assertion that the arguments for women priests are entirely secular, I consider that the biblical text of Galatians 3:28 is a persuasive scriptural argument otherwise. The tradition of a male priesthood I continue to maintain is based more on anthropogy that theology. The argument that Christ was a male, is a specious argument at best. A similar aversion to women in all sorts of professions has been tradition in many male bastions, even mathematics. One should read up on the histories of Hypatia, and Sophie Germaine to see the true source of male objections to women in such occupations. Emmy Noether in the 1930s was considered by Albert Einstein to be the most significant mathematician since Isaac Newton.

Henry himself preferred to maintain the English Church as Catholic rather than Protestant. Edward VI succeeded Henry in 1547 but died in 1553. The accession of Mary (C of Aragon’s daughter) resulted in a Catholic reaction against Cromwell, and he was eventually stripped of his ecclesiastical titles and executed for heresy. Mary’s strenuous attempts to restore the Catholicism of the English Church together with Cardinal Pole, was short lived with the accession of Elizabeth, The Church under Elizabeth went down the Protestant road, as originally envisaged by Cranmer. It was this Protestantising of the English Church which resulted in Pope Leo XIII’s finding that Anglican orders were invalid.

(1) It is the current teaching of the magisterium! Response: For the time being that is the discipline of the church, and needs be observed. Ordination of women is not to considered a valid option in the present church today. However it has not been taught as an infallible doctrine of revelation and has not been issued as an “ex cathedra” doctrine. Therefore, although it requires external observancy, I maintain that the issue may be intelligently debated, without necessarily falling into error. It is not on the same level as for example questioning the divinity of Christ, which necessarily requires an internal assent to remain within the church. (2) It is the tradition of the church that only men may be ordained, and therefore can never become a valid option! Response: Not all traditions of the church are immutable. I maintain that this tradition is based on a human cultural tradition that subordinated women to men, as an anthropological phenomenon, and that the tradition has no sound basis in theology. Therefore this tradition may not be immutable. (3) Christ chose the option to become a male human, and therefore only male priests can be true representatives of Christ in their priestly ministry. Response: In order to become fully human, the Son of God had to choose to become either male or female. He might have chosen to become androidal or hermaphrodite, but then it would be argued that he would not be fully human, and that would be in error. The cultural environment of 1st century Palestine demanded that he become male. A woman in 1st century Palesine would be incapable of being any kind of religius leader, let alone even a rabbi. St Paul’s teaching in Gal 3:28, shows that all are to be admitted to the life in Christ, that there is no more “male nor female”. Here he is teaching theology. Paul’s teaching concerning other female roles, his preference that they be silent in the assembly, that their heads be covered, are in the nature of discipline and are not of a theological nature. (4) Christ never ordained women as part of his commissioning! Response: The gospels, written by men, record that Jesus called men to become his disciples. Nevertheless, his attitude towards women was revolutionary in the extreme. He debates with the Samaritan woman at the well, unheard of! He defends the woman taken in adultery, discerns the men’s holtile motives, and prevents her being stoned, unheard of! He allows a highly suspect woman to anoint his feet, over the Pharisees’ objections, unhear of!. He commissions those at the Last Supper to observe his actions over the bread and wine as a memorial. It is quite likely that women were also present, very likely in a subservient role as befitted their station in that cultural environment. There were women at the foot of the cross after all the men had fled, with the sole exception of the disciple whom Jesus loved. After his resurrection he imparts the power to forgive sins. The gospels are silent on whether women were so commissioned or not, but if they were it is unlikely that the evangelists would make a point of saying so. Women are present in the upper room when he presents himself as resurrected, and also when the Holy Spirit descends on those present at Pentecost. He commsissions all to go forth and teach all nations his commandments. (He never said, “But don’t ordain any women!”) It is Mary of Magdalen whom He first reveals himself as surviving the grave. (5) John Bourgeous was disciplined for simulating the ordination of a woman, and this demonstrates the teaching of the church that women may not be ordained! Response: I have discussed this at some length above. Bourgeous was quite properly disciplined for this act of defiance against his superiors. It still does not follow that this teaching is immutable. Conclusion: I await with some expectation that some other sound theological reason might be discovered, for prohibiting the ordination of women.

They may be related to a misreading of some ancient medieval texts, mentioned by Jack Markwardt, ‘A sixth century entry in the Liber Pontificalis records that Pope Eleutherius, whose papacy extended from approximately 174 to 189, “received a letter from British King Lucius [Britannio rege Lucio] asking that he might be made a Christian through his agency.” ‘ Venerable Bede in 731 AD repeats this. Markwardt quotes Adolph Harnack 1904 that the misreading should be: “… that the Liber Pontificalis entry had been intended to reference not Britain, but, rather the Britio Edessenorum, Edessa’s citadel, and not King Lucius, but King Lucius Ælius Septimius Megas Abgarus VIII of Edessa, otherwise known as Abgar the Great” The Burgh Island posting above includes the comment: “Indiana Jones meets Dan Brown”, which is probably not far off the mark!.","date":"2012-10-18","mins":"6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/18/burgh-island-in-devon-key-to-world-piece-and-the-mystery-of-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Burgh Island in Devon: Key to World Peace and the Mystery of the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-27013","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I have some reservations on how validly representative of American opinion the poll might be, as little information on the sampling method followed is given in the report.

His five fold tiling is a favourite among recreational mathematicians; subsequently the tiling, which does not yield a repeating pattern was discovered in certain crystals. The Wikipedia article on him is comprehensive, and includes criticisms of his views on the relationship between quantum theory and consciousness. Interestingly, considering these views, he has described hmself as an atheist and he is an ardent supporter of the Humanist Association. Contrariwise, he has also been awarded an honorary doctorate from a Belgium Catholic university. He has also claimed to have evidence of a pre existing universe before the Big Bang. I think there may well be philsophical and possibly scientific problems in associating consciousness with a scientific approach, even at the quantum level. During life, animal consciousness appears to have an organising principle in the brain. When the brain deteriorates after death, this organising principle no longer survives. Theologians have traditionally adopted a “spirit based” approach to deal with this problem. In quantum theory, it seems that the various fields are always associated with particles, hence the Higg’s boson to explain the gravitational field. Are we to assert the existence of a field of consciousness? However, if a scientific approach is to be taken, this would seem to require the existence of a conciouness particle. But wherein are such particles organised? Or am I to consider the concept of parallel universes, whereby consciousness.particles, possibly undetectable, can cross the boundaries between such universes?

It has certain definite physical characteristics. The invention of lasers producing high intensity coherent light (light waves in phase) enabled Michigan researchers Leith and Upatnieks to apply the continous wave laser to holography. We need I think to distinguish this purely physical optical phenomenon, from the metaphorical use of the word light, when we come to consider the “mystery of consciousness”, or such phrases as “Truth is Light”, “I am the Light of the World” and so on. In these latter phrases, I suggest we are NOT referring to a literally physical aspect of light, but we are drawing on the mental imagery which our human experience of the physical properties of light can conjure up for us. Thus an object remains visibly concealed from us until it is able to reflect the physical light that falls on it, when it then becomes manifest. Whereas when we say that “Jesus is the Light of the world”, or even a human response such as “Suddenly light dawns” we are saying that these are ways of expressing a sudden insight of human understanding of something previously not understood. The distinction between the actual physical phenomenon, and our metaphorical use of the phenomenon is important, so that we can be quite clear as to what it is we are talking about. Clearly the mystics, and I would include Teihard among them, frequently draw on such metaphorical uses of physical phenomena, and while this may aid our understanding and uplift our vision, paradoxically it can also render their intent obscure and confusing, if they are interpreted in too literal a way. To say that consciousness is a type of hologram, I would prefer to say is best understood in this metaphorical sense. I doubt if it should be interpreted literally as a hologram. The advantage of saying that it is a metaphor, is that it provides us with a mental model as to what consciouness might be like, but not that it is to be thought of as a literally physical hologram. Distinctions are important I think. Teilhard was frequently accused of being a pantheist, but unjustly so. But there is clearly a trap there for those engaged in exploring the mystical, of those things which our present understanding constrains us from as yet fully comprehending. To see consciousness as an integral part of the universe, also runs the risk of pantheism.

Your mention of Adam & Eve. And also Joshua & Jericho: The literal interpretation of Scripture, while it may be promoted by certain fundamentalist sects, is certainly not the Catholic position. Nevertheless there is a truth in all of scripture, which needs to be discerned and not just be taken at face value. Like all good literature, the books of the B Ible can operate at several levels. Sometime during the last year, I was privileged to hear an excellent homily from a particularly gifted preacher who we are blessed in having in our local parish. He presented the story of Adam & Eve, the garden and the snake in a way that all our sophisticated congregation could relate to. “We have all been there.” He made the story perennial, current and relevant, He was able to extract the Truth and meaning of the story, in a way that no biblical literalist ever could. This is the real value of such stories, but it requires a special insight and understanding to be able to do this. Incidently, I understand that some paleontologists have been able to trace all of humanity to a single female source through mitochondrial DNA, and I think a particular fossil they found was nick named ‘Eve’ as a result. You can probably find this on the web. One message here I think is that it underlines the universality of the human family, the brotherhood (or sisterhood) of our species. Perhaps this is one message of the Genesis story. The flood stories that the Jewish exiles discovered in Babylon permeate much of the ancient Middle East. Such stories can be found whereever large rivers occasionally caused devastation in those civilisations. There are no such stories in Egypt where flooding of the Nile is predictable, benign and beneficial. One example is that of Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh, as the hero sets out on his quest for immortality. The Jewish writers took this story, and many parallels can be found, such as building the ark, sending out ravens and so forth, and gave it a new religious meaning, which we read in the story of Noah. The fundamentalists are still looking for the remains of the ark on Mt Ararat, but they will never find it, as they have missed the point of the story. For me, Teilhard was a true pioneer in his attempts to find a synthesis of science and religion, but llike all true prophets he was too far ahead of his time, and the church authorities were not ready for him. He continues to be denigrated by conservative elements, as like many such with feet in two disparate disciplines, he was not received by either scientists or theologians. His Jesuit superiors forbade him to publish during his life time, and most of his published work is posthumous. I made the comment above that accusations of pantheism against him were in fact unjust. Consequently your own comment above that Pope Benedict has expressed admiration for his work is refreshing, and hopefully a breakthrough in appreciating Teilhard’s particular insights..","date":"2012-08-23","mins":"8:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/22/can-our-consciousness-operate-independent-of-time-and-space/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Can our consciousness operate independent of time and space?"},{"id":"comment-199295","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"As an avowed authenticist, I have noticed that the trolls and blather on this site are not merely confined to the skeptic lobby.

He chose his regnal name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi. He is the first Pope born in the Americas. A comprehensive background of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge Bergoglio He is one of five children of an Italian railway worker. After studying at the seminary in Villa Devoto, he entered the Society of Jesus on March 11, 1958. Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio Máximo San José in San Miguel, and then taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada in Santa Fe, and the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires. He was ordained to the priesthood on December 13, 1969, by Archbishop Ramón José Castellano. He attended the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel, a seminary in San Miguel. Bergoglio attained the position of novice master there and became professor of theology. Impressed with his leadership skills, the Society of Jesus promoted Bergoglio and he served as provincial for Argentina from 1973 to 1979. He was transferred in 1980 to become the rector of the seminary in San Miguel where he had studied. He served in that capacity until 1986. He completed his doctoral dissertation in Germany and returned to his homeland to serve as confessor and spiritual director in Córdoba. As Cardinal, Bergoglio became known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle has contributed to his reputation for humility. He lives in a small apartment, rather than in the palatial bishop’s residence. He gave up his chauffeured limousine in favor of public transportation, and he reportedly cooks his own meals. Upon the death of Pope John Paul II, Bergoglio, considered papabile himself, participated in the 2005 papal conclave as a cardinal elector, the conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. A widespread theory says that he was in a close race with Ratzinger until he emotionally asked that the cardinals not vote for him.[3] Earlier, he had participated in the funeral of Pope John Paul II and acted as a regent alongside the College of Cardinals, governing the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church during the interregnum sede vacante period. In New Zealand, the run up to the announcement of the conclave’s decision, Breakfast News interspersed its interviews with news rep Garth Bray at St Peter’s Square with reports that the NZ Parliament had just passed its second reading of the Same Sex Marriage Bill by 77 votes to 44. During the committee hearings several submissions were rejected and not heard as they were deemed to be too offensive to be seen by Parliament. This included submissions by the ultra conservative Catholic Action group. Clearly there were better ways to be effective in opposing the Bill than the Catholic Action group were able to find. What has mystified me since the new Pope Francis was announced, is how I seemed to know his name about an hour beforehand. As I was preparing the morning cereals and wifely cup of tea, I was pondering what the new Pope might be called. I had rejected the names Pius, John, Paul and Benedict. It occurred to me that he might choose Francis in view of the wold’s ecological crisis, and it seemed to be a natural choice. How did I know this?

The right wing deputies wanted to hear Pope Francis’ first speech, while the left wing deputies wanted to proceed with the set agenda item of honouring deceased President Chavez. The Left being in the majority got their way. Cardinal Bergoglio seems to come with some right wing baggage arising from the crimes of the 1970 76 military junta when the church was widely seen as siding with the regime. Progressive liberation priests disappeared, many being murdered. Cardinal Bergoglio somehow survived, despite his advocacy of the poor. He denies the various allegations made against him during these dark days. Concerning the scuffle in the National Congress, the “Atlantic Wire” commented: “Argentina’s Congress got in a fight over a guy that once sympathized with an authoritarian regime in order to hold a ceremony for another guy who was in charge of an authoritarian regime? Latin America is weird, sometimes.” Corruption and self interested manipulation of the system also seems endemic to Argentina. Both the Peronistas and subsequently the Kirchners came to power on a mandate of helping the poor. Both have faced charges of corruption and feathering their own nests. What with his wily Jesuit background and his familiarity with the worst aspects of his homeland, one could hope that Pope Francis might well be more than a match for the schemers and corruption in the Vatican, and be able to sort out the banking scandals and other abuses. Reports suggest that he is not a familiar figure in Rome, and clearly he will need some inside help to get to the bottom of these matters. Globally, Catholic Bishops have sometimes expressed their frustration at their views being ignored because of the power wielded by the Curia establishment. Time will tell whether their concerns can be better addressed than seems to be the case in the recent past. Will there be a Vatican Council III? Who knows? That is what is probably needed. One might hope that a papal chemical engineer might be roused to some interest in initiating further investigations into the Shroud of Turin. The young Jorge Bergoglio entered the seminary at age 22, and perhaps any chemistry he once knew has long been forgotten.

From the evidence of the witnesses, it is clear that they perceived it both as something physical, and yet mysterious, with properties that went beyond the merely physical as we know it. To refer to it as a “spiritual body” seems to me a contradiction in terms. A pure spirit does not have a body, nor is a body pure spirit. It is christian doctrine that Christ’s body was resurrected, and we are to understand this as having some physical meaning, not merely a resurrection in the spirit. If we are to look for an analogy, then I prefer one that sees our own familiar universe as a sub set of a higher universe. Thus an ant on a table top may see his own universe as merely two dimensional with no up nor down. However from our own three dimensional universe we may observe the ant and perceive that it does actually exist in a three dimensional universe. I think perhaps that the resurrection was something like that. Christ was able to alight onto the table top of our own three dimensional universe from his multi dimensional higher universe. The question of passing through walls and closed doors does not enter into the equation. And I don’t see that this concept involves the creation of any kind of new physics, but is merely a broadening of our perspective. But it is only an analogy, hopefully more helpful than passing through walls.

One of the semantic problems is that the term “spirit” in most languages seem to have several different meanings. Essentially there seem to be two approaches, a) metaphysical, b) theological. Significant metaphysical contributors include Leibnitz, Hegel and Berkeley, and it is necessary to read what they have to say about the subject to arrive at any conclusions, if that is at all possible. On the theological aspects of the problem, my preference is for a Thomistic approach. However several of the early fathers of the church have also written about the subject and some of them have asserted that the angels are not immaterial beings.

It is evident that Leibnitz, Berkeley and Hegel had much to say on the concept of spirit, but there are several others, both ancient and modern.as a Google search on “notions of spirit” easily demonstrates. Recently my local U3 A group ran a series of discussions on Evolution covering a lot of similar ground. The later works of Darwin seem to see the development of morality and religion as part of the evolutionary process, and seems to have an essentially materialist bias. It culminates in the work of Richard Dawkins. As with any group of people discussing the topic, it proved to be contentious and of course resulting in no real consensus. People will believe what they choose to believe. I think there is much of informative value in what the evolutionists can tell us. My personal belief is that it demonstrates God’s plan of revelation to us. But to ignore the contribution that religion has made to the development of civillisation in the course of its history is a gross error of judgement.

They rapidly assume a fixed form to the extent that any deviations from the accepted format can be deemed to be an incompetence.

It also occurs in African primal societies. 2) These oral traditions were used in different ways by the individual evangelists. Thus both Matthew and Luke, as well as using Mark, have access to another source common to them. Also Matthew and Luke each have access to a third and fourth source but which are not used by the other. John’s gospel is to a large extent independent, but like Matthew and Luke also uses much of Mark’s Passion narrative. They were also written at a time when there would have been witnesses still living. The essential point is that in spite of whatever individual differences in use of source material occur, or their approach and style, all four gospels are fundamentally corroborative, 3. The conversion of Paul occurs well after the events of Jesus’ earthly life at a time when the followers were being persecuted. In fact we are told that he supervised the stoning of Stephen. He is not concerned with narrating the events of Christ’s death nor of his resurrection, but seeks to interpret them in his own particular way. He is not a witness to the actual resurrection event as reported in the gospels, but a witness to the resurrected Christ as manifest to himself in his own particular conversion at a much later date. 4. Paul’s conversion is in fact narrated in Acts by the same author as the third gospel, Luke. In fact Luke reports Paul’s conversion at three separate places: Acts 9:1 9; Acts 22:3 16; and Acts 22:2 16, with some differences in detail owing to the use of different sources. 5. Paul’s own letters, although set down in writing at an earlier time than the gospels, report his own experience of Christ resurrected as the personal manifestation to himself. There seems to be no specific evidence that he was familiar with Christ’s earthly mission or had even encountered him.

It is now generally considered pseudonymous, and almost certainly non Pauline. It is absent in some of the early canons, but was eventually included for its pastoral content. It is hardly surprising that it might cite a passage or so from a gospel account. With the early expectation of the Parousia there would seem little point in committing the events of Jesus’ life to writing. Because this expectation went unfulfilled, the decision would then have been made to commit the oral traditions received into the written form of the gospels. That they originated from a set of various oral traditions is evident from their pericope format, a set of structured brief episodes likely recited during communal worship, now gathered together into a coherent narrative. 2) My point was that there was little if any evidence to demonstrate that Paul had any personal acquaintance with the earthly mission of Jesus, whereas the gospels are primarily concerned with setting down this narrative. His encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus occurs well after the events of the gospels.

Because, IMO, broken legs would hasten death but not immediately cause it. Unable to lift themselves up by their feet to counter their body weight, asphyxiation would indeed result in one final display of cruelty.” See separate thread Stephen Jones’ on Zugibe vs Barbet. Barbet’s theory was that that the crucifarius had to exercise a see saw motion transferring weight between arms and legs to maintain breathing; this could not be sustained indefinitely and the usual cause of death was therefore asphyxiation. Zugibe claimed that the weight could be taken on the legs and that breathing was therefore not a problem, cause of death being shock. By breaking the legs, death would be by asphyxiation regardless. Gospel accounts claim that the soldiers broke the legs of the other two because of the forthcoming sabbath. J P Meier claims that John’s gospel is the more accurate, the Friday being Preparation day for Passover, the year probably being 30 AD. Exposing crucified bodies when Passover occurred on the sabbath was particularly objectionable. When they came to Jesus, he was already dead so they followed the legal requirement of percussio, piercing the heart, enabling the body to be released to the family. From reading Barbet, I get the impression that it was not unusual for the bodies to be exposed for perhaps several weeks, suggesting that the sabbath was not usually a consideration, unless some Roman concession recognising local Jewish sensibilities perhaps made it an exception..","date":"2013-12-21","mins":"4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/20/christmas-card/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Christmas Card"},{"id":"comment-214831","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Response to Sampath: The book, “Acts of the Apostles” is presented at its outset as a continuation of Luke’s gospel. Both are addressed to one Theophilus, who may be some official, a real person, or it may just be a literary device, similar to that used by some other Greek authors. “Theo philus” could be translated as “Lover of God”, that is it may be intended for a general reader who wishes to know more about God. Perhaps 50% of Mark’s gospel is used by Luke (In Matthew it is about 90%). Like Matthew, Luke also uses Q. However there is also material unique to Luke (L). This includes the “old age” birth story of John the Baptist, Luke’s Infancy narrative, and several parables (e.g. Good Samaritan, Prodigal Son). All the material about John the Baptist is deliberately placed before that of Jesus. Luke tends to humanise the portrait of Jesus compared to the starker picture presented by Mark and Matthew, there is a concern for piety and prayer, it comes from the Septuagint tradition, and there is compassion for the poor and despised. However there also seems to be some ignorance concerning certain Jewish customs and Jewish geography. (Luke does not appreciate that it is impossible to have a solar eclipse during Passover.) From about Ch 13 of Acts dealing with Paul’s mission to the Gentiles, the author adopts the pronoun “We” as if he is a companion on Paul’s journeys. This may be the case, or it may be a literary device to establish the authority of his text with Paul as his guarantor. Several differences from Paul’s own accounts and his pattern of thought have seemed difficult to reconcile the author of Acts as a close companion of Paul. So he may be working from sources other than his own experience. The three accounts in Acts of Paul’s conversion pose no difficulty in reconciliation. In Acts 9:1 9 the conversion is part of the narrative; In Acts 22:3 16, the conversion is presented as Paul recounting his experience to appease the rioting Jews seeking to kill him; In Acts 26:2 18 it is presented as his own account before King Agrippa and the governor Festus before Paul’s departure for Rome. The differences are in only minor matters of detail. If you are look for a good annotated on line Bible text, then I recommend the USCCB version which I often use myself when on line.

Only c. 31 verses of Mark are found nowhere in Matthew or Luke. In the material common to all three Synoptics, there is very seldom verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke against Mark, though such agreement is common between Matthew and Mark or Luke and Mark or where all three concur. 2) The postulated common saying source of Matthew and Luke, Q, would account for much verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke when they include sayings absent from Mark. The fact that the sayings are used in different ways or different contexts in Matthew and Luke is an indication of a somewhat free way in which the editors could take material and mold it to their given situations and needs. 3) The placement of Q material in Luke and Matthew disagrees at certain points according to the needs and theologies of the addressees of the gospels, but in Matthew the Marcan chronology is the basic scheme into which Q is put. Mark’s order is kept, on the whole, by Matthew and Luke, but, where it differs, at least one agrees with Mark. After chapter 4 in Matthew and Luke, not a single passage from Q is in the same place. Q was a source written in Greek as was Mark, which can be demonstrated by word agreement (not possible, for example, with a translation from Aramaic, although perhaps the Greek has vestiges of Semitic structure form). It is therefore a reasonable conclusion that both Matthew and Luke had access to Mark’s gospel, but there has to be an explanation as to why there is common material in Matthew and Luke not present in Mark. Augustine’s speculation that Mark was an abbreviation of Matthew does not stand up to scrutiny in terms of modern scholarship. Nevertheless the theory does re emerge from time to time and has done so recently, but it remains a minority view. Note that there is more agreement between Mark Matthew and Mark Luke than there is between all three. This points to Mark as being a source used by both Matthew and Luke. We then need an explanation as to a separate common Matthew Luke source for material not found in Mark. The Q source theory satisfies this requirement. There is much that continues to be debated, such as whether there was a type of original Aramaic version of a Proto Matthew now lost, which Mark may have used, but these debates are of more interest to specialists in exegesis, and being speculative I think are of lesser general interest..","date":"2015-11-20","mins":"3:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-214799","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Rick, this is precisely the problem I see with the concept of a “spiritual body”.

The notion of an after life and a general resurrection was a very late development in Jewish thought. (It can certainly be found in Maccabees) In the New Testament the specific word “Paradise” (of Persian origin) only occurs three times: Luke 23:43, II Cor 12:4, Rev 2:7. Certainly the Sadducees, the Jewish priests, rejected the notion of a general resurrection, even in NT times. However the Septuagint LXX, which was the common Bible in those days uses the word “Paradise” some 46 times, but uses it in a variety of ways. This was the Greek Bible which was translated in Alexandria in the 3rd c BC, originally to serve the requirements of Greek speaking Jews, and partly for the requirements of the Great Library of Ptolemy II in Alexandria. LXX comprised the Jewish Bible and several other works, the so called Apocrypha, or deutero canonical works. It is frequently quoted in the NT. Its general use by the early Christians to make their case, resulted in the Jews rejecting it ~100 AD, and reverting to the original Jewish texts only. Despite its use by the Catholic Church for 15 centuries, mainly as the Latin Vulgate, (also the Greek Orthodox) the Protestant reformers also decided to reject it, although not without some internal controversy. The idea of an afer life is clearly an early Christian teaching found in the New Testament, in the gospels and epistles, and finally as the New Jerusalem of Revelations. A memorable saying of Jesus to the Sadducees found in John’s gospel is “Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad” (I paraphrase from memory). Because it is in John, some liberals such as the ‘Jesus Seminar’ tend to reject this as a reliable saying of Jesus. We also have the words from the cross to the ‘good’ thief, “Amen, this day you will be with me in paradise.” So it all depends what sources you’re prepared to use, but it is clearly an orthodox teaching, found in the practice of canonising as saints those whose lives have been exceptional. Interestingly, I searched in the index of my 380 page “Source Book of the Bible for Teachers”, published as long ago as 1970, but there was nothing listed under ‘paradise’ or ‘after life’ and the only reference to ‘resurrection’ was confined to that of Jesus.

My own religious view is that God chooses his own methods of revelation of His Truth to humanity, Clearly the Alexandrian Jews came to believe in an after life which went well beyond the traditional Jewish idea of Sheol as the the abode of the dead.

The full title of Ifrah’s Ch 29 is actually ‘The Origin of Hindu Arabic Numerals’. It was the Hindus who invented our modern denary counting system, and it included a place holder zero. The only precedent for it is the ancient Babylonian base 60 system which only survived in astronomy and mathematics. No other civilisation ever came close to any similar system. The Indian system migrated extensively into South East Asia, but the symbols were modified and adapted to suit local writing materials and styles. The Arabs adapted the system, and two separate sets of symbols developed one eastward and the other westward. The actual symbol used for the Cheddai date 346 (=AD 595) in the copper plate deed appears as three near horizontal scribed strokes with a vertical stroke down the middle. The 3 symbol used in numbering the verses in the AD 875 poem is actually very close to our modern 3 with a small tail. Ifrah has several tabulations of the symbols used at various times, and there is quite some variation, some of them particularly stylised. The first appearance in the West occurs in a Visigoth manuscript ‘Codex Vigilianus’ of AD 876 where the 3 appears more as a stylised z with a reversed tail.

In the 12th century, Adelard of Bath translated several Arabic mathematical works and the apices method was discontinued.

Both Chevalier and Rev Herbert Thurston fell back on their version of the D’Arcis memorandum to discredit it. The two reverend gentlemen appear to have entered an unholy conspiracy to discredit the Shroud, not by an objective scholarly representation of the D’Arcis memorandum, but by deliberately and fraudulently misrepresenting it by twisting facts, and the deliberate omission of material, and hence concealing their lie, Regular bloggers will be aware of a common public misperception that the D’Arcis memorandum discredits the Shroud, apparently in an authoritative way, as being a man made object from the 13th – 14th centuries. This misrepresentation is solely due to the work of Chevalier and Thurston. The case against them is clearly set out in a paper: “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD”; By Jack Markwardt, 2001.

Thanks to Yannink for initiating.this blog, and detailed exposition of Roger’s work. Several commentators including Colin and Gabriel make I think some valid points. Like Colin I have some problems with the gas diffusion model, mainly because of the high resolution of the image, its lack of directionality, and the 3 D encoding. I feel there has to be some other process involved, more instantaneous than any diffusion process would allow, although diffusion of the gases may have been some kind of preliminary necessary for the action of image formation. I’ve previously mentioned Giovanna’s de Liso’s work on seismic image formation, “Shroud like image formation during seismic activitiy”; Giavanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010″ at http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/De Liso Web.pdf. I thought her paper showed some fairly persuasive looking images However so far I’ve been unable to find any enlightening commentary on her work. I did not obtain a reply after sending an Email to her, asking her for any current comment. The sharpness of the image seems to me to require some kind of light or other radiation, or a contact process. I feel I may be coming to the point where I may have to concede that the image formation has to be some kind of supernatural event. I consider that so far the explanations that have been attempted fail to explain the unique qualities of the Shroud image, and we are all like the blind men of Gotham floundering around trying to describe a phenomenon we can’t begin to conceive.

The cloth’s early historical anonymity could be simply explained if, during that period, it was not known to exhibit an image. Although Wilson noted that botany specimens could develop, in seventyplus years, into “strikingly precise images in a sepia color closely akin to that of the Shroud”, he discounted all image formation processes that could not have been completed within the thirty six hour entombment of Christ’s body. Wilson, The Shroud of Turin, p. 247. In 1981, S. F. Pellicori produced an image on linen sensitized by contact with a body covered in myrrh, olive oil, and skin secretions and theorized that the sindonic image had developed over a period of decades or centuries.

In 1993, Dr. Leoncia Garza Valdes suggested that bacteria had not only invalidated the results of the Shroud’s carbon dating, but had also formed the sindonic image over the course of a century. Garza Valdes, pp. 56 57. Were an image not readily observable after the Resurrection, the Shroud’s earliest custodians may well have believed it to be only a blood stained burial cloth, folded it, and hidden it away with other Passion relics, the image thereby being permitted to develop unperceived until the cloth was extracted from concealment.” More speculation – We don’t know!.","date":"2012-06-17","mins":"8:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"id":"comment-12666","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"That seems like a fair comment, Colin.

Other religions have other origins: They may include the deep thinking and reflections of their wise men, myths and legends from the mists of times long past, the human aspiration for a share of the divine, the struggle of a people for a defining identity, an awareness of a spiritual reality, or claims of a divine revelation. Yet others have less to recommend them, based on superstition or originating from an ambition to impose the secular power of an elite, the demands of submisssion or a rebellious spirit against long held traditions. Christianity may also share in some of these other features. However, for me, the importance of the Shroud, assuming its authenticity, is that it is a tangible witness to the reality of this historicism. Others may interpret its significance how they will.

Quite a good source to read is “The Quest For The True Cross”: Carsten Peter Thiede and Matthew D’Ancona; Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2000, though now a little dated. At the time of publishing, the University of Arizona had yet to do its carbon dating of the titulus in 2002. You can of course Google to Wikipedia on “Titulus Crucis” for a summary. Santa Croce in Gerusalemme was built by St Helena on the site of her former palace in 325 AD, and after scavenging the Holy Land for relics of Christ’s Passion and Crucifixion, she relocated several of them here, although she distributed some to other locations as well. Many of the original authentic relics definitely existed. At the time of Egeria’s visit the “title” was shown as one of the relics at Jerusalem in 383: “A silver gilt casket is brought in which is the holy wood of the Cross. The casket is opened and (the wood) is taken out, and both the wood of the Cross and the title are placed upon the table.” Fragments of the True Cross were dispersed throughout Christendom, the main portion of the Vera Crux was held in the custody of the Bishop of Jerusalem whence it was captured and recaptured. Eventually the Crusader kings took up the practice of carrying it into battle as a talismanic weapon. It finally disappeared in 1187 on the field of Hattin in Galilee in the Frankish battle with the sultan Saladin. It was last seen tied to the tail of Saladin’s horse as he dragged it through the streets of Damascus as a trophy of his triumph. In view of the imperial court’s seizure of all these relics, as part of an exercise in enhancing its own authority and reputation, it is hardly surprising that such a relic as the Shroud, in whatever form it may then have been kept, remained hidden from them. This acquisitive imperial streak of course continued with the Byzantine general John Curcuas, when he took under threat of force, the Image of Edessa, whatever that may have been. The original Titulus Crucis was hidden around 452 during an attack on Rome by Visigoths and forgotten until 1492, when it was said to have been rediscovered by workmen restoring a mosaic, and was found behind a brick inscribed with “Titulus Crucis”. In view of these dates, it is curious that the Arizona carbon dating asserted that the present artifact was made between 980 AD and 1146 AD. If the dating is correct, the only explanation must be that it was intended as a replica of the original, but then why wait until 1492 to announce its rediscovery? Possibly it was some kind of closely guarded secret know only to a select few sacristans?? Despite the Arizona dating, D’Ancona and Thiede seem to make a very plausible case for the relic, and if it is indeed a replica, then very likely it is a close imitation of the original. I would guess that the flagrum viewed by Sprott during his visit, is very likely some artifact recovered during an archaeological dig, possibly at Herculaneum (buried at the same time as Pompeii), or else is a reconstruction from Paul Vignon’s analysis of the scourge marks on the Shroud image..","date":"2012-07-26","mins":"7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/26/god-only-knows-if-these-relics-are-truly-what-they-claim-to-be/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"God only knows if these relics are truly what they claim to be"},{"id":"comment-32662","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Science can only ever be a crutch of support.

Not only may they be a divine revelation, but their purpose is a private communication, so that there have to be elements reflecting the psychology and understanding of the recipient, for the revelation to be effective. Thus if Hagin believed that Jesus was nailed through his palms, even with three sided nails, then that is what he might very well see, and that would not necessarily nullify the vision. The test of the vision would be how effective Hagin was in his ministry to the sick. “By their fruits shall you know them!” A similar situation applies in the case of stigmatists. It seems that it is usual for genuine stigmatists to receive the imprints of Christ’s wounds, on their bodies corresponding to where they believe they occurred. We can blame St Jerome for the tranlation of “cheir..” as “manus” rather than “carpus”. Precisely the same noun “cheir..” is used in Peter’s release from prison, Acts 12:7. Jerome also tranlates this as “manus”, so that most English tranlations have “And the chains fell from his hands”. Whereas a moment’s reflection would conclude that in fact the chains would have been around his wrists. This is acknowledged in a number of modern translations, including the US Conference of Catholic Bishops translation.

Ian Wilson first mentions this work in his 1978 book at Chapter XXII. Doubtless there are now more detailed and better write ups available on this work, probably on the Shroud.com site. Jackson and Jumper recruited another Air Force colleague who seemed to match the TSM’s physique and draped a cloth over the subject. They measured the body cloth distance and correlated their results with readings from a densitometer on a Shroud negative, obtaining a perfect match. Their further investigations with the VP 8 image analyzer followed, leading to the various 3 D images so familiar to us now. How objective generalized scientific conclusions resulting from.that work may be written up is a matter of skill in accurate report writing. I’ll confine my conclusions merely to saying that the Shroud clearly contains 3 D encoding of the subject, a property first noticed by Paul Vignon following the development of Secondo Pia’s photographic negatives.

In Dan’s subsequent posting on this topic, Gabriel hints that there must be implications about the image forming process. One might hypothesize for instance that if it has a chemical basis, then perhaps the gas(?) molecules emitted by the body are inherently unstable, and in the finite time that they take to arrive at the cloth are partly converted to a stable form, resulting in different concentrations at the cloth, giving the correlation between luminance (conversely opacity) and cloth body distance.

In Matthew 28, there is an earthquake and one angel gives the three women the message, and then in Mt 28:9 10, Jesus comes to meet them. In Luke 24, however there are two angels who give the women the message, the women go to tell the 11 apostles, Peter runs to the tomb, confirms their story, and then Jesus appears to two of the apostles on their way to Emmaus, but is unrecognised. In John 20, only Mary Magdala is mentioned as coming to the tomb while it is still dark, sees the tomb is empty, she tells Peter, and then Peter & John confirm the story of the empty tomb; Meanwhile Mary waits outside the tomb weeping, she sees two angels who ask her why she is weeping, and then sees Jesus, mistaking him for the gardener.

However I suspect John Cleese is no longer in the business. Turning to the serious business of setting up a new scientific study of the Shroud, one could not do better than researching the background history of the STURP project. Some of this is outlined in Ian Wilson’s 2010 “The Shroud”, chapter 5 ‘Under the Microscope’. A more comprehensive and detailed story on the setting up of STURP is set out in the drafts of John Klotz’s forthcoming work “Quantum Christ”, particularly his chapter 7, ‘Game Change: Science Goes Deep, 1960 1978’. His Chapter 8 describes the ‘120 Hours in Turin’. The STURP team was to a certain extent self selecting, but it comprised a very broad mix of several disciplines, a mix of pro authenicists, those who were initially indifferent, and to some extent those who were initially anti authenticist. It was able to exploit the opportunity of the 1978 exposition celebrating the 400th anniversary of the Shroud’s arrival in Turin. It proved to be the most detailed scientific investigation into the properties of the cloth and its image that had then been carried out. Even so, there were a number of aspects that were overlooked and missed, and not studied due to lack of time and preparation, unexpected, or possibly insufficient forethought. Each of course had his own discipline and specialty, and if a particular specialty was not included in the team, that aspect could not be given proper attention. An important aspect that is sometimes overlooked in discussions, is the question of funding, and the ernergy and efforts taken by a few individuals to raise the necessary, some $US2.5 million as at 1978. I’m inclined to the view that the only way a new STURP project might be implemented is if a small team of determined, qualified and competent people can set about formulating a definite game plan to bring it about. They would need to be of sufficient youth and energy to see the project through during their own likely life times. Shroud conferences might be useful forums to air such a project and could generate useful discussion and ideas, and possibly provide useful avenues for specialist recruitment. One advantage STURP was able to exploit, was in being able to draw on contacts with close affiliation to Turin, particularly Father Rinaldi, who was able to ease the way for their work. Italy is not USA, nor the UK, nor for that matter Poland nor Switzerland. It has its own culture and way of doing things, and social contacts are important in being able to get things done. Without such a broad, concerted and determined approach by those comptent to do so, I fear nothing will otherwise happen. But if it does happen, expect to be prepared for a very long road ahead to see it through before a conclusion can come into sight..","date":"2013-09-13","mins":"5:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/10/i-say-let-all-of-us-help-david-help-us-all/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"I say let all of us help David help us all"},{"id":"comment-43885","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Kelly Kearse makes entirely valid points.

In this case it is Les Fredette making the claim of associating his “sighting” of the Shroud nail image with the nail said to be found in the Caiaphas tomb, so I guess that is a genuine report of sorts. As with many archaeological sites discovered during urban development work in and around Jerusalem, investigations into the Caiaphas site were badly done. It cannot even be confirmed that the said nails were actually found in the Caiaphas ossuary, and like many such discovered artifacts they turned up in the hands of a private collector. Despite crucifixion being a surprisingly common form of punishment (A Syrian governor crucified 3000 rioters in Jerusalem around 4 BC following the death of Herod the Great), very few crucifixion nails have been discovered. They were highly prized by the Roman soldiery as curative talismans, are rare, and so are collectible items. As crucifixion was a common form of punishment, I guess there plenty of such nails available in those times, So the Caiaphas nails could have come from any crucifixion at all. If one of the nails was buried with Jesus, there would have been some hard bargaining with the executioners to acquire it, and maybe they retained the others, although various other relics are claimed to be nails from Christ’s execution, If the nail was bloodied, that may have provided a reason for internment of the nail with the burial cloth – it would not normally be retained by a Jewish family as it was obviously unclean. The Time report mentions apocryphal writings that claim that Caiaphas eventually became a late convert to Christianity, but this too is very likely fanciful.

On Theology: It is my persistent view that God will not compel belief – He invites it! Come share My Life with me is the invitation. To reject God in the face of irrefutable proof is the sin against the Holy Spirit for which there can be no forgiveness. But God is merciful. So He hides His irrefutable proof, and it still remains an invitation, notwithstanding the five “proofs” by St Thomas Aquinas. 2. On Proof: There are various degrees of proof. My school years, now long gone, were at the time when Euclid was still part of the core math syllabus. My teachers were such that we learnt his proofs of geometry, not merely by rote, but by means of logical induction, developing our sense of critical thinking. In the early 1900s, Russell & Whitehead became dissatisfied with Euclid’s proofs, considering them non mathematical. But their project of transforming mathematics into more rigorous logic eventually failed as a result of Godel’s theorems and is now only of antiquarian and specialist interest. Nevertheless a more rigorous approach in Pure Mathematics did emerge, and mathematical proofs are now seen as the idealised model of irrefutable methods of proof. In the experimental sciences, the concept of proof is necessarily less rigorous than tht of mathematics, and are subject to amendment as new information comes to hand. However the standard confidence level of 95% commonly used is entirely arbitrary. In the Social Sciences and Applied Probability exercises, it is even less rigorous, and margins of error are routinely accepted. I spent some 10 years with an Internal Audit office, and our conclusions had to be weighed on the balance of probabilities, merely sampling transactions on some systematic basis. In my engineering days, an impatient supervisor once had to inform me that it was only the scientist who could pursue the rigorous truth, and the engineer had to be satisfied with an answer that would suffice for now. In a court room, the weight of circumstantial evidence is sufficient to secure a conviction. So there degrees of proof, depending on the circumstances in all matters of human affairs. 3. On Faith: In contrast to rigours of Truth are matters connected with Faith. We make several life judgements taken merely on faith. But they are generally based on the degree of faith that we can feel comfortable with based on our experience and knowledge, that is, a rational or informed faith. A bride and groom make their vows based on the confidence they have come to accept in promises made by the other person. They may be let down or be eventually disappointed, but hopefully their vows may survive despite what life throws at them. To make life changing decisions based on snap judgments only is to trivialize faith, and that way lies inevitable disappointment. 4. The Shroud: Somewhere between the rigorous requirements of scientific truth and an informed faith lies the mystery of the Shroud. Each one may come to their own decision as to whether this cloth wrapped the divine body of the Saviour of the world or is something else. For me personally the weight of evidence is too strong to reject it as anything but the former. It is the love letter left by Jesus, and is meant for our time, to strengthen our faith..","date":"2013-02-16","mins":"4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/16/imagining-the-shroud-of-turin-again-and-still-by-mathew-n-schmalz/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Imagining the Shroud of Turin AGAIN, and still by Mathew N. Schmalz"},{"id":"comment-15096","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Les, Thank you for your gracious response to my comments. With regard to lions and crocodiles, it was intended to be aimed at the more fanciful speculations that frequently occur on this site from time to time. If the nail image on the Shroud is adequately demonstrable, I have no problems with that. With regard to relative frequencies of nailing versus binding, the sources seem to have differning opinions on the matter. I did go exploring to see if I could find some authoritative comment. Quite a good report with several sources cited seems to be: “Crucifixion in Antiquity, the Anthropological Evidence”, by Joe Zias which can be found at: http://www.joezias.com/Crucifixion Antiquity.html. It includes the following comment: “Scholars have in fact argued that crucifixion was a bloodless form of death in that the victims were tied to the cross (Brandenburger 1969, Jeremias 1966). Martin Hengel, however who wrote what is perhaps the definitive scholarly report of the subject of Crucifixion in antiquity, takes along with Hewitt (1932) an opposing view and argues that nailing the victim by both hands and feet was the rule and tying the victim to the cross was the exception. During the first revolt of the Jews against the Romans in 66 73 CE Josephus mentions that in the fall of Jerusalem (70 CE) “the soldiers out of rage and hatred amused themselves by nailing their prisoners in different postures (JW 5.11 and 451).” There is much more informative comment in the Zias paper. He claims for instance that even Jews carried crucifixion nails along with other amulets, and were indeed permitted to carry them even on the sabbath. This suggests that they were not all that uncommon. One aspect is that it seems that the nails were bent over making them difficult to remove from the wood, without damaging the bones and flesh of the condemned victim. So the record seems to lead to conflicting results as to their prevalence. I suggest that the nails were prized as amulets not so much for their rarity as for the superstitious appeal they may have had with their macabre association with a horrible form of execution..","date":"2012-08-16","mins":"7:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/16/i-think-i-see-another-different-nail-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"I think I see another, different nail on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-70236","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Ignorance upon ignorance compounded!

I surmise that the initial discovery seems to come from Joseph Kohlbeck, a scientist at the Hercules Aerospace Center, Utah; and Richard Levi Setti, a scientist at the Enrico Fermi Institute, University of Chicago They concluded that dirt from the roads of Jerusalem (Travertine Aragonite) may be found on the Shroud on the following parts of Jesus’ Body: 1. The nose; 2. The left knee cap; 3. Both heels. The dirt on the nose and the left knee cap is almost certainly dirt from the road, as Jesus fell under the weight of the heavy cross beam tied over His shoulders. The dirt on the heel area was probably collected as Jesus stood at Calvary (a quarry area in Northern Jerusalem near Golgotha) waiting to be executed by Crucifixion. Joseph Kohlbeck and Richard Levi Setti compared dirt samples taken from the Shroud with limestone from ancient Jerusalem tombs. Web site http://www.factsplusfacts.com/travertine.htm has the following extract: “Joseph Kohlbeck, Resident Scientist at the Hercules Aerospace Center in Salt Lake, Utah, and Richard Levi Setti of the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago, examined embedded dirt particles taken from the foot region of the Shroud’s surface. Using a high resolution microprobe, Levi Setti and Kolbeck compared the spectra of dirt samples taken from the Shroud with samples of a relatively rare form of calcite, travertine aragonite, found near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem. The chemical signatures of the Shroud samples and the dust found near Golgotha were identical except for some minute fragments of organic cellulous linen fiber that could not be separated from the Shroud samples.” Web site http://holyshroudguild.org/ceacutesar barta.html has the following: “New evidence may explain image on Shroud of Turin” by Kohlbeck and Nitowski. Biblical Archeological Review (BAR), vol 12 n. 4, 1986, pp.23 24): By César Barta & Giorgio Bracaglia Kohlbeck claims that in Jerusalem there is limestone and that this particular limestone is primarily travertine aragonite (New evidence may explain image on Shroud of Turin” by Kohlbeck and Nitowski. Biblical Archeological Review (BAR), vol 12 n. 4, 1986, pp.23 24) In addition, the Jerusalem samples also contained small quantities of iron and strontium but no lead. When a calcium sample from the Shroud was examined, it turned out to be aragonite which also exhibited small amounts of strontium and iron. Dr. Nitowski concluded that the Shroud at one time must have been in Jerusalem.” “Excerpt from a letter to Father Otterbein by Dr. Nitowski: Limestone (calcium) samples were collected from as far south as 30 miles from Jerusalem to as far north as the Galilee and Mt. Carmel. As previously reported, Kohlbeck and Damian had matched a heavy calcium concentration from the foot area on the Shroud of Turin to samples collected in Jerusalem. This evidence was called into question, so sampling around Israel was performed to ascertain if such a test was valid. From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Therefore, the match between Jerusalem and the shroud is a valid one. The Shroud of Turin was indeed in Jerusalem at one time during its history. Sister Damian of the Cross, OCD (Dr. Eugenia Nitowski)” I get the impression that most of these conclusions were reached in 1986. I also discovered that there were two other current sites, but these had privileged access rights only, possibly confined to specialist members of the STURP group.

I don’t recall seeing anything solid that indicates this was ever submitted to a peer reviewed journal, although there are a number of references to it in the literature. In checking Ray Roger’s computer, I could not find specifically which of his tape samples he sent Nitowski or whether they were ever returned. He did send her a Raes sample which she did not return.

In Isaiah 14:12 he is used as an allegoric subject of a taunt song against the King of Babylon: “How you have fallen from the heavens, O Morning Star,* son of the dawn! How you have been cut down to the earth, you who conquered nations! 13 In your heart you said: “I will scale the heavens; Above the stars of God* I will set up my throne; I will take my seat on the Mount of Assembly, on the heights of Zaphon.” So that he then becomes identified with the sin of pride, setting himself above the stars of God. This theme of pride then seems to be taken up in the NT. When the 72 return from their mission into Israel, they comment on how even the demons obey them and Luke has Jesus give the reply: ‘Jesus said, “I have observed Satan fall like lightning* from the sky.” [Luke 10: 18] which seems to echo the Isaiah passage. He continues: “19 Behold, I have given you the power ‘to tread upon serpents’ and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you. 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.” I suggest that Jesus is implying that the forces of evil have an existent spiritual reality. This idea of Satan falling from the sky, finds an echo in Revelations 9:1: “1 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star* that had fallen from the sky to the earth. It was given the key for the passage to the abyss. 2 It opened the passage to the abyss, and smoke came up out of the passage like smoke from a huge furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the passage. (etc) ” Thus, in Christian times Lucifer came to be regarded as the name of Satan before his fall. It was thus used by John Milton (1608–74) in Paradise Lost, and the idea underlies the proverbial phrase “as proud as Lucifer.” However, it is also apparent that those who suffered from various forms of mental illness were thought to be possessed by a devil or an evil spirit. The two should not be confused by a modern mind, and I think it reasonable to believe that there are in fact evil spirits who desire the downfall of mankind. How much of this is spiritual reality, and how much of it is merely a projected personification of the forces of evil is difficult to say. As a footnote, it is curious that in some primal societies, even today, those who suffer from certain types of mania, are sometimes seen as having access to a form of spiritual power, and are consequently granted an excess of temporal power or leadership, sometimes to the detriment of the tribe. In history, to what extent have the several tyrants been driven by a type of megalomania, because they were perceived as having access to a type of divine power?.","date":"2015-08-29","mins":"6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/28/is-pope-francis-walking-on-the-mystical-side/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Pope Francis Walking On the Mystical Side?"},{"id":"comment-9549","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I went to the link ‘On the Road to Jerusalem’, the writer being a professed Christian, one Antonella Garafalo.

If there had been more handling, the clots would have been wiped away or obliterated; The rear part of the right heel is poorly marked, compared to the rest of the sole, and can be explained if it was the part covered by the hands of the bearer. I would observe that it would be a much easier task to remove the nails from the patibulum after it had been removed from the stipes, than attempting to remove the nails while it was still on the stipes. It is then only a question of whether the nails were removed with the body lying at the foot of the stipes, or whether the body was taken along with the patibulum for the nails to be removed at the burial site. It would only require five men to transport the body with the patibulum to the burial site. What part of this simple explanation, does Hugh Farey with his contrived skepticism not understand?

It is essentially the paper he presented at the Societe de Saint Luc, Bulletin March 1938. First it must be understood, that the condemned person carried the cross beam, the patibulum, to the place of execution where the upright stipes was kept permanently in place. With the victim lying on the ground with arms outstretched along the patibulum, the victim’s hands (wrists) were nailed to the cross beam. The stipes would have been about 6ft high only, to make it reasonably easy for the execution party. The patibulum with the victim suspended by his wrists was then lifted onto the top of the stipes, which may have been fitted with a mortice and tenon joint to keep it in place. The weight of the body, would then have sagged, resulting in the arms being at an angle of about 65deg to the vertical. The feet would then be nailed to the stipes. Barbet envisages the following procedure for removal of the body, which would be in a state of rigor mortis: First the nail through the feet would be removed from the stipes. Barbet does not dwell on the method. However, as an engineer, I can readily envisage a forged pinch bar made probably of wrought iron which would serve the purpose. Wrought iron has been known from ancient times. The only problem is that it is malleable, and might be likely to bend, unless it was heat treated and alloyed with some other metal. But I can readily envisage that the nail could be removed without further bodily damage. Remember that the Roman army was equipped with good metallic swords. The patibulum with the victim still suspended would then be removed from the stipes. Barbet envisages a party of five would then transport the deceased, still attached to the cross beam, to the tomb. This transport would be facilitated by the body being rigid in rigor mortis. He envisages that two men would support the patibulum, two would support the body mid section using cloth bands, and one would support the feet. He claims to note that the right heel is poorly marked, and that this is the only part of the body touched by the transport party. The absence of post mortem blood flows on the Shroud, points to the likelihood of this blood being lost during transport, (unless it was otherwise collected) and the body being laid on half the shroud, only at the place of burial. The nails would be removed from the patibulum, and the hands then with some little force be moved to the groin position. Barbet asserts that this can be readily done, even in the case of rigor mortis. The above description is necessarily a terse summary of Barbet’s highly detailed description, which includes aspects of the post mortem blood flows. His work should be consulted if more information is desired. Crucifixion nails were highly prized by the Roman soldiery as medical talismans, so that few examples now survive. Of the nails that St Helena recovered, Constantine is said to have used one in his helmet, and converted another into a bridle for his horse. With adequate tools, I can readily envisage that it would be quite feasible to remove the nails, without further damage to the body, particularly if the type of wood was selected with this ultimate requirement in mind, and if done with respectful care..","date":"2013-12-06","mins":"4:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/05/it-is-too-bad-that-this-one-minute-apologist-interview-ran-for-two-minutes/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It is Too Bad That This One Minute Apologist Interview Ran for Two Minutes"},{"id":"comment-22700","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"After reading through the various web postings, I can see that this could be a most intriguing situation, and there may well be object lessons to be learnt for other church jurisdictions.

This would be a fairly common situation under several state, national and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. In NZ for example most RC (arch)diocesan property, including parish churches would be registered under NZ law as the property of the (Arch)bishop of (diocese), “a corporation sole”.

The ENS site has some fascinating opposing views and comments on the matter, which would be entertaining if they were not so sad. One comment suggests that if the suit was successfully defended, then the remnant church would then be obliged to maintain several old buildings, which are registered historic places, but would be unable to fund their maintenance with their depleted congregations.

In the case of John, there is a detailed knowledge of Jewish geography and religious practices and it claims to have been written by an eye witness, a disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. However the closing verses of the gospel indicates its final form was compiled by a Johannine school, probably at Ephesus. The source for the several detailed discourses, particularly those at the Last Supper are a serious problem. The discourses are several, long and involved. They purport to have been said by Jesus. John’s gospel was known by about 100 AD, but its acceptance as canonical did not come about until 180 AD. There are few indications that it was originally Aramaic, and there is an absence of the usual signs of translation into Greek. The assertion that the words were first written onto wax tablets and later transcribed onto goat skin, would seem to owe more to a ‘post hoc’ creative imagination to justify a position, rather than on any kind of hard evidence. The percentages of Mark’s gospel found in Matthew and Luke, as quoted by Max, are inaccurate. Encyc Brit states that of Mark’s 661 verses, some 600 appear in Matthew (i.e. 90.8%), and 350 in Luke (53.0%). Only 31 verses of Mark (5.7%) appear in neither. Where any two of the synoptics agree against the third, it is always Mark and Matthew that agree against Luke, or Mark and Luke that agree against Matthew. Matthew and Luke never agree against Mark. This points to Mark’s gospel being used as a source by Matthew and Luke. Furthermore there is a distinct “telling it like it is” in Mark, whereas Matthew and Luke are more circumspect. A simple example from Jesus’ preaching in his home town: In Mark we have “Is this not Jesus the woodworker?” becomes in Matthew “Is this not the son of the woodworker?” and in Luke “Is this not the son of Joseph?” (no mention of a manual trade!) Mark’s writing of Jesus’ anger or the disciples’ shortcomings is more restrained in the more respectful later gospels of Matthew and Luke. The common material found in Matthew and Luke, but not in Mark, generally the logia or sayings, have been postulated as coming from a separate source, sometimes referred to as ‘Q’. However the placing of this material varies in both gospels after chapter 4. The commentaries in the Jerusalem Bible translation, under general editorship of Alexander Jones, are not entirely satisfied with this theory. They fall back on Papias 125 AD assertion that Matthew wrote the sayings in the Hebrew tongue, and identify it as “Matthew Aramaic”. They see a certain roughness in some of Matthew which justifies this position, and claim that even Mark used some of this material. I am uncertain to what extent these commentaries may be concerned to respect the patristic sources, which for all we know may only be faulty best guesses on their part to provide an adequate explanation as to the origin of the gospels, Other patristic sources which say much the same thing are merely echoing Papias. Yet it was Papias who said that he preferred the oral traditions to anything written, thus testifying to a “teaching church” rather than a “writing church”. Not all the fathers had a great respect for Papias’ opinions (e.g. “a man of little brain”). As to the congregation for which Matthew’s gospel was written – the general consensus seems to be that it was written for Judaic converts to Christianity, somewhere in Syria, possibly Antioch. There is frequent reference to Christ fulfilling the prophecies of the OT, Matthew is concerned to portray Jesus as the new Moses – he brings him out of Egypt, he has him preaching from a mountain (c.f. Luke has him on an open field), and so on. However Matthew is also concerned to demonstrate Jesus as the Messiah to the gentiles – gentiles in his ancestry, the wise men from the east, frequent cures involving gentiles. The conclusions we may draw from either internal or external evidence, can never be final, and I think it ill behoves any of us to make dogmatic assertions about whatever opinions we may conceivably reach. Like the Shroud, the origins of the gospels in their final form are hidden in the mists of time, but they exist for the present, to enhance our lives, and to give witness, as we may allow them to do so..","date":"2013-01-15","mins":"12:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-21965","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My posting was prompted by the Louis comment: “The problem is that the fragment is in Greek.

Mellon Professor of Divinity, Harvard University, 1981 84; Dean, Divinity School, 1968 79. Others have also contributed. A few Encyc Brit extracts on authorship and dating of John’s gospel follow: “Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown. ” “Because both external and internal evidence are doubtful, a working hypothesis is that John and the Johannine letters were written and edited somewhere in the East (perhaps Ephesus) as the product of a “school,” or Johannine circle, at the end of the 1st century. The addressees were Gentile Christians, but there is accurate knowledge and much reference to Palestine, which might be a reflection of early Gospel tradition. ” “The Jews are equated with the opponents of Jesus, and the separation of church and synagogue is complete, also pointing to a late 1st century dating. The author of John knows part of the tradition behind the Synoptic Gospels, but it is unlikely that he knew them as literary sources. His use of common tradition is molded to his own style and theology, differing markedly with the Synoptics in many ways. ” “Yet, John is a significant source of Jesus’ life and ministry, and it does not stand as a “foreign body” among the Gospels. Confidence in some apostolic traditions behind John is an organic link with the apostolic witness, and, from beginning to end, the confidence is anchored in Jesus’ words and the disciples’ experience although much has been changed in redaction. Traces of eyewitness accounts occur in John’s unified Gospel narrative, but they are interpreted, as is also the case with the other Gospels. ” It notes that John’s Greek is relatively simple, and that various background influences have been suggested including: Greek philosophy; Works of Philo of Alexandria, Hermetic writings, Gnosticism, Mandaeism, Palestinian Judaism; Wisdom components from Qumran. All of the above is consistent with my previous assertions that John’s gospel is a product of complex redactions, that its final form was written in Greek and compiled by a Johannine school, probably in Ephesus towards the end of the end of the 1st century, that its detailed knowledge of geography and Judaic religious practices support an apostolic origin but not necessarily final authorship. Clearly there had to be some process from when the original Aramaic or Hebrew sources became embedded into the gospel’s final Greek form. Evidently the contributors are not prepared to speculate on what that process might have been, nor to such components as oral recall or written notes. Neither shall I. The observation that some two dozen biblical scholars consider a much earlier dating viable is interesting, but here it depends on what they mean by that. The gospel itself is extremely complex, As its origin clearly has links to apostolic times, there had to be some material, either written or oral, available quite early. However the complex treatment of that material evidently took some duration, and we only know the gospel in its final form. There would seem to be little point in compiling such a complex gospel until such time as a need for it came to be recognised. The highly developed theology in chapter 1, as to the Word existing from the beginning, contrasts with the synoptics’ origins of Jesus, Mark’s opening section on his baptism in the Jordan, and the Mattean and Lucan infancy narratives, which I think are strong arguments against John’s predating the synoptics.

The responses above suggest a reaction against some unspecified assertion that he was. I doubt if any serious scholars would now make such an assertion. However in early Christianity, both orthodox and gnostic, there was an active debate about the competing merits of celibacy and married life, because of an early unfulfilled expectation of the Parousia – evidence for this debate can be found in Paul’s writings for instance. The fragment, if indeed it is authentic, should only be seen in that light. It may be evidence of some sect’s attempts to justify marriage as a way of life, as opposed to celibacy. An alternative explanation may be that “the wife” is intended to refer to the church. The prolonged duration of the testing period to establish authenticity, suggests that there may well have been some kind of problem with establishing authenticity.

But then you refer to “words often in the same order” and this could imply something about phraseology. The most meaningful statistic when comparing who depended on whom, seems to me, to be the measure of number of verses. On that basis, it is a false assertion that 88% of Mark is in Luke, although I could concede that Luke may have used 88% of Mark’s vocabulary, but that would seem to me irrelevant when discussing use of material. “In approximate figures, Mark’s text has 661 verses, more than 600 of which appear in Matthew and 350 in Luke. Only c. 31 verses of Mark are found nowhere in Matthew or Luke. In the material common to all three Synoptics, there is very seldom verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke against Mark, though such agreement is common between Matthew and Mark or Luke and Mark or where all three concur.” “The postulated common saying source of Matthew and Luke, Q, would account for much verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke when they include sayings absent from Mark. The fact that the sayings are used in different ways or different contexts in Matthew and Luke is an indication of a somewhat free way in which the editors could take material and mold it to their given situations and needs.” (Source – Encyc Brit) Encyc Brit’s assertion “there is very seldom verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke against Mark” would seem to be a gross understatement, and I have read elsewhere that such alleged agreement never occurs, On that basis, I would hope that we can continue to concur that Mark predated final Matthew and final Luke, and that both Matthew and Luke drew on Mark to the extent indicated.

I would stand by the comment I made on Luke, but the Greek found in John’s gospel is said to be fairly simple (Encyc Brit). I have already commented that there was clearly some process whereby the original Aramaic preaching came by some unknown process to be finalised into its ultimate Greek form. What that process was, I think, is lost in the mists of antiquity, notwithstanding the assertions of some two dozen NT scholars. It seems that Clement as early as 150 AD considered the gospel to be apostolic. JB notes that the absence of reference to “the sons of Zebedee” in John’s gospel, may point to John the Apostle being the initial author, and early fathers (e.g. Iraeneus) claim that John wrote the gospel in Ephesus and Revelations on Patmos. However JB also mentions one tradition that John was in fact martyred during the 1st century. In the 6th century, the church of Ephesus claimed to possess the autograph of the Fourth Gospel. At the end of the 2nd century, Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, claims that John’s tomb is at Ephesus, identifies him with the beloved disciple, and adds that he “was a priest, wearing the sacerdotal plate, both martyr and teacher.” There were in fact two rival sites in Ephesus claiming to be his tomb. Legend was also active in the West, being especially stimulated by the passage in Mark 10:39, with its hints of John’s martyrdom. Tertullian, the 2nd century North African theologian, reports that John was plunged into boiling oil from which he miraculously escaped unscathed. One resource I have, mentions that the education of young Jewish boys in 1st century Palestine apparently included instruction in the “Hebrew scriptures”, but I would be uncertain whether that would refer to the Septuagint (it was in general use at this time), or the actual Hebrew scrolls. So there may have been some more general acquaintance of pure Hebrew than I had granted, but of this I’m not certain. The complexity of thought in John’s gospel, and the evidence of several external influences, including the dualistic thought of Qumran, and traces of gnosticism, and so on, would seem to argue against a single author of the gospel in its final form as we now have it. It may be that a single religious genius might have had the ability to write it, but I think it does strain the bounds of plausibility that one fisherman wrote the entire bulk of it, A series of redactions by a Johannine school, probably at Ephesus, working on an original autograph has I think got more going for it. Against this argument, might be the unity of the whole. Concerning an earlier comment I made about the lack of appreciation in monolingual cultures about the multi lingual capabilities in other societies: In NZ we have several well known Maori and Polynesian writers who are quite comfortable in writing in either English or their native tongue, and who reguarly win national awards for their work, perhaps one advantage of living in a smaller country. At Victoria University in Wellington, the senior lecturer in professional writing for many years was in fact a highly thought of Maori professional writer. My own nephew, whose mother was Ngati Porou, a professional polytech teacher, has won prestigious national awards as a playwright for instance, and is comfortable in writing in either language. My point in mentioning this, is to demonstrate that there may be less difficulty for Judean evangelists writing in the Greek language than has been imagined..","date":"2013-01-17","mins":"4:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-22141","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If I don’t follow your Stein statistics, it’s because you haven’t explained them clearly as to what they’re about. The only other recourse I have is to go searching for them on the web which I can do when I have a moment to spare. However pure logic tells me that it is the percentage of verses that matter for the purpose of this debate (who was copying whom). Concerning the question of Hebrew/Aramaic vs Greek, I suspect there’s a lack of appreciation of the multi lingual capabilities of other societies by those writers who are constrained to live in a mono lingual culture. Hence they see a difficulty where none exists. Koine Greek was the common language in the eastern part of the empire, various Aramaic dialects a close second, (Peter’s style of speech revealed him to be a Galilean to the maid servant), with local pockets of other indigenous languages. I believe pure Hebrew very likely had tended to become confined among the Jews for religious purposes only, and therefore unlikely to be a suitable means of transmitting the gospels to a wider congregation. I have already conceded that there had to be some unknown process for transmitting the Aramaic preaching and sayings of Jesus, into their final Greek form. [Papias’ comment that Matthew wrote the sayings in the Hebrew language, may or may not be the case – they might well have been the original Aramaic collection.] However the general consensus seems to be that there are only tenuous signs of translation in the Greek gospels. For the record, the version of Encyclopaedia Britannica I use is the “2006 Ultimate Reference Suite” which unsurprisingly post dates 1939, and has yet to pass its “use by date”. Notwithstanding minority dissenting research since 1970, such research hardly seems to have affected the generally held consensus of the majority of exegetes since published elsewhere. That is not to say that it may one day do so. Whether that will be a good thing or no, there is now some evidence of an unfortunate ill informed trend among some powerful conservative religious lobbyists even to abandon Marcan priority. Such an unfortunate trend can hardly create confidence in the worth of “recent research”, and one might suspect kudos seeking from those pursuing the alleged discovery of novelties, rather than an honest distilling the truth of such matters...","date":"2013-01-16","mins":"4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-22194","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I presume you are referring to the gospel usually appearing as second in the NT. The way you have written his name, presumably a transliteration from some Hebrew source, suggests to me the possibility of a family connection with the Maccabees, I wonder. There is a strong tradition that Peter in Rome was the authority behind Mark’s gospel, see closing verses of I Peter (epistle) for instance. Whether he was the same John Mark that disappointed Paul in Acts, or whose mother’s home was a regular meeting place, we might guess. As we have discussed previously (e.g. Ossuary stats etc) the reservoir of Jewish names was much more limited than modern names, but it seems quite likely it could have been the same person, JB has an interesting complicated take on the origin of the synoptics, which I think may owe something to your French RC exegetists. Following Papias, (I imagine), it postulates a primary Matthew Aramaic with sayings and some narrative, but originating from an oral tradition. It then claims that Mark, as well as Matthew Greek used this primary Matthean Aramaic, but that Mark omitted the sayings. Nevertheless it claims that Mark’s gospel is a gospel in its own right that can stand on its own. It claims to detect more primitive forms in parts of Matthew, more so even than Mark. If Mark had Peter as a source, it puzzles me why he should feel the need to have recourse to another external source, and why he should then omit the sayings. The final Matthew Greek, and Luke even more so, is more circumspect concerning “unfavourable” reporting compared to Mark. As I have repeatedly attempted to express in our exchange, the production of the gospels into their final form was not I believe a simple matter, but was rather more complex, and a fertile ground for speculation as to how it all came about.

Tan grew up in Malaysia as one of 14 children in a poor family. Before coming to New Zealand he trained in medicine in Australia, eventually specialising in plastic surgery. He has made breakthrough research in the benign tumours known as strawberry birthmarks, a horrible distinctive disfigurement found in infants. His discoveries have resulted in dramatic shrinkage of these birthmarks using drugs normally prescribed for high blood pressure. Coincidentally, I discovered that the current issue of the NZ Listener had also published a fulsome article and interview of Dr Swee Tan. You can find out more about his work from the web site of the Gillies Mc Indoe foundation: http://gmri.org.nz/cms/ The Listener interview had some interesting observations on his particular research and research generally. I think these comments might well apply to Shroud research! On his work in Boston with mentor Professor Judah Folkman, inventor of the world’s first pacemaker, first slow release contraception, and discovery that tumours could make new blood vessels: “… He was ridiculed by lots of people for years and years and couldn’t get his work published. People now recognise that he was a great inventor. There are drugs based on his research now used for people who are going blind. …” On his own research into strawberry birthmarks: “… Our work couldn’t be published for a long time, because people thought we were mad. / Q. Why did they think you were mad? / A. Science is a very conservative discipline. It does not take kindly to disruptors. Those who are regarded as experts often stand in the way of progress.

However it is not a common view, and this view might well only stem from the evidence of the more naturally Aramaic style of the authors. It would seem most likely that Jesus would preach in Aramaic, and also speak Aramaic among his intimates. It needs to be remembered that in these early cultures there was a strong tradition of accurate oral recall (It is still evident in the recital of traditional NZ Maori genealogies and their other customary recitals) – there was not the same requirement to rely on written material as there is in a modern culture. So whether there was the need for Aramaic written sources or not can be argued. No Aramaic original sources have ever been found. Furthermore, both Mark and Matthew were writing for predominantly gentile churches, essentially Hellenic. Luke’s polished Greek is certainly the original language, and likewise there can be no question about John’s Greek. If the fragments mentioned above are authentic, it is hardly surprising that they would be primitive or koine Greek. We should note that even in Mark, Aramaic phrases occur which are then deliberately transliterated into Greek. This would hardly be the case if the original language of Mark was Aramaic. Encyc Brit comments: “In Mark, some Aramaic is retained, transliterated into Greek, and then translated e.g., in the raising of Jairus’ daughter (5:41) and in the healing of the deaf mute (7:34). The well known abba, Father, is retained in Mark’s account of Jesus’ prayer in Gethsemane. In the two miracle stories, the Aramaic may have been retained to enhance the miracle by the technique of preserving Jesus’ actual words. And a cry of Jesus on the Cross is given in Aramaized Hebrew.” All this would seem to argue that the original language here was Mark’s rough Greek..","date":"2013-01-13","mins":"6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-72519","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Jeffrey, Thanks for identifying the speaker.

Only circumstantial evidence is available, such as the correspondence with the wounds of the subject with those of the gospel texts. One would need to take the position that persuasive circumstantial evidence needs to suffice, otherwise perpetual skepticism must needs remain. Also it depends on what is mean by Science. Would it for example include historical evidence, would it include the correspondence with early portraits or icons which showed Shroud like features, would it include proof that the flax used for the linen had a Middle East provenance, would it suffice to demonstrate that the linen dated from no later than the first century, and so on. There is evidence which claims that the dirt on the feet, nose and elbow of the image corresponds to the travertine aragonite limestone particular to Jerusalem. Does one accept this evidence, or claim that no formal scientific peer reviewed paper has ever been submitted to and accepted by the scientific community? Nevertheless there are reputable and qualified investigators who make this claim. Most of our life decisions do not demand an infallible level of proof, and life would become intolerable if we attempted to do so. We are normally satisfied with a reasonable level of probability, and people are imprisoned or are liberated in our justice courts every day on this basis.

I tend to blame Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida for their impact on present educational systems through their philosophies of relativism. The comments there are in sharp contrast to the intelligence of the readers frequently displayed here on Dan’s site. The question of what is real and what is imaginary was first examined in great detail by the 17th c. Mathematican, philosopher and scientist Rene Descartes. Beginning at “Dubito, ergo sum” and then proceeding to “Cogito, sum”, he finally arrived at his ontological proof of the existence of God in his work “Meditations”. However even this conclusion was flawed, as the God that Descartes had constructed by this means was no more than Descartes’ own idea of God. It was one of a number of key errors in Descartes’ reasoning, which even extended to mathematics. He would not believe for instance that the lengths of various curves could be resolved, despite the discovery of the calculus, and his own invention of coordinate geometry, and as demonstrated by the the work of Pierre de Fermat. If Descartes made major errors.in his philosophy, and in other fields, what chance have lesser minds to arrive at the truth? Perhaps most of us resort to falling back on the empirical principle: “What is reasonable?” or “What conclusions would a reasonable, well informed person come to?” as a working principle for daily living. But of course, even this has hazards and to be wrong is to be human. To fall back onto earlier certainties such as the philosophies of Aristotle and St Thomas would appear to be retrograde. Even the principles of so called “scientific scepticism” can be demonstrably unproductive. Can scientific experiment yield truth? It seems only about the material world, and only then if rigorous sampling protocols are followed! The interpretations and conclusions therefrom are another matter. What does “What is reasonable?” mean?!.","date":"2012-12-13","mins":"3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/13/livescience-goofs-again/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"LiveScience Goofs Again"},{"id":"comment-21904","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Concerning ‘colinsberry’ comment:: “re publishing lengthy chunks of other people’s content, but with one important difference – he can’t be bother(ed) to seek the author’s permission”..

B. Segal, whom Wilson rightly regards the best modern authority on Edessa, and its earliest Syrian versions do not relate the existence of any miraculous image of Jesus. Segal concluded that Christianity did not arrive in Edessa until late in the second centuryand Wilson himself has recently acknowledged that the factual underpinnings of the Abgar legend may well be.attributable to that latter era.” Markwardt cites ‘See Wilson, The Blood and the Shroud, pp. 161 175’. I don’t have a copy of that particular text, but I expect to be able to follow it up. In his 2010 book “The Shroud”, Wilson, Bantam Press, he discusses the issue comprehensively on pp 116 – 123. He recounts Eusebius story of Abgar V and the alleged correspondence with Jesus on p.116. He writes: “So what about that hornet’s nest of controversy? Immediately needing to be made clear is that, even without its tenth century Image of Edessa component, the Abgar story is one that historians have long viewed with the greatest scepticism. Pope Gelasius (pope 492 496) … (letters declared apocryphal) … modern day scholars … fully justified. (allusion to John 20:29 … written afterwards) ” Continues. “Abgar V was part of a dynasty of rulers bearing the same name, and one successor slightly more favoured by historians as the Abgar whom Addai converted (AND WHO THEREFORE MAY HAVE BEEN THE TRUE RECIPIENT OF THE IMAGE OF EDESSA / SHROUD) IS ABGAR VIII, WHO REIGNED 179 TO 212 [Daveb emphasis]”. Wilson continues this discussion. He is evidently not entirely pursuaded that the recipient is not Abgar V, as he finds it difficult to accept that Edessa was ignored by 1st C Christian missionaries because of its proximity to Antioch and Palestine, compared to other further cities that were in fact evangelised. He also provides support that Addai was in fact a 1st C missionary. Nevertheless, it is apparent that he is not as dogmatic in this position as YC has alleged, and is prepared to consider other explanations. I am more pursuaded by the Markwardt 2008 hypothesis: “… when the royal scribe, at the direction of Abgar (VIII) and under the supervision of Bishop Palut, applied the precepts of the Discipline of the Secret and inserted, into the official archives, an allegorical narrative designed to protect Abgar (VIII) and those who had participated in his baptism,and that it is this allegory which was subsequently transposed into the ancient Syriac and Greek Abgar (V) Legends” ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET, pp 26 28; http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf.","date":"2012-10-05","mins":"5:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/28/losservatore-romano-weighs-in-on-the-coptic-papyrus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"L’Osservatore Romano Weighs In on the Coptic Papyrus"},{"id":"comment-17235","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick Clement’s pathological dislike of Ian Wilson and all his works blinds him to what Wilson is actually saying, and YC is only too willing to read Wilson out of context. The paper Wilson presented at Valencia begins with a correct reprise of a paper he first presented in 1973 to the British Catholic Herald, and followed up in his 1978 book “The Shroud of Turin” In the second paragraph of the present 2012 paper, he then gives a succinct correct summary of what that theory was (para as quoted by YC). From this en passant comment, it is unreasonable of YC to say that Wilson is still taking the legend as historical fact, if in fact that was ever Wilson’s view.. But that is not the main topic of the 2012 paper which now readdresses the missing years between 1204 and 1350, for which he is clearly having some new ideas, dismisses the Templar claims put forward by Barbara Frale, and also presents some new material to support his case that the Shroud and Image of Edessa were very likely the same object. But Wilson is not being close minded or dogmatic about this hypothesis, acknowledges that there are Byzantine scholars who disagree with this theory, and uses conditional expressions such as “…if the Image of Edessa really was our Turin Shroud…etc”. He points out his reasons how objections to the theory might be overcome. All of this he is entitled to do, and at least he has made the effort to consider others’ views, and without rancour! In 1999, Jack Markwardt in his paper “Antioch and the Shroud” was able to write, pp1 2: “Segal concluded that Christianity did not arrive in Edessa until late in the second century and Wilson himself has recently acknowledged that the factual underpinnings of the Abgar legend may well be attributable to that latter era” (and cites: See Wilson, The Blood and the Shroud, pp. 161 175) Markwardt in his subsequent 2008 paper ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET, gives a most credible explanation for the origin of the legend in the time of King Abgar the Great around 200 AD, see pp 26 28. It includes the following passage: “It is doubtful that, even under the tolerant Commodus, the details of Edessa’s conversion would have been accurately recorded for fear of unforeseeable imperial consequences. Nevertheless, and despite what might have been originally reported, the archives were assuredly modified after Septimius Severus assumed power in 193, and perhaps again, in about 201, when he issued an imperial edict banning conversions to Christianity. The recently baptized Edessan king, as well as the city’s new Bishop, confronted a serious dilemma: How could the most historically significant event in Church history be recorded without incurring the resultant fatal consequences? The author suggests that by 200, and with orthodox Christianity now firmly established in Edessa, the quandary was overcome when the royal scribe, at the direction of Abgar and under the supervision of Bishop Palut, applied the precepts of the Discipline of the Secret and inserted, into the official archives, an allegorical narrative designed to protect Abgar and those who had participated in his baptism,and that it is this allegory which was subsequently transposed into the ancient Syriac and Greek Abgar Legends.” Markwardt continues giving an explanation of how the allegory might be read, identifyng the various 200 AD historical personages in terms of the Abgar legendary characters. I see this as an excellent example of how allegorical legends are to be read and interpreted correctly, penetrating a mystery, instead of dismissing them as mere fairy tale concoctions. They more than often have a valid historical basis, which a literalistic turn of mind is doggedly determined to remain blind to, and will forever be unable to comprehend. I should think that even this relatively detailed note of mine will if it is read at all be wilfully misinterpreted by those who cannot see beyond the limits of their own preconceptions..","date":"2012-10-05","mins":"5:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/28/losservatore-romano-weighs-in-on-the-coptic-papyrus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"L’Osservatore Romano Weighs In on the Coptic Papyrus"},{"id":"comment-34608","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Shakespeare’s “Dream”: The play appears in the 1st & 2nd Quarto, and all four Folios.

Wrist nailing: The only scriptural source we have for Christ being nailed to the cross, as against having his arms tied to the cross beam can be found in John ch 20. This is the post resurrection story about Doubting Thomas. There appears to be no other gospel reference. Possibly other references might be found in prophetic utterances under Isaiah. Thomas’s statement and Jesus’ response are respectively: “Unless I can see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe. … ” “Put your finger here; look, here are my hands. Give me your hand; put it into my side. … ” Jn 20:25 27. The Greek word (transliterated) used here for “hand(s)” is ‘kefir’s, lit hand. Ian Wilson makes the point that the word also includes the wrist. We see an example of this in Acts 12:7, when Peter escapes from prison. “and all the chains fell off his wrists”. The same word ‘kefir’s is used. The four major reputable English translations of John 20, all use the word hand. However at Acts 12:7, three of them use wrist, and only the New Revised American Bible use hand at Acts 12:7. The three that translate ‘kefir’s as wrists at Acts 12:7 are: NRSV, Revised English, New Jerusalem. Somebody may be able to check a copy of the Latin Vulgate, and I would speculate that Jerome translated the Greek as “manus” rather than “carpus”. Consequently generations of artists have shown portrayals of the crucifixion with nails through the palms of the hands rather than the wrists. 2.

However John does not say on what side the wound was given. There are several references in the early Fathers of the Church establishing a tradition that the wound was given on the right side, and this is precisely what analysis of the Shroud image shows. Now, the Shroud itself acts as a mirror. Imagine yourself holding up say a bed blanket by its corners, and imagine that your bodily image is projected onto the blanket on the side facing you. This is roughly the way that a Shroud would be draped over a human body. Your right hand side will be projected onto the.left side of the blanket image. And vice versa your left hand side will be projected onto the right side of the blanket, just as looking in a mirror. On the original Shroud cloth the wound certainly appears to be on the left hand side because of this. But you need to view it on one of the several photographic negative images to reorient it to the correct view, when the image will then appear correctly on the right hand side. Similarly on the Shroud cloth, the right foot appears to be crossed over the left, when in actual fact, the left foot crosses over the right and is therefore in front, also as shown on the Shroud negative photographs. There is quite a lot that can be said about the wound in the side, and forensic pathologist Dr Pierre Barbet conducted several investigations into the various wounds, examining the negative photographs and experimenting with recently dead cadavers and amputated limbs during the 1930s. His book “A Doctor at Calvary” published in the 1950s is a classic in Shroud forensic literature. He considers that the cross could not be more than about six foot high as both the crucifixion and the blow itself had to be given by foot soldiers in the execution squad. The blow itself was not part of the actual execution, but was a legal requirement to establish the fact of death before delivering the body to relatives. The blow itself seems to have been given by the Roman “lancea”, a long bladed spear, and the size of the wound matches the size of the lancea blade exactly, from various Roman military artifacts which have been recovered. Dr Barbet discussed the details of the side wound in chapter 7 “The wound to the heart” of his book. He considers that the blow was delivered above the sixth rib, obliquely but almost horizontally, and the soldier would be seeking to pierce the right auricle of the heart which is always filled with blood. The water described in John 19:34 is pericardial fluid which would have accumulated in a great amount from the trauma of crucifixion. Barbet was also a classicist of some ability and is able to support his analysis by reference to considerable Roman military and other sources as well as by his forensic abilities. I hope these few notes might give you a better understanding of the various technicalities implicit in your question..","date":"2012-12-26","mins":"4:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/24/merry-christmas-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Merry Christmas Everyone"},{"id":"comment-67276","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"One never knows what a day might bring.

Concerning the conflict of values, it is probably endemic to the human situation. I vaguely recall, perhaps in an encyclical, or it may even be in Aquinas, that it is not in man’s nature to seek to do evil as such, but rather that it is in pursuing a perceived good that may result in evil. For example the good that is perceived in liberal secular values is the freedom of choice, and the exercise of individual rights, but which is often devoid of the concomitant obligations that go with such freedoms. It is interesting that the Catholic Herald article sees more common ground between the traditional values of the Nigerian Archbishop of Jos and those of Vladimir Putin with his Russian Orthodox background, than he has with those of the now entrenched Western secular values. Concerning the posted topic, the alleged conflict between science and religion, much of it stems from the extreme polarities on both sides: the biblical literalism of the evangelical wing of religion, and the extreme scientism of the so called free thinkers. Truth will not be found in adopting either of these positions. Religion has been brought into disrepute by extreme evangelicalism and has wounded its credibility. The historical religious conflicts in both Europe and the United Kingdom, had the effect of the various colonies adopting a public policy of secularism. In NZ for instance this became manifest in the 19th century Education Act which demanded that education in public schools shall be free, compulsory and secular. The consequence has been that most N Zers are religiously ignorant and utterly unaware of the historical influence of Christianity in their heritage, values and culture. It has been left entirely to the churches to educate their congregations in this heritage. Religion has also been brought into disrepute by the human failures of more orthodox churchmen, particularly with the media’s focus on anything with a whiff of scandal. Historically, the religious conflicts of the distant past, with the persection and martyrdoms of religious opponents can also be cited. It is an unfortunate legacy, that raises legitimate questions in the minds of the opponents of religion. Ever since the times of Copernicus and Galileo, there have always been scientists who also found a truth in religion and belief in God, sometimes unconventional, but at least an awarness that there was something more than just the material world of their particular specialty. The orderliness of nature revealed in “Goldilocks Zones” for example persuades many scientists today towards some belief in the inference of creation by design. There is a middle way between science and religion, and one may hope that it may yet be attained. However there can be little hope for compromise where rigidly held extreme views are held entrenched..","date":"2014-02-20","mins":"3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/20/mixing-believers-scientists-and-many-who-are-both/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Mixing Believers, Scientists and Many Who Are Both."},{"id":"comment-44447","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Paul, I’ve previously mentioned fairly recently, that it is common for rocks to be displaced from cliff faces and other ground discontinuities, by the release of the shock wave of an earthquake from the cliff face, and hurled some tens of metres away.

One of the evangelists (John, from memory) even attributes movement of the stone to the EQ, but includes an angel in the story. My personal view is that the story of the EQ is not intended as a mere literary device, but was an actual event. It provides a “naturalistic” explanation for the movement of the stone. It’s also possible that the EQ may have had a role in forming the image, such as by the release of radon gas which commonly occurs during E Qs, and also possibly by concurrent variations in the geo magnetic/electric fields.

The TS happens to be one of the very few burial cloths that no longer contain human remains. Clearly the image formed before corruption set in. Are images that form soon after death then eradicated by corruption products. We do not know, because no one has ever looked, and it has never been researched. It is not necessary to believe that the TS image was caused by naturalistic means, nor is it necessary to believe it was caused by some supernatural agency. However, before asserting that the image was created by some miraculous means, then one ought to eliminate the possibility of it being caused by some as yet unknown natural process. To date this has not been done. There are very many amazing cures, such as at Lourdes, and other various wondrous events. However only a very few of those that are examined are eventually declared to be miraculous. The Medical Councils at both Lourdes and at the Vatican Causes of Saints exercise extreme caution in attesting that examined events have no natural explanation, and only a small percentage are so validated. That is not to say that other unattested cures may also be miraculous. The TS, arguably the most important relic in Christendom, needs to be approached with similar caution, before making any rash assertions about it. Concerning the role of earthquakes in forming the image. I did not say that radon gas caused the image, only that it may have had a role. This has been researched by Giovanna De Liso in the seismically active area of Piedmont over a period of 12 years. Her efforts are one of the very few cases where I have seen any naturally caused images that appear at all persuasive. She used variously treated cloths, measured the various effects of radon gas, atmospheric conditions, variations in the magnetic and electric fields and so on. It seemed that the presence of iron bearing rocks were important. She claimed that images only formed under very specific circumstances. She produced images of a snake and a metallic key. Her paper has sometimes been criticised, because these were only small objects. You can find her paper at: http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/De Liso Web.pdf I am personally inclined to the view that the TS image is what I call a second order miracle. That is, Providence so arranged matters that the very many necessary rare conditions that would produce an image, came together at the same time. It may not have required that the Laws of Nature be suspended for it to happen. However, for all we know, it may not be as rare as we might imagine. We need to remember that the image is not that of a glorious resurrected Christ, but is that of a very dead corpse. To my mind that would seem to rule out the likelihood of the image being caused by the Resurrection event..","date":"2013-09-17","mins":"12:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?"},{"id":"comment-44639","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Matthias: I would be prepared to allow that the Shroud image may have been some kind of by product of the Resurrection process, whatever that might have been. However I see a strong objection to that hypothesis in that the image is that of a corpse. The gospels refer to the appearances of Christ after the Resurrection, St Paul records his own experience of the risen Christ, and in John’s Revelations, the images of Christ are of a triumphant Son of Man in glory. None of that is consistent in my mind with the image displayed on the Shroud. One of the reasons why there has been such little progress in arriving at a decision on the origins of the image over the last 40 years, is the inaccessibility of the Shroud to scientific enquiry. In 1978, the nature of the image was quite unknown, apart from a few properties such as the negativity of the image and its apparently 3 D properties caused by its variations in brightness. This last is I think strongly suggestive of a possibly naturalistic cause. In 1978, it was not even known if the image was a product of painting or not. Since then, the Shroud has been largely inaccessible to further enquiry. Investigations have since been confined to very small samples of threads only. I mentioned De Liso’s investigations above, which I think demonstrate that a naturalistic cause may be feasible, and there have been a few other suggestive although less successful attempts as well. As previously mentioned, I’m inclined to consider that the image may be what I have called a seond class miracle, in that Providence so arranged matters, that the particular circumstances that would produce a naturally caused image combined to do so. We do not even know if in fact whether it is normal for images to form on burial cloths or not, only to be obliterated by subsequent corruption, because no one has ever bothered to research it. There are one or two other cases, not as spectacular as the Shroud image, where images were known to form by deceased persons. The image on the Shroud is not perfect, and there a few gometrical distortions. This would tend to argue against a miraculous cause of the image, which one would expect to show a high level of perfection if it were indeed miraculous..","date":"2013-09-18","mins":"4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?"},{"id":"comment-44602","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I don’t recall noticing the name of Josie L Tyner previously in the nearly two years that I have been working this blog most days, so I find her comments that I should share my views somewhat gauche and impertinent.

It has been mainly left as a field for individual scholars who had sufficient enthusiasm for it. When it comes to the wider religious aspect, there seems to be a dichotomy. For example, most New Zealand universities have a Religious Studies department, and there are opportunities for obtaining a major, and post graduate qualifications. I suspect most of these tend to be studied on a phenomenological basis in their general approach. However I also suspect that enrolments in the RS departments are probably fairly small, and would have little influence within the wider university campus. Back in the 1980s I obtained a RS major from Massey University in Palmerston North, which I found to be particularly broadening and enlightening. Both Auckland and Otago Universities offer courses in Biblical Studies for a B Theol degree, and again there are opportunities for post graduate studies. The various church seminaries also have their curricula of course, but these would usually have vocational and ministerial objectives, rather than academic. The general university approach in our present age has tended to become in my view far too compartmentalised and narrow, diected at specific occupational training, and truly educated people with a broad range of knowledge and understanding have now become a rarity.

The Catholic Church, having learnt its lesson from the Galileo case were one of the few institutions that were prepared to accept Steno’s theories. Steno became disenchanted with the bickerings within the scientific establishments of his time, entered Holy Orders and lived a life of extreme frugality.

The other heavier elements can only be produced by an explosive super nova. From the known constant speed of light, the rate of recession of remote galaxies and the limits of our visibility, we know that the universe is roughly 14 billion years old, about three sun lives. We are in fact made of star dust! None of this was known to the ancient patriarchs, nor the writers of the New Testamment and it has only become known to us in the last few hundred years, or even less. They had a calling to communicate the Word of God, and this had to be done within a comprehensible cultural context of their time and place. To God, a million years is but a day, in fact there is no time with God, – everything for God is NOW, our ancient past and our unknown future! Who can know the mind of God? The Old Testament was not written down complete and “issued” once and for all at one paricular time. It was a process that took some thousands of years, from ancient folk stories told around camp fires, through the monotheism of Abraham, the Exodus and wanderings through the desert, the Davidic dynasty, the Babylonian exile, and the triumphalism of the Macchabees. There is poetry and music there in the Psalms and the Canticles of Canticles, there are guides to proper behaviour in the Proverbs and Wisdom selections, There is a call to repentance in the prophets, and there is a history of a peoples on their way to God. The original Creation story is in chapter 2 of Genesis. It is a primitive story, God is seen as anthropomorphic, He walks in the Garden, and talks, He asks questions “Where are you?”, He forms the woman from a rib taken from Adam. We have a talking snake. Around 540 BC, the banished exiles encountered Babylonian science, and so reformulated a more elevated story of Creation which we find now placed in Chapter 1 of Genesis. However they were not about to abandon the truths they felt were contained in the ancient story of Chapter 2, and retained it. They heard of the flood stories such as those in the Epic of Gilgamesh, resulting from random unpredictable flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates. They took this story, gave it a divine meaning to their purposeful God, and incorporated it into their ancient story of Noah. When we come to the Shroud, it remains a scientific mystery. Some see it as primary evidence of the Resurrection, a fifth gospel, a love letter from Jesus, comprehensible only in our own time with our technology. Modern man imagines he knows better than the ancients, dismisses the old religion as myths now irrelevant, “God is dead!” The guide to proper behaviour, if there is such thing, is enlightened self interest. The Resurrection of Jesus is impossible to contemplate.

He categorises three types: a) God does something that nature cannot do; b) God does something that nature can do but in a different order; c) God does something that nature can do but without the operation of the natural principles. The Catholic position seems to be that Catholics are required to believe in miracles, but beyond those contained in the Creeds, are not normally required to believe in specific miracles as an article of faith. The Church may recognise specific miracles, such as when examining the causes of saints, but these are not usually compelling on Catholics. In considering the reported miracles of Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament, it needs to be remembered that the gospels and other writings were written for the purpose of proclaiming Jesus as Lord, and all may not necessarily have occurred as actual events. Thus we may readily accept the miracles reported as cures or exorcisms, but we may have a mental reservation about such reported miracles as the conversion of water into wine at Cana, Jesus walking on water, the multiplication of loaves and fishes, or the calming of the storm. There may have been other explanations, or they may have been the particular author’s interpretation of actual events that occurred. Having said all that, it is within the power of God as author of nature, to set aside the laws of nature that He has devised. The evidence of witnesses may be compelling, as seems to have been the case of Fatima in Portugal on 13 October 1917: “Anywhere between 70,000 and 100,000 people, who were gathered at a cove near Fátima, witnessed the sun dim, change colors, spin, dance about in the sky, and appear to plummet to earth, radiating great heat in the process. After the ten minute event, the ground and the people’s clothing, which had been drenched by a previous rainstorm, were both dry.” It might be asserted that the cause was a mass hallucination, but this explanation seems unlikely, and merely begs the question.

A sample of Cardinal Pell’s approach to this issue: “In case there was any doubt about the matter, in August Mr Calma and Conrad Gershevitch delivered a conference paper on the inquiry which opened with these words: “The compatibility of religious freedom with human rights is the subject of the most comprehensive study ever undertaken in Australia in this area. …’” “Let us spell this out. The clear meaning of these words is that religious freedom is not a human right and may not be compatible with human rights. This is an astonishing claim from a senior officer of the body responsible for the protection and advancement of human rights in Australia.

If it’s not a forgery, then it merely contributes a little more to scholars’ knowledge and understanding about whatever gnostic sect originated it. When it comes to gnostic and other ancient writings (scribblings?) you need to know that they are sometimes deliberately obscure. For example: “Is the writer wanting to make a claim that is to be literally interpreted? Or was he intending it to be interpreted allegorically? Is the wife intended to be a person? Or was he intending to say that the wife is the Church? Even the phrase ‘She can be my disciple’ can still be interpreted allegorically.” Scholars may debate this issue for their academic entertainment for years to come. It does seem that King does have a proactive feminist agenda, as evident in her other writings, and her having worked worked with Elaine Pagels. She is apparently a strong advocate for female ordination, but then there’s not a great deal wrong with that. I know several very effective Protestant women pastors for instance. One highly suggestive comment I spotted referred to the trial by Internet blogging. The commenter wondered what would have been the outcome with the Nag Hamadi and Dead Sea scrolls discoveries if the Internet had been around at that time. There is a present conflict between the demands of newsdesks, public wanting to know, and proper academic study of such discoveries.

It is obviously a gnostic work. Prof Watson claims to recognise that the Coptic fragment has been compiled from a copy and paste of bits and pieces from a Coptic translation of the Gospel of Thomas, and therefore asserts it is a forgery. Hopefully a chemical analysis of the ink will settle the matter one way or the other. The gnostic gospels are not the only “scripture” to be obscure. John’s gospel was written towards the end of the 1st C, during an intense period of persecution, and consequently we can expect a sub text to have been written into it. Albert Dreisbach for instance in a Shroud Conference paper, Atlanta 2005, asserts that there is a hidden message concerning Jesus’ burial cloths in the resuscitation story of Lazarus, which only occurs in John. Mark’s gospel is much more primitive and tells his story in a more direct way. It his gospel that identifies the names of the brothers of Jesus and his trade as a woodworker. Matthew’s and Luke’s gospels are rather more circumspect. From the Greek word used for brother (adelphos), John P Meier asserts that they were blood brothers of Jesus, not half brothers or cousins. My own view of this is that they could easily have been adopted by Mary and Joseph. Adoption was very prevalent in those times because of parents’ early mortality. There were several orphans, and adoption gave precisely the same rights as blood under both Jewish and Roman law. That is one reason why I would be prepared to concede that Jesus himself may have adopted a son and there may be more to the inscriptions on the Talpiot ossuaries that many are prepared to admit. He may well have been the disciple whom Jesus loved. The whole business of the Talpiot ossaries was very badly handled archaeologically by the IAA, (merely in the interests of expediting a residential development) and now we shall never know because of their cleaning of the ossuaries and disposal of the contents in a common grave. Consequently I see the controversy concerning the James ossuary as an IAA exercise in futile damage control and covering their backsides. Notwithstanding the words of Pope John Paul II on the issue of ordaining women, it was to be expected that Jesus would appoint men only as his disciples because of the prevalent culture of the time and place, not for any theological reason. His own attitude towards women was a revolutionary breakthrough, and in the Acts it is apparent that women were occasionally appointed as deacons, and not merely in passive supportive roles. The gnostic gospels, were for what they’re worth, might suggest that Mary Magalene had a very prominent role in missionary activity, which was downplayed by the orthodox. We shall probably never know for sure..","date":"2012-09-27","mins":"4:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/26/national-post-quality-punditry-from-across-the-globe/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"National Post: Quality punditry from across the globe"},{"id":"comment-145600","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Congratulations, Andy; That is great news!

We know that certain light frequencies may appear red to us, while others appear yellow, but we don’t know really know why. I don’t believe that even neuroscience can answer this question. I really have no way of knowing whether my sensation of red, is the same as anyone else’s, even though experts have informed me that I’m not colour blind. The dilemma is as old as Adam & Eve! “Then the serpent said to the woman ‘No! You will not die! God knows in fact that on the day you eat it (the fruit of the tree of knowledge) your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.’ “. Gen 3:4 5. The complexities of the argument may have developed and become more sophisticated, but the basic temptation has not really changed. Behind it, is the arrogance of becoming “like gods’. Yet it is possible for humility to accompany the most knowledgable of scientists, and for them to have a faith which their science can only illuminate. Fanatacism of whatever brand, the agnostic sceptic’s or the religious fundamentalist’s, whether of the ignoramus or the scholar, such fanaticism can never illuminate. It is both “Faith and Reason” that make us fully human. Every mother knows her child and that it is hers; but not every father demands a DNA test to have sufficient faith that the child is his. We don’t really know why the fundamental forces, or the fundamental atomic constants have the values that they do. But if they were any different, none of us would be here.

I respectfully suggest to Nabber that he might read the Vatican II document, Lumen Gentium, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, particularly Chapter 2 where the emphasis is on the People of God. It is remarkably inclusive, and he may find there a refreshing change from the strictures of earlier pronouncements. As a young man, now some 60 years ago, I had read the 1896 encyclical of Pope Leo XIII, Apostlicae Curae, on the validity of Anglican Orders. It had stemmed from the work of the Oxford Movement, led by such as Henry Newman, now recently canonised. It had seemed to me then that there was therefore little hope of any reconciliation at all. However we now seem to be moving in an entirely different and better direction, and anything might become possible. We often now share in joint worship, even though as yet, full communion remains a barrier. Many churches in NZ are now facing considerable reconstruction costs and disruption in order to comply with new national standards of earthquake resistance. My own parish church will remain inaccessible over the next several months while it is being brought up to the required standard. Our relationships with the Anglican church across the road is cordial.

In Saudi Arabia, they may not be licensed to drive, and in public must always be accompanied by a man, such is the retention of an archaic desert nomadic morality. In Afghanistan there has been a continuing battle for the education of young girls, often accompanied with mass slaughter of those who so dare to challenge. In India in not so distant centuries, it was expected that the widows would also mount the funeral pyre, and if dowries were not as expected the in laws would persecute the bride. In African tribal societies, similar subordination is prevalent. I have personal acquaintance with similar perspectives in Maori and Polynesian societies. A close female relative was to receive an award for her artistic achievements. Protocol demanded that she be excluded from sitting in the front row with the other recipients, only on account of her gender, and with some distaste I was obliged to sit in her place, although I had little to do with what was her own personal achievement. Such subordination practices are quite common here in these societies. However it also seems to continue in certain conservative European societies, the background milieu of most or all 20th century Popes who may thereby be influenced by their upbringing and culture. Equal status in the workplace and the right to a vote are comparatively recent innovations even in societies we might regard as enlightened. Jesus challenged such perspectives, and his relationships with women, engaging them in discussion as recorded in the gospels was a signal departure from the common practices of the time. However, a female apostle in those times would not be at all practicable and would only give rise to scandal and gossip and was clearly not then achievable. In the minds of many of those times there might well have been an unwarranted association with the temple prostitution of pagan cults. In fact it is remarkable that the early church went as far as ordaining women as deacons. Of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human gene, only one pair determines gender, a random accident of the individual’s conception. Such an accident is a poor indicator of one’s ability to function effectively as any kind of pastor. I see it as depressing for the Catholic Church that we might yet be overwhelmed by conservative Anglicans, even their bishops, converting on the grounds of their objection to women ordinands. In Canada and New Zealand, Anglican women priests are not at all uncommon, and in NZ we have seen at least two strikingly effective women Anglican bishops.

I would see the mantle as a kind of symbol of Elijah’s prophetic office which now passes to Elisha. The metaphor of the mantle falling to a successor is common enough even in modern secular language. A Jerusalem Bible (JB) annotation mentions that the “sons of the prophets” were groups who lived in community, and although Elijah himself was a lone prophet, Elisha seems to have been closely associated with them. JB also comments on Elisha’s request for a double portion of Elijah’s spirit, as befitting an elder son who inherited a double portion of his father’s goods, even though the prophetic spirit is not inherited but is a gift from God. JB comments that God indicates that the request is granted by allowing Elisha to see what is hidden from human eyes, while the “sons of the prophets” see only the human circumstances, not the spiritual reality behind them. The “sons of the prophets” recognise that the spirit has now passed to Elisha, by reason of the mantle, or perhaps by seeing Elisha using it to part the waters.

In it Kaku has a fascinating Chapter 8 “A Designer Universe?” where he expands on the idea of ‘Goldilocks Zones’, of which there are several, all persuasive arguments for a designer universe. He explores the idea of multiverses quite thoroughly. It seems to be quite a valid proposition, but seems likely to remain only a speculative concept, unless there is a major breakthrough allowing us to penetrate beyond our own universe. The “anthropic principle” invoked by some seems to say little more than “We’re here because we’re here”, hardly a remarkable insight. The historic changes in human understanding of reality has I think influenced modifications to our understanding of religious matters, often for the better. Genesis chapter 2 was the first of the biblical creation stories, an anthropomorphic God, a desert nomad camp fire story perhaps, but with a difference from other contemporary creation stories in that God was a separate being from His creation. The Babylonian exile ~540 BC exposed the early Israelites to more scientific concepts, and they wrote a more compelling story of creation which we now find in Genesis chapter 1, apparently influencing Augustine, but they still did not throw out the older story. It gave us a three tiered universe; above the earth in the sky was the abode of the gods and the heavenly host; below was Sheol the abode of the dead and the demons. Despite any advances in Greek astronomy the three tiered concept remained intact well into medieval times, infuencing such writers as Dante, until finally put to rest by Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler. The old Genesis stories remained dogma, even influencing men of science. Niklaus Steno was obliged against his better judgment to compress his discoveries of stratigraphy into a period of 6000 years, and could find few to support him otherwise. However Laplace’s dogmatic determinism was dealt the death blow by the discoveries in quantum mechanics, where outcomes became matters of probability. Charles Darwin’s theories posed more challenges for traditional concepts of creation, but I think Teilhard de Chardin showed us a better way with his insights. I am not familiar with Tipler’s writings, but I would affirm that there always needs to be an ongoing dialogue between science and religion. All new ideas are challenged, as they disturb our comfortable received concepts of reality. But having been tested in the crucible, the truth will always emerge. I have few problems with the concept of transubstantiation. We are not the same people we were as recently as seven years ago, not a single atom of us. If God can renew the material reality of every human being on earth in that space of time, then it can be no problem for His Christ to be truly present in a piece of consecrated bread, nor in a chalice of wine, any appearances to the contrary..","date":"2015-06-30","mins":"4:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-50153","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“I will not go quietly into the night…”: A misquote from the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas 1914 1953, best known for his brilliant classic radio play “Under Milk Wood’, a day in the life of a small Welsh village. I first encountered UMW on an LP, as a young student around 1960, have since read the script often, participated in several theatre group readings, and at the slightest provocation will replay my copies of the full text with Richard Burton as Reader 1.

His inability to deal with his Inland Revenue problems plagued him for most of his life, and compounded his chronic alcoholism. Dylan Thomas wrote the poem “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”, with its echoing refrain, “Rage, rage against the dying of the light” when his father was being afflicted with the onset of blindness. The dying of the light is a reference to darkness and being blind. A degree of blindness may occasionally affect more than just a few of us. Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.

Topic: Giulio Fanti’s work on testing the mechanical properties of ancient flax fibres is one piece of pioneering work that may at some time develop more conclusively. But I suspect that rather more is required. His paper “A NEW CYCLIC LOADS MACHINE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF MICRO MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SINGLE FLAX FIBERS COMING FROM THE TURIN SHROUD” by Giulio Fanti, Pierandrea Malfi; can be found at: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aimeta fanti.pdf And he has some good citations of earlier work by various ones. The paper has considerable technical content which may be difficult for some. Essentially the concept is that the cellulose degrades with time, and by calibrating against properties of known ages of cloths, an estimate of the sample’s age can be made. A significant problem is that time is not the only dependent variable, but also the history of the cloth, its storage, handling, humidity, also affect these properties. My recollection is that he tested some four separate parameters, and there was a considerable spread of the various estimated ages. His attempts at measuring the age of his TS samples seems to be generally considered inconclusive by most reviewers, as far as I know, although he asserted his results were at least consistent with 1st century provenance. A significant problem will always be the reluctance of relics’ guardians to allow the release of samples from intact relics, because of a natural enough wish to preserve the integrity of the relic. This will always seem to make adequately representative sampling a difficult issue. There is clearly a preference for non destructive testing methods. Some, including the late Ray Rogers, considered that the presence of a starch coating on the TS fibres indicated that the TS was of ancient provenance, because of the change in linen production methods in medieval times which left no such coating. Rogers also considered that the absence of vanillin was another indicator. Clearly much more is required than what has been achieved to date, and it may well come. Nevertheless it is one matter to determine the age of the cloth, but even if it was proved to be first century, there would still be those skeptics who would assert that the image was produced by some medieval artisan, by some means as yet unknown! Much more scientific work and historical research, on several fronts is required. Access to the relic hampers scientific testing. Time and the inevitable destruction of any records that may once have provided clues hampers historical research.

Frankly I prefer a phenomenological approach, such as that taught in the better Religious Studies departments, and which tends to be more comprehensive in its understanding of Religions generally. It seems to be a trend within the history of philosophy that whenever it pontificated about some esoteric topic, that the topic became specialised in a way that proved more successful outside Philosophy’s hallowed halls. It was true of Aristotle’s Physics for example, and I think it is very likely true of Religion. The philosopher’s approach often seems to be narrow, even reductionist, with what seems to be the Philosopher’s emphasis on “knowledge”, and the “nature of knowledge” where it might better apply itelf. What modern philosophy has to say about religion is a far cry from St Thomas’ Summa Theologica for instance, notwithstanding Professor Gutting’s 12 years of training with the Jesuits, and his instructing of Catholic students at a prestigious university. His criteria for evaluating religions: “the three great human needs religions typically claim to satisfy: love, understanding, and knowledge” are just too reductionist for me, and I doubt if I can agree that,this is what religions are indeed about. There is nothing here for instance of the divine, the spiritual, the otherness, little about the role of social cohesion, or sense of community, or “The Idea of the Holy” (e.g. Rudoph Otto), the numinous, the mysterium tremendum, or the cosmic and the ultimate end of humanity. It is little more than a warm fuzzy! Professor Gutting is apparently a specialist authority on the work of Michel Foucault, who along with Jaques Derrida have both been an unfortunately powerful influence in much of 20th century thought and development, but who have also been variously described as two French clowns who contributed little that was worthwhile, whenever it did occur to them to be at least comprehensible. I doubt that Michel Foucault ever had anything of worthwhile utility to say about Religion. If modern Philosophy has anything at all useful to say about Religion, it would very likely be confined to commenting on the nature of religious knowledge, and very little else, a very circumscribed aspect indeed..","date":"2013-01-23","mins":"7:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/23/philosophy-the-way-of-the-agnostic-and-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Philosophy: The Way of the Agnostic (and the Shroud)"},{"id":"comment-38172","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There are known facts, there are speculations, and there are interpretations.

But that is not the reality of where many people seeking a faith happen to be at. What should one say to these – “Sorry, that it is all or nothing – you’re either in it totally or you’re out!” That does not seem to me to be the truly Christian approach. For many, the fulness of faith is something that can develop over a period of time. We get a hint of this in Matthew’s gospel, 19:1 9, where the Pharisees question Jesus about divorce. They asked: “Then why did Moses command that a writ of dismissal should be given in cases of divorce?” Jesus replied “It was because you were so unteachable that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it was not like this from the beginning.” I think we see here that there can be degrees of commitment, according to the capability of the person, even though it is not the way of perfection. As I’ve indicated above, I’m not at all happy with Professor Gutting’s approach, that all religions are about “the three great human needs … love, understanding and knowledge”. That to me is too anthropocentric, and is not what religion is about at all. As my local pastor is so fond of saying: “It’s not about me; It’s not about you; It’s all about God!” But that is a way of perfection, and many of us are still children in the faith. However the God centric approach does not appear to be part of Prof Gutting’s consideration at all in what he has recently posted, but perhaps he is providing a way for the tepid or agnostic..","date":"2013-01-24","mins":"11:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/23/philosophy-the-way-of-the-agnostic-and-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Philosophy: The Way of the Agnostic (and the Shroud)"},{"id":"comment-185169","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Piero quote: “The Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino, about 90 miles (150 kilometers) to the northwest, was heavily bombed by the Allies in 1944, and many Savoy family documents about the shroud that were placed there for safekeeping during the war were destroyed, Cardin said.” Very many NZ soldiers were involved in the Cassino campaign. The Allies’ northward advance up the Italian peninsula to Rome was still blocked by Kesselring’s Gustav Line, which was hinged on Monte Cassino. A mass landing to bypass Cassino, had occurred to the north at Anzio, but time spent in consolidating these forces allowed Kesselring’s reserves to develop a powerful counteroffensive, reducing this attack to a shallow beach head. The decision to bomb the historic Cassino monastery was a difficult one, was controversial, and not made lightly. I recall discussing the issue in the 1960s with a work colleague, a veteran of the Cassino campaign. He told me that it was plain the German army was occupying the monastery, and using it as an unassailable defence fortification. Vehicle wheel marks were clearly visible on the ground and appeared over several nights showing evidence of their troop movements, and eventually the decision to bomb was taken. The comment that several Savoy family documents concerning the Shroud were destroyed is significant, and of course one wonders what they might have contained.

It paints the scene of the Last Judgment when the Son of Man comes in his glory, escorted by all the angels, and separates the sheep from the goats. The essential criterion are the corporal works of mercy: “Come … For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; (etc)”. This seems to be the main theme of the present sermon of Pope Francis. He associates it with putting your hands into the wounds of Christ, maybe “getting your hands dirty” would be an Anglophile way of expressing it. It is also significant I think that this text immediately precedes the Passion narrative, when Christ incurs those wounds. Coming from Pope Francis with his South American background it is a refreshing re emphasis of the core of this Christian message. The Latin population expressions of religion have often in the past seem to have been marked by extreme mortifications, such as the Lenten flagellations and personal self crucifixions, seen in these countries. Meditation and other expressions of personal piety has also, I think, tended to have been over emphasised, at the expense of this reaching out to those with real suffering. Yes, fasting, prayer, penance and meditation all have their place, but need not be taken to such extremes that they displace the real caring and reaching out on which we will be finally judged. Such works as those of Mother Theresa of Calcutta, the work of the St Vincent de Paul Society, founded by Blessed Frederick Ozanam, and the personal or institutional efforts of many Christians, such as nursing, missionary charity, prison chaplaincy, are various ways in which this message can be realised..","date":"2013-07-04","mins":"6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/04/pope-francis-we-encounter-the-living-god-through-his-wounds/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Pope Francis: We encounter the Living God through His wounds"},{"id":"comment-22402","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I watched the video right through, and it was OK, coverage of basic forensics was adequately dealt with, but no mention of the possibility of a naturalistic process, and they clearly attribute the image to the Resurrection event, In view of John Calvin’s rejection of the Shroud image (he considered it unthinkable that it wouldn’t be mentioned in the gospel accounts, if true) it is interesting that many Evangelical Christians are now showing an interest in it. The PITN folks are an off shoot of the “Church of God” movement, which had very fragmented beginnings, and quickly divided into various assorted sects. Part of the problem was the life style of a few of the founders, which involved frequent serial adulteries, and mishandling of their finances – check “Church of God” in Wiki and elsewhere.

Historically, the churches’ position on a social option for the poor and oppressed has been uneven. It has ranged from an outlook that has promoted a philosophy of passive Christian patience, forbearance and acceptance of one’s lot to the then somewhat radical but essentially conservative social teaching of Pope Leo XIII, sometimes described as the Catholic Church’s “best kept secret”. The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century led to the gross exploitation of the working classes, not only male workers but women and children as well, at the behest of capitalist profit. There have always been extreme right wing regimes oppressing the poor for similar reasons. These factors inevitably led to the teachings of Karl Marx who saw Religion as the opiate of the poor, their only available refuge. The response of the churches to these conditions has often seemed ambiguous. The Liberation Theology of the late 20th century as one solution to these problems was often condemned. In South America some Catholic churchmen joined underground revolutionary movements and took up arms to fight against reactionary government forces, fifty Bolivian priests openly espoused armed revolution, and a group of Maryknoll priests and nuns assisted Guatemalan guerrillas. There is a diversity of theological commitment, but also a unity of shared concerns and theological perspectives. An excellent essay on the topic by Ernest Wallwork can be found in the textbook “Critical Issues in Modern Religion” – ‘Christians in the Revolution of the Oppressed’. The extreme religious escapism evident in Filipino flagellations and self crucifixions, and by similar devotional excesses elsewhere I do not see as a minority practice such as the snake handlers of some southern USA groups, but as a more general outlet of religious expression and social frustration. I see the sermon of Pope Francis as a signal, and hopefully heralding a repositioning and coming of age of a theology and option for the poor and oppressed..","date":"2013-07-06","mins":"5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/04/pope-francis-we-encounter-the-living-god-through-his-wounds/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Pope Francis: We encounter the Living God through His wounds"},{"id":"comment-206801","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Mean value of the various heights that Hugh lists is 180.50 cm, standard deviation of 4.26 cm, a variation of 2.36%.

The Synoptic gospels attempt to connect the Last Supper with the Passover meal may have been a late stage insertion, and for the Synoptic evangelists a symbolic passover meal. John asserts that the Friday was Preparation Day. This made the actual Passover fall on the sabbath and consequently of particular solemnity that year. It’s the main reason why the three bodies could not stay on their crosses beyond the Friday. There are two years that fit the bill, either 30 AD or 33 AD. There are only four major chronological events that give us any indication of when significant dates in Jesus’ life occurred. These are: (1) his birth – about 6 BC or 7 BC, a few years before the death of Herod the Great in 4 BC; (2) John the Baptist commences his preaching in the 15th year of Tiberius – depending on the method of counting this is sometime between Sept, 27 AD to Aug, 29 AD; (3) Pontius Pilate procurator 26 – 36 AD; (4) Jesus dies on a Friday which is also Preparation Day when Pilate is procurator. Meier concludes that the date is Friday, April 7, 30 AD. Essentially it depends on how long Jesus’ ministry lasted commencing with John the Baptist’s preaching, and Jesus’ death. Reading the Synoptics, it’s only about 18 months. In John, Jesus goes up to Jerusalem from Galilee, for a number of great feasts, probably when there would be large crowds. Meier concludes that the ministry lasted 2 years and a few months. Only if the ministry was some three years longer, could the 33 AD date be accepted as the year of Jesus’ death..","date":"2012-05-26","mins":"7:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"id":"comment-11626","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The evangelists were not writing history; They were writing gospels. In the gospel of Matthew, the disciple named as Levy the tax collector in Mark, is changed to Matthew, presumably to give this gospel apostolic authority. Papias writing in the second century says that Mark was Peter’s amanuensis (secretary), although one of the Fathers also says that Papias is a person of very little brain (I think it was Irenaeus). In the concluding verse of I Peter, apparently written by Sllvanus at Peter’s behest, “my son Mark .. (sends you greetings)”. However some authorities dispute this, as I Peter is written in the best Greek (i.e. Not Galilean – although Silvanus might be competent). So the guarantor of Marks’ gospel is said to be Peter. Luke’s gospel is said to have been written by the companion of Paul, and frequently addresses gentiles. Encyc Brit ,makes the following comments: ” … style of this preface follows the pattern of Greek historiography, and thus Luke is called the “historical” Gospel. Historically reliable information cannot be expected, however, because Luke’s sources were not historical; they rather were embedded in tradition and proclamation. Luke is, however, a historian in structuring his sources, especially in structuring his chronology into periods to show how God’s plan of salvation was unfolded in world history. …” Encyc Brit makes the following comments about John’s gospel: “Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown.” Thus it cannot be assumed that it was the disciple John who wrote the gospel of that name. One hypothesis is that John’s gospel and the epistles of that name were written and edited by a Johnannine school in Ephesus towards the end of the 1st century. There is much debate among the authorities, and it seems nothing is certain. An enlightening insight into the varying purposes of the gospels is arrived at by asking the question “When does Jesus become the son of God?” In Mark’s gospel, it is when the Holy Spirit descends on him at his baptism by John in the Jordan. In Matthew’s and Luke’s gospel it is at his conception. In John’s gospel, it is from the beginning of time “In the beginning was the Word” so each one of the gospels has its own particular intent and focus.

Here at the end of the world, our music groups still occasionally sing that hymn at Mass – the full force of the conservative reaction now prevalent elsewhere has still a little way to go in NZ. I remember the hymn being very popular in various youth and family groups during the 1960s. JV: I believe that one only sees contradictions in the gospels if you fall into the trap of interpreting them literally. To do this one ignores the literary artistry that is a gospel. Each one of the evangelists has his own purpose in writing a gospel. Both infancy narratives place their birth stories in Bethlehem, to suit a “prophecy” that the Messiah will be born there. It is quite likely that Jesus was actually born in Nazareth. Matthew does not even know that Nazareth is the home town of Joseph and Mary, and mentions no stable nor inn. Matthew’s purpose is at least two fold – his gospel is intended to include the gentiles, so he has wise men coming from the east, and includes Ruth a Moabite in the genealogy; he also wants to present Jesus as the new Moses and uses several devices to show this. He wants to bring him out of Egypt, so has to have a reason for getting him there first. The Last Supper was not a Passover meal, but a farewell meal, which symbolically became associated with the Seder. And so on. Meier’s text is extremely authoritative, and has been cited by Pope Benedict in some of his writings. It was partly written as a reponse to tendencies in the Jesus Seminar group. You can probably find Meier’s credentials on the web. At the time of writing his book 1991, the jacket blurb included the following: “John Paul Meier is a Biblical scholar and Catholic priest. He attended St. Joseph’s Seminary and College (B.A., 1964), Gregorian University [Rome] (S.T.L, 1968), and the Biblical Institute [Rome] (S.S.D., 1976). Meier is the author of nine books and more than 60 scholarly articles. He was editor of The Catholic Biblical Quarterly and president of the Catholic Biblical Association.

My own comments there attempted to provide a terse summary of these and my own interpretation of its significance. The experts allow that even if carbon testing on the papyrus shows a 4th century date, this is not necessarily significant as the material is readily available on the black market. Tests are now proceeding on the ink which should show whether it is authentic or a forgery. It may be significant that the owner, whoever it might be is said to have expressed an interest in selling it. Should the fragment prove to be authentic, I have surmised that it may well be a copy of an attempt to resolve a 2nd century conflict within some gnostic sect on whether marriage may be a valid option for its members or not, in view of the early expectation of the parousia. By asserting that Jesus was himself married, the writer would be attempting to validate marriage. The fragment cannot inform that Jesus was himself married, as the assertion is very likely spurious.","date":"2012-09-21","mins":"4:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/21/really-we-must-come-to-god-by-faith-not-by-sight/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Really?

The campaign was a major influence in shaping a sense of national identity in both countries. We are seeing several TV documentaries and magazine articles from archives and records of soldier’ memories. Recently there have been documentaries on the chaplains’ roles. It seems that during both world wars, it was a common practice before battle for the Catholic padres accompanying the troops on the front lines to invite all who wanted to receive Holy Communion beforehand, regardless of their religious affiliation. In fact the relationship between all the different padres generally seems to have been cordial and cooperative. When the troops returned home after cessation of hostilities, they were disappointed to discover that the old sectarian differences had again resurfaced, and that the unity of purpose once evident in the thick of battle against the common enemy had now been set aside. Some commentators have attributed this apparent hypocrisy as being one cause of a falling away from religion that occurred during the 20th century from the 1920s onward. Perhaps we are seeing more of a sense of unity between the churches now, initiated by Pope John XXIII, and followed up by his successors, and also by the Second Vatican Council. In Wellington there is an Ataturk memorial, commemorating the conciliatory attitude of Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, and victorious commander of the Turkish forces at Gallipoli. It was largely through his efforts that has enabled access to the many ANZAC war graves there. However in modern Turkey, it is now a different story, where the trend to Islamisation away from a secular state, seeks to downgrade the memory of Ataturk, and to attribute the Turkish victory solely to the will of Allah. Such are the fickle perceptions and reactions of humankind, forgetful of the past, and mindful only of the aspirations of a moment..","date":"2015-05-25","mins":"8:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/24/rejecting-authenticity-out-of-hand/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rejecting Authenticity Out of Hand"},{"id":"comment-19644","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Most parishes, dioceses and churches have their own web sites these days, but they’re of varying quality.

It is certainly considered as such by its owners, and by a very large catchment of Christians throughout the world. It is not a “laboratory specimen” – It is unique. It is true, as he ssys, that this subjective value necessarily influences what can be done and not done in any scientific investigation. For instance, it constrains the amount of destructive testing that might be carried out. Nor were normal laboratory conditions with its more usual lack of time constraints available to the STURP team. The programmes they formulated had to be planned so as to be completed within whatever time would be allowed to them. Shortly before their departure, the custodial authorities asked that their “12 hour programme” be sent; in response they sent their 96 hour protocol instead. It was clear that Turin politics were at work, another hurdle they had to deal with. There were delays in arrival of essential equipment. The Italian Customs authorities also impounded the equipment, merely because of the standard radiation sticker on their X ray machines. These are only some of the obstacles that STURP had to overcome. It is a tribute to their peristence and determination that they achieved as much as could be done within the time available. Dr Berry also castigates the commenters on this blog, for tarnishing the reputation of the three laboratories in question. It is not merely the laboratories who may have been at fault.

It follows a common gnostic practice of being in dialogue form rather than narrative form as in the canonical gospels, although note the long discourse sections in John ch 13 17. [John’s gospel was suspected of showing gnostic tendencies until about 180 AD, and Eastern Orthodoxy remains hostile towards the Book of Revelations.] The only known commentaries on gnosticism until the mid 20th century were those as filtered by the naturally hosile proto Nicene fathers, and access to these early maunscripts following the Nag Hammadi discoveries has led to a greater understanding of what the various forms of gnosticism were about. Elaine Pagels of course has written extensively about them, but of course she is known to have her own singular view about them. Personally, as a some time student of general Religious Studies, I consider them of value in throwing light on what the various gnostic sects believed, and they are also informative of an apparent evolutionary trend for religious movements to fracture in various ways towards sectarianism. Following the lead of Ireneus, orthodox Christianity will always show hostility towards such manuscripts as they are clearly heretical.

Until then the only serious work had been the forensic pathology examination of the photographs of Pia(1898) by Vignon and Delage, and of Enrie(1931) by Barbet, Bucklin and Willis. The work of the 1969 Commission was all done in secret, the names of the participants not even being known until 1973. Nearly all of them were chosen from the diocese of Piedmont, although all reasonably expert in their particular specialties. They were not all Catholics, but included agnostics and Protestants. The nature of the cloth was not even known until Raes was able to confirm that it was indeed linen of a particular flax, and with some contamination of cotton. In 1973, Frei was commissioned to offer some photographic advice, based on his reputation in police investigation work. Frei was able to take the opportunity only then of collecting his first pollen samples. The findings of the 1973 commission were necessarily limited by the constraints of the intended scope of their work. The impetus for the STURP team possibly originated with the discovery of the 3 D properties of the photographs using the VP8 analyser, and the decision of a few American scientists to attempt exploiting the opportunity of the intended 1978 ostentation. At this stage the nature of the image was completely unknown. Barrie Schworz was recruited to join the team. He tells of his anticipation of a free trip to Turin and expectation that it was no more than a painting and that would be the end of it. But of course that was not to be, and the rest is history. Such was the state of ignorance even as late as 1978. The setting of the 1988 C14 Radiocarbon dating was fraught with conflicts of egos, thwarted intentions of sampling protocols, the scepticism of some custodial authorities, the ignorance of so called experts in textiles and other disciplines, and an assortment of various personal and professional agendas, and finally the selection of a totally unrepresentative sample. Few I feel could come out of the whole sorry exercise with any kind of worthwhile credit at all. What assurances can there ever be that human egos can be set aside, and a proper disciplined professional approach to any future scientific investigation can ever be achieved? Is it possible for human subjectivity to be set aside in any such investigation? Or will fallen human nature, with all its personal ambitions and agendas, always compromise what ought to be a proper objective assessment of this most important treasure?.","date":"2013-10-11","mins":"6:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/10/responding-directly-to-colin-berry/","cat":"science","title":"Responding Directly to Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-146195","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My advice is “Don’t let it beat you, David G.” Keep on keeping on if you can.

Earthquakes have not affected the C14 dating of any other object, and it is highly speculative and dubious to assert that it affected the Shroud dating, when other more credible explanations for skewing the date are available (e.g. Cotton contamination of C14 sample). The late Ray Rogers gave strong arguments as to why the Shroud image was not caused by radiation of any kind. The release of radon gas during seismic activity together with other seismic effects, such as variations in geo magnetic and electric fields may have been a necessary contributing factor but it is questionable as a primary cause.

Ussher was no intellectual slug, was an expert on semitic languages, and remains a highly respected biblical scholar for his time. In particular he is credited with correctly distinguishing authentic and spurious epistles credited to Ignatius of Antioch of the 2nd century. By back working the biblical genealogies he had calculated the date of Creation during the Saturday evening of October 22, 4004 BC, somewhat older than that calculated by Johannes Kepler, who was famous for his laws of planetary motion. The Danish Nicolaus Steno, originally trained in medecine, made major break throughs in anatomy, including discovering the parotid salivary duct, and other discoveries in anatomy which had remained unchanged since the time of Galen. Appointed as physician to Grand duke Ferdinand in Florence, he became fascinated with the layered limestone strata of Italy. He made major discoveries in crystallography, particularly quartz. Steno was the first to realize that the Earth’s crust contains a chronological history of geologic events and that the history may be deciphered by careful study of the strata and fossils. He rejected the idea that mountains grow like trees, proposing instead that they are formed by alterations of the Earth’s crust. Most scientists of his time considered that fossils such as shells either grew in the rocks, or else were the inundation remnants of Noah’s flood, and Steno found little support for his ideas, except from Gottfried Leibniz. Steno was constrained by the religious bigotry of his time to compress his geology into a period of 6000 years. Having learnt their lesson from the Galileo case, the Catholic Church was one of the first institutions to abandon the 6000 year old world history concept. Nevertheless elsewhere the idea survived well into the 18th century. Disillusioned with the backbiting and rivalries within science, Steno abandoned it and caught religion, converted to Catholicism (he had worked with the younger Medici family in Florence) took Holy Orders, and was commissioned as the Pope’s envoy to Germany and Scandinavia where he lived and died in extreme voluntary frugality. Pope John Paul II beatified him in 1992, somewhat ironically on October 23 within a day of the same date that Archbishop Ussher had set for the creation of the world. Steno’s biography can be found in Alan Cutler’s “The Seashell on the Mountain Top”, Heinemann 2003.

What bad science and bad religion seem to share in common is a certain arrogance and lack of humility. There are certainly any number of examples of bad science. However, science itself seemed able and bound to accommodate itself when sufficent evidence was mounted to discard older discredited theories. However the process of getting there was usually fraught with much disputation, often acrimonious. The phlogiston theory had to give way to Joseph Priestley’s oxygen; Despite the atomic theory being a working hypothesis for chemists from the 18th c. The experimental physicist Ernst Mach was denying the existience of atoms as late as 1905, dirving Boltzman to suicide; Soon afterwards Einstein demonstrated their existence from applying Boltzman’s theories to Brownian movement; Similarly “conservation of mass” was disproved as an infallible statement from Einstein’s E = mc^2 equation; Immutability of the elements was altered by Rutherford’s work in radioactivity; Laplace’s insistence on determinism was dealt a blow by the demonstrable randomness of quantum mechanics. The debate concerning entropy, may have originated with Teilhard de Chardin’s observation of the development of complexity being an apparently opposing principle. Many of Teilhard’s forecasts, particularly relating to inter personal communication have now come to pass. Nevertheless, the law of increasing entropy has been shown to be true for all observable closed systems, notwithstanding increasing complexity. However as recently as 1978, Ira Levine was able to state in his text book “Physical Chemistry” that “There is no guarantee that laws that hold on a terrestial scale must also hold on a cosmic scale. Although there is no evidence for a cosmic violation of the second law (of thermodynamics) our experience is insufficient to rule out such a violation. (etc)” op. Cit. P.96. He mentions the discredited steady state theory of Hoyle et al. Levine I think demonstrates the correct attitude of scientific humility. Michio Kaku in his “Parallel Universes” makes the point that the plethora of “goldilocks” properties, on both the micro and macro scale has persuaded a number of scientists that the universe, and in particular our own solar system, did not eventuate by chance, but rather by cosmic design. Yet others less credulous take refuge in the invention of the so called “anthropic principle”.

While Dawkins et al might argue that random fluctuations, natural selection and Darwinian survival of the fittest are all that is required to explain our present situation, a more fundamental approach is required. All that exists in the universe depends on the fundamental properties of matter. These properties could very well have been somewhat different from what they actually are. A few minor examples: “In order to create life, our planet must have been stable for hundreds of millions of years. But such a stable world is extremely difficult to make. Commencing with matter, if the proton particle were just 1% heavier, all atomic nuclei would be unstable and fly apart, and life would be impossible. To create DNA, protons must be stable for hundreds of millions of years. When we look at the four fundamental forces of nature, these are also critical. If the weak force were either weaker or stronger, then neutrinos could not form supernovae, and there would again be no elements heavier than iron.” There are many such examples Any search on “Goldilocks zones” or “Goldilocks properties of matter” can provide persuasive evidence that there is an intelligence which shapes our ends. Getting lost in the detail provides little further enlightenment. There is no fundamental reason why the universe should not be otherwise than what it is. That the universe is what it is, can only point to a Creator God, timeless and omniscient.

The fragments had been deliberately stained with chromium and iron sulfate, and the teeth subjected to artificial abrasion. Identity of the perpretator remained a mystery, Suspects included the discoverer Charles Dawson, motive – seeking admission to Royal Society; a friend of Dawson’s – Samuel Woodhead; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who lived nearby; Sir Arthur Keith prominent in museum circles. Teilhard worked with Dawson and was also a suspect; Rev Rutler says Stephen Jay Gould a palaeontologist was convinced of Teilhard’s guilt, but Gould only obtained his Ph D in 1960, so could not have been privy to the identity of the hoaxer. In 1996 two British palaeontologists examined contents of a trunk stored at the British museum in 1975, and discovered bones stained exactly the same way as the Piltdown remains. The trunk belonged to one Martin A C Hinton, keeper of zoology at British Museum in 1936. Hinton had worked with Dawson in 1912, and his requests for a weekly wage had been rebuffed. It seemed that Hinton had planted the bones to embarass Dawson, and had used the bones in the trunk to practise on beforehand. So even reverend gentlemen such as Rev Rutler can poison the well, and besmirch the character of those whose theology they disagree with. But Teilhard leaves a better legacy than Rutler can ever hope to attain..","date":"2012-10-07","mins":"2:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/06/rutler-the-mainstream-media-falls-for-the-latest-hoax/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rutler: The Mainstream Media Falls for the Latest Hoax"},{"id":"comment-18712","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Our climate in NZ is more benign, though variable.

On the advisability of dating the Shroud, the Cardinal asked the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, obtaining the nihil obstat from both. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, at that time Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, stated that there were no objections to date the Shroud, provided that the operation was well planned and carried out among other tests that would complete those of 1978.” None of the stated requirements were satisfied.

The Shroud puts the Biblical literalists into a similar bind as it does the skeptics! Christianity is a product of history and the canon of scripture is the product of the early Church, not the other way round! The writers of scripture were not concerned to write history in the style of Heredotus or even Josephus, but to proclaim their understanding of the gospel for the congregations of their time. The Shroud image is not mentioned in the gospels for a very good reason! It would no doubt have confused and perplexed the Jewish disciples for whom any image was anathema. Likewise the “unclean” burial cloth was also an embarrassment. Doubtless they were relieved to send it off to a ‘good home’ in non Jewish Edessa. No doubt American Creationists will continue to believe in the literalism of Genesis, and not see it for what it is, an Israelite expression of the truth that God is the Master of Creation; Our modern understanding that He chose to do this through an evolutionary process does not change this fundamental truth. I recommend they read “The Seashell on the Mountaintop” by Alan Cutler, Heinemann 2003, the story of Nicolaus Steno, 1638 1686, the founder of modern geology.

I think it means involvement with community. The Salvation Army and the St Vincent de Paul Society have been doing this for over a hundred years. The corporal works of mercy come into it. Our great NZ poet James K Baxter set up a commune for waifs and strays at a place called Hiruharama (= Jerusalem) a long way up the Wanganui River which had been a former mission station led by Blessed Mother Mary Aubert (from Lyons). In the foreword of his “Jerusalem Daybook” he tells the story of a certain hermit who bought a large corrugated tank and furnished it with the necessities of life. There he lived a blameless life without interruption from the world. But there was one great hardship. Every morning and evening volleys of bullets would rip through the walls of his tank. He learned to lie on the floor to avoid being shot, but occasionally sustained wounds; the walls were pieced by many holes that let in the wind and the daylight and sometimes the rain. At first he plugged up the holes, but gradually began to use them for a useful purpose. He began to watch the people passing by, and to see the outside world. Eventually the tank rusted away and fell to pieces, and he walked out of it with little regret. There was a man with a gun standing outside. “I suppose you will kill me now” said the hermit, “but I would like to know why have you been persecuting me, why are you my enemy when I have never done you any harm?” The other man laid the gun down and smiled at him. “I am not your enemy”, he said. And the hermit saw that there were scars on the other man’s hands and feet, and these scars were shining like the sun. But Baxter tells the story much better than my brief paraphrase of it. There’s a great world out there, but we need to be involved with it!.","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"7:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/24/scientific-truth-is-a-pathway-to-god/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Scientific truth is a pathway to God"},{"id":"comment-165573","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, the Jeffrey Tucker reference you gave above is one of the most profound articles that I have ever read about Oscar Wilde.

This is a presumption. It may be that the Shroud image is naturalistic, and one might then expect that if given adequate access to the relic, then Science might some day discover all that is to be known about it. However in our present state of knowledge it is equally possible that the image has a supernatural origin. How is the competent scientist of Faith to take account of this very real possibility? Does he ignore the possibility that it may be miraculous, knowing than that whatever scientific endeavours he persists in may well be fruitless, as his Science may be incapable of providing the answer? Or perhaps he may look for some kind of boundary where Science and the Supernatural might meet? This second path seems to be the one trod by such as Fanti, Carpenteri and Jackson. For various reasons they seem to have discarded the purely naturalistic explanation and seem to be searching for some kind of amalgam of science and the supernatural. Yes, it involves conjecture and speculation and an agnostic scientist is unlikely ever to accept their conclusions. As in all such new ideas they will sometimes go astray, as seems to have been the case with the Carpenteri paper. But what if they happen to be right in their suspicions that a purely naturalistic explanation will never suffice? In the absence of adequate experimentation, a purely naturalistic explanation cannot yet be ruled out. I should like to see a concerted programme of experiments with time expired lab animals to see if it is possible to produce Shroud like images by naturalistic means. Whether that is indeed possible cannot yet be excluded. In the meantime, other well meaning attempts to explore the boundaries between science and the supernatural need not be deplored. However, they might be constructively criticised when their unwarranted speculations are asserted as more than just possibilities, and are published as formal papers in scientific journals.

It included such worthies as Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Diderot and the like, united in their anti clericalism, and lacking the humility to admit the possibility of any kind of divine revelation whatsoever. It can boast as its ultimate logical outcome the Reign of Terror which followed the French Revolution, the founding of Freemasonry, and Free thinkers dominated the French Academy of Science when Yves Delage attempted to present a scientific paper on the forensics of the Shroud of Turin. Having no objective criterion but one’s own subjective interpretation of what comprises adequate reason, it ultimately led to the totally subjective philosophy of Michel Foucault and others of his ilk.

Here goes for about the 12th attempt: Concerning the D’Arcy memorandum alleging that the image was painted: The position is clearly set out in Markwardt’s 2001 paper “Conspiracy against the Shroud”, and Wilson 1978 also comments on it. In 1900 Ulysse Chevalier apparently had available to him a near finished Latin draft from the Troyes diocesan archives addressed to a Scribe, which would imply that the alleged memorandum was never even sent to the Scribe, let only to Anti pope Clement VII. However rather than producing this draft, Chevalier cobbled together a text from prior separate notes, which included editing marks such as marginal notes, cross outs, and substitute wording, and manufactured for it an end of 1389 date; as by its archival retention it would be clear from the near finished draft for the scribe that the memorandum had not in fact been sent to Clement. Markwardt refers to the two source documents: “In 1993, Hilda Leynen discovered that two distinct drafts of the D’Arcis Memorandum were maintained in the Champagne collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, one very rough and containing bracketed words, and the other a relatively neat and polished product.” From Chevalier’s cobbled Latin text, Herbert Thurston published an English translation in the Catholic periodical “The Month” in 1903. Wilson 1978 provides the full text of Thurston’s translation as Appendix B, the fraud apparently even escaping Wilson’s attention. The relevant text cited by Markwardt is included in his Note 6: ‘6 The memorandum refers to an alleged investigation conducted, in about 1355, by Henri de Poitiers, Bishop of Troyes. “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered the fraud and how the cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed.” ‘ Wilson makes the point that Latin lacks a definite article, and that the verb used was not “pingere” (to paint) but “depingere” (to copy). Thus the key phrase can be just as easily translated as: “… by an artist who had copied it … ” which sheds rather a different light on the whole bizarre episode. Thus relying on a questionable translation of a fraudulent memorandum may be the stuff by which art historians might make a living, but to others it may seem rather slender grounds for asserting that the origin of the Shroud image was ever an artist’s paint brush! Very likely, D’Arcis’ alleged copy assuming it existed, may have been commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original she had taken from St Stephen’s at Besancon for safe keeping and the venerable cleric was confused about the matter. The 1880 assertion that both the Besancon and Piedmont Shrouds were authentic burial cloths beggars belief, would seem to be based on no more than an excessive piety, by 1880 the French Revolution would already have deposed of the Besancon icon, the reverend gentleman would no longer have had access to it, nor would he have had access to the 1898 Pia photography..","date":"2014-11-26","mins":"4:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"id":"comment-81735","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If we’re looking for competitors for true sanctity, then my vote goes to Blessed Frederic Ozanam, founder of the St Vincent de Paul Society.

He seems to favour the idea that leeches were used to paint the blood stains. The main source for the claim seems to be the work of Heller & Adler (1981) that Kelly Kearse mentions in a recent posting. The Shroud com “Facts 3” page also cites Schwalbe & Brillante as sources, but I had not been entirely successful in tracing their work. I suspect it all comes back to Heller & Adler. Svensson & Heimburger also refer to the H&A 1981 paper, including the following comment: “From a forensic point of view, we must notice that this article has been published in a peer reviewed journal (Canadian Society of Forensic Sciences Journal) dedicated to Forensic Science.” They then list seven results which they deem the most important. They give the following entry on item 7: ” ‘Protease tests, leaving no residues’. This is very important: “Within a half hour this solution completely “dissolved” the non birefringent red particulate coated fibrils coating, leaving no particulate residues… This protease treatment also removes the golden yellow fibrils, corroborating their identification as “serum” coated fibrils. Interestingly, fibrils freed of their coating using this technique closely resemble the non image fibrils when viewed under phase contrast…” I take it that here they are quoting an H&A finding, and, unless I’m mistaking the intent, it seems to me that here is the main source for the assertion that there is no image under the blood stains. Another aspect raised by CB was the very low potassium levels, which he claimed also suit his leech theory. Low potassium levels, are yet another by product of physical trauma as explained in this paper.

I think it is thoughtful and well written. However, let us not forget that Colin’s web site seems to be agenda driven, with its heading “The Turin Shroud: but for the pseudo science it might have been dismissed long ago as a medieval fake” Contrast this with the more circumspect heading on Dan’s site intro – “Is the Shroud real? Probably.” Colin would win more friends if he was less provocative as to his intentions, and could demonstrate a modicum of open mindedness about even the possibility of authenticity. However I particularly like the point he makes about “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” – for I suspect there are many such. In the meantime “Peace!” and let us hope that it is more than just a “Cease fire!” I have been attempting to give some thought about the question of “pareidolia” as to their real presence or not, and what objective ways there might be of ascertaining this, or at least a better indication than mere subjectivity. There has already been extensive comment following the posting of the recent paper on this topic. One of the shortcomings of that paper, and indeed a considerable volume of most other material on the web concerning image analysis and identification, is that they all seem to seek to make comparisons with known pre existing imagery, such as for example the attempt to make comparisons with an alleged back of cloth facial image with the known front of cloth image. This approach clearly has limitations, and does not allow for the discovery of anything new not yet known, or at least possibly admissible. A passing thought is the simple human ability to recognise ordinary alphabetic lettering despite a variety of fonts. By objective measures only, there would seem little to connect say Lucida Black with Times Roman, serif fonts with non serif, Gothic and Arial, etc. Yet the human eye and brain readily succeed in achieving this recognition. I think it doubtful that any objective measure could succeed in confirming this identification in the same degree. OCR succeeds to some extent, but perhaps it needs to identify the font character set beforehand. I suspect that similar comments may apply to pareidolia, that there are inherent difficulties with objective measurements. The frequency distribution of any variate is completely defined by its statistical moments, although it is rare to go higher than the fourth – 1st moment = central tendency (mean); 2nd moment = variability (standard deviation); 3rd moment = skewness; 4th moment = flatness or peakedness (kurtosis). Higher moments tend to be unstable. The situation becomes somewhat more complex for multi variate distributions, and the grey scale pixels on the Shroud cloth comprise degrees of greyness on a 2 dimensional matrix (surface of the cloth). There is also the backgound inherent banding from the weave of the cloth. It occurs to me that it should be possible to divide the cloth into a grid of squares wherein the various normalised moments can be ascertained. There is a further complication with areas which may be blood stained or not blood stained, and whether the cell is an image area or non image area. Ideally it should be possible to ascertain grid moment outliers as areas of interest for further inquiry into pareidolia phenomena. Yet a further complication is that pareidolia imply a geometrical shape, which again implies some kind of inter connectedness between neighbouring pixels. The computing requirements for such an investigation would be phenomenal, and perhaps it is no wonder that subjectivity has to date been the mainstay of attempts at identifying pareidolia – however such subjectivity has proved to be controversial and lacking agreement. I think perhaps I have now exhausted my present thoughts on the topic, but possibly it may continue to tease my regrettably now senescent brain. Perhaps a younger investigator may see something worthwhile in pursuing a few of these ideas..","date":"2013-01-12","mins":"4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/12/stop-taking-cudgels-to-each-other/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Stop taking cudgels to each other?"},{"id":"comment-19694","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I would think that I would go further than some of the comments above. In BT’s original comment for instance, I think that there can be a presumption that the technology available to any medieval forger, with all the properties that the TS is known to have, ought to be discernible to a competent technologist of the 21st century, if the TS had indeed been forged. That no such technology can be so discerned, is for many a persuasive argument that forgery is at least a very unlikely.scenario. Yannick Clement has often made the point that the bloodstains have been made before the image was formed, and that there is no image under the bloodstains Furthermore the flow of the bloodstains conform with that of a crucufied man. This has been discussed in considerable depth by a number of forensic specialists. We then would have to say that by some means your unknown forger was able to create an image which was a true negative, that the brightness of individual “pixels” encoded 3 D information, and so on, all that trouble just to produce a result that on first inspection gives just a watery looking pale image that could only be truly discerned in the 20th century from photography, or VP8 analysis. The word “symbol” is an understatement, and “mystery” is much closer to the mark. Most of us are well past the point of claiming as BT alleges, that as the image cannot be explained, Shroudies claim that this is ” a convincing argument for authenticity”. But together with all the other properties of the image, it still remains a powerful argument for authenticity. There are various naturalistic theories of how the image may have been formed, but none have been subjected to the crucible of rigorous testing. Neither a naturalistic, nor artificial, nor even a miraculous means can yet be asserted, despite all the research that the TS has been subjected to..","date":"2012-11-30","mins":"7:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/30/strong-ignorance-is-not-strong-evidence/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Strong ignorance is not strong evidence"},{"id":"comment-23105","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Love the cartoon.

The Shroud was not “turned down in 1390 by Clement VII”, nor was it required to state that “it was not authentic.” Permission was obtained to exhibit it on the understanding that the De Charnays should continue to describe it as a “likeness or representation”. Rather than being prompted by the Bishop D’Arcis’ memo on the matter, Clement may well have suspected its true Constantinopolitan origins, and therefore adopted this requirement for reasons of discretion. If Clement had any real reasons for suspecting a forgery because of the D’Arcis memo, he would not have twice ordered D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication, nor would he have permitted the exhibitions to continue. His actions are more consistent with seeking to avoid an adverse reaction from either Rome or Constantinople. Concerning the Besancon Shroud: It may well be the case that it was a planted substitute for the true Shroud, and its somewhat similarly vague presentation was an attempt at imitating some of its principal features. Quite likely this was the actual cloth giving rise to D’Arcis complaint being mistakenly misinformed as being painted, his error being to ascribe this to the Lirey Shroud..","date":"2015-12-21","mins":"11:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-216982","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Mario’s comments above make a great deal more sense to me than those of the other correspondents here.

We have Robert de Clari’s evidence that a very similar cloth was exhibited at the Blachernae church in Constantinople every Friday, regardless of whether it was Easter or Christmas. I would also hazard a guess that the western “relic craze” up to the 14th century, was merely a copycat mimicking of the several relics known to have been pillaged from Constantinople, with small time forgers attempting to cash in on some of the topical action.

There were early Jewish Christian conclaves there, even in apostolic times, and certainly Sts Peter and Paul were both there. It did not require the presence of the imaged Shroud of Christ for a knowledge of his actual appearance, and it seems likely that many Jewish men were in fact bearded, and wore their hair long, which contrasted with the prevailing Greek and Roman fashions, clean shaven and cropped locks. However there is at this time a variety of appearance in such iconography as there is, and this would seem to be an important point. The iconography needs to make a connection with those to whom it is directed, and therefore an artistic and evangelizing imperative prevails, that the subject should not seem culturally alien. A case study example: The first Catholic missionaries to New Zealand were French Marists from Lyons to the Maori mission stations, soon followed by Irish clergy for the Catholic settlers, perhaps fleeing the Irish troubles, or the penal colonies in Australia. Even in my boyhood, the statuary and holy pictures of Christ, the Holy Family and the various saints, inevitably reflected a European complexion, blue eyes and fair skinned which I heard one priest describe as the “Iced lolly” variety. But this is not the only kind that occurs. Try this simple Google experiment: search on “Maori Christ” and click on ‘Images’, and you will see the tattooed moko, the feathered cloaks, and the highly prized huia feather as hair adornment showing high born status, together with the other cultural features, such as unshod feet. Doubtless other cultural ‘icongraphy’ also occurs, whether it be Chinese, Korean, or Filipino. The earliest Shroud like images of Christ appear to be the St Catherine’s Pantocrator, the Homs vase image, and the gold solidus of 692, all seemingly commissioned by Justinian II. Following his defeats and eventual reinstatement, Justinian seems to have interpreted his earlier representations as a sign of divine wrath, and abandoned these earlier attempts at realism. The iconoclastic movement also no doubt played a part. However the Image of Edessa also seems to have had a major influence in church iconography at this time, and there is an almost universal consistency in the portrayals claiming to be of Mandylion status. I think it is extensive enough to demonstrate that indeed, a single image can and did in fact spark off an artistic revolution across a very wide area!.","date":"2015-12-25","mins":"4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-217088","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Conjecture: From a Mario posting above it seems that reports of Quem quaeritis date back to at least 1100, and the Troyes comment suggests that an imaged shroud was unlikely to be used in these ceremonies.

The collapse was not caused by the weight of the train, but occurred during a violent storm, and failed because the lateral bracing was insufficient to withstand the wind loading from the storm. I spent some 5 years on Railway bridge construction and another eight years in a Bridge Design Office early in my engineering career, so it’s something I was once expert in.

It has been a wonderful experience meeting you all on line, even when our views were completely different. The tragic loss for me is that I’m unlikely to meet you all again, except by happen stance. Here at the other end of the world, there seems to be little interest in the Shroud of Christ. Even during the exposition earlier this year, there was scarcely a mention of it in the Catholic News media, and I note that even Cath News NZ has only a few token news items about it on its web site. I ought to have written something about it for them, but I didn’t. I did run a few well attended lectures about the Shroud for my U3 A group, Perhaps with the extra free time now available, I can develop that into something more. God seems seldom to intrude into human affairs, but treats us all as free spirits. This was the way that Dan Porter ran his blog, seldom intruding, no heavy handed moderating, nor imposing his own particular perspective, but leaving us free to exchange our views, no matter how well or how badly informed we might have been. There was always someone else only too ready to correct us, contradict or lampoon even, no matter that they themselves were right or wrong. As a child, I recall my Nana had a small icon of the Shroud facial image, and sometimes I came across the occasional popular magazine article. My first real education on the Shroud began in 1960 with a presentation, likely based on Barbet’s work and given by our University Dominican chaplain,to a roomful of sceptical engineering students, but it impressed a few of us at the time. Much of the content has since been debated on this site, and will now persist in being argued elsewhere. I purchased Ian Wilson’s 1970 book, and learnt a great deal more about it. I found Dan’s site I think in 2011, and convinced by Wilson that the Shroud was the Mandylion, blogged accordingly. My views have since changed and I now think it was something else, perhaps the Image of Camuliana, the Image of God Incarnate. The pollen debate has been disconcerting but still an adequate argument. I continue to be persuaded that the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. No one in medieval times had the anatomical knowledge to persuade 20th century pathologists that it was nothing else, perfection of Greek statuary notwithstanding, and the historic clues prior to Lirey are adequate or at least suggestive. The Jerusalem aragonite limestone on the feet is persuasive, and the image is a close match with the gospel accounts of the crucifixion. The cause of the Image continues to be enigmatic, but I suspect not necessarily a divine mystery. It took Colin Berry some four years of experimenting before he persuaded himself that he might have found some kind of an answer, but if it was a medieval artisan, then we don’t know who it was, and he left no trace of what must have been several failures before he struck gold. And he never ever did it again. Some thoughts on professionals and amateurs. The patriarch Abraham began as a herdsman, Jesus as some kind of woodworker; the followers he chose were ordinary common folk, fishermen mainly, and Paul was a tent maker, hardly prepossessing material for a major religious movement which now pervades the globe. The mathematics of Pythagoras remain as true as they ever were. But in the other sciences, what was heresy yesterday is tomorrow’s dogma, and what was dogma is now heresy. Similarly history, always written by pro tem victors, is persistently rewritten. The Renaissance men knew nothing of such specialisation but sought an all round general education and comprehensive world experience, and it is they I have sought to emulate. I shall miss you all.

You can find a compendium of his works at: http://www.nzlf.auckland.ac.nz/author/?a id=8&qsid=30 A potted biography can be found on Wiki. Likewise the images of Baxter can also be found, but are rather more respectable than the memory I have of him walking barefoot, and unkempt with straggly beard around Wellington Railway station, sometimes fingering rosary beads. He struggled with alcoholism for much of his life, converted to Catholicism, had a profoundly spiritual awareness, and wrote not only some hard nosed poetry, plays and other works, but also regular columns for the Catholic newspapers. He was named for James Keir Hardy a notable founder of the Labour movement in Britain, his father a conscientious objector during the Great War was subject to severe military punishment on the front lines. In later life James K founded a commune for waifs and strays at Hiruhirama ( = Jerusalem) on the Wanganui River at the site of an early mission station established by Susan Aubert. He had an intense awareness of Maori spirituality and this permeates some of his work (e.g. “Jerusalem Daybook”). I can easily imagine Dominic’s strange little man as a kind of incarnation of Baxter, who brought an awareness of Christ with his presence. We ought not to dismiss too lightly such as those who unkempt and bedraggled walk our streets. They may well be closer to Christ than we may imagine ourselves to be.

I would agree that these would most likely arrive at a standard fixed form. Peoples of this era and even indigenous people today had and have specialists with remarkable recall of oral transmission. I see it here in NZ with both Samoan and Maori who can recite very long genealogies entirely from memory handed down from their forbears. It’s also evident in their knowledge of astronomy for navigation. [Recall Alex Haley’s “Roots” and his encounters with African peoples] These oral traditions (particularly Matthew’s) would have been recited as part of liturgies. The Parousia was soon expected and there would be little point in setting them down in writing until it became apparent that eye witnesses were dying out, and the Parousia was not as immediate as they had imagined. I could agree that there may well have been a few written sources which were available for the evangelists to draw on. 2) The argument from Luke’s Acts, I believe will not stand up. There is too much discrepancy between Paul’s own teachings in his epistles and Luke’s interpretation, for Acts to be contemporaneous with Paul. There is no need for Acts to record the death of Paul, and this is a flimsy argument to assert that Acts predates it. 3) If Papias has Mark as Peter’s amenuensis, why does he then say that Mark wrote as he remembered, but not in the right order, as if Peter was not then available to correct any errors that Papias believed Mark had got incorrect? And clearly Matthw and Luke both draw on Mark’s final gospel (95% of mark in Matthew). 4) Concerning the prophecy of the temple’s destruction, one could brutally say that these are words that Matthew and Luke put into Jesus’ mouth, after the event. It is not included in Mark 13, in the discourse on the end time. However, with the political situation in Jerusalem from about 65 AD, any astute observer would likely have had little diificulty in foreseeing the destruction of the temple together with the associated Roman suppression. 5) I see the final redactors of the gospels, particlarly Matthew and Luke, not so much as original authors, but more as editors each with a specific purpose, who assembled a mix of oral traditions and written material, set their own particular viewpoint upon this material, before the gospels attained their final form.

Antoninus in the 6th century reports seeing a titulus in Jerusalem (see below). Wiki states that sometime before 1145 the present relic was placed in a box which has the seal of a cardinal who became Pope in 1144 (which would seem to be Pope Lucius II). So it seems that the present artifact dates at least from this time. I would think that Helena was well enough endowed with crucifixion relics, to have insufficent motive to arrange a forgery of any other. I should also think that both Helena and Lucius would be suffiently versed in Greek and Latin, not to reverse the lettering. Thiede argues that the lettering may have been done by a Jewish scribe (hence the reversed lettering) and the order of Hebrew, Greek and Latin, matches what is historically plausible, whereas a forger would have adhered to what is in the NT canon [John = Hebrew, Latin, Greek]. Joe Nickell is known to dismiss this argument as second guessing, as forgers commonly do the unexpected. I’m not sure why you argue that the 1st century scripts were unknown in 1000 AD. If the original had badly deteriorated during the first millenium, then Lucius or someone else may have thought to create a replica from what then remained. The report of Antoninus differs from the present text. ‘The 6th century pilgrim Antoninus from Piacenza describes a Titulus in Jerusalem and its inscription: it said “Hic est rex Iudeaorum” (Here is the king of the Jews), while the one kept in Rome shows “Iesus Nazarenvs Rex Iudeaorum” (Jesus the Nazarene king of the Jews)’. Either Antoninus is relying on a faulty memory when he writes this, or it is some other titulus.

He includes the following footnotes 11, 12: 11 Pasquale Rinaldi (1983); Scavone “Documents” (1989). The letter was rediscovered in the archive of the Abbey of St. Caterina a Formiello, Naples; it is folio CXXVI of the Chartularium Culisanense, originating in 1290, a copy of which came to Naples presumably as a result of close political ties with the imperial Angelus Comnenus family from 1481 on. See also Longnon (1949, 118). 12 Karlheinz Dietz (personal letter), citing Polemis (89f.), is essentially correct about the nomenclature of Theodore of Epirus. But other scholars are not so insistent. Theodore himself could use Doukas, Angelos, and Comnenus sometimes together and sometimes interchangeably. Polemis concedes, with Stiernon, only that after Theodore’s fall from power did his contemporaries call him by Angelos. See Wolfe (240). The use of the name Angelos and the credibility of Theodore’s letter in 1205 are supported by the following. In 1202, when the Western princes launched the Fourth Crusade from Venice, Alexius IV, the son of the deposed Isaac II, appealed to the crusaders, promising to end the schism of East and West, to pay for their transport, and to provide military support to the crusaders against their original target, Egypt, if they helped him to depose his uncle and to sit on his father’s throne.

The absence of smears on the cloth make it unlikely that it was used as a body bag, and also that there was a minimum of handling of the body. Barbet is specific on the cause of the blood belt on the back. Crucifixion was carried out with the victim made to lie on the ground, his arms possibly temporarily bound to the cross beam, while the hands / wrists were nailed to it. The execution squad would then lift the cross beam onto the top of the upright, and probably tacking it to stop it from tipping. The feet were then nailed to the upright, Barbet claims by a single nail. After he had expired, it was then a simple matter to remove the nail from the feet and then to lift the cross beam off the upright. Rigor mortis would have set in, and the body would have been quite rigid and would not sag if it was carried horizontally. Barbet claims that it was not until they had reached the tomb that the body was placed on the Shroud, as otherwise it would have been drenched with the blood from the interior vena cava. He is quite detailed on this point, mentioning discussions he had with officials from a local abattoir who were familiar with this particular blood flow. During the journey the greater part of the blood was either lost or collected. Only that remained which coagulated on the skin. He maintains that the rear part of the right heel is poorly marked compared to the sole, and that this was the only part of the body that was handled. He postulates that a band or a twisted sheet was used to support the thorax, and that this is the cause of the blood belt. The flow has congealed transversally on the back, has even managed partly to reascend, and consists of irregular windings, which bifurcate and come together again several times. The band would have become saturated with blood, but only a small part of it shows on the skin as the blood belt from the folds within the twisted sheet. With the minimum of handling so evident, he considers that the cross beam was used to support the top half of the body and it was not removed until they reached the tomb, which was nearby. In Barbet’s detailed scenario there is no need for a stretcher or body bag, and it seems that the distance that the body was carried was not far. John 19:40 42: “40 They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. 41 Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. 42 So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by.” Note: ‘a garden in the place where he had been crucified; in the garden a new tomb; the tomb was close by’..","date":"2014-11-27","mins":"5:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-175194","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"After some three years on this site, I think I may be getting a little tired of debating with the blind men of India as to what an elephant looks like.

Clearly differences of viewpoints will always appear on the web expressed in different ways, and they’re not always accurate.

I did not pursue whether the Swiss illustration was of the original or its supposed replacement, but the church window was I think 15th century, well after 1355. But I think there are other illustrations of it. Possibly these only display a ventral image.

In any event, a shroud of some type was on display at the Chapel of the Holy Shroud in Saint Etienne (Besançon), which building also possessed one of St. Stephen’s arms (before the fire of 1349). In due course, the painted shroud was placed in the newly upgraded Cathedral of Saint John (1669). It had become an important object of veneration in the seventeenth century, a period of conflict (Thirty Years War, annexations and withdrawals of France from this region) and yet another round of the plague. Indeed, the surrender of the city in front of the French armed forces, in 1674, was conditioned only upon a requirement to keep this relic at the Cathédrale Saint Jean de Besançon. The Shroud of Besançon was sent to Paris on 27 Floréal, an II (May 16, 1794) of the Revolution. It is then thrown into a fire, from which it did not escape.” “One may find a representation of it on a window in the chapel of Pérolles in Fribourg, Switzerland, dating back to 1520. On the glass appears the canons of Besançon, an episcopal mitre, and the linen facing the crowd. The cloth bears the double image, quite similar to the Shroud of Turin.

The window(s) appear as Plate 30a in Wilson 2010. It seems there may be two windows: on the left one are two bishops, looking to the right holding the ventral section; on the right are two bishops (one looking to the left, the other face on) holding a cloth with only a vague suggestion of an image (possibly the dorsal). Wilson’s caption places the scene as parapet walls of Chambery Castle, c. 1523 3. His picture credit is: ‘Marcel Strub “Les monuments d’art et d’histoire du Canton de Fribourg”, Basle(?): ed. Birkhauser, 1959.’ I surmise a copy would be archived in a relevant library. This would have to be the representation referred to in my extract at Nov 29, 1:27pm, where it is claimed: “On the glass appears the canons of Besançon, an episcopal mitre, and the linen facing the crowd. The cloth bears the double image, quite similar to the Shroud of Turin. …” Clearly whoever wrote the Besancon text interpreted the scene quite differently from Strub’s work. It would seem to be an attempt to claim that the Shroud was originally in Besancon, but other references can also be found for this claim. One wonders at what feature in the window identifies the claim for the Bishops being canons of Besancon?.","date":"2014-11-29","mins":"2:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-173335","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"While I can applaud Colin’s rigour in exploring all possible avenues of enquiry, I don’t think I can buy into his body bag argument. At the cross, the arms would have been set fixed in the outstretched position of crucifixion by rigor mortis. The image of course shows the arms brought down to the sides with the hands carefully crossed covering the pubis. The question arises as to when the burial party forced the arms into this position, which probably took some effort to do. It was Barbet’s opinion that the taking down from the cross and the transport to the tomb was accomplished simply by a party not needing more than five men who merely removed the cross beam from the upright, two carrying the cross beam with the arms still attached, two supporting the trunk, and one at the feet. There may have been a cloth casually wrapped around the body to catch any blood for its inclusion with the burial. At the tomb, the arms would have been removed from the cross beam and brought into their final position for the burial. A particular problem with the image I’ve often noticed and mentioned, is that it is a near orthogonal projection like a photograph, and it is difficult to imagine how this could have come about. This does not seem to me like a body bag image which ought to show the sides and the top of the head, and would also show a more distorted randomised image, if that was the case. I’ve sometimes wondered if some of the 100 lb package that Nicodemus brought was used to pack the sides of the body, which would go some way to explaining orthogonality. Despite the assertions made that the Besancon Shroud was also an authentic burial cloth, I think that this is a misapprehension made merely to assert its validity, and that it is more likely to have been a painted copy commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy in her efforts to placate the Besancon authorities that the Shroud she had taken for safe keeping had been restored to them. That her stratagem worked is attested by the spurious claims made for her substitution. It would seem that Bishop D’Arcis believed in the existence of a painted copy, but was confused as to which cloth was the copy..","date":"2014-11-27","mins":"1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-173694","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Andrea is free to believe what he will. He may prefer the alleged explanation of Pierre D’Arcis that it was so cunningly painted that it succeeded in deceiving a succession of medical forensic pathologists from Yves Delage to Fredererik Zugibe. That will not satisfy others more rationally minded. Scavone makes the point as early as his page 3 that the Shroud remains relatively free of historical documentation. I should imagine that the 1349 fire at St Stephen’s would leave little in the way of any documentation of any real event there whatsoever. What little might have remained in the region was dispatched by the French Revolution. In those circumstances it is fatuous to demand documentation to make a case for anything, and one must be satisfied with what little can be discovered, some even from family traditions. Geoffray de Charnay’s descendants could only say that his acquiring the Shroud was as “a reward freely given” which assists very little. If the Shroud was not “cunningly painted” then its emergence in Lirey by some means demands an explanation. We can hardly suppose that Othon de la Roche had any motive for sending it to either of the De Charnay or de Vergy families in Troyes, when his own castle was at Besancon in Burgundy. The “historical critical” method which Andrea seems to consider is the touchstone of historic discipline puts me much in mind of Bertrand Russell’s approach to mathematics with his logical positivism. Russell devoted some 300 pages of his Mathematica to prove his conjecture that if one object was added to yet one other object of the same class, that the result was in fact two such objects. I exaggerate not! Russell’s Mathematica is now merely of antiquarian interest, and it discovered little that was new.

The principal authorites he cites seem to be: 8 See Chifflet (1624); Vignon (1902, 64 76); Fr. Paul de Gai (1973); and Dorothy Crispino (1985). 9 M. Buttigieg (1990); Bro. Hilary de Crémiers (1991); Michel Bergeret in CIELT (1993); and now Alessandro Piana in BSTS Newsletter (2007). See also Piana, Sindone: gli anni perduti (2007). The specifics are in his bibliography. The essential outline of the scenario he gives is: – Around 1206 or 1219, Othon de la Roche arranged to ship the Shroud from Athens to his Burgundian Chateau de Ray sur Saône near Besançon, as in 1219 Othon sends his confrere Pons de Chaponay to Besancon on an unidentified but important mission. Bergeret and Piana have provided photos of a wooden chest labeled in recent times as that in which the Shroud was “brought back by Othon de Ray in 1206.” Scavone opts for the 1219 date. – At some time before 1349, Jeanne de Vergy, concerned that at Besancon the Shroud was under threat from various causes, decides to rescue the Shroud for France, and brought to her marriage to Geoffray I de Charnay 1351 54. Malijay argued further that she presented it first to the French king, Philip VI de Valois (d. 1351), who in turn awarded it to Geoffroy de Charny. – Besançon’s historians wrote that on March 6, 1349, a fire in St. Stephen Cathedral resulted in the apparent destruction–certainly, the disappearance– of their Shroud and the loss of all church documents attesting to the circumstances of its arrival in that city. It would have been unwise to announce that Lirey now possessed Besançon’s lost precious relic. – In 1624 J. J. Chifflet, Besançon’s first historian, convinced that the original Shroud was consumed in the St. Stephen fire, wrote that in 1377 it was miraculously discovered in a niche in the new cathedral. In 1902, based on the illustrations of the Lirey and Besançon shrouds from Chifflet’s book, Vignon wrote that the Shroud of Besançon was clearly a replica of that of Lirey, made between the years 1349 (the fire) and 1375. Besançon’s own historian Dom François Chamard (1902) agreed–though he was not forthcoming about how Lirey had obtained the original. – Towards the conclusion of his paper, Scavone makes the case that the copy was commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the Shroud she had taken from Besancon, that the succession of four bishops meant that no one really knew what the original Besancon Shroud looked like, that the copy was attested by a bishop who was a family connection, and that this was the actual copy referred to in Pierre D’Arcis’ notes, and that D’Arci’s was confused as to which was the genuine Shroud.

Questionable agendas are much more evident among the pseudo skeptics with their pseudo science than it ever has been among members of the STURP team. The various scientific institutions have had their opportunities, and they invariably fluffed it, driven as they were by their own pseudo skepticism.

Because they were dominated by so called free thinkers and so called rationalists. The British have seldom shown an interest in Shroud investigations, apart from their involvement in the notorious Carbon 14 dating tests, and they fluffed it. They were even talked out of a rigorous sampling protocol. Dr Berry’s assertions that there is no evidence of crucifixion in the subject of the image, pretends an ignorance in the 1930s work of forensic pathologist Dr Pierre Barbet, and so Dr Berry has fluffed it. Mc Crone’s otherwise highly reputable laboratory came to false conclusions and so he has fluffed it. Madame Flury Lemburg a most highly recognised textile specialist, claimed that the material of the cloth was uniform, and so she fluffed it.

If Andrea Nicolotti or David Mo had lived in the Pacific or in Africa they might have a rather different view of the worth and value and authenticity of oral tradition of non literate peoples, the prevailing milieu of 14th century Europe. Setting aside the plagiarism controversy, I would recommend as a first lesson the reading of Alex Haley’s “Roots The Saga of an American Family”. It seems that Haley borrowed extensively from Harold Courlander’s “The African”. Nevertheless “Roots” had great influence on awareness in the United States of African American history and inspired a broad interest in genealogy and family history. Much of its success derived from the oral traditions in Africa which were found to match the Afro American traditions that Haley had come to know through his own family in the USA. Likewise the Polynesians navigated the Pacific by means of the oral traditions handed down to them. In NZ today the Maori folk recall their genealogies with great reliability, together with the various historic events significant to them. The scriptures themselves are derived from oral traditions, the alleged contradictions between the four gospels for instance are generally of insignificant import, and their consistency is remarkable. To demand a non existent documentation of a 14th century non literate society, in the wake of massive destructions of such evidence from a persistent war torn environment, is I think to rob Europe of much of the tradition of its own significant historical events. Yes, Russell’s “Principia Mathematica” was a massive and significant work. However few mathematicians today have even bothered to read it. It seems that the Russell Whitehead vision of building a mathematical edifice solely on principles of logic was dealt its death blow by Godel’s 1931 theorem of undecideability. “Moreover, Kurt Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem (1931) proves that there cannot be a single logical theory from which the whole of mathematics is derivable: all consistent theories of arithmetic are necessarily incomplete.” Nevertheless, scientists, engineers and even mathematicians continue to do mathematics and see it as a worthwhile and valuable activity!

It has its own Pontifical Science Academy, led by outstanding world leaders in science with a range of different beliefs. Pope Pius XII himself was well known for his interests in cutting edge astronomy, having written significantly on the then new topic of qasars. The original Vatican Radio station was designed and installed by broadcasting pioneer Marconi. Popes from at least the time of Pius XI have all expressed a personal belief in the authenticity of the Shroud, but have stated that they leave it to the scientists to establish true authenticity or otherwise. There is no need for the Church to be the source of funds for any Shroud research, and this is best the role of those with sufficient influence and motivation to do so, as was the case with the 1978 STURP project in the USA. However the Church surely has a leadership role in creating the proper climate for quality research to occur. If authentic, the Shroud has a wonderful potential for the evangelisation of peoples in the 21st century. Catholicism in particular and Christianity in general, is a religion based on actual historical events, the passion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the Shroud has the potential to be an authentic witness to that historicity.

Scientific interest in the Shroud commenced in 1898, with the first photographs taken, and probably the greatest achievement occurred with the mainly American STURP investigations of 1978. Their success and advanced technology seemed to have left the locals somewhat mortified and humiliated, and STURP was shut out of the 1988 radiocarbon investigations. There seem to be other signs of reluctance to involve the wider scientific community, such as the non release of a series of detailed micrographs taken which could reveal further information. Meantime there seems to be a series of peculiar experiments in the north of Italy promoting some strange ideas concerning radiation as a possible cause of the image. All this seems to some professionals to be a little bizarre. The disciplined approach with generous funding taken by the wider European scientific community to investigate a lump of rock 308 million km from Earth, is in sharp contrast to the lack of any systematic investigation of a holy relic which is of considerable public interest, but which languishes for want of a similarly coordinated approach, and at an insignificant small fraction of the cost of Rosetta..","date":"2015-06-18","mins":"6:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/17/the-masters-of-comedy-in-piedmont/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Masters of Comedy in Piedmont"},{"id":"comment-202675","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Granted that the quest for candidates for canonisation is a significant agenda item for Rome, as seemed particularly the case for JP II, the demands of papacy as CEO require that no single issue become an isolated focus to the exclusion of other significant priorities.

Everyone’s life experience and world view has value, and is valid to them. What is not permissible is to assert dogmatically that the Shroud is not the authentic burial cloth of Christ, nor to assert dogmatically that indeed it is. It is conceivable that the Shroud is what it appears to be, and equally conceivable that it may not be. My own personal opinion based on the information which I have considered over a long life, that it is the burial cloth is well enough known. That opinion as is the opinion of others are all worthy of respect if honestly derived. Because the Shroud may be what it appears to be, it ought to be approached with the proper reverence and respect that admits such a possibility. It cannot be dismissed as an insignificant rag, or merely a cunning device created for the gullible and superstitious, regardless of whatever our personal opinion may be of it. Too much about it is unknown. In Andrea’s posted comment above, reasons are given for his rejecting its authenticity. Andrea has written a book arguing that the Shroud is not the Mandylion, and therefore he would seem to have a vested interest in asserting that it is not authentic. Quite likely he may be correct in his assertion that it is not the Mandylion, but that is quite insufficient by itself to assert non authenticism, as there are any number of other possibilities, some of them unknown. Wilson’s Mandylion theory was only one such brave attempt to derive an explanation for the apparent gap in its history. Andrea, along with others, considers it has failed to do so. He asserts that for thirteen centuries no one in history has ever spoken of the Shroud. That is his own peculiar rigorous view of history, where he seems to require a specific document outlining and specifying all the features of the Shroud that we now know. A more open approach to history would place some value on the very many less specific and obscure references that we find in Byzantine sources, but to an open mind would seem plain enough, particularly if allowance is made for a typical Byzantine obscurantism when discussing matters of the Holy. It is therefore incorrect to assert that no mention is made. He then refers to the comments of the Bishop of Troyes and the Pope, presumably Pierre D’Arcis, and Avignon Pope Clement VII. Much of what is asserted here derives from the work of Chevalier and Thurston, both of whom had a peculiar agenda of asserting non authenticity in response to the photography of Secondo Pia and the forensic work of Delage and Vignon. Both Chevalier and Thurston have been charged with a conspiracy to misrepresent their sources. A rigorous approach to history should be satisfied that the claims that D Arcis and Clement VII are asserted to have made are indeed factual, and are without the bias of Chevalier and Thurston. He then ventures beyond his own field of specialised competence into the forensic. He dogmatically asserts that the image could not have been produced by a dead body without the intervention of a craftsman, and that the blood flows are unrealistic. Given the particular properties of the Shroud cloth, he cannot know this, and several forensic pathologists, experienced in such matters, have asserted otherwise. Nor does his assertion that the Shroud cloth is technologically medieval stand unchallenged. There are good reasons for asserting that the yarn was processed according to ancient methods, particularly the bleaching process. His brave attempt at asserting that twelve separate radiocarbon tests dated the cloth to medieval times, conveniently passes over the fact that all the tests were carried out on one single unrepresentative sample, so that it would be incomprehensible and incompetent of the laboratories if the results did not match. In fact the actual tests are known to have failed a chi square test for consistency, so even that remains an unresolved issue. I am uncertain as to his intent in mentioning coins, but it is curious that there are Byzantine solidi from about the sixth century which are a close match to the Shroud facial image. Perhaps his allusion is to the debatable coins over they eyes issue. He seems to dismiss such matters as pollens, although there remains sufficient evidence from spring pollens exclusive to Jerusalem environs, including the Dead Sea area. He omits any reference to the presence of Jerusalem aragonite limestone found on the feet, nose and knees of the image, as if from a fall, and from walking the Via Dolorosa. Perhaps none of the matters I have mentioned are sufficient by themselves to assert authenticity, but taken together I find them a powerful argument. There still remains the enigmatic image of a man of sorrows. And yet with all our modern technology, no one yet knows how that image was created.

It may have been too late for any significant Christian relics to be deposited there. It is Markwardt’s theory that Bishop Ephraemius took an important icon from Antioch to Cappadocia in 540 AD to preserve it from the attack by Persian Chosroes. He argues that it was the Shroud. The Image of Camuliana was paraded around Cappadocia and Anatolia in 554. In 574, Byzantine emperor Justin II brought two important relics to Constantinople, a relic of the True Cross, and an image of Jesus which was said to have originated in Camuliana. Markwardt believes that this was when the Shroud arrived in Constantinople. However there are other viewpoints concerning the Camuliana relic. If the present Cappadocian archaeology site is at all significant in respect of the Shroud’s sojourn, then it would seem to require a date going back to about 540 – 574.

Geoffray de Charnay had indeed subjected himself to a similar earlier period of voluntary English imprisonment, as you indicate above had John II. Wilson is at pains to cover De Charnay’s fascination with the ideals of knightly chivalry, and of course mentions his earlier namesake, the Templar Prior of Normandy executed with Jacques de Molay. The inference seems to be that De Charnay was attempting to found a successor order similar to the Templars. The Lirey badge of course shows the De Charnay arms on the dexter side of the shield implying that De Charnay was still alive when the badge was struck to commemorate the first showings at Lirey, so that it had to be before 1356. Part of Wilson’s purpose in mentioning this fascination with knightly ideals seems to be to exempt him from any deliberate fraud in creating the Shroud, as out of character for such a person. The Shroud image itself is quite unlike any concurrent artistic model of a dead Christ. Whether De Charnay had the financial or technological resources, let alone the time available to him in what seems to have been a busy warrior’s life seems an unlikely proposition. You’ve spent some three years experimenting in your attempts to produce something even vaguely like the image. I doubt that De Charnay had that amount of free time available, and he certainly would not have the same technical know how. Did anybody? If it’s a fraud, the craftsman only ever did it once, left no trace of his attempts and failures, we don’t know who he is, nor whereabouts he did it, and we still don’t know how he did it!.","date":"2015-04-24","mins":"3:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-197397","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"No real intention of being disparaging, not even mildly mocking.

Could he accidentally stumble on this marvelous secret, still unknown, and not make better, more frequent use of it? He only ever did it once. Re the coat of arms, if Geoffrey had already died, my understanding is that the Lirey medal ought to show his arms on the sinistral side, and his widow’s on the dexter, but that’s not the case, hence it was before 1356. Re spelling conventions, that seems to have been an arbitrary optional practice in those days, and all variants regularly occur.

Its predecessors included orreries devised by Archimedes (285 211 BCE) which were model planetariums derived from earlier model globes of Thales and Eudoxos which included markings of fixed stars and constellations. Later Heron of Alexandria constructed similar orreries. The “antikythera” (so named from its location) was discovered in the Aegean in 1900 by Greek sponge divers and lying in 200 ft of water. In 1958 Derek Price was permitted to examine its remains. It is essentially an astronomical clock, with an inscription giving instructions, It included mechanical gearing, and a dial with signs of the zodiac. It included a slip ring which could be used to adjust the mechanism, as predating Julius Caesar’s leap year calendar, the constellations would gradually get out of sync with the lunar calendar then in use. It included several gear trains, and signs of minor repairs indicated that the device actually worked and was in use. From the setting of the slip ring it seems that the ship sank about 65 BCE, but then little further was heard of such devices, until about 1000 AD, when al Biruni an Iranian savant traveled to India and described a very similar machine. Like the Antikythera, al Biruni’s machine had 60 degree triangular teeth mounted on square shanks.

In general, analytic solutions are usually only available for the simplest cases, such as in laminar flow of incompressible fluids, particularly if they can be modeled in two dimensions only. A lot is known about the turbulent phases and the significance of boundary layers, momentum exchanges and so on, but knowledge and analysis remains imperfect, theoretical only, and to some extent speculative. In most practical cases of any complexity it is necessary to resort to physical modelling. Some skill and knowledge is required to ensure that the requirements of dimensional analysis are satisfied, and it is usually not enough to construct merely a geometrical model. Depending on what phenomena are thought to be most significant the model must be consistent with several various dimensionless numbers, such as the Reynold’s No., Mach No., and so on. The situation becomes more complex in the case of compressible flow, more so if random temperatures occur such as in a fire. The “Trench Effect” mentioned by Max would seem to be some kind of convection phenomenon caused by the fire, possibly due to some kind of confined air flow from the temperature gradients. In different practical situations, other as yet unknown effects might also occur, and can usually only be identified by physical modelling. I would think it unlikely that the “Trench Effect” per se would be of direct relevance in creating the Shroud image. As yet we do not know the processes that might have been involved in creating the image, assuming that it might be naturalistic. However if fluid flow was involved in its creation, then a physical model would in time be necessary to test any hypothesis, and some as yet unknown fluid phenomenon might yet be involved. Concerning collimation, it was for this reason that I had wondered whether earthquake stimulated radon emissions might be relevant, in confining and directing whatever particulates might have caused the image..","date":"2015-04-29","mins":"3:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-11112","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I clicked on “here” and it looks as if Colin’s taken his own posting down, Dan.

Both originate from primal religious rituals but are seen to survive even in mature religious rituals and even every day social rituals. A topical example of a contagious ritual would be the pressing of a copy of the Shroud to the original with the intention that the mystique or power of the original would be imparted onto the copy. An example of imitative magic would be the creation of a doll, with recognisable features, perhaps using the hair of the intended victim, to do harm to an enemy. Imitative magic survives in some forms of emblems. It was widely used in medieval medicine by prescribing foods that had the appearance of the affected organ, e.g. Walnuts for brain fever. The sign of the cross for instance might be technically classified as such by imitating the form of the cross. A kiss might by a principle of contagious magic provide adequate defence against the power of the magician, or conversely inhibit the power of the magician. This explanation has been grossly simplified, merely to explain the basic principles involved. However once explained, several examples can come readily to mind, e.g. The finger of God reaching out to the finger of Adam in the Sistine Chapel Creation scene. Touch is a fundamental principle in the Polynesian and Maori concepts of “tapu”. The head is particularly tapu. In the old days, Maori chiefs had sometimes to be fed by their womenfolk, as food is “noa” or common, and the chief might be in a state of tapu, and could not touch the food himself. Attendance at a Maori funeral makes one tapu, and so requires the eating of food at its conclusion to return everyone to a state of “noa”..","date":"2013-03-14","mins":"8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/13/the-shroud-connection-shape-shifting-jesus-described-in-ancient-egyptian-text/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud Connection: Shape-Shifting Jesus Described in Ancient Egyptian Text"},{"id":"comment-17844","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think there are several problems, no matter how John 20:8 might be interpreted.

To follow Augustine’s view could be to fall into the trap of religious reductionism. Although Augustine could have been right. What cloths did Peter & John see? Why did Mary Magdala mistake Jesus for the gardener? If he was clothed in the Shroud as a himation as Max contends, then the cloths they saw could not have been the Shroud. They could only have been the bandages and ties. The head cloth in a separate place had probably been removed by Nicodemus and Joseph A. To put a supernatural interpretation on it, it may be that Mary saw Jesus draped in some kind of miraculous or heavenly garment, but then he says he has not yet ascended to the Father! Then it could be that the cloth they saw was in fact the Shroud. Meacham’s paper refers to the glutinous properties of the myrrh, and then Peter & John have to get their heads around the idea that a grave robbery has occurred, that only the body has been taken away after the difficult matter of removing it from the glutinous coated Shroud. Alternatively if they saw the image had formed on the Shroud, this might persuade them to believe in the Resurrection. But only if the image had already been formed, and had been fixed. Note that John 20:9 has “UNTIL THIS MOMENT, (they had failed to understand etc…) We can speculate and speculate, and come up all with our own interpretations, but I feel that none of us end up any the wiser.

There’s plenty to think about there. There would seem to be definite limits to how far the rigour of the scientific method can take us. As John Klotz correctly asserts we cannot order our lives by this method. Decisions must be made, and we do so in normal life by a collection of probabilities. Sometimes we are right in our assessment, and we therefore succeed. But sometimes we are wrong. That’s just a fact of ordinary life. Yet most of the time, we can still pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and start all over again. An obvious limit to the scientific method is that there are no certain agreed proofs for authenticity, but plenty available for testing non authenticity. But when most of the available proofs for non authenticity have been exhausted and have failed, this only notches up an increased likelihood for authenticity, but can never make it certain. Another apparent limit of the scientific method, is conflicting interpretation of evidence. We see this in court rooms everyday, where opposite sides are quite capable of calling expert witnesses to the stand to bolster their case. Where they conflict, both cannot possibly be right. At this stage it is the jury’s prerogative to call the verdict, again based on probability. In the case of the Shroud, the scientists have been hamstrung by lack of access. And so science has been so far unable to have its last word on the matter, even though it may well already have the methods to carry out definitive tests, one way or the other. There still remains plenty of scope for experimentation without the need for direct access. There have been attempts to replicate the image, but so far these have only been rudimentary. The search for a naturalistic explanation of how a dead body might form an image on a piece of ancient linen has hardly been explored at all.

In an otherwise barren landscape they are capable of perceiving the minutest traces of the path of an animal or fugitive over the course of several days.

Giovanna De Liso worked for some 12 years in the seismically active area of Piedmont, experimenting with producing images using all sorts of different cloths treated in various ways, and under different conditions. She seems to have successfully produced 3 D image of a key and a snake. Some have commented that they are the most successful images produced to date; others have commented that they are only of relatively thin objects. Her paper “Shroud like image formation during seismic activity” by Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010, may be found at http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/De Liso Web.pdf and is well worth reading. Note that the PDF is ‘secured’ so I’m unable to copy and paste extracts here. The most successful images were produced in connection with the seismic release of radon gas in the neighbourhood of iron bearing gneiss rock formations, with electrostatic discharges and infra sound emission and with variations in the local geomagnetic field. It seems that the lack of any one of these variables resulted in no image. I have been unable to find out very much about this author, and she has not responded to my enquiries in English. I am given to understand that she may work with Prof Giulio Fanti, and has supported his “corona discharge” hypothesis, so some consider she may be suspect. My own view is that the paper should stand on its own merits. Twelve years of dedicated work resulting in the successful production of 3 D images is not to be ignored. Radon 222 is the longest lived isotope of radon with a half life of 3.28 days, emitting alpha particles, and is a decay product of radium. It is prepared synthetically for treatment of cancer, as the daughter product is Bismuth 214 which produces penetrating gamma radiation. In an earthquake the quantities would be very small. However Radon 222 has been implicated as the most significant non tobacco cause of lung cancer in apartment dwellings in USA. I recall that there have been subsequent papers citing De Liso’s work which you may find on the shroud.com site.

I might guess that it could get its name from taking the Partial Derivatives of the Least Square equations on each of the multiple variables to obtain the coefficients and equating the various partial derivatives to zero to minimise the various least square sums. If you are familiar with ordinary multivariate regression analysis, I’d be inclined to use that, if not, then consult any standard text on Statistics and Probability theory, most of which will include a chapter on MVR. Very tersely: Let there be n sets of data points in k independent variables x(j) where the x(j) are measured about their sample mean values. Then the objective is to obtain an estimate y’ of the dependent variable y about its mean value. Geometrically the problem is one of finding the equation of the plane which fits best, in the sense of least squares, a set of points in k + 1 dimensions. The equation will be of the form: y’ = Sum [ a(j). X(j)] (j = 1 to k) where a(j) is the coefficient to be found for each x(j). Taking the partial differentials of the sum of the least squares expression yields k separate equations which must be solved to obtain each of the a(j). Equation j will then be of the form: Sum [ a(i). Sum [ x(j). X(i) ] ](i = 1 to k) = Sum [x(j).

Every matter atomic particle, is supposed to be paired with an anti matter particle, so we have positrons (anti electrons), anti protons, anti neutrons etc. The wonder is that there was any matter left over after the “Big Bang” which created the universe. If a matter particle encounters an anti matter particle, they are both annihilated, releasing energy according to Einstein’s equation: E = Mc^2. AJ is saying, “Suppose your average 1st century Jew is about 70 kg, then destruction of the total body mass would result in a 10 GT nuclear explosion.” However, clearly Baldacchini must be on the wrong track, as this didn’t happen. The body disappeared, but several people claimed to have seen Jesus afterwards, unless they’re de Wesselow animists. If we’re going to confine our thinking to purely physical processes, then a parallel universe becomes a much more credible alternative explanation.

The Voice of Russia web site mentions that a few of the alleged relics from the True Cross proved to be fir, and I guess there wouldn’t have been much of that ever growing in Jerusalem. I’ve written postings on the Vera Crux on this site before. The Crusaders carried the cross beam, found by Helena, as a talisman into battle; It was lost in 1187 on the field of Hattin in Galilee in the Frankish battle with Saladin, who dragged it tied to the tail of his horse through the streets of Damascus, after which it disappeared. I guess his soldiers might have used it for firewood. I’d say there wouldn’t be many authentic relics from the cross beam, although possibly some fragments might have found there way back to Europe. A surviving fragment of Helena’s Titulus Crucis was said to have been rediscovered in 1492 in the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome. The surviving fragment is clearly only a portion of the original. It weighs 687 gm, measures 25.3 cm × 14 cm × 2.6 cm, is made of walnut wood, was originally painted white, and with incised letters showing traces of red or black. The sequence of the lettering is Hebrew (or Aramaic), Greek and Latin, which is at variance with the gospels of Luke and John who both give different sequences. Some have argued that this sequence difference is an argument against forgery. The Greek and Latin lettering reads from right to left, either through ignorance or as a parody of the Hebrew. In 2002, the University of Arizona conducted carbon dating tests, and asserted that the present artifact was made between 980 and 1146 AD. But of course we’ve heard all about problems with C14 tests before. On the other hand it may have been intended as a replica of the original, which certainly existed as attested by several witnesses including Egeria 383 AD, Antoninus 6th c, Saints Cyril of Jerusalem, Ambrose of Milan, and John Chrysostom.

The purpose of the book is to encourage and admonish the church to be steadfast and endure. The form of an apocalypse shows affinities with contemporary Jewish, Oriental, and Hellenistic writings in which problems of the end of the world and of history are linked both with prophecy of an eschatological nature and with “sealed” secret mysteries. Such revelations are traditionally received in trances, characterized by strange symbols, numbers, images, and parables or allegories that represent people and historical situations. Apocalypticism is essentially dualistic, presenting the present eon as evil and the future as good, with an ultimate battle between the divine and the demonic to be won only after one or more cosmic catastrophes. The aim of apocalyptic literature is to depict in the age of present tribulation a knowledge of a future glorious victory and vindication, thus giving hope and assurance. In Revelation, it is God who gives the revelation to Jesus Christ to be shown by Christ through an angel to his servant John, in exile on the island of Patmos, in order that John become his seer and prophet to the church. John is to write down what he has seen, what is, and what is to come. In contradistinction to most Jewish apocalyptic works, Revelation is not pseudonymous and John is to give finally unsealed, clear prophecy related to the present and to the end time. As in the rest of the New Testament, the starting point of eschatological hope is the saving act of God in Jesus, a historical centre pointing toward historical developments that will bring about the establishment of God’s kingdom and vindication of his people, ransomed by the blood of Christ, the Lamb who was slain. It provides certainty and encouragement with the example of the faithfulness of those who have already witnessed unto death (martyrs) and their reward special inheritance in the eternal kingdom. … … The letters sent from the heavenly Christ through John (chapters 2 and 3) exhort, comfort, or censure the churches according to their condition under persecution or danger of heresy. From chapters 4 22 there are series of visions in three main cycles, each recapitulating but expanding the former in greater and clearer detail with groups of seven symbols predominating in each (seals, chapters 6 7; trumpets, chapters 8 10; and bowls, chapters 15 16). This material is interspersed with visions of God in his heavenly council, various visions of catastrophe and of Satan, the destroyer, the appearance of two witnesses and other martyr examples to spur the church to endurance, the victory of the archangel Michael over the dragon (Satan) by the blood of the Lamb (Christ), and the representation of the powers of emperor cult and false prophecy as beasts who bring destruction to the unfaithful in God’s judgment. In summary, the seer reminds the reader that the words, because they are of God, are trustworthy and true. The motif that the Lord is coming soon is again repeated. This reflection of the early Christian watchword suggests a sacred liturgical style. The last verse is the closing benediction perhaps not only of the letters in the beginning of Revelation but of the whole of Revelation, which was to be read aloud in a worship setting. Apocalypticism was introduced into Asia Minor after AD 70 (the fall of Jerusalem), and c. 80 90 a prophetic circle was formed near Ephesus. Its leader was John, a prophet, who might well have been the author of Revelation, which is deeply steeped in apocalyptic traditions. The “Johannine circle” bearing the tradition of John, the Apostle of the Lord, and from which emerged the Gospel and letters bearing his name, might have been a continuation of the prophetic conventicle of Ephesus in which John was prominent. The various writings do not have to be consistent except in their basic faith in Jesus Christ; and, as the situations to which they addressed themselves were different, different styles and content were required. The seer was probably involved in an actual historical situation in the late 80s under Domitian, a time when there was open conflict between the church and the Roman state. There is a tradition supported by Irenaeus, a 2nd century bishop of Lyons, that in this persecution punishment was death or banishment. John’s prominence might have led to banishment to Patmos, an isle off the coast of Asia Minor, from his homeland in or around Ephesus. From Patmos he wrote a circular letter to the churches in Asia. … … Revelation is written in fantastic imagery, blending Jewish apocalypticism, Babylonian mythology, and astrological speculation. It is pictorial, dramatic, and poetic. Revelation contains long sections characterized by Greek that is grammatically and stylistically crude, strangely Hebraized to give a unique, almost Oriental, colour. This may have been deliberate. Although Revelation is replete with Old Testament allusions, there are no direct quotations, and this may reflect the seer’s conviction that the work is a direct revelation from God. In other sections the poetry of Revelation might stem from the seer’s experience in the heavenly throne room of God, from hearing the hymns of the angelic host, or from his recollection on Patmos of the liturgical practice of the church. The image of the Bride and wedding feast together with the “Come, Lord Jesus!” have associations with the eucharistic liturgy of the early church. … … The mysterious name of the first beast, 666, in 13:18, can be calculated by “gematria,” assigning their numerical values to letters of the word and summing them up. The most adequate solution is Nero (the numerical value of the Hebrew letters for Caesar Neron equals 666), a demonic Nero redivivus (revived), who returns from the dead as Antichrist. … … The cosmic battle in heaven is fought by those willing to give their lives, who mix their blood with the blood of the Lamb, whose blood “ransomed men for God.” The writer of Revelation based his hope for the church on perseverance, on endurance even to death, and on what the future will bring when the church will live with the glorified Christ, slain as a lamb. The harlot of Babylon will be destroyed and the church will endure; Babylon falls and the new Jerusalem, the city of God that is to come, is depicted in all its glory. These are the hopes to strengthen the persecuted church, assurance that God will soon triumph. With trumpet call and heavenly voices there is the joyful promise that “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.” These selected extracts originally by Rev.

It requires an anti Herodian bias on the part of the author which I don’t see elsewhere in the text. Such bias as there was, seems merely to have originated with the anti Idumean heredity of the Herods, which is extraneous to Revelations. Nor do I see the vaw vaw vaw replication of 6 6 6 in the text. The Greek texts – both 1550 & 1894 Textus Receptus & the Byzantine Majority – use the Greek numerals khi xi sigma. The sigma appears to be a possible typo for the obsolete letter digamma, as otherwise sigma had the value 200, but being placed at the right suggests here a units value. [khi = 600, xi = 60, digamma = 6] The texts, Alexandrian and Hort & Westcott, both give the number in words “exakosioi exikonta ex”, and which Jerome transcribes in words as “sescenti sexaginta sex”. Clearly the number is six hundred and sixty six, and not six six six. Ifrah’s text on the history of numbers [From One to Zero] has a comprehensive chapter on gematria giving several Hebrew, Greek and Arabic examples. The transliteration he gives for applying the number to Nero is QSAR NERON, which he transcribes into their Hebrew equivalent, but reading from right to left as: “nun vaw resh nun, resh samekh qoth” thus “50 6 200 50, 200 60 100” which adds up to the number 666.

There could only be merit in the argument that it refers to the Herodian dynasty, if there is evidence in any primal text that the original author intended the number correspond to the Hebrew number vaw vaw vaw, which in Greek I would presume to be translated as ‘ex ‘ex ‘ex. The examples I have given all show the number was interpreted as six hundred and sixty six. Http://www.greeknewtestament.com/B66 C013.htm , see verse 18. Is Max able to demonstrate an original text supporting the argument that the number was meant to be six six six? Most of the several gematria examples given by Ifrah, tend to commence with a given text or phrase from which a number such as a date or a year can be derived. Going in reverse from a number to a presumed text, as in Rev 13:18, seems more unusual a practice and is obviously fraught with ambiguities in interpretation. The only evidence for Herod the Great’s purported massacre of infants is given in Matthew’s infancy narrative, and seems to be a literary ruse so he can bring Jesus out of Egypt as the new Moses. There is no other historic evidence for this crime, although there were several crucifixions and executions of Jews about this time resulting from a few rebellions and riots. I am of the opinion that the Herodian dynasty did a lot more good for the Jewish people than evil which was overstated by the Jewish writers including the evangelists, but this went unappreciated because of their Idumean ancestry. Herod the Great himself sold much of his own silver to purchase bread during a Jewish famine, and he frequently intervened with Rome on their behalf to forestall imperial offending of Jewish religious sensibilities.

Professor Karen King occupying one of the most prestigous chairs of Divinity in a USA University, has done exactly what she was asked to do – To give an opinion on an alleged Coptic fragment of papyrus, She has not as far as is known claimed that the fragment is authentic. That has yet to be tested. She has arranged for a translation and written a careful and cautious paper on her findings to date. She correctly points out that IF the fragment turns out to be authentic, it is the only fourth century writing which asserts that Christ was married. There’s not much more to it than that. Extensive comment on the fragmet has already appeared on this site. The ill will evident on the Mundabor site is merely a remnant of an old tired form of Catholicism, that the vast majority of Catholics have now thankfully put behind them..","date":"2012-09-24","mins":"4:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/24/when-asses-flew/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When Asses Flew"},{"id":"comment-16889","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The full Daily Mail article referenced by Tornike above belies its sensationalist headline. Professor Francis Watson of Durham University believes that the fragment is a fraud made up of a collage of a Coptic translation of extracts from the Gnostic ‘Gospel of Thomas’. He may be correct in this view. However the full article goes on to give a reasonably balanced full account of the fragment. The point is made that tests are proceeding to test the ink which should give a definitive answer one way or the other. Karen King has not asserted that the fragment is authentic at all, but in her position she has to remain open to the possibility until proven otherwise. The fragment has nothing to do with Dan Brown theories despite the titillation aroused. There is a general misunderstanding abroad, particularly among Christians, about the role of a University Religious Studies department or faculty, a discipline in which I happen to hold a NZ Bachelor’s major. It is the function of such a faculty to study ALL aspects of ALL religions, not just one’s own favourite brand of Christianity. In my studies we covered Biblical Studies, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, various Oriental Religions, Zorastrianism, Ancient Mesopotamian Religions, Polynesian, Maori, Melanesian and Aboriginal Religions, as well as Modern Critical Issues in Religion to name a few. I have presented at Stage III seminars papers on Baal Hadad, Epic of Gilgamesh, Pope Leo XIII’s social encyclicals, Hans Kung and Teilhard de Chardin. I have read up on Gnostic Writings, studied the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, Confessions of Augustine, countless Catholic and Protestant writers and so on. None of this has compromised my own Catholic Faith, but in fact I feel it has broadened and deepened it. Critics of such studies migh reflect that the great Jesuit missionary St Francis Xavier considered it important in missionary work that there should be a full understanding of a peoples’ culture if such work was to succeed and bear fruit. Gnostic scripture is a valid research topic for any University Religious Studies department. Much of the Nag Hamadi scriptures go towards confirming what Iraeneus and other Church Fathers had to say about gnosticism which up until recently was all that was known about it, from these naturally hostile sources. I quote a recent news report: “The text is not evidence Jesus was married, said the professor, Karen L. King, a historian of early Christianity at Harvard Divinity School, who is scheduled to discuss her discovery at an international gathering of Coptic scholars in Rome on Tuesday. But she said it may cast new light on the history of early Christianity, including the formation of Christian views of celibacy and whether women were members of Jesus’s inner circle (etc)” Nevertheless, the sensation mongers will continue to make more of this ALLEGED finding than can at present be justified. That cannot be helped, but is just part of the tiresome modern business of people making a living from news gathering and its presentation..","date":"2012-09-25","mins":"7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/24/when-asses-flew/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When Asses Flew"},{"id":"comment-73519","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"How about for this for an argument?

The Book of Revelations and the angelic worship although at times expressed in material terms does so only by way of metaphor and analogy. But we are also told that there will come a day of a new creation. What its nature might be, we may only speculate. Anthropologically, such cults as relics, and even the cloak of Elisha, probably owe their first origins to expressions of primitive magic, particularlly of “contagious magic”, where certain specific objects were believed endowed with magical properties, communicated by touch, such as is still practised in the use of relics for healings. There are several instances of the use of objects in the gospels and in Acts, Jesus’ garments and Paul’s apparel. I think that David Goulet’s remarks, that it is faith that creates the miracles, not the relics by their own power, is close to the mark. However the origins of the healing power must be perceived in a material way.

The last ten years of my engineering career were spent in the Internal Audit department of a major national organisation in New Zealand. It was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding times of my working life. Conventionally, Auditing is often thought of as focusing on monetary issues, but during the 1990s I noticed that its scope tended to become extended to a wide variety of other important public activities, with recruiting of a variety of professions well beyond its traditional focus on mere accounting. I attended a number of auditing conferences, including an international conference in Auckland. One of the conference highlights I recall was an audit paper focusing on environmental activities for example. The matter of licensing for various patented processes and franchises is commonly a subject for professional audit, where the reputation of the process may be at stake. Essentially auditing is concerned with providing assurance, and this as I see it is the purpose of “peer review” of scientific papers and their related claims. Auditing has its own literature on technical processes, sampling methods, and standards. It is supported by a vast network of a wide variety of general and specialised auditing associations directed at auditing education and standards. My own work was focused on providing assurances for various major capital intensive engineering projects, as to their feasibility, the associated risks, and the likelihood of realising the benefits claimed for them (pre audit), as well as post audits to provide a data base of experience, and current audits, ungluing stalled projects. However, auditors (read “peer reviewers”) are all too human and the audit process can be corrupted by failures of objectivity, personal interests and bias, or telling the customer what they would prefer to hear, rather than telling it as it is. Historically in NZ, we have even had an Auditor General who was sacked on a corruption charge because of misuse of a credit card. I also observed that there seemed to be a few major international auditing organisations whose methods and training seemed somewhat lax and did not meet what I believed to be adequately rigorous professional standards. The adverse non objective reaction to Yves Delage’s paper in 1902 will be well known to Shroudies. Proper Peer review processes needs to meet the same high standards that are aspired to in every other branch of auditing and provision of professional assurances..","date":"2013-04-07","mins":"5:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/07/when-it-comes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-has-peer-review-lost-its-luster/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When it Comes to the Shroud of Turin, Has Peer Review Lost its Luster?"},{"id":"comment-98073","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"PHPL is misinformed.

From your first reference, it seems that cotton was not well known in Europe until well after the First Crusade in the 11th century – and it was even common to mistake it for some kind of “tree wool”. The question now in my mind is when was this repair carried out? I am wondering if the dye found suggests that it was a medieval repair, rather than an ancient repair, as also might be suggested by the C14 tests. In that case it takes us back to the absence of vanillin as possibly the only remaining argument that the main cloth is of ancient provenance, but that it does not locate the origin as either Europe or the Middle East.

He believes that Bishop Avercius was given temporary custody of it ~200 AD to convert the court of Abgar the Great in Edessa, thus giving rise to the Abgar legend whose true meaning is deliberately concealed by an allegory (by citing a predecessor), and also to the Hymn of the Pearl, and then it was returned to Antioch. When Persian king Chosroes attacked Antioch in the 6th century, he believes that Bishop Ephraemius took it to Anatolia and hid it there for safe keeping, but died before he could retrieve it.

Yale remains neutral on the subject and merely consider themselves the guardians of a valuable and controversial manuscript.

Concerning the”sigma”, this is a short hand for “standard deviation” a measure of the scatter of statistical data. Any stats handbook or elementary text will explain its significance and how it is calculated. A very large number of measurements of the same property of an object will have a scatter which can be expressed as a ‘sigma’. If there more than about 10 measurements then the distribution will approximate to the “normal distribution” and it can be expected that some 95% of the measurements will be within 2 sigma of the mean. If there are fewer than 10 measurements, then the “Students’ t” distribution should be used. If the measurements don’t show this, then we get into the area of Type I and Type II errors, which is explained in the text books. I know little about the techniques of carbon dating, but I believe that “calibration” refers to the modification of the theoretical dating curve (an inverse exponential) because of historic variations of C14 in the atmosphere.

I would therefore not look there for any biblical exegesis on the matter of earthquakes as they are beyond their ken, no matter whether the exegetes are evangelical pastors or even editors of newsletters of the BSTS. To those of us living on the “ring of fire”, such as Japan, California, Chile or New Zealand, earthquakes are an everyday occurrence, and we design our buildings and structures to take account of them. Most of them are scarcely felt and of no great significance. In NZ perhaps we get at least one earthquake of around M*6 about once per year. In the last 24 hours as I write this, there have been three in NZ of around M*3, and one of M*5. Http://www.geonet.org.nz/quakes/felt Compared to the more active “ring of fire” localities, Israel is an area of moderate seismic activity. In 2013 there were several shocks of around 3.5, In 1927 there was a 6.2 which killed 500, injured 700; and in 1837 an earthquake left 7000 dead. The effects of an earthquake event will depend a lot on how well buildings and structures have been engineered against earthquake. Countries of only moderate seismicity may in fact be more vulnerable as there is not the same awareness in the more active zones, and they are less prepared for them. Stephen Jones exegesis only refers to Matt 28:2 the “resurrection” earthquake (possibly an after shock) and seems to ignore the “crucifixion” earthquake of Matt 27:51; “At that, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; the earth quaked; the rocks were split; the tombs opened …” all of which seems plain enough. Mk 15:38, and Lk 21:45 only refer to the temple veil being torn in two, which may be considered at least suggestive. All three synoptics also refer to the darkness. John’s account passes over these events. A resurrection after shock provides a naturalistic explanation of a sealed rock being hurled from the tomb entrance. Boulders are commonly hurled from rock faces because of the emerging P wave, and they may be tossed some tens of metres or more. That Matthew ascribes it to an angel suits his purpose of indicating some divine intervention. Some might ascribe the “angels” to the early perception of the Shroud body images, as does De Wesselow for instance. The paper’s authors, as does Jones, become fixed on significant earthquakes said to have occurred in 33 AD. They do not look further afield into the possibly more accurate dates of earthquakes occuring around April 7, 30 AD. Nevertheless, it is quite likely that such an earthquake might have gone quite unnoticed elsewhere, as it probably does not require such a major earthquake to produce the events reported in the gospel accounts. Even a moderate earthquake could release sufficient radon to be an issue in producing the Shroud image, as De Liso has indicated from her moderate seismic region of Piedmont.

I found it intriguing: the unusual depiction of a naked Christ; the dorsal view; the crossed hands over the pelvis; the flagellation marks; the two executioners either side; maybe even the alleged suggestion of epsilon finger signs. However there seems to be a historical problem in associating it with a presumably Byzantine Shroud image. The Psalter is said to be Carolingian, perhaps 800 – 814 AD. At this time tensions between East and West were strained, and there seems to have been little close contact. Note that the Mandylion did not arrive in Constantinople until 945, and it is not until after this that the supposed full image was revealed. There are of course earlier suggestions of a full body image might have been known. The time also coincides with an iconoclastic period in Byzantine history. In the case of the Pray manuscript there is a link through King Bela III, who was for a time heir apparent to the Byzantine imperial throne.

I even provided some clues as to the presence of the full length image seen in Constantinople and elsewhere. But the discussion then degenerated into some infantile visual lampooning of my comments making sensible discussion impossible, and I do not seek to make the same mistake twice. Briefly, it was not only mere prudery that would have concealed the full length double image, but several other factors as well, and indeed it would be difficult if not impossible to identify a time window within the first millennium when the true nature of the Shroud image could have become publicly known. Some of these factors included: need for secrecy in face of imperial persecutions until the time of Constantine; continuing need for later secrecy in face of imperial acquisitiveness of Passion relics; early reluctance (based on O.T. Prohibitions) to depict icongraphy until about the sixth century; Periods of iconoclasm 726 – 786 & 814 – 842, with icon veneration not being restored until 843; Byzantine reluctance to reveal to the public gaze those relics considered especially sacred (Mike M comment above); Byzantine superstition concerning the use of Christ imagery on coinage and for military purposes; a specific reason relating to fear of earthquakes, and likely implicating the Shroud specifically. Prudery also may indeed have played a part. Even early crucifixion scenes showed a fully robed Christ on the cross. The Syriac Gospel Book of 586 shows Christ dressed in a full length sleeveless tunic, and as late as the ninth century he wears a colobium over a loin cloth or a perizoma. In 740 AD Constantinople experienced a series of continuous earthquakes, and this would seem to mark the time when what is likely to have been the Shroud was sealed in a golden chest, and remained closed to all but the emperor for fear of further earthquakes, until about 1201 when it was then regularly displayed in an elaborate ritual. This seems to have been the ritual observed by Robert de Clari in 1204. This Byzantine reluctance to expose those things considered particularly holy to the public gaze survive even to the present time. A vestige of it might be seen in the use of the iconostasis during the consecration in the formal liturgy, concealing this sacred moment from the eyes of the general congregation. Even in the Roman church until the 1950s we were taught that only the priest might touch the sacred vessels. I mentioned that there were clues. Perhaps the most salient can be found in the Hymn of the Pearl composed by the Edessan Hymnodist Bardesan about 200 AD, probably on the occasion of the baptism of the court of King Abgar VIII the Great. It would seem likely that Bardesan might have had the opportunity to view the full length image at this time. A Prince, the son of the King, is divested of his shining robe, and must wrest a pearl from the serpent; he travels to Egypt, snatches pearl, returns home, but his robe now seems an image of himself; There are several interpretation, but an obvious analogy is that of Christ being sent to redeem humanity from Satan. The hymn concludes: “On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness. And the image of the King of kings Was depicted in full all over it…” One interpretation of this strange verse would seem to be: Mirrored image on previously clean robe represents mirrored image of Christ on his clean burial cloth; Robe’s reflecting images suggest ventral and dorsal sindonic images; Suggests that Bardaisan had seen the full body image at Edessan royal court. Note the particular recognition of a “Mirror Image”. Yes, the verse is enigmatic, but recognizable in meaning in terms of the Shroud image. It had to be enigmatic, to avoid provoking the Emperor in Rome..","date":"2015-12-07","mins":"5:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-215877","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I doubt that it’s valid to take measurements from the Abgar icon.

A heavenly vision revealed that the city would not be freed of such ill until such time as the linen cloth with the Lord’s face on it should be locked up and hidden away, far from human eyes. And so it was done. The sacred linen cloth was locked away in a golden case and carefully sealed up, and then the earthquake stopped and the heaven sent ills ceased. From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake.” Although it refers only to the face, it cannot be the Mandylion which had been frequently displayed since its arrival in Constantinople as recently as 945. This cloth is evidently held in greater esteem than even the Mandylion. The only other acheiropoietos Christ image impressed upon linen then present in the city of Constantinople was the Image of God Incarnate. The reference to the face can be easily attributed to the writer’s limited understanding of what the golden case actually contained. There were two significant candidate earthquakes in Constantinople which might have prompted this seclusion of the relic, the series in 740, and another in 869. Damage was limited in the 869 quake and it could not be described as continuous, but the 740 series of quakes endured for a year: “In the same year (740) a violent and fearful earthquake occurred at Constantinople on 26 October, indiction 9, a Wednesday, in the 8th hour. Many churches and monasteries collapsed and many people died. There also fell down the statue of Constantine the Great that stood above the gate of Atalos as well as that of Atalos himself, the statue of Arkadios that stood on the column of the Xerolophos, and the statue of Theodosios the Great above the Golden Gate, furthermore, the land walls of the City, many towns and villages in Thrace, Nicomedia in Bithynia, Prainetos, and Nicaea, where only one church was spared. In some places the sea withdrew from its proper boundaries. The quakes continued for twelve months.” [Theophanes, A.M. 6232, p. 412.6 ff] ‘The imperial covenant with God was broken at the turn of the thirteenth century. Nicholas Mesarites’ statement, in 1201, that Jesus’ resurrection was being reenacted in Pharos Chapel ceremonials which involved a sindon that had “…wrapped the mysterious, naked dead body after the Passion” confirms that he, and the other participants in this rite, had viewed the image, very likely whenever they lifted the cloth to a vertical position. Three aspects of Mesarites’ statement identify this sindon as the Turin Shroud: his description of the body as naked, his use of the adjective aperilepton, meaning “unoutlined”, which aptly describes the relic’s blurry image, and his claim that the cloth had defied destruction, alluding no doubt to the fire damage evidenced by the relic’s so called “poker holes”. ‘ [Markwardt, St Louis conference paper] The covenant was evidently broken by the disreputable emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195 1203). He was deposed by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade at the instigation of the newly installed Byzantine co emperors, Isaac and his son, Alexios IV. His serial treachery and flagrant desecration of the tombs of his imperial predecessors amply demonstrate that he cared nothing about loyalty or honor, and that he would have thought nothing of breaking a centuries old imperial covenant with God. So that for some 460 years from 741 to 1201, the Shroud had been consigned to utter obscurity..","date":"2015-12-07","mins":"2:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216111","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It seems clear enough that the Mandylion was not the cloth that was sealed in a golden case, such that all but the emperor were forbidden to view it, as reported in the Tarragon manuscript. [In 1995, a Byzantine scholar, Krijnie N. Ciggaar, published a French translation of the anonymous Tarragonensis 55 (generally known as the Tarragon manuscript), datable to ca. 1075 1098, written in Latin, and maintained in the Public Library of Tarragon, Spain: Ciggaar, Krijnie N., Une Description de Constantinople dans le Tarrogonensis 55’, Revue des Etudes Byzantines 53, pp. 117ff. (1995). ] Nor would it seem were there any disastrous earthquakes in Constantinople following the Mandylion’s arrival there in 945, that would have prompted such an action. But there were such earthquakes there in 740 and a lesser one in 869. Prior to its departure from Edessa, the Mandylion had been viewed several times during the preceding centuries, its container had been opened and the cloth had been viewed by the clergy and the faithful. Bishop Abramios of Samosata had closely inspected it on its acquisition by the Byzantine Army. On its arrival in Constantinople it had been viewed by the emperor’s sons after having been carried in procession. Symeon Metaphrastes recites that, upon the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople, “everyone was looking at the marvelous image of the Son of God on the holy cloth … “. John Skylitzes’ Synopsis of Byzantine History recites that, in 1036, the Mandylion was carried in procession through the capital in an attempt to end a six month drought, and Abu Nasr Yahya, a Christian Arab writer, claims to have viewed the icon within the Hagia Sophia Cathedral in 1058. It is virtually certain that some Byzantine artists were given access to the Mandylion in order to produce the copies which are dateable to 944 ca. 1090. This is in stark contrast to the cloth described in the Tarragon manuscript, hidden from all eyes except that of the emperor! So, what was it? There is little mention, if any, of the Image of God Incarnate after the iconoclasm periods of 726 – 786, and 814 – 842. Some had therefore concluded that this Image had been destroyed during the iconoclasm. However there is no known report of this image having been destroyed. In fact, as it was acheiropoietos, “not made by human hands” its destruction would have been deemed a sacrilege, as opposed to those images that had been made by human hands, and so deemed legitimate targets for destruction. Fr Heinrich Pfeiffer believes it was not so destroyed, but possibly adopting a Mandylion = Shroud thesis, he associates it with the Veil of Manoppello. I have been unable to discover his justification for this conclusion, but perhaps someone else might know his reason. Note that the 740 year of the severe continuous earthquake coincides with the first iconoclasm period, and might well be deemed a justification for ongoing iconoclasm, if depictions of icons were deemed to prompt divine wrath such as in the form of earthquakes, or incidentally even military defeats. However the fact that the Image of God Incarnate, aka Image of Camuliana, was deemed to be acheiropoietos, would be sufficient to shield it from iconoclasts, and so the solution of sealing it away in a golden casket hidden from all eyes would be adopted. There are several problems in the attempt to identify the Mandylion with the Shroud, as many have reported. But it seems that a Shroud like image was being displayed in the Pharos chapel in 1201 accoring to Nicholas Mesarites. And yet the Mandylion continued to be separately identified in the inventories. A good case can be made for the survival of the Image of God Incarnate from the iconoclastic period, that it was the cloth sealed away in a golden casket for some 460 years, hidden away from all eyes except those of the emperor, and this was the cloth that came to be known as the Shroud of Turin..","date":"2015-12-10","mins":"5:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216166","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If in fact any man made artistic copies of the Image of God Incarnate had been made before it was sealed away in a casket around 740 AD, due to fear of divine wrath, then any such copies would likely be destroyed during the periods of iconoclasm 726 – 786 or 814 – 842. This might account for the absence of any representation of the Shroud double image from the first millennium. On the resumption of iconography in 843, the likeness of the Image of God Incarnate would have been long forgotten, until the casket was re opened around 1201. But with one possible exception: Bela III, as heir apparent to the Byzantine Imperial Throne, might well have been entitled to view the image. Upon returning to Hungary, after his betrothal was annulled, his recollections of what he saw may have informed the illustrator of the Hungarian Pray Codex.
