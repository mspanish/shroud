You need to remember that they’re intended to be used as a rubric in the Orthodox Easter Friday and Saturday liturgies, that’s their purpose. I found a You Tube video, but it’s the full service, very long, rapidly wordy, and I didn’t see much action after about 10 minutes of watching, all behind the reredos stuff. But check out the stills sequence bottom of: http://www.stirene.org/holy friday night—epitaphios procession.html You’ll see it being taken in procession. I doubt if you’d ever find one of the same dimensions as the Shroud, they’re intended to be representational, not accurate models, think Byzantine mind set.

Apparently it was discovered in a Thessalonika church in 1900 but is attributed to the time of the Palaiologos family who became prominent in Greece in the 11th century, and founded the imperial Palaiologi dynasty in 1269. It is now considered the benchmark against which all other Byzantine embroidery is judged.

Daniel Scavone suggests it may be 14th 15th century which of course post dates 1355. However apparently it comes from a Mt Athos monastery, and he suggests that it is therefore of Greek origin “looking back” rather than being influenced by the Lirey showings. The cloth clearly shows a representation of the herring bone twill, extensive flagellation marks, and of course crossed hands over the loins. It is evident just from the chest wound that the Shroud is itself a mirror image and so we see it as if the right hand is over the left, rather than the actuality of it being left over right. The epitaphioi that I looked at all seem to show the right hand over the left, so they do seem modeled on the Shroud image. Wiki says that the oldest known epitaphios is one at Venice which is thought to date from ~1200. Epitaphioi are essentially an Orthodox practice, so that the oldest being at Venice is a little surprising. Perhaps the returning crusaders brought it as a trophy from Constantinople after they’d sacked it in 1204!!?? I wouldn’t bet on Hugh’s chances of finding a north east European origin for the genre, no matter how much time he takes to search for it..","date":"2014-04-14","mins":"8:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/14/if-the-shroud-is-a-forgery-where-are-its-precedents-2/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"If the shroud is a forgery, where are its precedents?"}]
