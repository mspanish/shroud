As for Frei, his fundamental training was in botany, he exercised the science of palynology to the extent that it had been developed in his time, had often applied it giving evidence in several criminal cases, and was widely consulted by several other Police jurisdictions, to the extent that he was commissioned to investigate the plane crash when former UN Secretary General Dag Hamerskjoeld was killed. It might be fair to ask to what extent has Hugh Farey been commissioned to give palynological evidence in criminal cases!.","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210261","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It’s all very well to propose a new round of pollen investigations, but following the 2002 “restoration”, that is likely to prove quite difficult if not impossible. The debris on the Shroud from this “restoration” was supposed to have been collected, and one might hope that is adequately catalogued “somewhere in Turin”. How accessible it might be to bona fide investigators would be another question entirely. Meantime we have to be satisfied with the previous investigations by Frei, Danin, Baruch and Litt, hoped for publications at some time in the future, and with what Hugh Farey makes of it all, himself no specialist in palynology, an extremely difficult science. The comment that pollen cannot be identified at species level seems peculiar. One might expect that the DNA of pollen grains ought to be exclusive at the species level, and one might hope for a technology that could actually make this identification, when past samples could be re examined. I think it was Stephen Jones who had at one time suggested that the pollen collected might be radio carbon dated. How feasible that proposition might be could be doubtful, and likely have the disadvantage of destroying what pollen samples might be available. We end up with yet another unsatisfactory situation, apparently having put all our trust in those with a claim to know the science, but apparently who knew a lot less than they thought they did..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"5:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-214261","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"No doubt there will come a time when it will be feasible to radiocarbon date pollen grains.
