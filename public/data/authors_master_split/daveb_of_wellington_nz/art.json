I found it particularly informative on the number of early beardless Christs, and I was reminded of a recent posting here in apocryphal writings of Jesus as “shape shifter”, where his appearance was said to be different to different people. Which is of course legendary stuff. However by the end of it, I considered the paper overly interpretive, and came to a conclusion of how artistic mythology is created and reinforced by such papers. The paper is weak on some necessary objective factual evidence. Much is made of the now discredited Pierre D’Arcy memo, and it was only too evident that the Thurston / Chevalier notorious paper had been uncritically embraced by the authors, and it was only too clear that this alone was sufficient for them to adopt an anti authenticity position regarding the Shroud, with no mention of any scientific work to the contrary. The idea presented being to reinforce their thesis that acceptance of Christ imagery is determined by popular low culture, as anti Pope Clement VII had acceded to the popular demand for the Lirey expositions against the factual evidence, an overly subjective interpretation indeed. It cannot be surprising that iconic portrayals in the West differ considerably from those in eastern Christianity of whatever branch, Orthodox, Nestorian or Monphysite. The Eastern focus was on representations of Mandylion imagery, and it was some centuries before this penetrated to the West. I wonder for example if Michelangelo had indeed ever heard of the Mandylion? The Western imagery is largely irrelevant when it comes to debating to what extent the Mandylion influenced the appearance of Christ imagery. For a productive discussion concerning what influence the Shroud may have had on such imagery, the focus needs to concentrate on the eastern representations..","date":"2014-05-15","mins":"4:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/15/even-in-china-they-know-jesus-characteristic-features/","cat":"art","title":"A Guest Posting by O.K. –  Even in China They Know Jesus’ Characteristic Features"},{"id":"comment-11841","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Neither close minded skeptics nor obsessive fanatics will arrive at the truth of this matter, unless they’re prepared for a change in mind set, and engage themselves in some honest research.

Wilson cites one of the earliest reliable records of the burial cloth by an English tourist of 1125, but the Byzantines were not prepared to sacrifice their earlier traditions of the mandylion, the legend of Abgar and so forth so easily, so these too are inventoried. Up until this time most depictions of Christ’s burial were to have him wrapped mummy style, but from this time forth, we see a complete change, towards the threnos or lamentation depictions, with a nude prone Christ, hands crossed somewhat uncomfortably across the pubis region, and usually with only four fingers shown on each hand, with no thumbs.

The museum director Erman Bediz explained that it was an 8in x 6in fragment discovered by a local citizen making structural alterations to his house. He “hacked” it out and sold it to the museum on a “no questions asked” basis. The museum did not have it on display but only in storage, but it was viewed by Wilson & Guscin.

They are said to date from the 2nd 3rd centuries. The men of that time are all depicted with beards, and bushy hair, one or two wear turbans, the women are “golden robed and golden sandaled”. It is tempting to identify the ISSA mosaic as a copy of the Mandylion, particularly as Louis makes the point concerning similarity in the detail of the Saints Sergius & Bacchus in Kiev museum. Also archaeologist Dr Onal identified it as an “Issa” (= Jesus) icon. In view of the tradition of mosaic work among notable families, I suppose it is just possible it may represent someone else, perhaps in much the same way as modern families display family photographs. Not knowing the specific location of where the mosaic was found might perhaps be considered a problem in confirming it as a Jesus icon.

I guess complex fantasy plots with large casts of characters all with abstruse names is not really my genre. Colin’s quote of Tolkien’s comment that “Rings” is a “fundamentally religious and Catholic work”, I can however understand. It exploits the cosmic conflict between ‘good’ and ‘evil’, a classic theme in any number of other heroic epics. Essentially the same perspective is dwelt on in the Book of Revelations, and other apocalyptic scriptures. Rather more to my liking, are the works of Graham Greene. Catholicism here is more explicit, but Greene deals with it in an unconventional and unexpected way, and creates fascinating moral dilemmas, which are resolved in a way that is unexpected, and forces the reader to reflect on the issues he raises. Often depressing, but an excellent writer. A quote from Encyc Brit: “The world Greene’s characters inhabit is a fallen one, and the tone of his works emphasizes the presence of evil as a palpable force. His novels display a consistent preoccupation with sin and moral failure acted out in seedy locales characterized by danger, violence, and physical decay. Greene’s chief concern is the moral and spiritual struggles within individuals, but the larger political and social settings of his novels give such conflicts an enhanced resonance. His early novels depict a shabby Depression stricken Europe sliding toward fascism and war, while many of his subsequent novels are set in remote locales undergoing wars, revolutions, or other political upheavals.”.","date":"2013-10-29","mins":"7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/29/bouguereaus-mary/","cat":"art","title":"Bouguereau’s Mary"},{"id":"comment-134291","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My dear father, long since departed, grew up during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and for many years of his life worked as a butcher in a meat factory.

Max had also referred to another, MPH: “The Monastery of Stavronikita epithaphios is only mid 16th c. CE. See also the 1300 CE ca zigzag/herringbone patterned epitaphios from the Byzantine Museum in Thessaloniki.” The Thessalonika example appears to be quite different. He then commented on the St Mark’s cathedra of 7th century, which did appear to have signs of a herring bone weave. There was more extensive discussion some 15 months later when the stavronikita topic was revisited: https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/21/herringbone weave within stavronikita epitaphios revisited/ References there were also made to earlier examples, 1300 and 1200, claiming to have the herring bone weave. Again discussion diverted to the 700 AD St Mark’s cathedra. There was some dispute between Max & Yannick C re the dating of various epitaphioi, Yannick apparently wanting to demonstrate that the Mandylion was still in Edessa at the time of these epitaphioi, and hence Mandylion had to be a different object from the Shroud, but I think that ended up as shown to be a false argument. Daniel Scavone had written an informative paper on epitaphioi, (the PDF is dated January 2000); “GREEK EPITAPHIOI AND OTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE SHROUD IN CONSTANTINOPLE UP TO 1204” and can be found at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/scavone.pdf Scavone makes the point that although Western crusaders had visited Constantinople in 1204, the Byzantines did not reciprocate, and the Lirey Shroud would have been unknown to them. Nevertheless, several epitaphioi did show Shroud like features, even centuries after 1204 when the burial cloths were taken, so that these features seemed so well established in the Byzantine memory, that they persisted in the design of the various epitaphioi. My interest in the epitaphioi stems from the extremely long and somewhat frustrating debate concerning the Hungarian Pray manuscript of 1192 95, with well over 250 contributed comments, with contenders scarcely moving away from their initial viewpoints as to whether or not the Shroud had influenced its composition. Hugh Farey had commented that what was needed to establish a connection was the discovery of some kind of “smoking gun” clue. I suggest that the “smoking gun” might be found in a close study of the epitaphioi. Scavone’s paper is informative in this regard. However the dating of several of the examples seem ambiguous, with many different opinions about the same object. The epitaphioi often show features which could only have come from the Turin Shroud, but even though many of the examples post date 1204, and often enough even 1355, it seems unlikely that knowledge of details from the cloth’s presence in Lirey was a factor in their design. It seems to stem from a Byzantine tradition and the memory of when it was in Constantinople. I conclude that the epitaphioi provide strong evidence that the Shroud was in Contantinople prior to 1204, and that many details of its features were well enough known to have persisted in the Byzantine memory well after that time..","date":"2014-06-28","mins":"6:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/28/comment-promoted-the-stavronikita-epitaphios/","cat":"art","title":"Comment Promoted:  The Stavronikita Epitaphios"},{"id":"comment-134286","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"From Hugh’s almost predictable comment below 6:54am , I fear you might well be correct.

Colin has made some shrewd observations of distinctions between such software and the way our brains work. The software provides objective measurement but is imperfect. Our brain works on some kind of subjective measurement, but making it difficult to express communication of the comparisons between different observers. This makes discussion of whether perceived images of subjects A and B are the of same person or not controversial and even contentious. We see this all the time in our discussions of comparisons between Christ icons and the Shroud image. We have come a long way since the Vignon markings; they might be seen as an analogue of the computer software. But Vignon markings are often considered suspect when it comes to asserting a Shroud like facial image on an icon. Nevertheless many of us see the likeness of icons to the Shroud facial image. Others may deny such likeness. How much of it is wishful thinking; How much of it is merely personal denial? We cannot say. It seems to be merely in the perceptions of the beholder!

While the original might even be first thought to be a photograph with its subtle treatment of light, his copy could never be thought to be anything else but a painting. However, his comments are important, and the first that I have seen on this site by anyone with any practical experience, knowledge and competence in portrait work, as distinct from mere art critics, or art historians.

A particular comment attracted my interest, the “now you see it, now you don’t” qualities of the Shroud image. I wondered if this might be due, not merely to the superficiality of the image depth, but because the image pixels are confined to the very crowns of the image fibres, so that the precise angle of observation might be a factor in this subtlety. His experiment with a myrrh covered statue I also find intriguing, notwithstanding his comments of its not complying with the image’s chemical properties. I am sorry that I fail to be impressed by Hugh’s response, in attributing the image to a human agency intending to create a “sweaty imprint”. To my mind Hugh is too locked in to the results of the radiocarbon dating, and is unable to concede that they might be incorrect, or irrelevant. If a “sweaty imprint” was the intent, then a more convincing and persuasively realistic negative image as shown up by the Pia Henri photographs could not have been so intended, and it is stretching the laws of unintended consequences to claim it as an accident.

His claims of “repeatedly conceding that they might be incorrect” is fresh news to me! The Shroud image itself as such is hardly a convincing liturgical prop. Its image is in fact quite elusive. More persuasive as liturgical props are the epitaphioi, such as the Stavroniska which seems to be modeled on the Shroud image, and are known to have been used as such. I can conceive no reason why anybody should come up with the idea that a sweaty imprint might be appropriate for such a purpose, given the highly elaborate and decorated props that liturgies have customarily used. As for the suitability of the cloth for an actual shroud to wrap a dead body, we cannot know the circumstances that may well have constrained Joseph of Arimathea in his choice. Perhaps he had intended it for his own burial, or it may have been an himation ready to hand, it was likely a public holiday and the markets were closing up for the day.

There are certainly some intriguing pictures there, and I certainly noted a definite herring bone pattern on one of them. There was also some rough(?) lettering, looked as if it had been hand carved, I thought it might be early Greek, I wonder if Max or someone else is able to provide a translation. I was a little disappointed that the pictures had no identifying captions, tags or commentary. Most of the text seemed to be a kind of promo for Stephan’s article, and his wonderment that his paper had been accepted for publication along with other prestigious writers, but little other information. 2: I attempted a search of the web for more definitive examples, but as yet not with much success. It was apparent that herring bone weave was commonly practised from ancient times The herring bone pattern in other art forms also seems to have had some popularity, extending to block or brickwork walls, and even to beadwork by southern African tribes such as the Bdelebe(?). 3. I discovered a fascinating paper by Diana Fulbright: “Akeldama Repudiation of Turin Shroud omits evidence from the Judean desert”. By Diana Fulbright, 2010; Shroud of Turin Centre, Richmond VA. Paper can be found at: http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Fulbright Akeldama Web.pdf It is possible to download the paper, but only as a “secure” pdf. The security means that it is not possible to copy any of the text or graphics from this paper. In December 2009, following the discovery of a sealed 1st c. Jewish tomb at Akeldama, when a “shrouded” body was discovered, it was widely proclaimed that the Turin Shroud could not be 1st c. As this single example was in simple weave. This inference is clearly an extremely weak deduction, with no statistical significance. It almost appears as if the body may not have been shrouded at all, but was merely wrapped in its own clothing, indeed with mixing of kinds, both wool and linen (apparently permitted for dead bodies under Mishna regs). The D Fulbright paper is directed against the Akeldama assertions, citing several examples of herring bone weave from ancient times, Even more complex patterns of weaving were found at Masada, including a diamond twill. The sash of Rameses III (1200 BCE) included a number of complex patterns, including a 3:1 herring bone twill. It is apparent that weavers were quite capable of producing quite intricate patterns from ancient times. 4. Indeed the apparent prevalence of the herring bone twill, probably means that some caution is required when artifacts are discovered with this pattern. It would be precipitate to associate such occurences with the TS, unless there was clearly some other associative or corroborative evidence, such as when it is definitely related to a threnos, lamentation, or epitaphios artifact. That there is a zigzag pattern on the 6th c. St Mark’s cathedra is certainly a tempting association, but it may be just a little too tenuous to make a decisive connection with the twill of the TS..","date":"2012-07-23","mins":"9:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/21/herringbone-weave-within-stavronikita-epitaphios-revisited/","cat":"art","title":"Herringbone Weave within Stavronikita Epitaphios (Revisited)"},{"id":"comment-14164","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max: Thank you for your additional comments above.

Hand signals were a very common and accepted means of silent communication throughout the ancient world. Nor through scanning quickly through the Psalter did I come across another specific instance of the epsilon sign. It may well be that the other various hand signs shown also have their own particular significance which is now unknown to us. It seems to have originated with a wide assortment of finger counting systems which included sophisticated forms of finger calclations, silent bargaining practices, guessing games of skill such as variations in the morra game, to the extent that literary allusions to numbers often became metaphors, many of them derogatory or vulgar. Georges Ifrah cites very many such examples in chapter 3 of his history of numbers “From One to Zero”. That such allusions found their way into the literature would indicate a common understanding of what was intended. It adequately demonstrates that hand signals were once a very common and well understood means of silent communication. When seen in the context of the scourging illustration in the Psalter, with its other Shroud like motifs, a naked Christ with crossed hands over the pelvis, scourging blood marks, two executioners wielding Roman flagra tipped with pellets, then the suggestion of the epsilon signal pointing to the heads is more than just interesting. It may in fact be of some quite definite significance. It is known that Charlemagne did have links with Constantinople, and some of his court may have been privy to a private exposition there or elsewhere. On the other hand, it is by no means certain that the cloth reported by Arculf to Adamnan was in fact the Shroud or else some other like object.

Nevertheless there are likely links between the Camuliana and the Edessa cloths. Edessa may have been copied from Camuliana.

The Mandylion is reported as being sent to King Louis of France after 1204, and later destroyed during the French Revolution. The Mandylion was always deemed to be a face, until at least after 944, and yet from after the discovery of Camuliana, we have full length images in illustrations and crucifixes and banners. I think your reference to the cloth sent to Abgar is naive. I think Markwardt gives an adequate explanation in his Antioch paper referring to the conversion of Abgar VIII the Great, (not Abgar V), and that may well have been the Shroud which Bishop Avercius Marcellus had temporary custody of from Antioch.

How then could 6th 7th century iconoclastic Byzantines then produce crucifixes, images of the crucifixion, and upper torso icons of Christ, based only on a facial image?

Despite the apostles fleeing Jerusalem after the stoning of Stephen, and Peter founding the Antioch church, you presume that they left the burial cloths behind in Jerusalem, even though there are early references claiming that they were kept by Peter. The Mandylion was claimed to be “painted in choice colours” which does not fit a description of the Shroud image, and as yet there are no grounds for presuming that the Manoppello is anything but a painted image. On the other hand the Camuliana is the very first image that is described as “acheiropoiteios”. I recall that Scavone (still apparently a supporter of the Mandylion theory) gives citations indicating that the “Image of God Incarnate” did include a body image, but fails to recognise that this cannot apply to the Mandylion. Markwardt examines Wilson’s Mandylion theory in considerable detail, and identifies the reasons why it cannot be sustained. After attending to securing the church in Antioch against Chosroes, Bishop Ephraim suddenly departed on a mission to Cappadocia when he might have been expected to stay and rally the populace. On his return to Antioch this is not held against him but he continues in his role as Patriarch, it must have been an exceedingly important mission. If the Shroud is the true burial cloth of Christ, then clearly it had be in existence somewhere at this time, and the Camuliana would seem to be the best candidate. As you would know and have sometimes posted, the Abgar legend was rewritten on a number of occasions, doubtless sometimes garbled from what the Scribe had thought he had heard, and doubtless to suit current local agendas, even to borrowing tales which had actually occurred elsewhere.

Following its discovery in Camuliana, it was paraded around Cappadocia and then taken to Constantinople in 574. There are several Byzantine references to it, it was modeled for various military palladia, but together with inconoclastic periods and following several military defeats, and a series of continuous earthquakes, the superstitious Byzantines locked it away for some centuries until the unscrupulous emperor Alexios III broke the imperial covenant made with God and opened it (1195 1203). Hence the observations made by Robert de Clari in 1204. It may even have been the model for the original Image of Edessa and the numerous copies made of it. It would account for the Justinian 7th century coinage showing a Shroud like facial image of Christ, along with Homs vase image, but which later reverted to a less suffering non Pantocrator imagery, because of this covenant.

It seems that Pfeiffer identifies the Camuliana with the Manoppello, but the ref does not elaborate on why he thought that. He also notes that the image disappears from Constantinople and somehow ends up in Rome. This corresponds to the time when Markwardt claims that the Camuliana was hidden away arising from iconoclasm, the defeats and the earthquakes. Markwardt notes that the Camuliana was the first one to be described as acheiropoietios, “not made by human hands” as stated by Pfeiffer. He also notes the legends that on its discovery, the Camuliana immediately spawned two copies of itself, and one might therefore speculate that Ephraim may have hidden more than one cloth at Camuliana, one of which might have become Manoppello, if in fact Manoppello is also acheiropoietos, and not a painted copy (not known). Much is made of the assertion that no one knows what the “Image of God Incarnate” looked like. However Markwardt gives a number of clues, beginning at p.37 of his St Louis paper, section ‘Full length and On cloth Images of Jesus’: 1) With regard to its full length image, first, the “custom of displaying the Redeemer on the Cross…began with the close of the sixth century”; 2) A full length crucified Jesus was illustrated in a Syrian Gospel Book dateable to 586, the very year that a copy of the archetypal Image of God Incarnate was displayed on a Byzantine labarum at the Battle of Solachon; 3) Only an acheiropoietos full length image of Jesus crucified could have convinced the iconoclastic Eastern Church clergy to countenance, and perhaps even invent, crucifixes and crucifixion images; 4) Mozarabic Rite of the Visigothic Church of Spain began to recite that “Peter ran to the tomb with John and saw the recent imprints of the dead and risen one on the cloths” (likely written by Bishop Leandro of Seville, who was in Constantinople 579 582); 5) Pope Gregory the Great ordered the creation of a tempera painting of a full length (albeit clothed and non suffering) Jesus, installed in the Sancta Sanctorum Chapel, and named it the Acheropita, the acheiropoieton (Gregory papal ambassador to Constantinople 579 585).

One telling argument against it is that the Image of Edessa showed only the face, and it is asserted that its alleged full length images only became known some time after its transfer to Constantinople by John Curcuas in 944. Nevertheless, soon after the discovery of the Camuliana and its transfer to Constantinople in 574, the iconoclastic Byzantines saw fit to portray upper body icons of Christ, invented crucifixes, used the full image of Christ as palladia and labara, and a full length crucified Jesus illustrated a Syrian Gospel book in 586.

The best way of locating the position of the wound is at the wound site itself, using a sufficiently clear image of the outline of the hands.

The Ingeborg Psalter has a plain undecorated lid. Both lids are skewed in a similar way as the Pray rectangle. You mention other earlier works which I have not pursued. There are distinctive variants in the Pray example: 1) There is no box or casket evident; the underlying base is a slab; 2) A tomb lid without a box or casket would be meaningless as such; 3) The skewed rectangle might be considered perhaps as a stylistic copy of a feature from the other works; 4) The feature may therefore have been intended to represent something else; 5) The rectangle’s wavy edge compared to the slabs straight edges, the zigzag pattern, and the four holes set in an L shape square to the rectangle, are highly suggestive of a cloth rather than a tomb lid, specifically the Shroud cloth; 6) I consider Charles’ reference to the fire holes in the Stone of Unction Rotunda as quite irrelevant in the context of any of The Three Marys representations; he might well choose any other set of random occurrence of holes.

I should think that an all important question in any artist’s work, is “What is the subject he is intending to depict?” Then there are the questions of secondary messages that the artist also wants to communicate. In the various depictions of the Veronica, Image of Edessa, Mandylion etc, I could only agree that the principal subject is clearly the living face of Christ. In all the various depictions of the visit of the Three Marys to the Tomb that I have seen, it is clearly the sense of wonder at the realisation of the Risen Christ. I can recall no instance where the Shroud image was featured in any of these works, even as late as the 1500s, even though the Shroud was known to have been in Europe during the previous 200 years or so. Most of the artists would have been aware of the Shroud, and they would need little imagination to associate it with the Resurrection. But they never chose to represent it in these scenes. The Lamentation scenes and the epitaphioi first seem to appear as early as about 1200, often depicting a Shroud like image of the Christ recumbent in death. The Stavronitska is a particularly good example, showing both scourge marks and blood flows. The subject is always the depiction of Christ in death, sometimes including the burial rite by the mourners. The Pray illustration is perhaps our first known attempt at representing the burial of Christ in a Shroud like posture, completely naked, crossed hands near the groin, no thumbs. The lower illustration is of course not the first known attempt at the Resurrection morning visit. The subject remains the sense of wonder at the realisation of the Risen Christ. The subject is not the image of Christ in death, nor the image on the Shroud. Even if the artist knew of the image, it would not be within his purpose to depict it. Holes are visible on the underlying slab, and also on the slanted rectangle. Perhaps these may be an echo of what crusaders had seen on the Jerusalem tomb. The holes in the slab seem to be arranged randomly, whereas those on the rectangle are arranged as a deliberate L, in a similar pattern as on the Shroud. However, a slab is not a casket, such as is clearly depicted on the Cologne and Ingeborg Psalter examples. A tomb lid is therefore meaningless in this context. But the artist has followed a tradition in showing the general shape of having a slanted rectangle, You may see pyramids. I see a zigzag pattern, quite like the herring bone twill. I also see that the edge of the rectangle appears wavy, not straight, suggesting a fabric. The arrangement of holes in an L shape is the clincher for me. I think there is a secondary message that the artist is subtly attempting to convey, but without distracting attention away from his principal subject. I do not see this as dreaming on my part, but more as perspicacity, obvious enough for anyone else with eyes to see. You may see a tomb lid, even though there is no casket whence it might have been..","date":"2014-06-19","mins":"6:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/12/navy-seals-at-the-battle-of-gettysburg-a-picture-of-the-shroud-in-1036/","cat":"art","title":"Navy Seals at the Battle of Gettysburg?

This is evident in the recumbent Christ which also happens to include a blood stain on the forehead. That knowledge of the Shroud had penetrated to the West by 1195 is evident from a) English pilgrim of 1150; b) Icelandic Nicholas Soemundarson 1157 inventory of the imperial relic collection; c) Archbishop William of Tyre 1171; d) also 1200 inventory of Antonius of Novgorod. There may well have been others. Earlier Byzantine records provide sufficient evidence of the Shroud’s actual presence in Constantinople. This is more substantial evidence than any that might place the Shroud in early medieval France, for which there is none, but which you apparently favour yet with nothing to substantiate it. The illustrator has no need to show the Shroud image, in the visitation scene; it is already present in the recumbent Christ above. Nevertheless he hints at it symbolically. You may consider me misled. I might respond with epithets of blindness and obstinacy, but there is no need for that.

It is clearly intended to be representational only. The codex is the first known attempt at a written work in the Hungarian language, with little preceding tradition behind it, and it must be seen as such. Holes will not be shown with their ragged edges but merely as small circles; the pattern of the weave was not intended to withstand a textile specialist’s scrutiny, but merely indicated by its striking feature, a zigzag pattern. Max’s principal arguments, succinctly summarised by Mike M, are strong evidence that the illustrator indeed knew of the Shroud image. It is reasonable that the oblique rectangular shape near the bottom of the picture, with its wavy edge and zigzag pattern is intended to indicate the Shroud cloth, rather than a tomb lid with straight edges, whereas the underlying slab with its cross marks (a different pattern) does have straight edges. The four holes arranged in an L shape and oriented square to the cloth edges, occur in the centre of this rectangle, i.e. On what may be taken as the cloth. The Klosterneuberg Pulpit illustration said to predate 1181 has some similarities with the Pray illustration, but is more stylised, the Christ has some draping (enshroudment?), appears as being placed into a burial casket (western burial practice), it is a Lamentation scene, not a post Resurrection scene, and the oblique rectangle in the background might be construed as the lid of the casket.

Second Florentine Period 1500 08: soon after victorious French entry into Milan; various engineering and military works for Florentine governing council; Visits Mantua, Venice 1500, returns to Florence; Departs Florence 1502 to work for Cesare Borgia, surveys and produces maps of territories; 1503 returns to Florence, plans for canal route connecting Florence to sea; works for 3 years on major painting Battle of Anghiari; Paints Mona Lisa 1503 06; Intensive scientific studies on anatomy (dissects 30 cadavers) and also on hydrology (fluid flow), flights of birds. Second Milanese Period 1508 13: In 1506 French governor of Milan, d’Amboise sought release of Leonardo from Florentine signoria, Battle of Anghiari remained unfinished. 1507 08 assisted Rustici with bronze statues for Florence baptistery then settled in Milan. Main work in Milan architectural advice on various projects. Little painting during this period, trained pupils in his studio, but his scientific work flourished at this time. Trivulsio, marshal of victorious French army returns to Milan, commissions Leonardo to sculpt his tomb, an equestrian statue, but after some years of preparatory investigations, this project also proves abortive. Last years 1513 19: 1513 temporary expulsion of French from Milan, Leonardo (aged 60) went to Rome at time of great artistic activity. Despite monthly stipend and accommodation from Giuliano de Medici, there were no large commissions. Worked on mathematical studies, technical experiments, surveyed ancient monuments. In 1516, leaves Italy forever, accepts invitation of French king Francis I as “First painter, architect and engineer to the king”, settles in small residence at Cloux near King’s summer palace at Amboise on the Loire, near Tours. Allowed considerable freedom of action. Various plans for palace and architecture but projects came to nothing because district threatened with malaria. Very little painting during this period, spending most of his time editing his scientific studies, treatise on painting, his anatomy treatise. 1519, dies at Cloux, buried in palace church of St Florentin, church devastated during French Revolution, completely torn down ~1800, grave can no longer be located. The Shroud 1452 1519 … : Within a year of Leonardo’s birth, Margaret de Charnay had gifted the Shroud to the House of Savoy, and the Shroud was then kept in the Savoy Chateau at Chambery, east of Lyon. Essentially the Savoy territory extended from Lake Geneva in the north to the Isere River in the south and eventually extended east across the Alps into Piedmont. In 1502 the Shroud was housed in the newly built Sainte Chapelle at Chambery. In 1509, it was placed in its silver casket commissioned by Margaret of Austria. This was where it was located at the time of Leonardo’s death in 1519, and before the fire of 1532. Following a French invasion of Savoy in 1535, the Shroud was temporarily trasnsferred to Turin, but was returned to Chambery in 1561. Following the transfer of the Savoyard capital to Turin in 1563, the Shroud itself was eventually moved to Turin in 1578, being eventually housed in the Guarini chapel in 1694. Assessment of the argument: Almost all of Leonardo’s working life was spent in Italy – Florence, Milan, Rome – and there is no suggestion that he had any contact with the House of Savoy, in a foreign territory, during this period. His extensive notebooks cover an exceptionally broad scope of diverse interests, and are all available in various publications. Many of the projects he wrote about came to nought. Although he is a pioneer in modern anatomy, nothing has ever been found in his notebooks suggesting that he was ever interested in creating a replica of a lost burial cloth of Christ, the creation of a mysterious image on linen by some means unknown to others, nor is he known to have attempted any such experiments, nor is there anything even suggestive of it in the Leonardo museum. His last years near Tours were as remote from Chambery, as were his early years in Florence and Milan. It’s over, Game, Set and Match!

At: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo4.pdf Guerreschi describes his concertina folding / jar storage experiment, replicated on television with Ian Wilson present, and described and diagrammed by Wilson in his 2010 book. The authors note that the L shaped holes occurred when the cloth was folded in four, when it would then fit the size of a Byzantine altar cloth. Hence the inference that the holes may have been caused by incense. Wilson also has a reference that the burial cloths were tested “by fire and water” and speculates that the holes may have occurred during some ‘trial by fire’. That the holes gave the pattern of a gammadia, opens speculation as to whether the pattern was deliberate, or if accidental, seen as providential and hence not mended. Regarding the early location of the Shroud, Markwardt makes a persuasive argument that it was stored in Antioch until about the mid 6th century, pending the destruction of the city by earthquake and Persian siege, when it was only then taken to Edessa. He interprets the Doctrine of Addai / Acts of Thaddeus as a deliberately secret analogy to record the important occasion of when Bishop Marcellus Avercius was given temporary custody of the cloth in the late second century as a kind of visual aid for the conversion of the court of Abgar VIII the Great at Edessa, and celebrated in the Bardesanic “Hymn of the Pearl”. “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” By Jack Markwardt, 2008: http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf.","date":"2014-07-23","mins":"1:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/22/origin-of-the-gammadia/","cat":"art","title":"Origin of the Gammadia"},{"id":"comment-139929","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin’s referenced image of St Lawrence is one of a great number of artist’s representations of the saint on the web, and this one seems to be the only one that has any similarity at all to the TSM.

The tradition that St Lawrence was slow roasted, together with the comment he’s supposed to have made “I’m done on this side, Turn me over” may well be legendary, and due to a copyist’s misprint of “… passus est …” in omitting the ‘p’ thus “… assus est …” = ‘he was roasted’.

Not a great deal is known about him, but tradition has him as a missionary in Egypt, and there are a variety of stories about his martyrdom, in Persia and elsewhere, and also that he met his death by being sawn in half. Those who assert that he was in fact of the Zealot party, say that it was partly to offset the choice of Matthew, a tax collector, whereas Simon was a member of the tax hating Roman hating Zealots, and that the kingdom of Jesus was to reach out to people in all walks of life. J P Meier, among others, asserts that ‘Zealot’ is a mistranslation, that the term reflected Simon’s zealousness, and that the Zealot movement did not really get under way until the start of the Jewish War in 66 AD. Nevertheless Simon is given the appellation in all four NT verses quoted. Others trace the movement back to the time of the Idumean Herod (the Great). From Josephus’ Jewish Antiquities: “The Zealots were a “fourth sect”, founded by Judas of Galilee (also called Judas of Gamala) in the year 6 against Quirinius’ tax reform, shortly after the Roman Empire declared what had most recently been the tetrarchy of Herod Archelaus to be a Roman province, and that they ‘agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord.’ ” And of course there’s much more!

Various markings extended the system up to 100 million, e.g. The letters written above an ‘M’ denoted myriads (=10,000). Gamma is not only the third letter in the alphabet, it actually represents the number three. Refer Georges Ifrah’s text p.261 et seq. The Jews adapted a very similar system using Hebrew letters. For example the Hebrew symbol for the numeral three is the letter ‘gimel’.

This Year B, it is the Passion according to the rudimentary Mark, who always tells it like it was. There are many passages there which relate to our various discussions on aspects of the Shroud cloth. Nearly all of the male characters come out of the narrative fairly badly, while the women seem to fare rather better. This is a sea change in the contemporary social wisdom concerning gender roles. Was Jesus anointed for his burial?. The opening passage gives the answer. A woman comes in and pours an alabaster jar of pure spikenard over the head of Jesus, specifically for his burial we are told. It is the men who complain of the waste, ointment to the value of 300 denarii, a whole year’s wages for a workman. “One of you is about to betray me!” “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times!” At Gethsemane, the disciples cannot keep watch with their master, but fall asleep. Mark’s gospel is the only one that tells of a young man, fleeing naked, as he leaves his linen cloth behind with the guards. Some think it is a pointer to the author of the gospel. Adrie vd Hoeven has suggested it may indeed have been the very Shroud cloth itself, that Joseph of Aramathaea recovered when he went to see Pilate. Jesus is silent before the Sanhedrin, while the so called witnesses against him contradict one another, until the direct question is put to him by the high priest, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” Receiving an affirmative answer, the high.priest tears his robes, foreshadowing the tearing of the temple veil at the crucifixion. All attempt to “do their duty”. The servant girl identifies Peter, but he denies he knows the man. Pilate knows that it is out of jealousy that the Sanhedrin has delivered Jesus to him, and seeks to release him, but succumbs to the crowd’s demand to release Barabbas. We are told of the treatment by the soldiers in the praetorium, their mocking, the beatings, the crowning of thorns, and eventually the scourging, all as portrayed on the Shroud cloth. Simon of Cyrene is pressed into service to carry the cross during the journey to Golgotha. Even those crucified with him have nothing but taunts. “Let him come down from the cross and we will believe him.” It is the women who wait by the cross, and note where he is laid. There are so very many different characters in this narrative. A thoughtful reflection can be achieved by pondering on what character we can most identify with, or most resemble. It is a tale of gross human weaknesses, only redeemed by the eventual victory of the cross and resurrection.

Even Jerome’s Latin Vulgate used the word “lignaverunt” suggesting he may also have been presuming bandages, a mummy style burial.

There is some suggestion of burn hole patches on the dorsal half of the cloth at right. Apart from the cloth itself, the other colours, particularly those of the figures are quite vivid, and it is a certainly a beautiful art work on that account. How closely does this restored painting of the Shroud reflect the artist’s initial intentions, and how closely did the artist observe the cloth, if indeed he ever did? There were at least two separate times when Cardinal Borromeo viewed the Shroud, the first in 1578, and the second some four years later. In 1578 he had also been granted a private showing. I interpret the posting above suggests the painting was done some time after 1650, and so I would guess it is intended to be representational or symbolic, particularly with figures of the Virgin and cherubim, and hardly a real historic record of any actual event. Ian Wilson’s 2010 book, ch 18 makes some interesting observations on the Borromeo ostentations. Borromeo had made a vow during the plague in Milan of 1576, to walk a pilgrimage to Chambery to see the Shroud, announcing this in 1578 when he was aged only 40. This provided Duke Emmanuel Philibert with the excuse he needed to transfer the Shroud to his new capital at Turin, away from Chambery, a little too close to France, and an easier distance for the pilgrimage. One of Borromeo’s companions, the later cardinal Agustino Cusano, wrote up the event. His comments on the cloth’s appearance are instructive. Referring to the image, he writes, “… I say, not with the human art of a painter nor with a variety of colours, but miraculously stamped and portrayed by his own body. The whole figure is rather obscure, like a dark shadow, or like the first sketch of a painting that now you see it, now you don’t, and that arouses greater desire and diligence to see it again better; now it is seen better up close, now further back … ” A similar impression of the vagueness of the image prevails even today. Cusano wrote this less than 230 years after the first known ostentation at Lirey, and only some 44 years after the Poor Clare repairs of 1534, notwithstanding l’Abbe Bouchage’s record of a vivid detailed description of the image at that time. A painting which has flaked? I don’t think so!.","date":"2015-02-01","mins":"10:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/01/picture-for-today-2/","cat":"art","title":"Picture for Today"},{"id":"comment-192082","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh’s t i c corollary is a teaser, but I’d say with a highly questionable conclusion. I’d guess that all the representations of exhibitions would post date 1453 when Geoffray’s grand daughter Margaret de Charnay passed the Shroud onto the House of Savoy. Wilson 2010 has three such representations, and as far as the detail can be seen they seem to fit the feet apart, loin cloth pattern. Prior to 1453, known exhibitions by the De Charnay family were: ~1355 before Geoffray I killed at Poitiers; 1389 provoking Bishop D’Arcis; From 1489, annual showings on Doubs R; 1449 (Liege, Belgium); 1452 (Macon). There seem to be two fundamental styles of post 1453 representations: 1) representing actual events, cloth usually held by five bishops; 2) symbolic as above with assorted saints, sometimes cherubs or other heavenly figures. Wilson’s ones are of actual Savoy showings. The pre 1453 showings would certainly be of the true Shroud. But what to make of the apparent convention that seems to have developed during the Savoy period? Was in fact a pseudo duplicate made up for casual exhibitions? Or are the artists just blindly following an early precedent in their depictions because of the faintness of the image? But it is curious that when copies were made, they corresponded more accurately with the actual Shroud. Regardless, it does seem that routine repairs were carried out on the actual Shroud, and I’d surmise that Hugh’s comment to the contrary is no more than naughty provocation..","date":"2015-03-01","mins":"5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/01/picture-for-today-fresco-in-pinerolo/","cat":"art","title":"Picture for Today: Fresco in Pinerolo"},{"id":"comment-124896","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"While it seems unlikely that John Jackson’s hypothesis that absorbed atmospheric CO affected the C 14 dating, one wonders if the 1532 fire may have had something to do with it.

However, Is it possible that the heat of the fire and the smoke may have acted as a kind of catalyst which accelerated the absorption of carbon atoms already present in the atmosphere of 1532? There is a simple experiment to test this. All that seems necessary is to date a sample from a piece of cloth of reasonably ancient age, then subject the cloth to fire and charring in a simulation of the Chambery fire, and then to date an unaffected sample from the charred cloth.

If the lids don’t have straight edges, then they’re symmetrical about their centre line, unless they’re intended to cover a hunch back. The second thing about them is that when you remove the lid from a coffin, you see an open space inside it, intended to contain the body. Also, only in a few rare cases (none personally known to me) is a coffin lid provided with air holes so the occupant can breathe. I suppose they might be provided where the intended occupant is known to go into occasional catatonic trauma resembling death, and they would then provide some measure of safety for him. The American writer Edgar Allan Poe for instance had a morbid fear of being buried alive. The edges of the oblique rectangle in the drawing are neither straight nor symmetrical about its centre line, but have similar curved waves both sides, which may suggest a fabric of some kind. Curiously, this rectangle also has a zigzag pattern on it. This so called ‘coffin lid’ is also provided with air holes arranged in an L shape. The under lying base does have straight sides, but no containment space is shown for a body. It appears to be a stone slab with some funerary significance.

I think Max has a valid point that there is much more to the HPM drawing than the two leading contenders are prepared to concede. The idea that the Shroud might be authentic, that it actually existed before 1195, is too much of a challenge for Charles’ innate skepticism, and instead of allowing his artistic vision to perceive what might in fact be represented there, he gives the impression that his interpretation is driven from an agenda of stubborn refusal to acknowledge that the TS might even have existed at that date. On the other hand, O.K. Seems uncompromising in being prepared to concede that there may be significance in the elements present relating to the Jerusalem tomb, as propounded by Charles. He seems concerned that any such concession risks diluting his claim that the artist knew of and intended to represent elements of the Shroud. I found the gallery of David Montero intriguing and inspected the dates there carefully. The impression I was left with was that the HPM had to be one of the very earliest attempts at representing a Lamentation or burial scene. There seemed to be few there that predated the 12th century, although I’m given to understand that there are indeed a few extant. So we might presume that the artist would not feel too constrained by precedent. I continue to feel personally persuaded that the artist did know something of the Shroud and this influenced his depiction. However this was not the subject he chose to represent, The picture is I should think intended as a meditation object for his fellow monks, He had no agenda of establishing the Shroud’s existence. He wanted the focus to be on the laying out and burial of the dead Christ, and the sense of wonder of the Holy women that he was no longer there in the tomb on the Sunday morning and their puzzlement at the message of the angel. Nevertheless the elements of the Shroud are clearly present. The virtually naked Christ is as far as I can recall unprecedented. The crossed arms with only four fingers showing, the omission of the feet, and other features, have to be significant. The underlying base seems to me to be more of a stone slab than an intention to represent the casket that is shown in later depictions. I am not convinced that the oblique rectangle is intended to represent a casket lid as asserted by Ian Wilson, Charles or Hugh, even though this is clearly the intention in other depictions of similar scenes. Its edges are clearly neither straight nor symmetrical, but curved, suggesting to me more of a fabric than a box lid. The zigzag pattern on this rectangle is sufficiently indicative of the herring bone twill to at least give pause and ought not to be set aside so lightly. The array of solid crosses and the indications of holes on the stone slab may be an echo of what returning crusaders had seen in Jerusalem. Reference has been made to King Bella and his resolution to embark on a crusade. There are several reports of important western personages being admitted to view the imperial relics in Constantinople, even with coherent reports of some viewing the Shroud. Is it not conceivable that Bella himself knew of it? The slab circles may be intended to represent oculi that the crusaders had seen. But the fact that the four holes arranged in an ‘L’ shape are in the middle of what might be represented as a herring bone twill, are just a little too persuasive for me. There remain other enigmas in the picture; the suggestion of a not too well concealed head in the woman’s drapery, and the peculiar alpha like symbol, might be interpreted in various ways, as discussed. My personal conclusion is that O.K. Has made his point, that the accumulation of features is just too persuasive to deny that the artist had some knowledge of the Shroud cloth, and judging from the prostrate Christ figure, even the image that it held. That is not to say that there may well be other factors that might also have influenced him..","date":"2014-06-26","mins":"6:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-133228","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I had come to a similar conclusion as Mike M some time ago way back, but had chosen to refrain from saying so explicitly.

Other features included a bloodied, scourged, prostrate Christ with crossed hands over the groin. Despite the many similarities, thumbs are nevertheless clearly visible. However, there was clearly disagreement about the date of provenance, some asserting it as late 15th – 16th centuries, while others insisted that it was as early as 12th century, a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. I have attempted to pursue this further via the web, but the only references to this particular epitaphios all relate back to Dan’s web site only. There appear to be no other web references to it. I can’t even find it on any of the Mt Athos Stavronikita monastery web sites. There were several other comments relating to herring bone twill representations, including several from Max PH referring to the St Mark’s 7th century carving. Someone had found a reference to the Stavronikita in a university library, but the matter of dating it still remains unresolved. Even though the TS was known in the west by the 14th century, would monks or artisans at Mt Athos be likely to use this knowledge as a model for an epitaphios for use in Greek Orthodox liturgies at this time? I think not! A rational explanation for whatever model was used for it, demands that some remembered features of the Shroud cloth when it was under Greek custody influenced its design.

The drawings of the Pray Codex are a style of their own, almost in a cartoon style, simple ink drawings with only two uniform primary colours. In no sense are they in the same category as their contemporary high European art, with all their concomitant artistic styles, and reliance on precedents. The Pray drawings occur in their context of the very first attempt at producing a written text in the Hungarian language. It may be regarded as a form of primal Hungarian art. Nor do I see that O.K. Is basing his arguments on artistic features of representations of the Shroud in medieval art. That does not seem to be his assertion, but rather that he claims to see that there are direct congruences between the proto Shroud itself and features appearing in the drawings. David Mo claims to find a very reliable characteristic feature in the shape of the Shroud. Very well then! Casual inspection of the oblique rectangle in the drawing will show that it has a length to width ratio of very close to 4:1, the same proportions as the Shroud cloth, the very same object that has a zigzag pattern on it, as has the Shroud, and the very same object that has an ‘L’ arrangement of holes. A further characteristic of the Shroud is that it is of fabric, so it need not be represented as having straight sides, but can be curved, without these being symmetrical. A straight edge placed against this rectangle will show the edges are indeed curved, and without the curves being symmetrical about the centre line. A slightly earlier work, more in the classic style, is the Lamentation scene on the Klosterneuberg pulpit near Vienna which is said to predate 1181. Here the partially draped Christ, with crossed arms across the groin, is being laid to rest in what is clearly a patterned casket. In the background, is also an oblique rectangle, patterned in the same way as the casket, having straight sides, and is clearly intended to be the lid of the casket, which it would seem to be designed to fit very well. This is quite a different object. Another aspect that would seem to disqualify the Pray rectangle from being a casket lid, is the absence of a casket. There is no casket shown for this to be a lid to! What is exactly the point in portraying a lid without a casket to own it? The base rectangle conveys no impression of being intended to represent a casket, so much as a kind of slab or stone, perhaps even something like the limestone shelves seen in any of the Jerusalem tombs, by wandering crusaders. I am bemused by David Mo’s assertion that there is not a ‘L’ shape in the Codex Pray, and I do not catch whatever subtlety he is attempting. There is clearly an arrangement of circles arranged as an ‘L’ shape in the oblique rectangle, which look very much to me as an attempt to represent a similar arrangement of holes found on the Shroud unrelated to the 1532 fire. It is true that the artist for whatever reason has chosen to include arrangements of tiny circles in other locations: as dress decorations, and on the underlying slab, perhaps representing oculi, and on the waist of the angel. They might for all we can guess suggest that we ought to be looking for a more subtle arrangement of circles, such as those arranged in an ‘L’ shape! DM: “The alleged shroud in the codex Pray is not a shroud; it is the sepulchre. There are several reasons that show this.” I venture to suggest that there are several many more reasons to assert that the oblique rectangle is intended to represent the Shroud than there are to say that it is a sepulchre! However, all the great men have spoken and have expressed their skepticism all to their own satisfaction no doubt.

Even assuming authenticity it is still not known how long the image took to form. Although the process is evidently different, one might draw an analogy with Volkringer patterns of flora which can take some considerable time to appear. A miraculist believing that the image was a byproduct of the resurrection, might assert that the image very likely formed immediately, but that is not necessary even for the miraculist. It is certainly not necessary for those who prefer a naturalist explanation. A medieval artist who knew of the Shroud might assume that the image was immediately visible after the resurrection, but evidently none did. It is of course the assertion of De Wesselow, who seems to believe that the image explains the belief in the Resurrection, while other commentators believe that John’s gospel narrative of two angels, one at the foot and one at the head, is a subtle reference to the image. There is a considerable weight of documentary evidence that the burial cloths were present in Constantinople. The first specific reference would seem to be that of Constantine VII in a letter to his troops of 958 AD. ” … the sindon which God wore, and other symbols of the immaculate Passion.” cited by Scavone. Other documentary evidence is persuasive that the sindon bore a full body image. Various later Byzantine liturgical rites such as the melismos imply a close association with the burial of Christ with the eucharist rite. The earliest threnos mural and a liturgical epitaphios would seem to be that in Nerezi Serbia of 1164. From the 12th century, epitaphioi become prevalent in the Easter Friday liturgies. It requires little imagination, to guess what initiated this departure from preceding depictions and what their originating stimulus might have been. From what we know of Byzantine liturgies, much of it is not for the public gaze. These are mysteries which only the privileged may witness. The eucharist rite of course is carried out behind a reredos. Consequently we cannot expect to see depictions of the sacred burial cloths with their image in Byzantine art. We are only allowed to see an interpretation by way of the epitaphioi. It seems that in 1204, the burial cloths with their image disappeared from Constantinople, according to the report of Robert de Clari, and it is not until 1355, that the Shroud is said to appear in Lirey France. Nevertheless, despite this knowledge and although various copies were made, it still seems that it was seldom depicted as an art object in its own right, neither in the west nor in the east. But the epitaphioi continued to appear, imprinted on the Byzantine collective memory..","date":"2014-07-03","mins":"7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-135191","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Response to David Mo of Jul 3, 12:19pm: “It is irrelevant if the image was produced immediately after the resurrection or two centuries later, miraculously or made by a forger.” It was argued by yourself and Hugh F that no medieval depictions of the discovery of the empty tomb showed an image on the burial cloths, and by extension I presume therefore that you are arguing that the Shroud image did not influence such depictions. I pointed out that there was no way of knowing whether the image was present on the burial cloths or not immediately after the resurrection. There is only tenuous evidence that it may have been. It would then be presumptuous of an artist to assume that it was visible at that time, and so none apparently depicted it as such. The tenuous evidence is found in John’s gospel when “the other disciple” entered the tomb saw the cloths and so believed, and the two angels one at the foot and one at the head. However John’s gospel is unlikely to have been written earlier than about 50 years after the event, by which time the image might then have developed to be visible. There were excellent reasons including secrecy as to why the image is not otherwise explicitly mentioned in the scriptures. There are further hints and suggestions to be found in Revelations. You seem to complain that I have not specified other Byzantine documentary evidence. I prefer not to spoon feed those who feign ignorance. A comprehensive review of the documentary evidence can be found in Scavone: “Acheiropoietos Jesus Images in Constantinople: the Documentary Evidence” found at: http://www.sindonology.org/scavone acheiropoietos.pdf Scavone provides further evidence in his review of the origins of the epitaphioi: GREEK EPITAPHIOI AND OTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE SHROUD IN CONSTANTINOPLE UP TO 1204, found at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/scavone.pdf It does not seem to have been in the Byzantine mind set to be overly explicit about sacred objects, perhaps a more recent western practice. So any descriptions of the Shroud and its image are by way of general allusions only. Nevertheless, the documents and the epitaphioi clearly have a basis for their origin and appear to reflect knowledge of the Shroud. The Shroud as we know it exists as a real object, yet no one has provided a satisfactory explanation for its characteristics and properties. There is much to support the view that it is what it appears to be, the burial cloth of Christ. There is only one piece of evidence that can challenge its authenticity, and that is the most unsatisfactory unrepresentative carbon dating, which is seriously questioned, but which is now only tenaciously clung to by the most rabid of non authenticists. I am happy to debate the pros and cons of the authenticity of the Shroud, and its various enigmatic properties with those prepared to discuss it with an open mind. However I see it as a rather fruitless and pointless task of continuously arguing minor details with those whose mind is made up and not prepared even to consider the possibility of authenticity no matter what arguments might be presented.

Prohibitions; Cult only developed in 6th & 7th centuries, following a) Edict of Milan 4th century enabling acceptance of Christianity; b) consequential emergence of Mandylion, Edessa 6th century. Icon worshippers were persecuted 726 – 786; Council of Nicea 787 condemned iconoclasm; But Second iconoclast period 814 – 842; Icon veneration restored 843. So even if Shroud image was in fact known, and represented in art, survival of any such art works might well be unlikely. Nevertheless there are hints that it was known to a few, epitaph of Bishop Avercius Marcellus d.~200 AD; Bardesanic Hymn of Pearl 2nd century; various comments alluding to chest wound. More likely it was not generally known because it was concealed as something else, and it seems significant that references to the burial cloth only emerge in Constantinople, following the arrival of the mandylion there, and Constantine VII’s letter of 958 AD. Until the time of the Crusades, the burial cloths along with other relics were generally kept hidden in the emperor’s collection. Even so there are references to sightings of it by various western visitors. The Shroud itself as such might not be considered an attractive or appealing subject as an art work, but it is represented in the highly decorated epitaphioi, and is there given a religious significance, important to the Byzantines, rather than just its cold realism more attuned to a later age. The two sides of the debate seem to approach the Shroud from two entirely different perspectives. For the non authenticist, there is the appeal of the enigmatic, the inexplicable, a subject of curiosity, which may be discussed purely as an intellectual exercise with absolutely no commitment. However for the authenticist, there has to be a reason why the Shroud has been given to humanity to contemplate. It is the predecessor of all iconography, it is a divine gift, to be treated with reverence, and has the potential to affirm faith, and to evangelize. We may gaze in awe at the pyramids, and the handiwork of earlier ages. But for the authenticist, the Shroud is so much more, and creates commitment. That is the distinction between the two approaches as I see it, and what creates the difficulties in attempting dialogue between the two sides.

The verse Matt 28:1 is often cited, suggesting the artists’ intentions of representing that scene. Mark’s gospel also refers to the visit of the three women, but Matthew deliberately gives the story a different twist (contrasts rebuff of Jews with the commission to teach the gentiles). If it’s Matthew 28, then there’s an earthquake, which would dislodge the stone, and so Matthew brings in the angel indicating that the earthquake is providential, and who brings the message of Christ’s resurrection to the women. Matthew 28 has the angel sitting on the stone. In few if any of the sample illustrations is the angel actually sitting on the stone. He is often either sitting or standing on a skewed rectangle, which often looks more like a Persian magic carpet, than a sarcophagus lid. This skewed rectangle seems a persistent feature whether or not the sarcophagus is shown or not. Sometimes the rectangle has a thickness suggesting a casket lid, sometimes it does not. In some cases it almost seem suspended in the air suggesting the carpet analogy. Why does the skewed rectangle persist, whether or not the sarcophagus is shown or not? It seems peculiar that this one feature endures regardless and independently of the sarcophagus. In the HPM, 12th century (1192 95) the angel is not sitting on the rectangle but seems to be sitting on a type of rock shelf, again not necessarily the rolled away entrance stone, and the skewed rectangle seems more part of the foreground. I think it unfortunate that the debate seemed to reflect too much the personal agenda of the participants. Thus all non authenticists have insisted that the HPM shows no connection with the TS, while all authenticists have insisted that it does. Clearly both sides have allowed their personal attitudes to authenticity to interpret the HPM. This is not the way to arrive at the truth of the matter. I consider that several of the illustrations from the 11th century are not all persuasive of the rectangle being interpreted as a casket lid. In fact I am wondering if there’s more of a hint in the theory that the stories about angels in the various resurrection stories, might refer to the images on the Shroud, allowing that all of the gospels were written some decades after the events they purport to recount.

We are not in the 1001 nights.” Matt 28:2 has the angel sitting on the rock, that sealed the tomb, and which the earthquake has rolled aside. [I’ve previously mentioned any number of instances where even moderate earthquakes in NZ and elsewhere will fling rocks from cliff faces and other outcrops several metres; I think this explains what moved the rock well enough.] I would have assumed that the artists portraying the scene of the women’s visit, would have done their homework and ought to have known that the angel was found sitting on the rock. But they show him as sitting or standing on this rectangular object. The gospel records that the tomb was sealed by a rock and there is no mention of a door. Why should the angel be sitting on the door of the tomb, the door is not in the gospel and it’s not scriptural! I agree that in some of the depictions this rectangle is shown clearly enough as the lid of the casket, and usually in those cases the casket or sarcophagus is also clearly present. However in other cases where there is no sign of a casket or sarcophagus, the rectangle is often ambiguous, and there is no evident thickness indicating the solidity of a lid. In a few cases this rectangle seems to be floating in the air with the angel perched atop it. That is the only reason why I said it looked more like a flying carpet, the closest resemblance I could think of. I am guessing that you would probably say that it is not meant to be the burial cloth, But I don’t know that we can be so certain. The images on the TS have sometimes been used to explain the appearance of the angel(s) and I think it’s possible that the ideas may be connected. Now on the HPM, note the position of the angel’s foot. It indicates he is seated (the foot is placed well in front of him), and three lines are sketched at the extreme left of the picture, which suggest to me the bench or shelf on which he is sitting. Furthermore, the oblique rectangle is set in front of the angel and in front of the women, and appears to be resting on the slab underneath, and it is placed in the bottom one third of the lower picture.

Those that are of interest for purposes of the argument must predate 1195. Maybe there were 40 or so, but I haven’t bothered to count them. Q1: How many showed four holes arranged in an ‘L’ shape on the rectangular object? A1: None. Q2: How many showed a zigzag pattern on the rectangle? A2: None. Q3: How many showed red coloured randomly placed streaks on the rectangle that might be interpreted as representing blood stains? A3: None. Q4: How many include a naked prostrate Christ with crossed wrists across the groin? A4: None. Objection – This relates to a Lamentation or Threnos scene not a Three Marys scene; You need to refer to pre 1195 Threnos scenes. But there are very few such Threnos scenes predating 1195. Development: In what ways does the HPM illustration relate to other depictions of Three Marys? There are three women present, with nimbi around their heads suggesting sanctity, one holding a vial presumably of spices, an angel is pointing to a vacant slab and seems to be giving them a message, there is a patterned oblique rectangle, all of which are consistent with earlier depictions of Three Marys. In what ways does the HPM illustration not relate to other depictions? The draftsmanship is relatively crude, essentially an ink drawing with only limited use of two colours, primary red and blue without subtle hues or texture. It is almost a cartoon style. The illustration also includes a Threnos scene, not usually associated with Three Marys. It also includes the features Q1 to Q4. Assessment: Does the HPM have sufficient in common with other depictions for it to be related to them? Yes, particularly with the presence of the oblique rectangle. What is unique about the HPM illustration? Its crude draftsmanship, inclusion of a Threnos scene and the features Q1 to Q4. What is significant about features Q1 to Q4? They can all be related to the Turin Shroud. Where else do these features occur? Q2, Q3, Q4 frequently occur on epitaphioi from the 12th century onwards. Many of these show a connection and knowledge of the Turin Shroud. Q1 seldom appears before modern times. Conclusion: Does the HPM illustration show a sufficient connection with the knowledge of features of the Turin Shroud?

There are several fallacies and even contradictions in his comments. They are a distraction and to be discussed adequately need a new thread. Most of them merely reflect his own subjective viewpoint. 1) The Lirey badge is a western representation of the Shroud. Byzantines didn’t do that sort of thing. Scavone provides comprehensive Byzantine documentation on the burial cloths, and also covering the question of difficulties of interpretation of these various documents. The Byzantine response as reported by various western visitors was clearly one of veneration. The Byzantine artistic response to discovery of the Shroud image was to design epitaphioi for use in their Easter liturgies, an appropriate religious response. 2) Charles asserts that there are no signs of distinctive features of the Shroud. That is his viewpoint but it has not been conceded by the authenticist camp. 3) His interpretation of the western history of the Shroud is garbled by his own predispositions against it. It draws on the fable of a non existent memorandum said to have been sent by Bishop Pierre D’Arcis to Avignon anti pope Clement VII from a story concocted by Jesuit Herbert Thurston and by Ulysse Chevalier, and is now discredited. Clement VII ordered D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under threat of excommunication. Ref: “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD”; By Jack Markwardt; 2001 Examines Chevalier & Thurston’s attempt to misrepresent D’Arcis memorandum. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf 4) First western showings of Shroud at Lirey 1356, badge with De Charnay (dexter) and De Vergy (sinister) arms; 1356, 28 May Bishop Henri (Troyes) praises Geoffrey I for founding of Lirey church with canons; 19 Sep Geoffrey I killed at Poitiers; 1389, Geoffrey II displays cloth as “True Shroud of Jesus”, prompts D’Arcis complaints, royal officers seek seizure of Shroud but are foiled; 1398 Geoffrey II dies, Shroud passes to Margaret De Charnay; despite two marriages remains childless; From 1418 annual displays on Doubs River; 1443 47 Lirey canons seek return of Shroud but unsuccessful; 1449 Margaret De Charnay displays Shroud at Liege Belgium, 1452 at Macon; 1453, still childless she only then decides to pass it on to House of Savoy, receives castle and estate from Duke Louis; 1457 Margaret threatened with excommunication if she does not return Shroud to Lirey canons, Duke Louis negotiates compensation; 1460 Margaret De Charnay dies. In 1464, Francesco della Rovere (later Pope Sixtus IV) writes book, refers to Shroud kept by Savoy, ‘coloured with the blood of Christ’. ); 1506 – Pope Julius II assigns Shroud own feast day of 4 May, many subsequent public showings on this day. 5) Relics do not require an associated miracle to be declared authentic. They merely require adequate certification of provenance associated with a holy person or place, such as part of a saint’s body or clothing. Certified miracles have sometimes been associated with specific relics. In the case of the Shroud, it is venerated as an icon, which may well be an authentic relic if it was ever adequately corroborated as the burial cloth of Christ, or if Science is ever able to confirm that the image was not made by human hands, which remains a particularly difficult scientific challenge. Hence the present prudent caution. Church evidently sees authenticity as a matter of science and other scholarship. The Shroud is not regarded as part of the “Deposit of Faith essential to salvation”; The Church may at some future date make a declaration on the Shroud when more is known, but such a statement would not be binding on members of the Catholic Church as an article of essential belief..","date":"2014-07-07","mins":"7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-192328","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"We have often been here before. The conflict of the “debate(?)” above illustrates how unproductive dogmatic statements concerning the Shroud can become, and from whatever side adduces them. I personally consider that the Pray illustration is highly suggestive of Shroud influences, and may well be indicative of its earlier presence and sighting in Constantinople by King Bela III of Hungary. As a past master of probability theory, most of which I’ve now forgotten, I consider it an error to arbitrarily designate numerical probabilities to events however rare they might be. Quantitatively, I consider the probabilities meaningless. But I consider them qualitatively highly significant. Bela’s older brother Stephen III succeeded to the Hungarian kingship in 1162, upon which Bela moved to Constantinople in 1163, was given the name Alexios by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and was betrothed to the emperor’s daughter Maria, and was designated heir in 1165. As such he would have had access to the imperial relic collection. Assuming that the Shroud was part of that collection he would doubtless have seen it. The betrothal to Maria was dissolved in 1169 upon the birth of her brother, and Bela was deprived of his titles being demoted to kaiser only. In 1172, Stephen III died, and Bela returned to Hungary and was crowned king there in 1173, surviving until 1196. There are a number of art works preceding the Hungarian Pray codex, depicting the visit of the Holy Women. They all follow a surprisingly similar pattern. The skewed rectangle is inevitably recognised as a casket lid. However the Pray Codex illustration almost seems to be the first that includes a prostate naked Christ with arms crossed over his groin, and only four fingers visible on each hand. Whence did the concept of this representation come? Given Bela’s presumed familiarity with the imperial relic collection, it requires little to make a judgment that it was very likely the Shroud image which he had seen in Constantinople. It is unlikely that he himself was the artist, more likely some monk who may have been advised by Bela. The drawing itself is somewhat crude in its execution. The sides of the rectangle are not straight as one would expect a tomb lid to be, nor are they symmetrical about their centre line, a poor piece of carpentry indeed. Conceivably they may represent the cloth of the Shroud, but it cannot be so stated dogmatically. The zigzag pattern may be a representation of the herring bone twill of the Shroud. The small cloth resting upon it, might wrap a head, but certainly not a whole body. It would be the only tomb lid ever drawn with four poker holes drilled in it in the shape of an L. The Pray Codex drawing is persuasive of it including Shroud like features. It is certainly not conclusive, but it cannot be so lightly dismissed as not significant.

His style seems to be more about dropping hints and leaving clues. “My ways are not your ways” comes to mind. Hence my comments attacking dogmatism whether by fellow religionists concerning Pray Codex illustrations or by skeptics who place their faith in uncritical pseudo scientism. We do not have an 8th century altar cloth that mimics the Shroud image, but there are early references implying the significance of the burial cloths and what they might have been or appeared to be. Again, it is hints and clues, and that’s all apparently we mortals are entitled to know. AD 325 Pope Sylvester I: “Celebrate Mass, clean linen altar cloth consecrated by bishop, as if clean Shroud of Christ”; Theodore of Mopsuestia late 4th c: “Deacons who spread linens on the altar, represent figure of the linen cloth at the burial.” St Nino of Georgia 4th c: “they did not find sudarium, but said to have been found by Peter who took and kept it; don’t know if it’s been discovered”; Mozarabic rite 6th c: “Peter ran with John to the tomb and saw the recent imprints (vestigia) of the dead and risen man on the linens.“ St Jerome – “Gospel of Hebrews” 2nd c: ‘Jesus gave sindon to servant of priest’; St Nino (above): Pilate’s wife had burial linen for a while, then passed it to St Luke, who put in a place known only to himself; The 6th century Mozarabic rite in particular is an interesting one. This liturgy is “intimately associated with and possibly even partly rewritten” by Leandro, the Bishop of Seville, who, while serving in Constantinople from 579 to 582, would likely have learned that the emperor was in possession of a burial cloth which bore the imprints of Jesus’ dead body. The references indicate that the burial cloths and their likely survival were considered significant from a very early stage in the history of Christianity. There are also many other independent references. The hints and clues seen on the Pray Codex illustration is only one other such.

There are in my opinion too many highly suggestive links for a Shroud influence to be rejected outright, at least as a credible possibility. But as I’ve indicated above I don’t see that such an influence can be asserted dogmatically. Nor do I believe can it be rejected. There are strong arguments for the Shroud being part of the Imperial Relic collection. If so, it is certain that Bela III, as imperial heir designate pro tem would have seen it at some time between 1165 and 1169, and it would have left him with an enduring impression. In 1172 he returned to Hungary and assumed the kingship. Some 20 years later, the Codex emerged. Any links with what Bela had seen may have been assisted with crude sketches from what was now a distant memory, so that exactitude could hardly be expected. The visitation of the Three Marys to the empty tomb follows a long tradition of known art works in the West, where a tomb lid was commonly shown as an oblique rectangle. The depiction of the preparation for burial as shown does not follow such an established tradition. It may well be the first western depiction of a prostrate naked Christ in the manner shown. It certainly shows some remarkable correspondences with the Shroud image. I think this is sufficient to admit the likelihood of other recognisable Shroud like features in a modified version of what had become a standardised Visitation illustration. OK has proposed that the rectangle is now to be seen as the Shroud resting on the tomb, the oblique angle being a crude attempt to represent a type of perspective. Perspective in art was known to a few of the ancient Greeks, but its knowledge had been lost. This knowledge was rediscovered by the Florentine Brunelleschi (1377 1446) and later codified in Genoa by Alberti (1404 1472). So that attempts at depicting depth in any art form as early as the end of the 12th century still remained crude. Therefore OK’s proposition may be thought credible. Your presumption that the herring bone weave is asserted as being represented by concentric circles is I think a distortion. What I believe has been asserted is that the weave is represented by the zigzag pattern. The five small circles arranged as an L echo the Shroud poker holes whose known origin is lost to history. Nor do I see the angel as standing or sitting on the “tomb lid”. The gospel accounts merely say with some variance that the women saw the angel(s) where Jesus had lain, and that is represented in the picture. I think there are sufficient indications to admit the possibility of a link with the Shroud. It is my personal belief that they do. But as previously stated I can agree that it cannot be asserted dogmatically as such. But nor do I believe can it be rejected. Can any further argument advance the debate? I believe not, and perhaps that is where it should rest..","date":"2015-03-06","mins":"6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-192647","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I see no concentric circles whatsoever on the illustration.

Matthew, despite his reliance on Mark, only has two women, but also has one angel. Luke is indefinite about the number of women, but has two angels, one at the head and one at the feet, and which de Wesselow wants to interpret as the Shroud image. John only has Mary of Magdala who arrives before dawn, but then summons two apostles Peter and another, probably John. Problem is that none of the synoptics mentions the burial cloths, only John, who has the linen cloths lying on the ground and the head cloth rolled up separately. Nevertheless, despite Mark’s silence on cloths, the angel in the illustration is definitely pointing towards some cloths. So it might be an amalgam of both Mark and John, or just a free interpretation of scripture. Note that the top edge of the oblique rectangle is still visible underneath these cloths, so that they look more like bandages than a full shroud, although the underlying zigzag pattern does not appear here. Also, for some reason, possibly a slip up by the artist or not, the top edge of this rectangle is out of line with its left most extension. Might we construe that a fold is implied. Just to the left of the bandages the area is marked by + marks, and then the zigzag pattern is resumed but reversed. Also note that along the rectangle, the zigzag pattern is reversed at least twice. The area marked by + marks would seem to indicate more cloth. If the ‘imageshack’ original is checked (see O.K. Comment 5.22pm) then the underlying slab is fully visible. Its bottom edge is quite straight as can be checked with a ruler. The oblique rectangle does not pass this test, both long edges clearly have a wave, and as I’ve noted, the top edge is discontinuous. It may indicate a certain cloth with a reversing zigzag pattern. There are several patterns of small circles on the lower drawing only: a) on the underlying slab; b) on the angel’s belt and on his wings c) on the centre woman’s collar; d) and of course those arranged as an L shape on the oblique rectangle. Nearly all of the hands show a thumb. It is only on the Christ figure where both thumbs are not visible. I find O.K’s calculation of probabilities far too arbitrary, and it’s not Bayesian statistics. It is in the accumulation of shroud like features that must persuade that the artist knows something of the Shroud. Any suggestion of Egyptian pyramids is utterly out of context of the Codex Pray, essentially an orthodox christian psalter and pyramids are irrelevant. Regardless of agreement on this detail or that, the evidence mounts up that as early as 1195, even some unknown Hungarian monk knew something of the Shroud and the features unique to it. The Shroud is not the subject of his picture, and it would be a distraction to figure it in what is after all a simple representation of his subject, a Lamentation at the Christ laid out in death, and the wonder of the Holy women at his implied resurrection. He was not setting out to convince any 21st century skeptic of the authenticity of a relic, but to provide a simple meditation icon for his contemporary monks. Nevertheless he was able to draw on certain resources that he and his brethren evidently knew about, which was enough to provide robust discussion some 800 years after he had inscribed it..","date":"2014-06-21","mins":"10:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-132238","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A further feature that I’ve just this minute noticed and I don’t recall any previous comment about it.

I noted that only a very few of the depictions, if I interpret the titles correctly, seemed not to come from Western Europe, that is France, Spain, Germany, Italy. I was particularly searching for examples from Eastern Europe, of which there seemed very few indeed. I noted a singular Turkish example, but it was quite elemental, almost crude and conveyed little. I would have liked to have seen a few examples from about the Balkans, a little closer to Hungary. One striking example was from Bohemia. It did include an empty sarcophagus, with just a few cloths inside, and it did show an oblique rectangle rising from inside the sarcophagus, and having the suggestion of a pattern. If it was intended to represent a casket lid, then I doubt it would have covered the space. It might even conceivably represent a large sheet such as a shroud. Is not an empty sarcophagus, more of a Western Europe tradition, reflecting that culture of burial. Certainly the gospels do not mention a sarcophagus nor any type of casket. It is essentially an artistic invention reflecting a local burial practice. I doubt that sarcophagi are represented in any examples of Byzantine Christian art of the burial, although I might be corrected on this. The Pray Codex illustration of the Three Marys does not illustrate an empty sarcophagus, in any way like the various Western Europe examples. It appears to be more of a stone slab, which is likely a lot closer to the truth of the actual burial. It was doubtless influenced by Bela III sojourn in Constantinople, which then had no tradition of representing sarcophagi in burial or resurrection art. If then there is no sarcophagus represented, then there can be no lid to it, and the oblique rectangle in the Pray Codex Three Marys illustration, may well represent something entirely different!.","date":"2015-03-11","mins":"6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-132255","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin, thanks for the flash back, I now recall doing some mini research on medieval fonts relating to the ‘a’ like symbol.

I find them intriguing. I must admit that I prefer them to what seemed to be a somewhat hostile, and to me somewhat inconsistent approach of the article that gave rise to this discussion. I feel that Wilson was persuaded as to the authenticity of the Shroud by much of the forensic work that had been carried out on it during the 20th century. He saw a yawning gap in its history prior to 1350 that needed to be accounted for, if ever the Shroud was to be taken more seriously. I feel that with the very best of intentions he directed what efforts he was able to bring to that problem in constructing what seemed to him and to others a credible history. His results are certainly arguable by those who claim to know a great deal more about art history, such as yourself, than they are willing to credit Wilson with. The history of academia in whatever field is replete with examples of faulty received wisdom, that persisted for a time, but later had to be discarded and rewritten. I doubt that anyone can be dogmatic about the history of the Shroud, and perhaps one day we shall see more clearly than we can at present. Meantime a more open minded approach could be more fruitful in bringing that about. Now to some of the points you have made above. I was amazed that you were able to find in Belting a reference to a cloth with an earlier image ‘apparently venerated in Byzantium as Christ’s burial cloth’. You say that Belting considers that the Shroud was a medieval copy of that cloth. From what we now know of the Shroud, that won’t wash at all. We know from its various properties that it was quite beyond the powers of any medieval forger to produce what we now have. I don’t intend to dwell on those aspects here, as they are available to all who wish to pursue the topic with an open mind. But caution is of course required, as there are claims which even pro authenticists would hesitate to accept, but others that seem conclusive. Here are a few historic references, which you may or may not be well aware of concerning the cloth(s) held in Constantinople (Byzantium): (a) Guscin’s translation of 12th C.Latin manuscript Tarrogonensis 55: said to be originally written by a pilgrim who spent a long time in Constantinople in 1090. The pilgrim refers to a linen cloth with the face of the Lord Jesus made by direct contact, held with greater reverence than other relics in the emperor’s palace, kept locked away in a golden case Only the emperor is permitted to see it. The case used to be open once, but the city was hit by great earthquakes. As a result of a heavenly vision, the relic was hidden away from human eyes and kept locked up, and the earthquakes stopped. Now it seems that Constantinople is not at all prone to such earthquakes, but we know that Edessa was. So it seems very likely that this is the Image of Edessa, but no one gets to see it around this time, except the emperor. (b) Around 1130, high ranking western visitors are shown the emperor’s collection of relics. Normandy based monk Orderic Vitalis reports that the Jesus imprinted Edessa cloth, besides Jesus’ facial imprint displays ‘the form and size of the Lord’s body to all who look upon it’, [Ord Vit, Historia Ecclesia, Pt II, Book IX, 8]. This might seem to be a second hand report, but it seems that Gervase of Tilbury makes a similar observation [Gerv of Til, Otia Imperiala III]. (c) Dobschutz Christusbilder Beilage III, p. 134: Refers to Latin Abgar Legend,.where Christ spreads out his whole body on a linen cloth, … majestic form of his whole body … divinely transferred … kept in Syria Mesopotamia at the city of Edessa in a great cathedral. I wonder about these references, and whether after all there may very well be more to some of the assertions made by Wilson, than others seem prepared to acknowledge. It does seem that some time around 1130 at any rate, there came to be recognised in Constantinople, the realisation that they had come to be in possession of Christ’s burial cloths. Why Belting seems unable to acknowledge that this is the present Shroud held in Turin, I would not know. Unless he is relying on the 100 year old Chevalier & Thurston version of the D’Arcis memorandum now shown to be a deliberate fraud. Or perhaps it is the missing years between 1204 and 1350 that trouble him. Perhaps what matters now, is what the hard sciences can make of the Shroud, and what might be made of it in religious terms. But it is a pity that Official Historians cannot seem to match a similar challenge as to its provenance. Hence the so called amateurs and enthusiasts can be expected to continue their efforts in coming to their own conclusions, as best they can..","date":"2012-09-08","mins":"6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"id":"comment-16069","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think Charles may have misunderstood my intention of the quotes at #17. I concur that (a) Tarrogonensis 55 clearly refers to the Image of Edessa, but that few seemed to have examined it closely to determine its true nature. However (b) and (c) suggest to me that by 1130 there had come a growing realisation among the Byzantines that somehow they had come in possession of the burial cloths Wilson of course identifies this with the Image of Edessa, but I’m not pursung that issue in this comment. There remains the question of how the burial cloths had come to be in Constantinople but were only recognised as such at that late date. Barbet mentions a late 12th century comment by Nicocephorus Callistus that in the year 436 the Empress Pulcheria deposited the linen cloths in the Blachernae church, which is intriguing in view of Robert de Clari’s comment, but Nicocephorus being such a late commentator, this might probably be discounted. I am happy that Charles seems to have clarified his approach to relics in his first para at #18, by saying that most of these were not genune, as in his paper that stirred up Stephen Jones, he seems to damn them all. He now seems to be prepared to concede that at least some may in fact have been genuine. One explanation of why there may be little reference to relics in the early Church, was of course that during its persection under the Roman Empire, they were not going to give any secrets away and risk losing what they treasured. Constantine & Helena very likely saw political advantage in emphasising a cult of relics as it provided a tangible means of connecting their dynasty with Christian origins. As an aside, I would also mention the long standing practice, still current, of consecrating altars with an altar stone containing alleged relics of saints. The tradition is said to date from the early Roman era practice of celebrating eucharistic worship on the bones of the martyrs in the catacombs. There are a number of indirect 4th century references to the Shroud or burial cloths: In AD 325, Pope Sylvester established – “that Mass be celebrated on an altar covered with a cloth of linen consecrated by the Bishop, as if it were the clean Shroud of Christ.” Theodore of Mopsuestia (350 428) describes the role of deacons: “When they bring up (the oblation at the offertory) they place it on the altar for the completed representation of the passion so that we may think of Him on the altar as if He were placed in the sepulchre after having received the passion … the deacons who spread the linens on the altar represent the figure of the linen cloths at the burial….” Saint Nino of Georgia (4th C): “Now they did not find the sudurium, but it is said to have been found by Peter, who took it and kept it, but we know not if it has ever been discovered.” Ishodad of Merv writes:” …the (sudura= sudarium) … remained with him [Peter] … head. And whenever he made an ordination, he arranged it on his *head … just as even … bishops of the Church arrange the turbans that are on their heads… in place of that sudarium” [Shroud is obviously too large – it may refer to the head cloth] The 6th C Mozarabic rite reveals that: “Peter ran with John to the tomb and saw the recent imprints of the dead and risen man on the linens.” I can provide the citations for these if Charles wishes to pursue them further. I think that it is evident that there was rather more interest in the burial cloths in the early church than many seem to have been prepared to concede..","date":"2012-09-09","mins":"5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"id":"comment-16116","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks for the comments and references, Ron.

However there are phenomena (art works) and the interpretation of those phenomena is a separate issue, Being human, we all have to live with the consequences of our mistakes in any such interpretations. It is interesting that Belting makes the point that many such images were made in the sixth century. Various features are frequently repeated, slavishly, even when they seem to make little artistic sense. It is a no brainer that there must have been an original template which became standard. And then others more geographically remote would use copies of the standard template (We are.not talking modern photography here). What was the template commonly used? Was it the “Christ Pantocrator”, the “Image of Eddessa”, the “Mandylion” or something else? From the Byzantine chronicle, to the extent it might be believed, we can infer that there were at least three such claiming to be the original, the Orthodox, the Monophysite, and the Nestorian. Very likely there were others. Perhaps one such copy became the “Veronica” or the “Holy Face of Manopello”. Not only the multiplicity of images, but also different names for what may have been the same object, contribute to our modern confusion. It is significant that the various copies made all radiate out from Edessa, as Belting asserts, all claiming to be copies or likenesses of the “Image of Edessa”, possibly subsequently modified by local artistic conventions. Let us now turn to the Turin Shroud. I do not accept the following circular reasoning, which seems to be frequently promoted. “Byzantine art was loth to represent a dead Christ and blood stains. Icons show a live and triumphant Christ without blood stains. The modern negative photo we have of the image of the Shroud show a very dead Christ with blood stains. Therefore notwithstanding any common features between the Shroud image and the icons, the image on the Shroud could not have been used as the original template.” We are aware that Paul Vignon identified some 15 oddities frequently appearing in Byzantine portraits of Christ, even when they seemed to make little artistic sense, and even when they dated from the 6th century as Belting asserts. Some little time back Davor Aslanovski posted on his website a crude parody of the Vignon observations which utterly fails to do them any justice. All of the 15 Vignon features appear on the Turin Shroud. So we are left with two possibilities. Either a medieval forger anticipated Vignon and included the various features he had discovered from icons onto his work. Or else the Shroud itself was the 6th century source for the original template. Some of the Vignon markings only make sense in terms of folds or creases in the cloth. How credible is it that a 6th century Edessan forger could make such an artifact with all the properties that only our modern era has discovered? And remember, Belting himself has said that the icons emanated from Edessa!.","date":"2012-09-06","mins":"8:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"id":"comment-15982","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"1 Laying aside Davor’s unfortunate customary superciliousness, I did persist with reading through the paper he mentions. He himself admits to it trying the reader’s patience, but never mind. I can understand reasons why Dan may have chosen not to post it here, which I dare say had less to do with the omission of the Gates of the Cherubim, cryptology, or fancy pictures, than the fact that it deals with a particular abstract specialised issue in the theory of art and art interpretation. The main message I took from it is that artistic works may have a life of their own in that each era will interpret them in accordance with its own prevailing culture, whether that is theological patristic, medieval miraculous, or whatever the prevailing modern culture might be. The original intent of the artist is apparently less significant than what we might imagine(???) I was somewhat reminded of the paradox “What sound does a tree make when it falls in a forest with no one present to hear it?” This is by no means intended to discourage him in pursuing the topic further, which might very well have some value in extending our understanding or meaning of art forms. 2) My point in raising this issue was that I found it strained my credulity that the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople was greeted with such fanfare, yet the arrival of the burial cloths there, as a separate relic did not even raise a whisper. All we have are hints and clues of its presence. Some would maintain of course that the burial cloths were never in Constantinople, but that I fear only strains my credulity even more so. It would seem that the arrival of the burial cloths was by some means concealed, unknown or only gradually came to light, 3) I concur with Davor’s basic thesis that corroboration is required before arriving at academic conclusions, that might otherwise be too hasty. However I can assure him that even in a NZ University, rather more is required for a major in Religious Studies than the reading of an excellent single work by some popular author. The syllabus is extensive ranging from Ancient Religions to the modern Universal, Primal (polynesian, micronesian etc), critical issues of modern concern, phenomenology, oriental and all the rest. I am not entirely ignorant of such matters. 4) It is clear that Davor can only have glanced through this section and has misinterpreted it.

Frei’s work is disputed, although Israeli botanists since have also made comparable claims. The arogonite limestone analysis by Nitowski et al remains unproven and has not been peer reviewed and there are gaps. The detailed forensic work by Barbet, Willis and others remains so far the best argument for authentictity, but even here, there is disagreement among the experts. Whatever process was involved resulting in an apparent negative with 3 D information is mysterious, yet may have been produced by some as yet unknown natural process. The appearance of Shroud like faces in icongraphy dating from the 6th century is barely persuasive by itself. Fanti’s work in dating the cloth through its physical properties is interesting, but is novel and yet to be accepted by the scientific community. The evidence of the blood stains is also persuasive, but were they shed by the victim of a crucifixion, or were they added after the making of the image? Despite the work of Rogers and others, no one has yet discovered a means by which an image with the same properties might be formed in a convincing way. There have been critics through the ages, from Bishop D’Arcis, Herbert Thurston, and more latterly the C 14 scientists. Although circumstantial, taken together, the weight of the evidence persuades many, including myself, that the Shroud is indeed the burial cloth of Christ. But that does not make it a rigorous proof, and I believe it can be only accepted by an act of faith based on this circumstantial evidence. There remains the question of provenance which remains an important missing link. This was recognised by Maurus Green, and as it happens also by Ian Wilson. Wilson attempted to fill that important gap, and more recent scholars have attempted to improve on it. But still, the “experts” reject these claims as unprofessional and suspect. The question of provenance is therefore important, and cannot be brushed aside as a “side show”. However until such time as the scientists can improve their game, by a more rigorous approach to their investigations, it is unlikely to be taken seriously by the majority of historians. But that of course does not mean to say that the Shroud is not indeed what it appears to be!.","date":"2013-09-04","mins":"4:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"id":"comment-42955","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"You are entitled to your opinion.

I have been a specialist myself during my working life, and I have also been a generalist. So I think I know and understand the strengths and weaknesses of both callings. Without wishing to bore you with personal details, my first specialty was in the design and construction of certain major civil engineering structures, subject to heavy dynamic loads, significant seismic effects and prone to foundation scour, of a kind unique to NZ. I spent some 13 years in this specialty. I have been in other specialties, such as the design of certain auditing and sampling systems. Some of my generalist work involved investment risk assessments across a full breadth of engineering projects, civil, structural, architectural, mechanical, electric traction, communications and information technology, and other such trivia including the management of major capital investment programmes. I feel I had a most satisfying and fascinating engineering career. Now to the point! The strength of the specialist is that a narrow focus can be brought to bear on highly technical matters, in a way that cannot be done by a generalist. Conversely the weakness of the specialist is that he is not fit for much else, without a major retraining programme. His particular specialty is the entire world for the committed specialist, his particular strength is also his weakness. He becomes too narrowly focussed, and he is prone to obsess about it. Thus in the case of the specialist in Byzantine history for instance, he will generally be entirely ignorant about matters scientific. The world of blood stains, blood types, recognition of pollen grains, textile weaves, carbon dating, imaging processes, chemistry, finer points of geometry are a closed book to him. While others might manage at least a superficial grasp of the significance of such matters, the Byzantine historian specialist will not have time for any of this. And what is true for one kind of specialist, is also true for other specialists, Your specialist in chemistry for instance may be found wanting in the matter of Byzantine history, general forensics, an inability to see the logical connections among evidential sources and be unable to draw a logical synthesised conclusion. Certainly your chemist will, most of the time, be able to provide you with sound advice and factual conclusions providing that he stays within the limits of his discipline. I mentioned the susceptibility to obsession of the specialist. Thus what he accuses in others he will fail to see in himself. Just read Davor’s primary posting above. He accuses those involved in discussing the Shroud with various kinds of bad faith. Does he deal with the various arguments brought to bear on the subject? No! He likens them to pornophiles! He accuses them of Ad hominem arguments, which may be fair comment for some of what appears here from time to time. But then he himsef brings contempt to bear on various named bloggers. I say “Physician, Heal thyself!” Davor sees sindonology as some kind of heresy. The truth of the matter is that the great majority of sympathetic bloggers on this site consider this relic important, because for various reasons they believe it may well be the burial cloth of their Lord and Saviour. As such it is potentially the most important relic in all of Christendom. However its authenticity is by no means so clear to others. There is such a thing as constructive conflict in coming to the truth of such matters which hopefully might be fruitful within our own lifetimes if we are lucky. Such conflict should be confined to the weight of argument, and not to persons. However bad faith can at times be only too apparent, and can be a challenge even to Christian patience. When the formerly agnostic Yves Delage, Sorbonne’s professor of comparative anatomy, presented his objective findings on the Shroud before the French Academy of Science, he encountered downright hostility, purely it would seem on the basis of the subject matter. The Academy was dominated by so called rationalists and free thinkers, anti religious to a man, a survival perhaps of the “French Enlightenment”. There remains a a distrust of Academia among those devoted to what they consider to be this most precious relic, a distrust which Academia itself has done little to dissipate, including I must say, what I have so far read from Byzantine historians. The great British chronicler of the Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill was once reported to have said, “History is Bunk!” I sometimes wonder if he was right!.","date":"2012-09-04","mins":"7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?"},{"id":"comment-15927","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Consider these words of the distinguished German art scholar, Hans Belting: “Art historians dislike the Shroud, as the latter is either an orignal (thus antedating Christian imagery), or it is a late medieval fake (thus postdating the history of intelligent and beautiful images)” : Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image before the Era of Art 1998, p.9. So we know that the Byzantine Art historians, are uncomfortable with it. From the various contributions they have made recently, it would seem that they are quite prepared even to deny that such a cloth was ever in Constantinople. Not for them the evidence of Robert de Clari, the Hungarian Pray Manuscript, the complaint of the Patriarch to the Pope that the French Crusaders had made off with it, nor any other such clues. That is their affair, and it may very well come back to haunt them. Now for those who deem it credible that such a cloth was indeed in Constantinople before the year 1204, and was the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, consider the following: So the Shroud must have arrived in Constantinople some time during the period 30 AD and 1204 AD. By the year 328, Helena had apparently ensured that Contantinople was apparently swamped with relics of the crucifixion, the early martyrs, and indeed according to Charles Freeman and his mentor John Calvin there was a whole shipload of True Crosses there. Curiously, the Shroud is not included in any of the inventories of this largesse, so presumably it arrived there after 328 AD, Let us fast forward to the year 943 AD. The great Armenian general of the Byzantines John Curcuas with an army of 80,000, had turned the course of history by his military conquest of the Turks. The Arabs had been weakened and here he is at the gates of Edessa which lie at his mercy together with a potentially utter defeat of the Muslims. What would you do as a general? Would you not press on and make the defeat complete? What does Curcuas do? Why, he camps at the gate and negotiates over several months for some old icon, a piece of rag with a picture on it, or so we are told. The Arabs are perplexed; the Caliph in Baghdad has to be consulted, and eventually the icon is surrendered. Now there are two possible scenarios to consider. Either the Byzantines already have the purported burial cloth, and this must be known by the Emperor and the Patriarch, or else they do not. If they already have such a relic, together with Helena’s largesse, why would they ever send such a prestigious general with his army merely to capture some picture, when there was a much more lucrative prize on offer, the utter rout of the Arabs? Very likely then, the burial cloth would have arrived in Constantinople some time after 943. The Mandylion, as it is called, is brought to the Emperor, together with whatever else had been captured, with great ceremony, it is seen so prestigious that a special feast day on August 16 is declared for its arrival, still celebrated throughout Eastern Orthodoxy even today. The Mandylion is made part of the Orthodox liturgy, and the legend of Abgar is recited. Let us now surmise that the Mandylion is not the Shroud, and therefore it arrives in Constantinople at some later date. Surprisingly, I cannot tell you the feast day for the arrival of the burial cloths of Jesus Christ in Constantinople. The Orthodox do not celebrate the arrival of such a prestigious relic. Robert de Clari saw something very like it in 1204, and the Patriarch complained to the Pope that the Crusaders made off with it. But of the arrival of teh burial cloths there is no mention. But of course I shall be told that all of this is my over wrought imagnation working overtime. It couldn’t happen that way at all. We have it on the best authority from Byzantine scholars who work so hard to affirm with each other in their closed circle that they are right and they are the specialists, even although Hans Belting knows that they are uncomfortable with the very idea of burial cloths. Perhaps it is just my imagination.

The legend associated with the Veil of Manoppello suggests that it may very well be the Veronica after its disappearance from Rome ~1608. Whether it was in Edessa or not might be argued. One version I read (Heinrich Pfeiffer) has it going from Jerusalem to Camelia in Capadocia, and thence to Constantinople in the VI c. Whence it disappeared in 705. The VI c. Is suggestive I think, and may point to an Edessa provenance as many copies of Edessa image seem to have radiated from there at that time (Belting). The three alleged originals (Melkite, Nestorian, Monophysite) make it further confusing, as do the various names used at different times for a single object. Byzantine chronicle says that Bishop Abraham only took the one object in 944 and returned the others, but that I suppose could be questioned. For me a compelling argument is the 15 Vignon markings. Whatever the original template (and perhaps its copies) that artists worked from happened to be, then the facial image on the Shroud must have been the model for those template(s). As the copies radiated out from Edessa in the 6th century, I find it hard to dismiss the inevitable conclusion that the Shroud was in Edessa at that time. It could no longer have been there when Edessa was destroyed in 1146. Around 1130, Normandy based Orderic Vitalis reports that western visitors to Constantinople are shown the emperor’s relic collection and that the Jesus imprinted Edessa cloth, besides Jesus’ facial imprint displays ‘the form and size of the Lord’s body to all who look upon it’.

Some of this is peer reviewed; some is not. Much of it has been carried out on a voluntary basis, some perhaps with the assistance of grants. It seems that peer review is not necessarily the guarantee of rigour that it once might have been. If one were to wait for academe to take an interest in it, I think we should wait a very long time indeed. There does appear in my view to be an academic conspiracy against the Shroud, based perhaps on faulty received wisdom. It commenced with the reaction of the French Academy of Science to Delage and Vignon. Sadly I have recently learned of the apparent intent to deceive by two notable cleric historians, Chevalier & Thurston. If you are not already aware of it, I would refer you to Markwardt’s paper “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD” 2001. It would seem that these two notable historians set about with a deliberate intent to deceive. Markwardt is an attorney at law and understands these matters very well. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf Chevalier & Thurston seem to have set an unfortunate precedent followed by some of their successors. I am sure that you would not willingly want to be such a participant yourself, but perhaps “caution” might be a good watchword. You refer to neglect of any potential healing power of the Shroud. That might well be true, but perhaps indicates that pro authenticists are more cautious than you have assumed. Albert Dreisbach has written extensively on its historic association with healing, most of them fairly ancient. I found the last paper he wrote, shortly before his death in 2006 quite moving. Although this paper does not specifically refer to healing, it certainly has a strong religious appeal which I hope you might be able to relate to. “THE ECUMENICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN”; (Perugia: Revised 2006) by The Rev. Albert R. Dreisbach: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/dreisbach4.pdf. He was on his way to deliver the paper at two conferences in Italy when he died.

He was born after the mandylion / shroud arrived there.” I now think this is quite a significant point, and after looking into the matter further, I think this may change the odds considerably towards the cloth quite possibly being a representation of the Shroud. The whole Ottonian period is a fascinating time for Europe, beginning with Otto I the Great. After securing the German Reich against various rival aspirants, Otto I was summoned to Italy by the Burgundian princess Adelaide, the widowed queen of Italy, married her and assumed the title of king of the Lombards. Having dealt with a Magyar uprising, he was summoned to Italy a second time, by Pope John XII, and was crowned as Emperor in 962. He had by then procured the election of his 6 year old son Otto II as king of Germany. He extended the temporal power of the pope, but having deposed John XII in 963. Obtained a proviso that the emperor was to ratify papal elections. Turning now to the marriage of Otto II with the Byzantine princess Theophanu in 972: She is not to be confused with Theophano, the widow of the incapable ruler Romanos II, son of Constantine Porphyrogenitus who had minted coins showing Shroud like facial images of Christ. The Mandylion had arrived in Constantinople from Edessa in 944. In order to promote her sons as the hereditary rulers of Constantinople, Theophano subsequently married Nikephoros II Phokas and served as regent during her sons minority. Theophanu has been suggested as the fourth child of Theophano and Romanos II, but current research holds that her mother was Sophia Phokaina, niece of Nikephoros II. Be all that as it may, it suggests that Theophanu, wife of Otto II, and mother of Otto III would have been suffiently connected with the Byzantine court to appreciate the true nature of the imperial relic collection, whatever that might have comprised. Otto II was declared emperor upon Otto I’s death in 1973, himself dying in 983 while attempting to bring Venice under imperial control. Whether Otto III was in a position to learn of the Shroud’s existence, or of its true significance, from his mother Theophanu, can only be a matter of conjecture, whether or not he knew of the cloth’s image. However the question of whether or not the cloth in his coronation picture is intended to represent the Shroud, becomes I think just a little more plausible and tantalising..","date":"2013-08-04","mins":"2:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/03/the-enthronement-of-otto-iii/","cat":"art","title":"The Enthronement of Otto III"},{"id":"comment-40374","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Despite its appearance, I’m inclined to doubt the object being a representation of the Shroud. Otto III was crowned Emperor in Rome in 996, when the Shroud would be virtually unknown as such in the West. He had planned to recreate the glory and power of the ancient Roman Empire in a universal Christian state governed from Rome, in which the pope would be subordinate to the Emperor in religious as well as secular affairs. Heeding an appeal from Pope John XV in suppressing a rebellion by the Roman noble Crescentius, Otto had crossed the Alps but by the time of his arrival in Rome, the pope had died. Otto then secured the election of his 23 year old cousin Bruno of Carinthia as Gregory V, the first German pope, who then crowned Otto as emperor. In making Rome his official residence and administrative centre of the Empire, Otto instituted elaborate Byzantine court ceremonies, and revived ancient Roman customs, as well as assuming certain religious titles for himself. This may suggest some acquaintance with Byzantium, and hence the possibility of some knowledge of the Byzantine relics, but to link this with the Shroud would seem tenuous. Gregory V died in 999, whereupon Otto installed his former tutor Gerbert of Aurillac pope, as Sylvester II. Sylvester a pre eminent scholar, was every bit a match for Otto. He had been trained in Spain, and it was largely due to him whereby Arabic learning was transmitted to the West, including the first use of Hindu Arabic numerals, an interesting enough subject in itself. Gerbert himself is a fascinating figure, being the foremost and dominating figure of the 10th century for modern scholars. Gerbert’s legacy includes his political roles; his teaching in logic, dialectics, mathematics and astronomy; his transmssion of Arabic learning; his relations with Otto III; his papacy; and his influence on later ages..","date":"2013-08-03","mins":"5:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/03/the-enthronement-of-otto-iii/","cat":"art","title":"The Enthronement of Otto III"},{"id":"comment-8318","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Quote: “You believe what you want!” I believe what the weight of evidence tells me.

Mark was Peter’s amenuensis in Rome, and so Peter was the guarantor of Mark’s authenticity. The theory states that Mark wrote his gospel after Peter’s death 65 AD, but before the temple was destroyed in 70 AD. Peter and Mark must have had some fascinating discussions in Rome, as Peter recalled his time with Jesus. Peter no doubt described his experience on that first Easter morning. He may even have mentioned his shock (possibly horror) at seeing a shroud with a naked imprint of his Master on it. What could Mark do with a story like that? Think about the psychology of it. Did he decide to insert the naked young man escaping the linen cloth at the time of the arrest, an omen or harbinger as Colin suggests? Or was it Mark himself as a youth? Or was it the young adopted son Yehuda bar Yeshua, the disciple whom Jesus loved, escaping in his pyjamas as suggested by Pellegrino?

Mark’s gospel was written first, about 90% of Mark is in Matthew, say 60% of Mark in Luke; Both Matthew & Luke have another common source which commentators identify merely as ‘Q’ (for German Quelle). As well, both have access to their own separate sources, say M1, L1. Only Mark mentions the incident, and both Matthew & Luke decided to omit it. Therefore some commentators believe it was probably the evangelist himself i.e. Mark. Authors Jacobovici and Pellegrino have an interesting take on the incident, ref “The Jesus Family Tomb” Simcha Jacobovici & Charles Pellegrino – Harper Collins 2007. It refers to the discovery of a family tomb in the suburb Talpiot where several ossuaries were found, all inscribed with names connected with Jesus family relations (Mk 6:3) There are several references in various gospels, particularly John, referring to “the disciple whom Jesus loved”. Most commentators believe this was the disciple John, some still identify as the evangelist of that name. For example he leant on Jesus’ breast at the Last Supper. In those days of high mortality, there were many orphans, adoption was very prevalent, and under both Roman and Jewish Law, adoption gave the same family rights as birth. (Even some of the emperors inherited the role through their adoption). Pellegrino’s take on this is that the young man referred to in Mk 14:50, is Jesus’ adopted son (Jude?) and this was the “disciple whom Jesus loved”, leaning on his breast, and fleeing from the arrest in his pyjamas. One ossuary has the name “Yehuda bar Yeshua”. The adoption is never mentioned in the gospels because of the implied threat to the young man’s life as son of the “King of the Jews”. It was then fashionable to dispose of an entire dynasty, not merely the reigning monarch, to avoid the rise of pretenders.

You say that you are very familiar with it, so I shan’t take time on this site to argue for it. For other readers, Wiki has a reasonably informative outline about it. Encyclopedia Britannica has an excellent comprehensive article, and there is also specialist material available. Essentially there are two approaches. Those who follow the “form criticism” approach, almost universally adopt Markan Priority, and it makes a lot of rational sense. Those who prefer the testimony of some of the early Church Fathers are those more inclined to adopt a Matthew, Luke priority, Mark as an abridgement, with John much later. Having read some of the material on it, I don’t see how it stacks up. It was with some dismay that I discovered that the translators of NASB without exception, were those who rejected the Markan Priority thesis. While there might have been some need to allow a non Markan priority viewpoint, it seems to have been a highly selective bias, considering what the majority exegete viewpoint is.

One problem is that in Mark, it looks like the Temple has not yet been destroyed, whereas in Matthew & Luke it has. Either way, Matthew & Luke certainly haven’t written before 70 AD. Here’s another theory, which takes on board both viewpoints! One possibility is that Mark wrote his between 65 & 70, but maybe it was only circulated locally and didn’t receive wide circulation throughout the whole church. Matthew & Luke had access to it together with other material, and compiled their gospels. Matthew’s was theologically comprehensive, and envisaged Jesus as the new Moses. Matthew’s was the gospel that was read in the churches, and is commonly called the ecclesiastical gospel. So in that sense it had priority. When Mark’s gospel became more widely known, it was seen as an abridgement of Matthew (90% of Mark is in Matthew), inferior, and so leading to the Clementine viewpoint. When does Jesus become Son of God? In Mark, it is at his baptism by John B in the Jordan! In Matthew and Luke, it is at his conception! In John, it is from the very beginning. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”. So there’s a clear transition, from Mark, through Matthew & Luke, to John. Incidentally, looks like Max’s comments on “sindon” might support the pyjama theory, or maybe it was just somebody in bed at the time.

My comment was intended to convey that no way was the young man who was fleeing from the arrest scene the gardening boy doing shiftwork overtime, although many of our iwi here in Aotearoa may consider full moon a propitious time for planting their kumara (sweet potato). Your comment re Magdalene’s mistaking Jesus for the gardener is fully understood. To say that John & Mark are one and the same person is a gross assumption, these names were exceedingly common in the Judaic community, and we can seldom know that when they’re repeated if they refer to the same person elsewhere in the Testament unless they can be placed in the same context. For example: we don’t know if John the disciple is the same as the evangelist (he may be), he’s probably not the writer of the Johannine epistles, and almost certainly not the writer of Revelations. A few years ago, following up hostile reactions on the web to the “Jesus Family Tomb” book which I mentioned above in my posting of Feb 15, I did a stats analysis of the names known to be on 1st c ossuaries. Most of the names familiar to us through the NT were exceedingly common. It takes some fairly rigorous analysis and context cross referencing to show that two separate occurrences of a name refer to the same person, and you still may not come up with the correct answer. I am utterly dismayed at Chris’s news of a growing tendency to reject Marcan priority. It is so retrograde. It is decorated with the name of following the Clementine tradition, asserting that this was the understanding of the early Fathers. It can be traced back to Papias, a 2nd century bishop of Hierapolos in Phrygia, who Irenaeus says knew the apostle John, and who Eusebius says was a man of exceedingly small intelligence. Subsequent Fathers are merely echoing Papias. What Papias actually said was that “So Matthew composed the Oracles in the Hebrew language and each one interpreted them as he could.” Now the Oracles may have been the “logia”, the “sayings” now common to Matthew and Luke, and possibly some of the common narrative, he may even have compiled the document called “Q”. They almost certainly were not Matthew’s gospel as we now know it, as it seems plain enough that the original language of this Gospel was Greek, not Hebrew. It is seriously doubted that the “Oracle” Matthew is the same as the “Gospel” Matthew (my note above re prevalence of NT names). Furthermore, the Anti Marcan priority lobby is not averse to using form criticism when it suits them, such as asserting that Mark deleted all the apparent anti Gentile references in Matthew. Either they should use the full weight of this discipline, or not at all. I recall that a few bloggers on this site seem to have been prone to a similar disease, selecting only that evidence which suits their case, and rejecting that which does not!

I urge both Max & Ron to examine these, as they cover the various arguments and issues in a way not possible in a short blog posting. Gospel of Matthew: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10057a.htm Gospel of Mark: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09674b.htm I do not subscribe to the views of Robinson, Trestmontant and Carmignac. Theirs is not the majority viewpoint of exegetes, and I think it unfortunate that they seem to have gained traction within the establishment. On the evidence of Papias, Mark did not use Matthew as a source, but reported what he had directly from Peter in Rome. He has written it for Roman Christians, many of them gentiles, although some were Jews. Matthew wrote his gospel for Syriac Christians, and it is evident that they are predominantly Jewish Christians, and likewise Jewish synagogues are also prevalent, probably as a result of the dispersion with the impending threat of the Jewish War. The source of Matthean priority seems to have been due to a misreading of Papias, who states that Matthew first wrote “logia” in the Hebrew language, (possibly the ‘Q’ document). This is covered in the references above. Only two of Mark’s miracle stories are not included in Matthew and Luke. The view I am coming to about the origin of the priority debate is along the following lines: Mark wrote his gospel, from the preaching of Peter, and it had limited circulation among Roman Christians. At some time Matthew and Luke acquired copies of it, and along with other material they had, compiled their gospels. Matthew’s gospel came to be read in the Syriac churches, was referred to as the ecclesiastical gospel, and in that sense had priority. When Mark’s gospel became more widely known, it was seen as inferior to Matthew’s, and an abridgement of it (90% of Mark is in Matthew), and therefore secondary. I do not subscribe to the view that there were early apostle scribes who wrote everything down. There is no evidence for such scribes, although someone called Matthew appears to have written down the logia (Q?). The parousia was believed to be imminent and so there would be little point in writing for posterity in the years before 70 AD. I suspect that the assumption arises from a modern Western lack of appreciation of the ability of non literate peoples to recite verbatim what they had heard, and there were many others who would correct them if they made an error of recall. Concerning the dates of writing, I can certainly concede there is wide spread lack of agreement among the authorities. The arguments for a post 70 AD date for the composition of Matthew is an extract at the foot of this posting. Extract concerning the origins of Mark’s gospel is reproduced below: Eusebius quoting Papias: “And the elder said this also: Mark, having become interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately everything that he remembered, without, however, recording in order what was either said or done by Christ. For neither did he hear the Lord, nor did he follow Him, but afterwards, as I said, (he attended) Peter, who adapted his instructions to the needs (of his hearers), but had no design of giving a connected account of the Lord’s oracles [v. L. “words”]. So then Mark made no mistake [Schmiedel, “committed no fault”], while he thus wrote down some things (enia as he remembered them; for he made it his one care not to omit anything that he had heard, or set down any false statement therein” (Eusebius, Church History III.39). Extract of arguments concerning Matthew’s post 70 AD date of composition: The following are some of the arguments advanced to prove that the First Gospel was written several years after the Fall of Jerusalem. When Jesus prophesies to His Apostles that they will be delivered up to the councils, scourged in the synagogues, brought before governors and kings for His sake; that they will give testimony of Him, will for Him be hated and driven from city to city (x, 17 23) and when He commissions them to teach all nations and make them His disciples, His words intimate, it is claimed, the lapse of many years, the establishment of the Christian Church in distant parts, and its cruel persecution by the Jews and even by Roman emperors and governors. Moreover, certain sayings of the Lord–such as: “Thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church” (16:18), “If he [thy brother] will not hear them: tell the Church” (xviii, 10)–carry us to a time when the Christian Church was already constituted, a time that could not have been much earlier than the year 100. The fact is, that what was predicted by Our Lord, when He announced future events and established the charter and foundations of His Church, is converted into reality and made coexistent with the writing of the First Gospel. Hence, to give these arguments a probatory value it would be necessary either to deny Christ’s knowledge of the future or to maintain that the teachings embodied in the First Gospel were not authentic..","date":"2012-02-18","mins":"6:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"id":"comment-8313","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A very informative postinig, Dan, Thank you.

Very many years ago in the 1950’s, I regularly topped my classes in French (and Latin), but purely on the basis of my meccano set (a well known model building set) my parents decided I should take up professional engineering instead. I’m afraid I’ve lost most of my French now and have lacked the incentive to take it up again. In later life I was able to take up my interests in literary studies and mathematics, which also happened to include a major in Religious Studies. I made some attempt to pick up on the works you mentioned, but I’m afraid that Google automatic French English translation of technical papers is only slightly better than pidgin. I regularly use my Encyclopaedia Britannica package as one of my reference sources. It has an extremely comprehensive in depth section on Biblical Literature, compiled by several authoritative authors. I also of course use several other sources as well. I also mentioned the ability of non literate peoples to recite long passages they had heard, purely from memory. This is still manifest among both Maori and Pasifika peoples for instance in reciting their whakapapa (genealogies) karakia (chants) and so on, which they have had from ancient times. You may recall a related passage from Alex Haley’s “Roots” which takes him to his ancestral tribe in Africa, and the tribal genealogist recites the genealogy enabling Haley to discover his ancestor who had been taken by slave traders. I think we see a glimpse of this practice of oral recitation in Papias: “Papias (died c. 130), a bishop of Hieropolis, in Asia Minor, was said by Irenaeus (died c. 200), a bishop of Lugdunum (now Lyon, France) to have been an eyewitness of the Apostle John. Papias had said, “For I did not suppose that the things from the books would aid me so much as the things from the living and continuing voice.” Eusebius (c. 260 c. 340), a church historian, reported these comments in his Ecclesiastical History and pointed out inconsistencies in Papias’ recollections, doubted his understanding, and called him “a man of exceedingly small intelligence.” Large sections of oral tradition, however, which were probably translated in part from Aramaic before being written down in Greek such as the Passion (suffering of Christ) narrative, many sayings of Jesus, and early liturgical material benefited by the very conservatism implicit in such traditions.” (Encyc Brit) I think it suggests that oral recitation in the early churches may well have been a norm. It is also reflected in the pericope style of the Synoptics, with their self contained mini episodic style of writing. Certainly in the time of Papias, both Matthew’s and Mark’s gospels were accepted as authentic witnesses. And of course by the mid 2nd c. We have Justin in Rome reporting in his Apologia: “And on the day called Sunday there is a meeting in one place of those who live in the city or the country, and the memoirs of the apostles or writings of the prophets are read as long as time permits.” “… the memoirs of the apostles which are called Gospels …” It seems that Justin feels the need to take pains in explaining this practice of reading the memoirs. I’m therefore of the view that the written Word was something that evolved rather more slowly than is allowed by some exegetes who see it as a more immediate development..","date":"2012-02-19","mins":"4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"id":"comment-8484","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I discovered the following paper sympathetic to the Robinson / Tresmontant / Carmignac hypothesis which may interest you, if you’re not already aware of it (thankfully it’s in English): CONTEMPORARY CATHOLIC BIBLICAL SCHOLARSHIP: CERTITUDES OR HYPOTHESES?

We should not fall into the reactionary trap of anti Teutonism to compensate. Surely the Judean / Semitic ingredient can be found in the authorship of at least three of the gospels, together with their milieu, although Matthew’s gospel, wrongly or rightly, has frequently been accused of being anti Semitic, and even a driver of anti Semitism. . I can agree with you on the possible importance of the halakhic burial rites, but I fail to see how that can relate to the Markan priority debate, or the date of committal to writing of the gospels. You have given a persuasive argument for it in the Sanhedrin roles of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, providing that there was sufficient light still available for them to observe all the detail of these rituals. There’s some interesting recent comments on this site about myrrhic and aloetic residues on the blog headed by Kelly Pearse’s fine article. I would go as far as saying that any exegete who fails to take due account of Jewish ritual practices runs the risk of being incompetent. I know of at least one paper that attempts to search for a photo sensitive chemical reaction involving myrrhic aloetic components. Perhaps such attempts should also be informed by allowing for the full detail of the halakhic burial rites, or at least possible variants of them..","date":"2012-02-19","mins":"11:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"id":"comment-8557","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Because I’m not a biblical ltieralist! I believe caution must be exercised in interpreting every line of scripture. A common enough error is to assume that every line of scripture is literally true, probably stemming from the traditional doctrine that all of scripture is divinely inspired. A broader view is evident as early as the time of Augustine (De doctrina christiana): “Its emphasis on allegorical interpretation of scripture, carried out within very loose parameters, was especially significant, and it remains of interest to philosophers for its subtle and influential discussion of Augustine’s theory of “signs” and how language represents reality.” (Encyc Brit), The evangelists were not concerned to write history, as we understand a historian might do today, or even in the style of Josephus say. They were generally concerned to proclaim Jesus as divine, as Saviour, to proclaim his teaching, and, in John, as Son of God from the very beginning. They did this according to their own understanding, and according to their perceived needs of their intended congregations. Notwithstanding, the gospels certainly do have some historical content. John is certainly concerned with Jewish practices, his intended audience appears for the most part to be Jewish Christians, his gospel seems to be structured around Jewish festivals, and there is further doctrinal development from the content of the Synoptics. But it is not possible for instance, as John P Meier has pointed out (A Marginal Jew) to obtain a time frame consistent with the Synoptics, John’s time span is much longer, Even so it is John’s account that Meier uses for dating the crucifixion. There was some initial reluctance to accept John’s gospel as canonical, and a few even suspected it of some gnosticism. It may well have been the intention of Nicodemus and Joseph Ar. To comply with all the detailed requirements of the prescribed burial rites, but there may well have been a few details they had to omit in the time available. Do we suppose that John would make a point of mentioning any omission if such was the case? It’s irrelevant to his preaching of the kerygma. I think there is scope for both points of view, but I can’t see that one can be dogmatic about either.

Text of Markwardt’s ‘Modern Scholarship’ paper is published by Barrie Schwortz at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf. It comprises some 276 pages, double spaced, with 251 footnotes, and 20 illustrations taken from his 136 slide presentation. It includes a detailed review of various other hypotheses, including the Wilson Mandylion theory, which Markwardt no longer holds. Two of his earlier papers, place the Shroud in the city of Antioch, taken there by the apostles consequential to the Jewish persecution after the martyrdom of Stephen. During the depredations and confiscation of church treasures by Julian the Apostate, it was hidden away until the 6th century when a series of earthquakes hit Antioch, and its location was then revealed. Soon after Antioch was attacked by the Persian King Chosroes who destroyed the city. Meantime the warrior patriarch bishop of Antioch, Ephraemius took the Shroud into Cappadocia, where it became known as the Image of Camuliana. Soon afterwards it was taken to the capital Constantinople, where it became known as the Image of God Incarnate, quite distinct from the Mandylion, This very brief summary does little justice to Markwardt’s excellent case, and one needs to read the paper to see his strong arguments for his theory. I consider the paper to be a major landmark in the quest for an early history. However there is a lot of scholarly investment in the Mandylion hypothesis, and I expect it will be some time before the significance of Markardt’s paper becomes fully appreciated.

Firstly only the exit wound of one nail hole of the left upper limb is shown, it is smeared, and no entrance wounds are visible. The length of phalanges between individuals is known to vary considerably; there is an underlying assumption that the outer surface of the hand is laying flat against the cloth, whereas it seems more likely to be an orthogonal projection, and for all that may be surmised, the fingers may be cupped to some extent, and also not parallel to the cloth; there is an assumption that the image of the ends of the fingers are clearly visible, but for all that may be guessed the end of the fingers image may merely be the end of the phalange bones, if that. I believe the measurement method described is therefore flawed. I have before me a particularly clear image of the exit wound. It appears to coincide with the narrowest part of the wrist, where the base of the thumb and little finger metacarpals converge at the join of the wrist. The “blood smear” extends from the base of the palm as far as and beyond the join with the fore arm, that is, generally what most people would call the wrist. As for the entrance wound, that is not visible. Barbet deduced from his experiments, that it was at the wrist. Zugibe considered it was at the base of the palm, and showed a particularly graphic example of a stabbing victim’s wound which he believed was similar. I believe Zugibe’s analysis of arm tensions was flawed, as it failed to take account of the fact of the raising of the cross beam, with the victim attached, when the full body weight would need to be carried by his outstretched arms, until the feet were nailed which only then could give any relief to arm tension..","date":"2015-02-23","mins":"5:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/very-disturbing/","cat":"art","title":"Very Disturbing"},{"id":"comment-191742","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"OK, Measuring – guess, guess, guess and approximate this and that.

Some claim to observe that the fingers appear to be unusually long; the reason might be that the image has imprinted onto a rumple, and thus appears longer. This would affect distance measurements.

The corpse is bent at the waist and so clearly not depicted in a state of rigor mortis. This contrasts with the assertions of Barbet. Barbet’s scenario for the transport is that the body was so stiff, that the cross piece was removed from the upright with the arms still attached and the body was easily transported the very short distance to the tomb by five men: two holding the cross piece (patibulum); two with a band supporting the waist; and one at the feet. There was no “stretcher” as otherwise the blood marks would show signs of smearing, and indeed this seems to be Barbet’s explanation for the blood mark across the small of the back from the supporting band. Likewise the arms (sinistral arm only visible) in the illustration are shown hanging loosely at the sides. Barbet asserts that the nails would be removed at the burial site, and it would take some definite effort to break the rigor at the shoulders to bring the arms down to the sides.
