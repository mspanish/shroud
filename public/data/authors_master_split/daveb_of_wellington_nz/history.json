The earliest one I saw on your Wiki ref was the Egyptian Ra of about 1200 BC. It would seem to have entered Christian art from Roman and Greek representations, such as the Sol Invictus. However in the case of the Shroud, I think there is an inference that a halo effect could result from the action of light or fading from its prior presentation in the form of a Mandylion. This could occur if the image was masked by a cloth covering leaving a circular hole to expose only the face, perhaps such as in some of the lattice work images of the mandylion displayed in Ian Wilson’s 2012 Valencia presentation. If the mandylion was in fact ever displayed in this way then over time the exposed part of the cloth would fade leaving a nimbus effect. But as O.K. Says, perhaps the alleged nimbus around the face of the Shroud image is only wishful thinking by those interested in promoting the Mandylion = Shroud hypothesis..","date":"2014-11-09","mins":"4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/a-detailed-response-to-the-halo-study/","cat":"history","title":"A Detailed Response to The Halo Study"},{"id":"comment-215701","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Mario for your response. You have clearly put in a lot of research into your paper, which I hope will be thoroughly analysed by those in a better position than myself to be able to do so. Clearly there will not be unanimity on your conclusions, but with so much controversy and uncertainty concerning the Missing Years, every avenue needs to be thoroughly explored as a possible route, and each case must be made and hopefully objectively appraised. For this reason alone, your paper must be considered a significant contribution towards these endeavours, regardless of the accuracy of any conclusions which might be made. My earlier comments concerning the Sainte Chapelle hypothesis may have been derived from a paper by Daniel Scavone who I note you mention in your ‘Response to Objections’. A possible major hurdle to overcome is the confusion in many minds with the Mandylion of Edessa, and the inclusion in the inventories of the image with the trellis work, when supporters of the Mandylion thesis assert that it had already been unfolded and revealed in Constantinople. The apparently casual approach towards the actual nature of specific relics by those compiling the inventories, also seems to create ambiguities in accurately identifying these relics.

And yet Robert de Clari’s sighting of a Christ imaged cloth in the church at Blachernae in 1204 seem unequivocal, and there are several earlier Byzantine references to such a cloth, a himation, the cloth that God wore, and so on. Our Shroud next emerges some 150 years afterwards in the French village of Lirey in 1355, apparently the property of Geoffrey de Charney, reported by his descendants to be a reward for services rendered and freely given, and hence not acquired through thievery or conquest. 1) The recent enquiries by Mario Latendresse demonstrate that there appears to be no known family tradition connecting Othon de la Roche with the Shroud and that the casket in the Castle Ray sur Saone purported to be its reliquary seems only to have been recently labelled as such. There are also other serious problems with the Othon theory. In 1204, Othon as a medieval lord owed fealty to his own lord and military commander, Boniface de Montferrat, both owing fealty to the recently elected emperor Baldwin IX of Flanders. If the Theodore Angelos letter to Pope Innocent III happens to be genuine, and if Othon did indeed possess the Shroud, then this would have been known in 1205. Baldwin was captured and likely killed by the Bulgarians in April 1205, and Boniface survived until September 1207. It would seem inconceivable that either Baldwin or Boniface would have knowingly deferred to Othon’s possession of such a highly prized relic. If they were unaware of Othon’s seizing of the Shroud, then he effectively stole it from those to whom he owed sworn fealty. It would seem unlikely that Othon would have deceived his liege lords in this way, and if he had, then it is also unlikely that they did not learn of it, and reclaim it from him by force if necessary. 2) No shroud was ever inventoried among the relics placed by King St Louis in his new Sainte Chapelle. We read of a “Du sainte suaire” = ‘a piece of the holy shroud’, and “une sainte face” = ‘a holy face’. Later inventories refer to the latter as a ‘a holy towel in a frame’, seemingly the mandylion of Edessa. If the mandylion was ever the Shroud, then it had been unfolded long ago in Constantinople, according to those advocating this hypothesis. The holy towel in a frame continued to be inventoried until at least 1575 when the actual Shroud was already on its way from Chambery to Turin. 3) The mainstay of Ian Wilson’s Templar hypothesis for their secluding the Shroud during its missing years, seems to be the alleged worship of an idol in the form of a head from confessions obtained under torture. He also refers to a painting of a Shroud like Christ found in the 1940s on a ceiling panel of oak boards found at Templescombe, possibly dating to about 1300. Daniel Scavone has noted that no two Templars ever gave the same description of the alleged idol, none ever described it as a cloth image, some said it was a skull, yet others said it had three heads. He also notes that some of these Templars were menials, and not part of the inner circle present at the secret meetings when the idol was supposedly exposed. More significantly, he notes that the inquisitors used the same questions in the trials of the Cathars, and that it would seem that the inquisitors themselves intruded the idol into the interrogations, and the members of the Order described one in the hope of leniency. 4) We turn next to certain heretical dualistic sects in southern Europe as possible Shroud repositors. They seemed to have their origins in a type of Neo Manichaeism imported from the Paulician sect of Armenia and Asia Minor. The Bogomils flourished in the Balkans between the 10th and 15th centuries, fusing Paulician dualism with a certain Slavonic movement aimed at reform. During the 11th and 12th centuries it spread over many European and Asian provinces of the Byzatine empire. They considered that the visible material world was created by the devil and rejected the doctrines of the Incarnation, Baptism, the Eucharist and the whole organisation of the Orthodox Church. By the early 13th century the dualistic communities of Southern Europe comprising the Paulicians and Bogomils in the East and the Cathari in the West, formed a network stretching from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Rome dispatched several legations and Franciscan missionaries to convert or expel Bosnian heretics. With the Ottoman conquest of South east Europe in the 15th centuries, obscurity descended upon the Bogomil sect. 5) The Cathari in southern France and northern Italy, emerged in France during the 12th and 13th centuries. They professed a neo Manichean dualism, reinforced by western dualists returning from the Second Crusade, and also by visiting Bogomil bishops. By 1140 they were an organised church with a hierarchy, liturgy and a system of doctrine. They became well established in the general Pyrenees area particularly in the kingdom of Leon, which incidentally provides a link with Oviedo its former capital. They became known as the Albigensians. Like the Bogomils, they preached that Christ had only been a ghost who only appeared human, and denied his incarnation, death and resurrection, and also the eucharist, transubstantiation and the mass. In 1218 the Cathari were confronted in the city of Leon by a Catholic prelate, Lucas of Tuy. Having personally destroyed one of their chapels, he wrote De Altera Vita, detailing various Cathari tenets and religious practices, displaying his own pathological hatred of heretics and Jews. If De Altera Vita is to be believed, then there was evidently a wide disparity between Cathari beliefs and their practices. For Lucas claims that the Cathari had manufactured a most unusual crucifix, departing in many ways from traditional orthodox depictions. Essentially this was a ‘crux simplex’ comprising an upright stipes with no cross beam, an inscription plate and a foot rest. The figure of Christ was portrayed attached by only three nails, with one driven through his crossed feet, and the heretics claimed that Christ was pierced in his left side by a Roman lance. Evidently his arms were extended directly above his head attached to the stipes. Given their strong aversion to images, the Cathari ought not to have produced such an object, and yet Lucas asserts that in fact they did. Furthermore, in doing so and given the strong tradition of the form of the crucifix, they ought to have followed some of these traditions, but they did not. Also given their rejection of the Eucharist, they ought not to have invited the leader of the Albigensian Crusade, Amaury de Montfort, to see the body of Christ that had become flesh and blood in the hands of their priest. A syndonic solution may resolve this paradox, the disparity between Cathari belief and their practices as alleged by Lucas. Uninformed by modern medical science, and failing to perceive that the Shroud was a mirror reversal, they judged that Christ’s arms were extended vertically above his head, and that the chest wound was on his left side. Indeed Barbet was later to propose that the feet were crossed and fastened by a single nail, as Lucas asserts of his Cathari crucifix. A Eucharist solution is not possible to explain the invitation to Montfort, but a bloodied Shroud image might serve as an adequate explanation. Given Cathari aversion to images, it is curious that inquisitors were to charge them with worshipping an idol in the form of a head, as later inquisitors also charged the Templars. 6) The disappearance of the Christ imaged cloth as reported by Robert de Clari in the chaos of the Crusader sacking of Constantinople in 1204, might then be explained by a Bogomil seizure of the relic and its transference through their extensive Neo Manichean network to the Cathari in Languedoc. Pope Innocent III had attempted to put down the Cathari heresy but this ended in disaster in 1208 with the murder of the papal legate. Amaury de Montfort had led the Albigensian Crusade in 1214 1224 ravaging Toulouse and Provence. A more orderly persecution sanctioned by King St Louis IX of France was more successful, with the capture and destruction of the castle at Montsegur, the Cathar stronghold in 1244. During the siege, four Cathari were said to have scaled down the steep cliffs taking with them a treasure of unknown content. There would then seem to be two possible routes by which the Shroud might have come into the hands of Geoffrey de Charnay. The first of these is that following the capture of the Montsegur castle, the Shroud came into the hands of King Louis IX. Not being part of the Contantinople relic booty, it failed to be catalogued with these relics. However it would then seem peculiar that it does not seem to be otherwise recorded in any other known inventory. Eventually it would be bestowed upon Geoffrey de Charnay for services rendered as claimed by his descendants. The second possible route might seem more credible. It would postulate that following the 1244 siege, the Shroud still remained hidden somewhere in the south of France. In the Spring of 1349, Charny’s royal annuity was modified to include the first forfeitures that might occur in the Languedoc senechaussees of Toulouse, Beaucaire, and Carcassonne. If the Shroud were then discovered during these forfeitures, it would rightfully become the property of Geoffrey de Charney in accordance with this grant. 7) There are several defects and anomalies in the various attempts to date at explaining the sojourn of the Shroud between Constantinople in 1204 and its arrival at Lirey in 1355: a) it does not seem to have been catalogued with the collection of the Louis IX Sainte Chapelle relic collection from Constantinople; b) nor could it have been subsumed there under the identity of a holy face nor as a Shroud fragment; c) it is an open question as to whether the Shroud was ever in Besancon; d) the Othon de la Roche story with its Castle Ray storage no longer seems viable; e) there also seems no adequate basis to support Ian Wilson’s Templar hypothesis. The victors’ customary practice of destruction of the conquereds’ records and documents always creates problems for any historian. Given the various defects and anomalies, the Cathari route for the Shroud is no less credible than most other attempts at a solution, and might even stand up to better scrutiny. It may in fact be its actual route.

I suspect that the Shroud would almost be unique in exposing the buttocks of Christ, although the scourging scene in the Stuttgart Psalter also shows them but is a cartoon style of drawing, rather than a medieval realistic representation. I think there would be almost no crucifixes without a loin cloth, and the early Byzantine icons of the crucifixion even showed a full length tunic. Apart from the Shroud and its various direct copies, I would hazard that there would be very few representations of Christ’s buttocks, particularly outside of Italy, and I can recall none showing his genitalia.

Similarly when Robert Burns asserts that the Shroud is a fake, that doesn’t make the Shroud a fake either. It has to be shown to be a fake by some kind of weight of evidence process, and so far that hasn’t been done. Neither has it yet to be shown to be authentic beyond all shadow of doubt whatsoever, but that’s probably not possible of any artifact. But there is a reasonable amount of evidence that shows that the Shroud is probably authentic, as indicated in Dan’s heading at the top of this blog site. It might perhaps best be illustrated by means of an electric circuit analogy. If the steps in logic are connected in series, and one of the steps break down, then that part of the circuit completely fails and that part of the logical process fails. However if the various components in the deductive process are connected in parallel, then it needs every component in the circuit to fail, before the whole logical process fails. This gives the lie to the XYX mantra invoked on this site at various times. If X, Y and Z are connected in parallel, then it requires all of X, Y and Z to fail before the logic breaks down, but that hasn’t happened. If X breaks down, and Y and Z remain secure, then the circuit still works, and similarly if both X and Y break down but Z remains secure, then the logic is still there. X will break down, if only one of its series elements, X1, X2, … Xn breaks down. So that’s my lesson in how to arrive at a logical conclusion. I hope that it is sufficiently clear that all may understand it. And who knows? We might have us all thinking logically for a welcome change.

The very many diverse examples given by Guscin suggest that owners of the several copies may have been anxious to establish a veneer of authenticity for their own particular copy, and to associate it with the Image of Edessa, but possibly reluctant to admit that theirs was only a copy. Note that in a somewhat similar fashion, several ancient churches had claimed to have been founded by one of the apostles to bolster their claims of apostolic origin. Guscin makes a passing observation concerning the Image of Camuliana, by noting that one particular case he refers to may have been the Camuliana. In 540 AD Persian Chosroes attacked and destroyed Antioch, and then set his sights on Edessa. An imaged cloth, not made by human hands, was subsequently discovered in Camuliania and a group of orthodox priests paraded it around Anatolia in 554. In 574 Justin II brought it to Constantinople, and it became known as the Image of God Incarnate. Markwardt claims that this is the object which was actually the true Shroud, and which accounts for those stories relating a full body image. Guscin who was closely associated with Ian Wilson in their visit to Sanliurfa (Edessa) during their investigations does not seem to make a distinction between the face only image of the Mandylion, and the various stories relating a full body image, but seems prepared to allow that they may have been one and the same. He skirts around the problem of specifically associating stories of the full body image with the Turin Shroud by claiming that this is beyond the limits of his thesis. Clearly the Camuliana was not the Mandylion, as they are two distinct objects, their arrival in Constantinople being separated by some 400 years.

Rinaldi evidently had the good sense to avoid the wrong kind of sensationalism by avoiding a direct reference to the miraculous, but in 1933, even his attempts at a scientific or naturalistic explanation had to remain essentilally speculative in the absence of any kind of rigorous experimental evidence. Some 80 years later we are still at the point of debating pretty well the same issues, with little further concrete evidence and only a small advance in our knowledge. There is more than one way we can conceive of the image being miraculous, and it does not necessarily imply the suspension of the laws of nature. In YC’s final paragraph above, he refers: “It is almost impossible to reproduce in a lab all the environmental and biological conditions that prevailed at the time of Jesus burial and so, it will most probably be impossible for anyone now or in the future to fully reproduce the body image on a linen cloth with all the same chemical and physical characteristics than we see on the Shroud of Turin.” But perhaps it is precisely in the specific conditions of the burial and conditions of the tomb, the 30 hours during which the body was wrapped enabling the image to optimise, the various other conditions, the fact that it only ever happened in the case of Jesus the Saviour of the world, and no one else, wherein the nature of miracle might be found. Even the Jospice mattress was an imperfect and unsatisfactory image, but in the case of Jesus, the conditions were apparently just right. Why was it just right, in this unique specific case? That is surely where the miracle can be found. The hand of God is surely evident, perhaps not in the interventionist way that we might ordinarily think of an event being being miraculous, but in the specific conditions that prevailed.

He was in a particularly privileged position in being able to discuss forensic issues with those first pioneers and with Guiseppe Enrie. I am given to understand that the article had a remarkable awakening of interest in the Shroud, particularly in USA. I have searched the article very carefully but have not been able to discover the specific quote given in Anoxie’s comment. It may be a reasonable inference she has made from her own reading of the article. Evidently Vignon felt he could come to some conclusions about the image formation process with the experiments he conducted with ammoniacal vapours and aloes. The article certainly does not say that he was successful in obtaining an image of any specific object comparable to that on the Shroud. He obtained some colorations. Rogers was able to make some advances on this subsequently, with the advantages of his more advanced chemistry knowledge. However some 105 years after De Lage’s presentation at the Sorbonne, and some 80 years after the 1933 exposition and Rinaldi’s article we still have not reached a definite conclusion on the image process supported by any kind of conclusive experiments at all.

It began to flourish in Palestine in the 1st century AD and had as its main concern ecstatic and mystical contemplation of the divine throne, or “chariot” (merkava), seen in a vision by Ezekiel, the prophet (Ezekiel 1). The earliest known Jewish text on magic and cosmology, Sefer Yetzira (“Book of Creation”), appeared sometime between the 3rd and the 6th century. It explained creation as a process involving the 10 divine numbers (sefirot; see sefira) of God the Creator and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Taken together, they were said to constitute the “32 paths of secret wisdom.” However the actual text of the “Last Supper Papyrus” as quoted above, seems to provide no evidence for its use as any kind of magic talisman, but is NT orthodox.

It is claimed that Egyptian looms of this width were known, and were required for the then much prized fashionable seamless tunic. Complex weaves from this period are certainly known, but more often in fabrics other than linen. A counter argument might be that the three pedal loom required for the most efficient production of the herring bone twill seems to have been a later invention.

The question has to be whether such “speculations” are followed up by some evidential support, and proponents of the Mandylion hypothesis have endeavoured to do this. So therefore these are not merely idle speculations withour supporting arguments, and it is these arguments that need to be addressed. Yannick claims that Wilson was only able to agree to only one of the folds identified by Jackson. In this he has misquoted Wilson, probably from a misreading of W’s comment. W’s actual comments on J’s fold marks can be found in his paper “…. A Reply to Professor Averill Cameron” identified in an earlier posting on this site. What Wilson actually said was this: “… Jackson … has claimed the pinpointing of at least four of the hypothesised ‘doubled in four’ foldmarks, with another two reasonably certain, and the two remaining there by implication. Particularly notable is one foldmark studied by Jackson, at postion C according to his notation, which can be traced clearly in all photos, including Xray and ultra violet, and even the comparitively primitive ones taken in 1898. Since this crease line occurs precisely one eighth length from the Shroud’s natural half way fold line, in itself it strongly suggests that the Shroud was once folded in the very way I have hypothesised for it to have been the Image of Edessa.” In other words, Wilson’s comments on one particular fold are making an emphatic point, that this particular fold can be traced clearly in all photos, and that it occurs one eighth of the length from the natural half way foldline; NOT as Yannick asserts that it is the only fold that is clearly distinguishable!

Robert de Clari had described how the cloth had appeared to rise every Friday, and the Jackson demonstration of this was an attempt to search for an explanation of the otherwise mystifying four closely spaced folds that he had also discovered, and why some of the frontal folds seemed to be no longer visible.

His second paper “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” presented at Ohio in 2008, he develops this theory further but with more detail. He believes it had a role in the conversion of the court and household of Abgar VIII the Great, involving Bishop Marcellus Avercius of Hieropolis, during the reign of the emperor Commodus and pontificate of Pope Eleutherius; that the event was recorded as a coded allegory in what came to be known as the Doctrine of Addai, later the Acts of Thaddeus; and is reflected in the Bardesanic “Hymn of the Pearl”; that the Shroud was returned to Antioch, was hidden in the wall there to be later rediscovered, the basis of the legend that it was found in a wall at Edessa; that with the impending destruction of Antioch, by earthquake and Persian invasion, that it was then taken to Edessa about 540 AD.

Mr Freeman I believe is lacking in any scientific credentials at all, and the only science that appears in his article is that which supports his case and is widely discredited or has at least been seriously challenged. Such inferences he makes as “overwhelming evidence that the Shroud is 14th century” and his opening salvo with the discredited D’Arcis memorandum hardly signals an objective intent. Not one single flake of the paint which he alleges originated the image survives nor has ever been reported in any single historical document. On the other hand we have ancient documents that report that the image was perceived as “not made by human hands”. Byzantine epitaphioi, notably the Stavronitska, some dating from the early 12th century, would seem to be persuasively derived from the Shroud image, and the Shroud therefore can hardly be 14th century. Mr Freeman blithely dismisses in his obviously agenda driven hypothesis any such argument and carefully selects only that which supports his tenuous case. What are we to make of the scientific credentials of one who is still prepared to firmly assert that no AB type blood appeared in the human species before 1000 AD and was the result of the Magyar admixture of A and B types from the Mongol incursions of that time when it is known that there are significant populations of AB scattered throughout the world, particularly in the Far East and Middle East, and AB is even found among certain non human anthropoids. Mr Freeman glosses over why any artisan should choose to make a mirror image of the Christ with its chest wound appearing on the left hand side of the body, when all liturgical traditions have the wound on the right side of the body, as it happens to be forensically correct to drain the right side of the heart of its blood, a mortal blow known to the Roman soldiery. The left hand side is what we see as the result of a type of contact imprint, and any competent artisan would have seen to it in the design of his template by reversing it. The image has been carefully studied by several forensic pathologists, none of whom entertained any doubt that the image was of a genuine crucified human male, and was no artifact. We expect that any art historian worthy of the name ought to be able to categorise a work of art, assign to it the particular prevalent style, comment on the genre, place it within the context of other like works, identify the methods used, if he cannot identify the artist to place it within a certain school of art, and compare it to other like works. This Mr Freeman is unable to do, not because its contemporary companions no longer exist, but because they never existed at any time at all! Any artisan who might have constructed such a work, only ever did it once, he left no record of how he did it, nor is there any trace of his failed attempts, and no one else ever thought to record the event either.

It is almost as if the disciples wanted to keep it a secret, and this might even suggest that the image became visible on it very early and so was concealed. Concerning the burial: All three synoptics say that Joseph takes Jesus down, wraps him in a SINDON, and lays him in a tomb hewn out of rock. It is John who says that Joseph and Nicodemus bind the body with OTHONIA along with spices according to the Jewish burial custom, with a garden close by, and lay him in a new tomb there. Concerning the resurrection: In Matthew & Mark, the women enter the tomb, see one young man clothed in a white robe, they are amazed, Jesus is not there, no mention of seeing the burial cloths. In Luke the women see two men in dazzling garments, Jesus is not there and they report to the apostles; Peter then runs to the tomb, sees the OTHONIA and goes home amazed (Luke doesn’t then mention the SINDON that he has said was used to wrap the body). In John, there is a different but more elaborate story. After Mary of Magdala has seen the stone rolled away, she reports to Peter and to another disciple ( = John?) that “they(?) have taken the body, and she doesn’t know where”. Peter goes into the tomb and sees the OTHONIA (John hasn’t mentioned a SINDON) and the SOUDARION that covered the head is rolled up separately. John? goes in, sees and believes (What did he see to make him believe?) They both go home. Meanwhile, continues John, Mary stays outside tomb weeping, bends down and sees two angels in white, one at the head and one at the foot where the body had been. (De Wesselow asserts that this seems to be a reference to the Shroud image.) She says “they’ve taken him, don’t know where”, she turns, sees the gardener, “Sir, where have you put him?” and then recognises that it is Jesus. Max Patrick Hamon has suggested that Mary’s mistaking Jesus for the gardener may have been because gardeners commonly wore a himation, a shroud like garment. If Jesus was wearing the Shroud as a himation, this goes against De Wesselow’s hypothesis about the two angels being the ventral and dorsal images on the Shroud. There are various apocryphal stories concerning what happened to the burial cloth, the Gospel to the Hebrews being as early as the second century. One story is that it was given to Pilate’s wife, another that it was given to St Luke who passed it on to Peter, and another source says that it was kept by Peter. Adrie vd Hoeven has written a comprehensive paper that it was originally John Mark’s temple garment, picked up by the arresting guards at Gethsemane, given to Pilate, and recovered from him by Joseph for the burial. Later liturgical sources associated the eucharistic altar cloths with the burial cloths, whence the term “corporal ( = corpus)”. It is all something of yet another enigma concerning the Shroud. However if the images had formed at a very early stage, then it is not surprising that the disciples wanted it to be kept secret. One of Paul’s authentic epistles suggests that he might have used it as a visual aid for some of his missionary work, although on the face of it this would seem unlikely..","date":"2014-11-11","mins":"4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/jesus-walked-off-with-his-shroud/","cat":"biblical_evidence","title":"Jesus walked off with his shroud?"},{"id":"comment-170679","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, I quite frequently have recourse to the very long article (some 24 separate chapters) on Biblical Literature from the Encyclopedia Britannica, which, although not the most cutting edge research, has the advantage of some reputation as recognisable proven scholarship, even though some details will always be disputed. It has an excellent chapter on the derivation of the canon. I’ll copy it as an extract and send it to you. I think you might find it quite informative. A few extracts here: “The first clear witness to a catalog of authoritative New Testament writings is found in the so called Muratorian Canon, a crude and uncultured Latin 8th century manuscript translated from a Greek list written in Rome c. 170 180, named for its modern discoverer and publisher Lodovica Antonio Muratori (1672 1750). Though the first lines are lost, Luke is referred to as “the third book of the Gospel,” and the canon thus contains [Matthew, Mark] Luke, John, Acts, 13 Pauline letters, Jude, two letters of John, and Revelation. ” … … “Some principles for determining the criteria of canonicity begin to be apparent: apostolicity, true doctrine (regula fidei), and widespread geographical usage. Such principles are indicated by Muratori’s argument that the Pauline Letters are canonical and universal the Word of God for the whole church although they are addressed to specific churches, on the analogy of the letters to the seven churches in Revelation; in a prophetic statement to the whole church, seven specific churches are addressed, then the specific letters of Paul can be read for all. ” … … “The criteria of true doctrine, usage, and apostolicity all taken together must be satisfied, then, in order that a book be judged canonical. Thus, even though the Shepherd of Hermas, the First Letter of Clement, and the Didache may have been widely used and contain true doctrines, they were not canonical because they were not apostolic nor connected to the apostolic age, or they were local writings without support in many areas.” Thus it was not only the matter of heretical movements such as Gnosticism, that disqualified various writings, but other criteria also had to be satisfied for a book to be considered canonical. Conversely, there are clearly some writings that can be considered reliable, even though they may not be canonical.

It would therefore seem to be adopting a literalist perspective of the Bible, which to me is a mistaken undertanding of the Bible’s true intent. It leads to such fruitless projects as the various searches for Noah’s Ark on Mt Ararat, which is a failure to understand the true purpose of the story. There is not even agreement as to what books constitute the “Bible”. This was evident as early as the Samaritan separation from the rest of Judaism (~722 BCE). The Samaritans only acknowledge the Torah, the first five books alleged to be given by Moses, and do not acknowledge the prophetic books which only seem to have been compiled around the time of the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE, or afterwards. Deprived of their temple worship, the Jews in Babylon sought to assert their special identity by recalling their ancient stories and writing them down. Many of these stories were incorporated into the already existing proto Genesis and proto Exodus books. Their exposure to Babylonian science also had an influence. The story of Creation in Gensis ch.2 is a very ancient anthromorphic story and was retained, but the more elevated Creation story in Gen ch.1 is a product of their time in Babylon, and was placed first. Likewise they took the flood myths of the Babylonians and reinterpreted it in greater depth to yield the story of Noah. The early Christians had as their scriptures the Greek Bible compiled in Alexandria over a considerable period after 300 BCE, and it is frequently quoted in the New Testament. It includes the deutero canonical or apocrophyl books, including much of the wisdom literature. Its use by the early Christians led to a Jewish reaction in the Council of Jamnia which declared the additional books to be non canonical, and they reverted to the Hebrew Bible. Despite their acceptance by Jerome and their continued inclusion in the Catholic canon, the Protestant reformers adopted the same position held at Jamnia and also excluded them. The Catholic Council of Trent reacted by declaring the disputed books to be canonical, and reasserted this position at the First Vatican Coucil of 1870. When we come to the New Testament, the inclusion of some of the books were also matters of occasional dispute. By about 200 CE, the criteria for canonicity had generally been settled as: apostolicity, true doctrine, and general usage. All three criteria had to be satisfied. Thus although the Shepherd of Hermas, the First Letter of Clement and the Didache were all accepted as containining true doctrine and in general use, they did not satisfy the criterion of apostolicity. Nevertheless the Letter to the Hebrews, with its non forgiveness of apostasy, was only reluctantly accepted in the West, and Revelations is still considered dubious by the Eastern churches. Martin Luther was reluctant to accept the Epistle of James but eventually acquiesced into accepting it. Probably as a reaction against the Protestant reformers emphasis on scripture as the sole arbiter on matters of true doctrine, the Catholic position towards scripture seems to have been to subordinate it somewhat. It possibly saw scripture as the product of a living Church, and the Church was to be seen as the sole arbiter of its intent and interpretation. The encyclical Providentissimus Deus of Pope Leo XIII in 1893 was a turning point against any such trend, with its establishment of the Pontifical Institute of Biblical Studies. Further impetus and encouragement for the faithfuls’ study of the Bible came with the encyclical Divina afflante Spiritu of Pope Pius XII in 1943. The topic of Revelation was at first contentiously debated at the Second Vatican Council, some 60% of the Council fathers being quite dissatisfied with the preliminary drafts. However the final document Verbum Dei, Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation came to be considered the second most important document promulgated by the Council, only after Lumen Gentium, the Dogmatic Consitution of the Church. Although the Catholic Church seems to have come belatedly to the serious study of the scriptural sources, particularly when compared to the 19th century Protestant scholars, it would be fair comment to say that it has now very likely surpassed present Protestant scholarship in the study of the scriptures. To see the Bible as proclaiming history or as an arbiter of science, is to demean its purpose. Its content is filtered by the times and understanding and the perceptions of those who first inscribed its text over the course of many centuries. I see its purpose as proclaiming the dealings of God with humanity, and of humanity with God. Yes, it contains an understanding of history and an understanding of science, but it also contains codes, aphorisms of wisdom and proverbs, liturgy, poetry, parable in its many forms, apocalyptic writings, and even a wedding song. In the New Testament, the intent is to proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord, Saviour and Redeemer..","date":"2013-08-01","mins":"9:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/01/bible-archeology-the-mystery-continues/","cat":"history","title":"Bible Archeology: The mystery continues"},{"id":"comment-41731","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Wiki has more detailed information, including a translation of the inscription.

Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf The discussion begins at p.24 and takes up much of the rest of the 76 page paper. Initially Byzantine objections to a naked Christ even depicted icons of the Crucifixion with Christ wearing a full length tunic, despite the gospel accounts of his “being stripped of his garments”. The paper mentions the Homs vase showing a Shroud like Christ and the Justinian II coin of 692. Used as labara, the images rather than showing a suffering Christ, more often displayed a triumphant Christ. But with Shroud like features. If portraits of Christ or else the True Cross displayed in battle as labara resulted in victories, this was taken as divine approval of the practice, whereas defeats were interpreted as divine disapproval and usually initiated bouts of iconoclasm. From p.41, Markwardt begins a section on the ‘Road to Iconoclasm’. The Justinian II solidus illustrated above was issued in 692. He awaited God’s verdict on this use of the image for imperial purposes, which was not long in coming. “In 695, Justinian was deposed, and his enemies, aware of a Byzantine tradition requiring an emperor to remain unblemished, cut off his nose before sending him into exile. A decade later, Justinian would return at the head of a foreign army, capture Constantinople, and reclaim his throne; however, apparently convinced that his use of the Image of God Incarnate had incurred God’s wrath, he employed only non Pantocrator images of Jesus on coinage minted during his second reign.” Hence we have the later solidus shown at the head of this posting, essentially a non Pantocrator type image. On p.48, he commences a new section ‘The Imperial Covenant with God’. From about the year 740 a series of destructive earthquakes struck Constantinople, and they were interpreted as a sign of divine disapproval for the displaying of a cloth with the divine image as discussed in the Tarragon manuscript, and it was kept locked up in a golden case. “From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake.” This cannot refer to the Mandylion which only arrived in the city about 940, and clearly some other relic is meant. The only complying image at that time was the ‘Image of God Incarnate’. From that time on the earthquakes ceased, and the Image was consigned to four and a half centuries of obscurity. Note that following its arrival in the city ~940, the Mandylion continued to be shown to western royal visitors and others. From p.67, Markwardt describes how the imperial covenant was eventually broken at the turn of the 13th century under the emperor Alexios III Angelos, who from his general behaviour seems to have had little respect for any possible threats of divine wrath. Hence we have Nicolas Mesarites’ of 1201, “that Jesus’ resurrection was being reenacted in Pharos Chapel ceremonials which involved a sindon that had “…wrapped the mysterious, naked dead body after the Passion” “..","date":"2015-07-10","mins":"4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/10/byzantine-coins-again/","cat":"history","title":"Byzantine Coins Again"},{"id":"comment-205209","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Note that the epitaphioi depicting a a frontal more or less naked Christ, usually with crossed hands over the pelvis and with scourge marks and other wounds, that were commonly used in the Easter liturgies, begin to date from the early 1200s, signifying that the full Shroud image had by then become widely known, since Alexios III had allowed the ‘Image of God Incarnate’ to be taken out of its casket after some 460 years of concealment..","date":"2015-07-10","mins":"11:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/10/byzantine-coins-again/","cat":"history","title":"Byzantine Coins Again"},{"id":"comment-205212","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Problem 1: The Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter scourging scene dates from 800 814, and might be linked to Charlemange’ sojourn in Constantinople.

The keepers of the Mandylion/Shroud were very secretive about exhibiting either. Any records clerk may well have been ignorant of the true nature of the Mandylion as the Shroud. What I find persuasive about Wilson’s theory is that the so called Vignon markings on the Shroud are also shown on copies made of the Mandylion on many of the various icons. The only reason for depicting the Vignon markings are that many of them can only be found on the Shroud, as a result of the injuries iniflicted by the Roman soldiery. If the Mandylion was a separate object, then it would need to have been made during the Way of the Cross to have shown the same markings, rather like the Veronica legend. Another factor is the cultural abhorrence of displaying a burial cloth, which seems to me a sound reason of why the early Jewish church fails to mention it, and why they were probably relieved to send it off to a good Gentile home where it would be more appreciated, than they were capable of doing.

The son and the grand daughter of Geoffroy de Charny also stated clearly that the Shroud was from Geoffroy de Charny, not from Jeanne de Vergy.” There are still several possible explanations which might not exclude the Othon – Jeanne de Vergy chain. Under French matrimonial property law of the time, it might be thought that any property brought to the marriage was legally the husband’s. Humbert was the second husband of Margaret de Charnay, the grand daughter of Geoffrey I. As the Shroud had come into her possession from her father Geoffrey II, and she herself goes under the de Charnay name, it is not unreasonable that it should be stored in a reliquary bearing her father’s coat of arms, rather than her grandmother’s. Despite the Shroud coming direct to Margaret de Charnay from her father, it is Humbert her husband who assumes the role of agent in the matter dealing with the Lirey canons, whether or not it was presumptuous of him to do so. The Shroud may have come from Othon down to Jeanne de Vergy, surrendered to King Louis as were other Byzantine relics, and the king may then have thought it meet to return it to Geoffrey I de Charnay in recognition of his services, which would explain the statements given by his offspring. If Othon had taken the Shroud from Byzantium, there may have been a family cover up to protect Othon’s name, in view of such illicit actions, which had been condemned by the Pope.

On Sept 19, that same year 1356, Geoffrey I was killed at the Battle of Poitiers. The Lirey badge commemorating the first ostentation shows the De Charnay arms on the dexter side and the De Vergy arms on the sinister, which according to the ordinary conventions of heraldry would imply that Geoffrey was still alive at the time when the badge was struck, i.e. Before Sept 19, 1356. Writing in 1389, Pierre D’Arcy alludes to the first showing as some 34 years previously, implying a date sometime in 1355. That is as close as D’Arcy can claim, even though he ought to have had access to Bishop Henri’s Troyes diocesan records giving a more specific date. The figure 34 years, is clearly taken to the nearest whole year, not just the nearest 5 years or thereabouts. Considering the significance of the badge, a first showing in 1357 seems unlikely, and if one presumes Geoffrey’s presence at the actual showings, and his likely absence from Lirey while preparing for the Poitiers campaign, then even 1356 might seem doubtful.

Concerning the Pastoral Letters attributed to Paul addressed to Timothy and Titus: The extract referring to “bring the cloak I left with Carpus at Troas” is II Tim 4:13. It has been discussed before on this site, and the word used generally translated as “cloak” is unknown elsewhere. It’s possible it may be some other object, even a carrying case for the parchments mentioned in the same sentence. Opinion is divided. However an Encyc Brit article asserts that the Pastoral Letters are pseudonymous, and probably not written by Paul at all. So caution is required. Re these Pastoral Letters the article states: “They are all pseudonymous, using Paul as an epistolary model and using pseudonymous devices, such as naming individuals known to be Paul’s co workers. Paul’s authority is invoked to lend credence to the teachings contained in the letters: the avoidance of heresy, holding to sound doctrine, and piety of life.

Historically scientific puzzles have often seemed to generate “freakery” ever since the days of the phlogiston theory, and even earlier. The search for a solution to the puzzle means a quest into the unknown; Lines of enquiry open up possibilities; sometimes there appear to be promising leads, but then end up as a dead end. The researcher has an investment in his work, it becomes his baby, and he defends it against all onslaughts. The more enigmatic the puzzle, the longer time that a solution delays its emergence.

He refers to such complicated weaves as the Rameses girdle, but which would not require the same large size of loom as required to weave the Shroud. He has previously been reluctant to admit the possibility of a Middle East provenance of the Shroud because linen threads are Z twist, whereas most known surviving cloths from there are S twist, although I gather this is particular to Egyptian cloth. Perhaps it is conceivable that other Middle East linen cloth was made as Z twist. A search for comparable control samples for the 1988 C 14 testing was apparently fruitless, and I believe that the only control samples that could be found were only of plain weave. Apparently no other surviving linen specimen of 3 to 1 herringbone could be found for purpose of a control sample. He expresses frustration at researchers’ unwillingness to look outside the Edessa Constantinople route, and I think the point can be taken that perhaps the Shroud or Mandylion would not have survived long walled up in the damp climate of Edessa, which was prone to flooding. Researchers have seen similarities between the Shroud image and the multitude of icons said to have been based on the Mandylion or the Image of Edessa, and this would seem to be a principal reason why the Edessa route has persisted in Shroud lore. Certainly there was such an object as the Mandylion held at Edessa and taken to Constantinople. Of that there can be no question. Nevertheless there is a strong argument that there has to be some kind of connection between the Shroud image and the Mandylion image, whatever its origin. I make no secret of my belief that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Christ, and bears his image. But I cannot suppose that Jesus was in the habit of regularly wiping his face with towels or veils and dropping his image on to them, as various legendary accounts would have it. It is not Jewish, it may even have been considered offensive, and it is certainly not scriptural. I believe there is only one time that it ever occurred, and that was in the tomb, however that may have been caused. Multiplying the occasions when it happened, are clearly derivative, and are merely pious attempts to explain the otherwise inexplicable of the one single proto image. Alternatively they are attempts to sanctify clearly derivative objects, such as icons. I have previously mentioned Markwardt’s theory that the Shroud was taken to Antioch and kept there. It makes a lot of sense to me, more than taking it to Alexandria as Charles would seem to have it. We know that Peter was first bishop of Antioch, and there is good indicative evidence that he held the burial cloths. Markwardt suggests that the hiding of the Shroud in a wall in Antioch for safe keeping when other relics were being pillaged or destroyed there, may be the true basis of the similar story from Edessa, Antioch, although often prone to earthquakes, and on the Orontes, could more likely have had a more conducive climate for the cloth’s survival in a wall than Edessa. He suggests that it was taken to Edessa only when Antioch was under threat from the Persian Chosroes. Arriving in Edessa, it was of course not stored in a wall but in the Hagia Sophia cathedral there. Accounts of stories often get garbled in the retelling, and there are always local agendas which like wonders to be self referential. Perhaps scribes have too limited an attention span to tell the full story of what they may hear. The truth of what actually happened is usually rather more complicated than the stories which emerge as the establishment tradition. This would be one reason why I believe Markwardt’s theory the more credible..","date":"2014-08-15","mins":"8:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/comment-promoted-looking-beyond-an-edessa-constantinople-route/","cat":"history","title":"Comment Promoted:  Looking Beyond an Edessa-Constantinople Route"},{"id":"comment-25426","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Gabriel, I’d like more confirmation before coming to your conclusion.

In this particular case, the face is presented on a landscape framed aspect, (a classic Mandylion presenation) and it is held by a cherub like figure, not by St Veronica. He mentions that he has studied some 3000 Breton Calvarys and none others have these features. The Atlas of Finistere crosses and Calvarys does not mention any other Calvary of this type.

However Gazay claims the Calvary dates from 1304 (his interpretation of the Romanized date inscription), and it can be clearly seen that in this depiction, the sculpture has been given a type of classic Mandylion presentation, facial image only, and landscape aspect within a solid frame, not what we would have expected if the sculptor had modeled it from what he might have seen from viewing the Shroud. This could argue that at this time the Shroud and what was thought to be the Mandylion, or a depiction of it, were in fact two separate objects. In his paper, Gazay has clearly brought into the Shroud and Mandylion being the one and the same object, but I don’t see that his argument necessarily follows. By blowing up Gazay’s photograph of the Calvary to 400%, I can persuade myself that the forehead may bear an epsilon mark as shown on a Shroud positive photo (not the 3 as per negative). Beyond 400%, there is too much graininess to discern it. If the Calvary is meant to be a depiction of the Mandylion, this would argue that the original of the Mandylion was in fact modelled at a very early time on the Shroud facial image. There are too many other correspondences between the Shroud facial image and the various iconic representations of Christ, to deny that the Shroud served at some time as the primal source of these various depictions, quite regardless of the controversy as to whether the Mandylion and Shroud were or were not the same object. The debate is irrelevant to this issue. As indicated in Dan’s posting, a higher standard of photography showing a clearer picture of the forehead is required to settle as to whether the epsilon is present or not..","date":"2013-02-22","mins":"5:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/22/david-rolfe-we-need-you/","cat":"history","title":"David Rolfe we need you"},{"id":"comment-25331","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A further thought on the Gazay Calvary: If the sculptor had seen both the Shroud face and a classic depiction of the Mandylion, he may have been struck by the similarities of the images and decided to amalgamate them, that is both the Mandylion face in a framed landscape aspect, and the forehead epsilon of the Shroud (but only assuming that it is in fact represented on the Calvary).

There may have been occasional revivals of it during bouts of iconoclasm. Gregarius may have believed the legend of Abgar, and that the Image of Edessa.predated the crucifixion, but more llikely he was mistaken. Nor does the DA blog deal adequately with the description of the cloth as ‘tetradiplon’, that it was a much larger cloth than was apparently visible in its normal display form – its presentation in landscape aspect.fits no normal artistic convention for such an object. Following earthquake damage to Edessa’s churches in 679 AD when the cloth was temporarily removed to Jerusalem, a French bishop Arculf reports seeing a ‘trial by fire’ on the sudarium at Jerusalem, The cloth is evidently about 8 feet long, but possibly doubled over. A major argument that the Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object, has to be the appearance of the Vignon markings on so many of the icons and coins from about 692 AD onwards. These markings, visibly only on the Shroud, were slavishly copied even when they made no other artistic sense. Any attempt to refute Wilson’s theory has to deal with this question, but the topic is not addressed at all. On the cloth’s first arrival in Constantinople in 944 AD, the emperor’s sons had difficulty discerning the image, and this seems to fit in with the faintness of the image visible on the Shroud. One further aspect is that the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople was marked by a general rejoicing, the institution of a major feast day observed annually throughout Orthodox Christianity, but no corresponding feast day for the arrival of the Shroud, a much more notable relic, which only seems to have become slowly manifest in Constantinople over a period of time, very likely when the Mandylion was removed from its framework. However the Byzantines were not about to give up on their precious Abgar legends, the stories which had become woven into their liturgies, and so the myth of the Mandylion as a separate object persisted..","date":"2012-06-23","mins":"5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-12956","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"No, I haven’t changed my mind either.

However I find myself unable to share his faith and confidence that this discipline will at present be able to “contribute with constructive criticism” and shed some light on the history of Shroud of Turin, which I think is a great pity. One would prefer to think that potentially it might be able to, as indeed several other disparate disciplines have contributed positive understandings of this relic. However there are few or even no signs that it can do so at present. Davor has categorised me as an adolescent sexagenarian, (which flatters my actual age), and has taken a solemn vow to ignore any of my subsequent postings. Other readers of this blog may judge for themselves whether his appelation is accurate or not. However I should like to hope that of such is the kingdom of heaven. I too can indulge in wishful thinking. At least I do not seek to be boring. His primary thesis is to create out of his imagination, and from his ivory tower cocoon, two categories, that of the exoheretic and endoheretic. His purpose in doing so seems to be create a protective mantle from the great mass of the unwashed for his own specialised discipline. He identifies himself as a “pompous and arrogant git”, which might very well be true, but this pathetic attempt at “false modesty” is in fact an inverted “ad hominem” argument, and simply won’t do. I think there is much for thought in his observation: “We, Christians, have once FORGOTTEN that there was a cloth, in some niche above some city gate, that bore Christ’s BLOOD.” There are of course many reasons for why this might have occurred: vigorous persecutions in the early Church; recurring bouts of iconoclasm; the known acquisitiveness of Byzantine emperors, even Constantine himself, and the obvious need for secrecy in preserving such a sacred relic from beng converted into the emperor’s pyjamas. It is little surprise that much has indeed been forgotten. The greater population of Europe for instance seems to have forgotten most of its Christian heritage, and this fault extends even to my own tiny country. However when we consider other disciplines, particularly in the hard sciences, major contributions have been made in our understanding of the Shroud. Medical forensics: Yves Delage, Paul Vignon, Pierre Barbet, David Willis have all contributed positive evidence. In Botany, even the primitive work of Max Frei identified pollen samples exclusive to the Dead Sea area, Palestine, Turkey, Greece, as well as the more ubiquitous Mediterranean species, and subsequent investigators have confirmed these findings. Textile specialists have affirmed contamination from cotton exclusive to the Middle East, that the linen has been manufactured in accordance with known ancient Syrian practices, that the cloth itself is exactly 8 x 2 Royal Syrian cubits, while other investigators such as Nitowski, believed that there is pursuasive evidence of Jerusalem aragonite limestone comtamination. In Chemistry one needs only mention the comprehensive studies carried out by Ray Rogers. Photography and modern space imaging technology have contributed to our understanding of the image. To all of this, Aslanovski and his brethren turn a blind eye. The best he himself can come up with is that there may or may have not been a first century burial cloth with an image of Christ crucified on it, or it may be a medieval scorch mark! This only emphasises the cloud cocoon of a singular disciplinary approach which grants little credit to other more scientific disciplines than the received wisdom of Byzantine art theology and its divine revelations. There is a single vacuum in our understanding of the Shroud, that is, its provenance and its history. Various investigators have attempted to fill this void in their own particular way. This has not satisfied the “true experts” who have abdicated from their responsibility in seeeking out an alternative that might satisfy. They have shown that they have nothing to offer. Nevertheless, the hard sciences have demonstrated that the authenticity of the Shroud is a credible proposition. To this, the Byzantine Art Historians say: “Sorry, we have nothing to offer!” Perhaps it does not matter that there is this void. The Shroud is here and now, for our own particular technological age to understand and make of it what we will. Perhaps it is indeed a love letter from Jesus, meant for our own time, a witness aganst a disbelieving age. Davor Aslanovski, may as he is so vowed to ignore my posting.

It is clear that he has no room in whatever he believes for the Shroud’s possible authenticity.

They are too complex to summarise easily here. About half the book comprises citations, notes and references. Nevertheless he is sparing in his acceptance of apocryphal source. For deciding what comes from Jesus as distinct from early Christian tradition he proposes five primary criteria: – 1. The criterion of embarrassment: Why invent what would invite difficulty for the early church? – 2. The criterion of discontinuity: Why reject as words or deeds of Jesus what cannot be derived from the Judaism of Jesus’ time or the early church? – 3. The criterion of multiple attestation: Is it more plausible to deny words, sayings, or deeds attributed to Jesus in more than one independent literary source (e.g., Mark, Q, Paul, and John) or literary genre (e.g., parable, miracle story, or prophecy)? – 4. The criterion of coherence: Given the claims to historicity from any of the above criteria, are different sayings or deeds evidently inconsistent? – 5. The criterion of rejection and execution: If Jesus’ ministry came to a violent, public end, what of Jesus’ words or deeds could have alienated people, especially powerful people? The criteria are to be used in tandem for mutual correction. Still, any claim is only to the probable, not the certain. I concur that the earliest assertion as to Mary’s perpetual viginity is the James Protevangelium ~145 AD, but it was not accepted as doctrine until very much later. It is also the source that asserts that Jesus’ siblings were from a previous marriage of Joseph. Meier rejects this on the basis that the Greek word used for sibling is “adelphos” rather than “anepsios”, implying a direct full sibling relationship. The James source is first mentioned by Origen in the early 3rd c. “which was of recent and dubious appearance”, sharing some common ground with the “Gospel of Peter”. It also asserts certain Jewish practices for which there is no other evidence. As I previously mentioned, I believe that adoption would be a credible alternative, would admit the term “adelphos”, and it would reflect the generous spirit of Mary and Joseph. Note that at Matthew 1:20, the Angel tells Joseph not to be afraid to take Mary his wife into his home. I see that as potentially undermining the traditionally accepted doctrine. I.e. Joseph may take Mary as his wife. Further comment on the distinctions between the individual gospels: When does Jesus become God? For Mark, it is when the Holy Spirit descends on him at his baptism by John in the Jordan; For Matthew and Luke it is at his conception; But for John, it is from the beginning, before time ever was. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God (distinct?) and the Word was God (identical?)” The mystery of the Trinity already!.","date":"2013-12-27","mins":"4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/25/did-jesus-talk-funny-and-when-was-he-born/","cat":"history","title":"Did Jesus Talk Funny and When Was He Born?"},{"id":"comment-69290","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Nevertheless, I believe I obtained some very valuable insights from Crossan’s “Power of Parable”, which I had not found elsewhere.

For a good historical perspective, I can only recommend John P Meier’s “A Marginal Jew”, specifically Vol 1, and also Pope Benedict XVI, “Jesus of Nazareth”. Meier sets a stringent discipline for himself, specifying some five criteria in his selection of facts he is prepared to accept. He concludes that Jesus was born about 7 6 BC, most probably in Nazareth, rather than Bethlehem, was baptised by John in 28, and accepts John’s version that he died on Preparation Day, making the year either 30 or 33 AD. He opts for Friday, April 7, 30 AD, at age about 36 years old. The Last Supper is to be seen as a farewell meal, rather than a Passover meal, although there are some calendrical variations that might allow it to be a Passover meal. In John’s scenario, the crucifixion occurs while the Paschal lambs are being ritually slaughtered at the Temple, making the timing particularly poignant. Meier considers that the brothers and sisters mentioned in Mark’s gospel are blood siblings rather than opting for other patristic explanations, the perpetual virginity of Mary being a late doctrine of the 4th century. I believe that adoption might offer an alternative explanation, as adoption was a widespread practice in those times, because of high mortality rates resulting in many orphans, and adoption conferred the same rights as birth under both Jewish and Roman law. We need to keep in mind that the gospels were not intended to represent history in the style of Josephus, notwithstanding that the gospels draw on actual historic events. Each one of the evangelists has his own agenda, with the intention of proclaiming Jesus variously as Messiah, the Son of Man (c.f. Daniel), and Lord. Raw Mark tends to tell the crude bare facts as he sees them, Matthew sees Jesus as the new Moses and is writing for a Syriac congregation, seeking to bring in Gentile elements, Luke has his own agenda and is most obviously anti Jewish, while John is more elevated, identifying Jesus as the timeless Son of God, and totally in control of his destiny. All of the evangelists have a most remarkable familiarity with the ancient scriptures which they use to an astonishing degree to bolster their message. I repeat, each of the evangelists has a specific agenda of proclaiming, and the message is more important than the literal text. Remember too, that Jesus was following a strong tradition of conveying his message in parables, and much of what we read in the gospels is itself intended as parable.

There are various highly suggestive references to linen cloths, both in the Acts of the Apostles, and also in Revelations. Shrouds are supposed to contain bodies, but there was no corpse to be found. Yet it evidently contained life blood, which ought to buried together with the body. Did they think the body might be found, and so save it? Or was the image a factor in the decision? There’s no direct mention of it, as it had to remain secret. What about the water marks, along one edge indicating that it was folded loosely concertina fashion and stored in an earthen jar similar to the storage of the Dead Se scrolls. There are no pat answers, and dogmatism in our state of ignorance is bound to lead us astray. Nothing is self evident! Change of topic: Nicodemus brought 100lbs of herbs and spices for the burial, 45kg. I don’t believe that all of it was spread around the walls of the tombs and implied above. What if the herbs and spices were packed in bags alongside the body? Would that have been a factor in producing the image? Is that the reason why there is no side view of the body, because the sides were masked by the spice bags? Or is there some other reason, why the image appears to be orthogonal, that is some kind of vertical emanation from either the earth or the body? Why vertical, instead of body normal?.","date":"2013-12-24","mins":"6:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/23/did-the-apostles-notice-an-image-on-the-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"Did the Apostles Notice an Image on the Cloth?"},{"id":"comment-66805","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Reference in Acts to (linen?) cloth and uncleanness: Check Acts 10:9:18.

I have heard of no traditions saying that the burial cloths were ever left in the tomb. On the contrary, there are a few traditions that others had them, including Peter, St Luke and P Ilate’s wife. If they were ever taken, it would seem unlikely they were ever returned to the tomb. On the other hand, given Eusebius’ reputation against imagery, would he have been likely to have specifically mentioned the images if the cloths had been there? Interestingly, it is Eusebius, who in his Ecclesiastical History, mentions his discovery of the Doctrine of Addai with its reference to Abgar V Ukkama in the archives of Edessa, but again he does not mention any reference to the portrait mentioned in later versions.

The principle was, in fact, invoked before Ockham by Durand de Saint Pourçain, a French Dominican theologian and philosopher of dubious orthodoxy, who used it to explain that abstraction is the apprehension of some real entity, such as an Aristotelian cognitive species, an active intellect, or a disposition, all of which he spurned as unnecessary. Durandus is primarily known for his opposition to the ideas of St Thomas Aquinas. Durandus’ attack on the teachings of Aquinas came at a time when Aquinas already was accepted as the official theological doctor of the Dominican order. Durandus taught that a philosopher should prefer the conclusions of his own reason to any authority except in articles of faith; the acceptance of truths of faith, on the other hand, did not depend on reason at all. This separation of reason and faith undermined the position of Scholastic philosophy generally, because much of it represented an attempt to bolster articles of faith by speculative reasoning. However as recently as Pope Benedict’s visit to the UK for the canonisation of John Henry Newman, he made it clear that both “Faith and Reason” were necessary, and condemned Faith without Reason as leading to fanaticism. What price Okham’s razor now? [Source for Durandus’ ideas – Encyc Brit article] In science, Nicole d’Oresme, a 14th century French physicist, invoked the law of economy, as did Galileo later, in defending the simplest hypothesis of the heavens. Other later scientists stated similar simplifying laws and principles. However in his search for simplicity, Galileo refused to accept Kepler’s discovery that the planets and other celestial bodies actually moved in ellipses rather than circles, his preferred Platonic and Ptolemaic idealistic approach which Galileo wished to retain. Newton’s discovery of the inverse square law of gravitation, following on from Kepler’s work, confirmed that the centripetal gravitation caused by large bodies, resulted in orbits of the various conic sections. Enough said, to demonstrate that Okham’s razor has limited utility and provides no infallible path to the truth!.","date":"2013-12-25","mins":"5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/23/did-the-apostles-notice-an-image-on-the-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"Did the Apostles Notice an Image on the Cloth?"},{"id":"comment-144403","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"No bones were found in the ossuary marked Jesus at Talpiot!

The present time is clearly inappropriate. With few exceptions, anyone involved in the testing and sampling does not come out of it at all well. Poor decisions were made throughout, and each seem to have had their own agenda. With this experience, it is only too plain that the objectivity of a proper scientific approach was abandoned, and it suggests that personal egos had too significant a role. The Shroud needs to be approached with a humility that is only too rare in the present climate, and that certainly seems to apply to the present scientific climate, if the 1988 experience is any indication. Anyone wishing to comment on any scientific testing of the Shroud should first read the 30 page paper “The setting for the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud” by Emanuela Marinelli, Valencia, April 2012. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf Sample extracts: [synopsis] “The method of radiocarbon dating, performed in 1988, placed the origin of the Shroud between 1260 and 1390 A.D.; but the reconstruction of the events that led to that analysis, and the controversy following its course, throw heavy shadows on the validity of the result. Not all the procedures followed for the completion of the radiocarbon test were regular. The history of the events and of the traumas suffered by the relic make it a difficult object, whose radiocarbon dating cannot provide reliable data. The analyzed sample, because of its peculiar characteristics, was not representative of the whole sheet. Consequently, according to the radiocarbon dating it cannot be definitely stated that the manufacture of the Shroud should be placed in the middle of the fourteenth century.” [Comments by Gove] ” … who emphasized seven points of difference from the original protocol of 1986: 1. The laboratories are reduced from seven to three. This eliminates the possibility of detecting a mistake made in the measurement by one or more of the three laboratories. Such mistakes are not unusual. 2. The use of the two dating methods has been reduced to one. 3. The amount of cloth that each laboratory will receive has been doubled. With this further material other laboratories could be included. 4. Representatives of the laboratories will not be allowed to observe the sampling. 5. The samples will not be unravelled, and thus that of the Shroud will be more easily identifiable. 6. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences was unaccountably excluded. 7. The acknowledged textile expert selected to remove the sample was replaced by an unnamed person.” [Gove continues] “… All these unnecessary and unexplained changes unilaterally dictated by the Archbishop of Turin will produce an age for the Turin Shroud which will be vastly less credible than that which could have been obtained if the original Turin Workshop protocol had been followed. Perhaps that is just what the Turin authorities intend.” And there’s much more in Marinelli’s paper!.","date":"2012-10-02","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/30/fascinating-account-of-a-2800-year-old-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"Fascinating Account of a 2800 Year-old Cloth"},{"id":"comment-17175","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I feel that with the background of the 1988 C14 tests, there would be concerns that any further testing of whatever kind, whether it be STURP II, C14, or anything else would make the controlling authorities reluctant to be involved in exposing the Shroud to any further acrimony.

Adherence to the Wilson theory still seems to be maintained by Daniel Scavone, and now more recently it seems by Mario Latendresse. Jack Markwardt had some years ago proposed that the burial cloths were taken to Antioch by St Peter, and had been kept there. He had proposed that Bishop Avercius had been given temporary custody around ~200 AD, that he had used it as some kind of visual aid for the conversion of the court of Abgar VIII at the king’s request, that this had led to the compilation of the tale of the Doctrine of Addai as an allegory by implicating his predecessor Abgar V Ukkama to conceal the conversion from the imperial court, and also the composition of the contemporary Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl, and that Avercius had then returned the Shroud to Antioch. Until recently, it had also been Markwardt’s belief that when Persian King Chosroes besieged Antioch in 544 AD, the recently discovered Shroud was then taken to Edessa, and he had accepted the Wilson hypothesis of it becoming the Mandylion. Markwardt has since radically revised this scenario by abandoning the Wilson hypothesis and asserting that Bishop Ephraimius took the Shroud to the safety of Cappadocia in Anatolia. Ephraimius died in 545 before he could recover the Shroud but only some nine years later a group of orthodox priests was parading an Image of Christ around Anatolia and it was the very first image to be called “acheiropoeitos”. He considers that this image was in fact the Shroud. It was soon taken to Constantinople and was variously referred to as the Image of Camuliana or the Image of God Incarnate. Markwardt presented his latest paper at a two hour special session at the St Louis conference in October 2014. “MODERN SCHOLARSHIP AND THE HISTORY OF THE TURIN SHROUD” http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf He provides very detailed arguments as to why the Mandylion theory should be rejected, as there seem to be too many inconsistencies with it, and he cites several historical authorities supporting such rejection. Pages 5 to 15 are dedicated to an evaluation of the Mandylion theory and give the objections which its proponents must deal with and answer before advancing their cause further. Apparently there was an exchange at the St Louis conference with Daniel Scavone who is one of the very few academic historians still prepared to accept it. Whether or not Scavone will eventually come around to a similar point of view as the majority of other academicians interested in the problem, time will tell. The whereabouts of the Shroud during its obscure years of 1204 to 1355 remain enigmatic, and of course various hypotheses have been proposed. Back in 2000, when Markwardt had been still prepared to accept the Mandylion theory, he had proposed that the unique Cathar crucifix with its Shroud like features suggested that the Albigensians in southern France, specifically Languedoc, had come into possession of it through contact with their Balkan coreligionists the Bogomil heretical sect. It was during this time that there was a general dramatic shift in the representations of crucifixes. Pope Innocent III had declared a crusade against the Albigensians, which threw the north of France against the south, destroying the Provencal civilisation, culminating in the Treaty of Paris 1229, and destroying the power of the southern princes, but not in exterminating the heresy. Many fled to Italy and their hierarchy faded out in the 1270s. It lingered on through the 14th century and finally disappeared in the 15th. If the Albigensians had the Shroud, then it was surely taken by the French crown and eventually awarded to the Charnay family “for services rendered” as later given out. This is only one of several hypotheses for the location of the Shroud during this period, but absent the Mandylion theory, and it may well be as true as any other such hypothesis..","date":"2015-08-04","mins":"10:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-207467","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"HF: ” … actual depictions of the cloth itself should at least pay some homage to verisimilitude.” As recently as the Valencia Conference 2012, Ian Wilson was still advocating his Mandylion theory. His paper is available on Barrie’s shroud.com site. It comprises a marvelous slide show with possibly the most comprehensive collection of representations of the Mandylion available. It also happens to include a number of 16th & 17th century painted copies of the Shroud. Wilson thereby demonstrates that artists painting direct from the Shroud believed that the eyes were open, and this would dispose of any objection that the Mandylion eyes were always shown as open. Certainly it would seem that the artists have not attempted to represent the herring bone weave on their copies of the Shroud, they merely painted their perception of the Shroud image on the particular cloth they used, in most cases probably just a plain weave. When we come to his collection of depictions of the Mandylion, all of which are clearly intended as deliberate art works according to the various contemporary styles, not one of them seemed to make any attempt whatsoever at representing the distinctive weave of the Shroud cloth. “Discovering more of the Shroud’s Early History”, Ian Wilson, Valencia 2012: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/wilsonvppt.pdf There are in particular two striking Shroud like facial images of Jesus dating from about the 7th century. The first of these is on a hammered silver vase, found among church ruins in the Syrian city of Homs, formerly Emesa, a late 6th century centre of Byzantine Christianity, this vase now being in the Louvre. The second Shroud like facial image is on a coin issued by Justinian II in 692, featuring a non suffering Pantocrator type image of Jesus with wide peering eyes, forked beard and uneven hair lengths. In 695, Justinian was deposed, his enemies cutting off his nose and sending him into exile. Upon his victorious return to Constantinople at the head of a foreign army some 10 years later, he apparently interpreted his earlier defeat on issuing coins in the Image of God Incarnate as a mark of divine disapproval, and henceforth the images of Christ on his coins displayed only non Pantocrator type images. It would therefore seem that a Shroud like image of Christ was known in Constantinople as early as 692, some 250 years before the Mandylion arrived there from Edessa, but very soon after the arrival of the acheiropoetios Image from Anatolia. Doubtless as an acknowledged art historian, De Wesselow was probably able to make his own particular contributions, but in many respects he seems mainly to be echoing Wilson. The objections to the Mandylion theory, such as those summarised in Markwardt’s paper, need to be dealt with by those advocating the theory.

It also seems that the Homs Vase Christ impression apparently from the sixth century might well predate both the coin and the icon. The coin image in my view, together with the Homs, has more of a Shroud likeness than even the Pantocrator.

I shall find it invaluable as a general resource. However I note that Grierson considers that the image of Christ on the 692 Justinian II solidus derives ultimately from the bust of the Phidian Zeus. His reference to the Pantocrator is a much later version in the dome of a cathedral ~1100 than that of St Catherine’s monastery. Possibly he considers that the Pantocrator is also based on the Zeus. I rather suspect that the historians are quite reluctant to recognise the possibility of the Shroud’s image being known at this time, and consequently are unlikely to attribute it as a source for iconic or numismatic imagery. St Catherine’s monastery was founded at the direction of Justinian I (527 565). The St C. Pantocrator had been previously believed to have been 13th c. Until the newer paint had been removed, and is now assigned to the 6th – 7th century. Whether it was sponsored by Justinian I or Justinian II therefore seems to me uncertain. Whether the Pantocrator was based on the Phidian Zeus or a known facial image of the Shroud might be debatable. To me the image of the 692 AD solidus looks much more like the Shroud image than it does to the Pantocrator. The features on the solidus seem to me to reflect the bruised distorted face of the Shroud than the triumphal aspect of Pantocrator. However the Homs vase Christ image would seem to be much earlier. I read (possibly from Markwardt) that Emesa was a thriving Byzantine Christian centre in the 6th century. On looking into references on Emesa, I discover that it was notably Christian even in the 4th century. So possibly the Homs vase might even be as early as this.

The principle source, possibly the only one known, is the description provided by a Catholic prelate, Lucas of Tuy, who confronted the Cathars in Leon after some who were seeking refuge settled there in 1218. He is also known as Lucas Tudense, Lucae Tudensis, and El Tudense. He authored the Chronicon Mundi, an update of St Isodore’s great chronicle, and was subsequently appointed bishop of Tuy in 1239. Quoting Markwardt: “Between 1229 and 1234, Lucas wrote “De Altera Vita, Adversus Albigensium Errores” (The Other Life, Against the Errors of the Albigensians) which detailed various Cathar tenets and religious practices and betrayed his own pathological hatred of heretics and Jews.” Markwardt acknowledges the “efforts of Paul C. Maloney, Vice President and General Projects Director of the ASSIST Investigations Group, in locating and reproducing this relatively forgotten work and the fine translation of its medieval Latin text by Mark Guscin.” In De Altera Vita, Lucas reports that the Cathars manufactured a most unusual crucifix. Briefly, Markwardt interprets Lucas’ description of it as comprising a vertical stake (but without patibulum), an inscription, and a footrest; that Christ was attached to it with only three nails with but a single nail through his crossed feet; that Christ was pierced in his left side by a Roman lance; and that He was hung from a crux simplex with his arms extended above his head, and hands or wrists nailed to the upright stipes. This is most peculiar. First, the Cathars denied the reality of the Incarnation, repudiating Christ’s human nature, and claimed that neither his death nor resurrection had been a physical reality; Second, they held relics and religious images in low esteem; Third, having manufactured a crucifix they departed from ancient crucifixion traditions dictating the shape of the cross, the number of nails, and the location of the lance wound. Furthermore, given their rejection of the Eucharist and the Mass, the Cathars should not have claimed to possess Christ’s transubstantiated body, and yet they did invite the leader of the Albigensian Crusade to see the body of Christ that had become flesh and blood in the hands of their priest. Markwardt endeavours to resolve these anomalies by proposing a set of Sindonic Solutions, that, following the disappearance of the Shroud from Constantinople, it came into the hands of the Cathars through their coreligionists the Bogomils, creating a crisis forcing the Cathars to face the reality of the crucifixion. Barbet of course interpreted the blood stained feet of the Shroud as having been crossed and fastened with but a single nail, but the Cathars failed to recognise that the Shroud imprint was a mirror image and hence claimed the lance wound as being in the left side, and furthermore they were persuaded that his hands were nailed above his head. If in fact the Cathars had been in possession of the Shroud and had held it in the region of Languedoc (the main area of their population), after being forfeited to the Crown, it would then be properly assigned to the Charny family. In a footnote, Markwardt observes: “In the Spring of 1349, Charny’s royal annuity was modified to include the first forfeitures that might occur in the Languedoc senechaussees of Toulouse, Beaucaire, and Carcassonne. This grant is preserved in the Archives Nationales JJ77 #395, folio 245 and is hand copied in the Wuenschel Collection.

Was he a victim of his own self deception? It seems remarkable that the Cathars should manufacture any holy object, even a crucifix, given their particular neo Manichean dualistic beliefs. Are Lucas’ description of it having three nails only, and a left side side wound sufficiently circumstantial to be indicative of Cathar possession of the Shroud? Whence could Lucas get such an idea if it wasn’t so in fact? The Shroud blood flows on the arms, might suggest to the medically uninformed that the arms were fastened above the head. But it is interesting that the Charny family were assigned first forfeitures from Languedoc as of 1349.

Briefly, Eusebius describes it as an exchange of letters between Jesus and Abgar V Ukkama, but makes no mention of a towel bearing an image of Jesus. Eusebius did not like icons and so it is possible his omission may have been deliberate, or else it was not part of the original story. The story itself is quite improbable if interpreted literally, however there must have been some reason for composing the story and entering it into the archives. The most likely explanation seems to be that it was composed as an allegory to conceal a secret, and that secret was the conversion of the court of King Abgar VIII the Great around 200 AD. The reason for keeping it secret was that the tolerant emperor Commodus had been deposed and was succeeded by a despotic emperor Septimus Severus and persecution of Christianity had resumed. Abgar VIII had previously displeased Rome, had been sent into exile, but had recently been reinstated. He would not want to upset the emperor again. The story of the conversion was then composed as a coded allegory involving his predecessor Abgar V and Jesus, rather than himself and Pope Eleutherius. St Peter had probably taken the burial cloths to Antioch. It is possible that they were used to assist the conversion of the Edessan court, and then returned again to Antioch. This may have provided the opportunity to compose the Mandylion “in choice colours”, and at some time a story of the imprint of Jesus was included in the legend. Also at this time, the Edessan poet Bardesan composed the Hymn of the Pearl, which suggests that he had very likely seen the full Shroud image. Both the Shroud and Mandylion were concealed at various times depending on the political climate of Christian persecution, Persian invasion, or confiscation of church treasures to be rediscovered in subsequent years. Possibly copies were made. At various times Byzantine iconoclasm played a part, some icons being destroyed unless they were hidden, Around 540 AD the Persian king Chosroes I, attacked and destroyed Antioch. If the Shroud was in Antioch at this time, it was taken away for safety, either to Edessa, or more likely to Cappadocia. The religious situation was also complex at this time, including such heretics as Gnostics, Arians, Docetists, Nestorians and others. At various time some of these seemed to have had possession of the Mandylion or the Shroud. I recommend the following two papers by Markwardt, which cover this period: “Antioch and the Shroud”, Markwardt 1998, Dallas Conference, http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf “Ancient Edessa And The Shroud: History Concealed By The Discipline Of The Secret” Markwardt 2008, Ohio Conference, http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf These two papers should be read in conjunction with his 2014 St Louis paper. Note that at the time of the 1998 and 2008 papers, Markwardt had supported the Mandylion theory, and this is reflected in these papers.

It accounts for the circlet type of crown seen on various western art works of Christ wearing such a crown. The type of crown worn by various eastern monarchs was more like a type of helmet, such as seen on coins issued under Abgar VIII the Great of Edessa for instance. The head wounds evident on the Shroud image, would indicate that the actual crown worn by the TSM matches the helmet type of crown. It is one small argument for the Shroud’s authenticity, as a western origin for the image would be more likely to reflect a circlet in the pattern of the head wounds.

The coin is of course Byzantine and not Syrian nor Edessan. It bears a striking resemblance to the Shroud facial image. In 1998, Wilson first mentioned the Homs vase (The Blood and the Shroud, Free Press, 1998, p. 141) in support of his Mandylion theory. He stated that it was “a silver vase discovered at Homs, the ancient Emesa, in Syria”. He failed to mention that, in the 6th century, Emesa was a Byzantine, rather than a Syrian city. This omission therefore creates an impression of unjustifiably identifying the vase with the Image of Edessa. Emesa is well to the south of both Antioch and Edessa, and perhaps because of this a misperception can easily be made. Christians were slow to settle in Emesa because of the strength of the sun god cult there. A Semi Arian, Eusebius of Emesa, a friend of Constantius II was appointed bishop in 339, but because of his unorthodoxy the Emesan inhabitants expelled him. An orthodox bishop Silvanus was executed by Julian the Apostate in about 361 and the Christian basilica was for a short time made a shrine to Bacchus. Another 4th century bishop Nemesius is the author of an extremely important work “On the Nature of Man, the first known compendium of theological anthropology with a Christian orientation. The treatise considerably influenced later Byzantine and medieval Latin philosophical theology. By the 5th century Byzantine Christianity was well established and it became an important Byzantine centre for Eastern Christianity. The emperor Heraclius was obliged to abandon the city to Rashidun Muslims following the decisive Battle of Yarmouk in 636. So for some 300 years then, Emesa was a centre of Byzantine Christianity. The Homs vase must date from within this window, and it is therefore definitely Byzantine. In his 1998 book, Wilson first mentioned the St. Catherine Pantocrator icon (p. 159), dating it to the 6th century, but, here again, he failed to mention that this Sinai monastery was founded by Justinian I and that, therefore, the icon is undoubtedly Byzantine, and not Edessan, in origin. Historians, unfamiliar with the Shroud likeness or unwilling to ascribe it as a source of the imagery, are prone to attribute the images of the Pantocrator and the Justinian II 692 solidus to the Phidias Zeus, an impressive 13 m high statue. Images of the statue are easily found on the web, and those more familiar with the Shroud image will be unimpressed by such a claim. In 2010, Wilson noted how Justinian II, after 705, issued coins bearing a non Pantocrator Christ face, but he then boldly asserted, with no historical support, that these later coins were “almost certainly” based upon the Image of Camuliana, while the earlier coins were based upon the image of the Shroud that could be found upon the Image of Edessa (The Shroud, Bantam Press, pp. 151 152). He also again mentioned both the St. Catherine Pantocrator icon and “the silver vase that was found in Homs in Syria” (p. 135). There is no basis whatsoever for attributing the 705 solidus to the Image of Camuliana, in fact it is more likely to have been based on a Syrian origin (Grierson). A likely explanation is that the superstitious Justinian II, having faced a series of earlier defeats, had decided that representations of the Image of God Incarnate on his coinage had met with divine disapproval, and hence changed the image of Christ to one that more closely reflected his human nature. The Image of Edessa probably first came to imperial notice in 787 when iconophiles at the Second Council of Nicea raised it to celebrity status by claiming it as a proven palladium that could save a city from conquest. Imperial desires to expropriate the relic were realised in 943 when John Curcuas succeeded in negotiating an agreement with the Islamic authorities. Until the arrival of the Mandylion at Constantinople on 15 August 944, and its inspection by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, there seems to be no reason why the Byzantines should have had any prior knowledge of the likeness of the icon. Nevertheless there are at least three primary Byzantine images of Christ of the 6th and 7th centuries which may be seen as close likenesses to the Shroud image and which predate the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople: the St Catherine’s Pantocrator, the 692 solidus, and the Homs vase. Wilson’s perplexing association of these artefacts with the Image of Edessa, effectively drew attention away from both the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, where the Image of God Incarnate had been present from at least 574, and also from the Byzantine province of Cappadocia where this same image had been present from at least 554. I hope that this brief summary may dispose of any doubts concerning the weaknesses in the Mandylion theory proposed by Wilson and subsequently by De Wesselow..","date":"2015-08-08","mins":"7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-207773","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Following your suggestion, I have “trawled” through a series of images for ancient crowns. I conclude that a helmet type is not as disproportionately small as you assert. There is considerable variation in the styles. They were quite often modeled on the pileus. Searches on ancient types of Assyrian, Egyptian, Persian and Indian crowns quite often show this type. In some cases it comprises a circlet but surmounted by 4 to 8 overarching arms to the specific regal symbol atop, usually with some type of fitted satin cap. Ancient Greek crowns seem to have been of the circlet type; Roman types were usually worked in the form of a laurel wreath circlet. Of the crown of thorns, St Vincent of Lerins (d. 445) states (Sermo in Parasceve): “They placed on his head a crown of thorns; it was, in fact, in the shape of a pileus, so that it touched and covered His head in every part.” (cited by Barbet). Barbet also comments that the Notre Dame “crown of thorns” that St Louis obtained from the Venetians in pledge for a loan, is actually a circlet made from plaited rushes, and that ancient authors from the time of Gregory of Tours have said that the crown was made of sea rushes, which in the immediate environment of Jerusalem would seem a little peculiar. However if this circlet crown is at all genuine, then it was clearly intended to hold the thorns on the head. The wounds and blood stains on the head of the TSM are highly significant and are not as incidental as suggested in your previous comment. They are a significant pointer to the identity of the TSM, as Jesus of Nazareth is the only crucifixion victim recorded as having been inflicted with the gratuitous and unusual punishment of a crown of thorns..","date":"2015-08-08","mins":"4:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-207767","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Louis, this crown is of course the traditional circlet.

Barbet thinks not, and evidently believes it was more like a pileus, and quotes St Vincent of Lerins in support. He also considers that the relic at Notre Dame in the shape if a circlet cannot be the crown of thorns, as it is made of rushes, and if it’s at all authentic, then it’s only use could have been to hold the thorns on the head. Or did those naughty Venetians weave it themselves making up a story to get their loan from St Louis. Would they do that? Who knows? Both Matthew and John are building on Mark’s narrative for their own particular story of the Passion. If Mark chose the wrong word, then it would be carried through to Mt & Jn.

Note that Wilson claimed that the full length image that he supposes was on the Mandylion only came to light sometime after the Mandylion’s arrival at Constantinople in 944 AD. A somewhat similar reference is found in a text by Pope Stephen III ca 769 AD. Both references reflect an earlier memory of a full length image, already in Constantinople, but which had been hidden away, and which had now been erroneously attributed to the Edessa image. Both Wilson and De Wesselow seemed to accept these texts at face value without penetrating any further. This confusion is addressd in Markwardt’s 2014 St Louis paper: “Modern Scholarship And The History Of The Turin Shroud”: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf See Chapter ‘The Blurring Of Image Texts’ p.53 at seq. Markwardt addresses the reason why the full length image in Constantinople had been hidden away in his chapter ‘The Imperial Covenant With God’ pp.48 52. The source is contained in a document known as the Tarragon manuscript, and refers to an imaged linen cloth which was always kept in a golden case and very carefully locked up. The ms describes how a series of continuous earthquakes threatened the city, and how a heavenly vision revealed that the city would not be freed from the quakes until the sacred linen was locked away far from human eyes. And so it was done and the earthquakes stopped. “From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake.” This cloth cannot have been the Mandylion, which was often displayed to many persons on several occasions, both in Edessa and in Constantinople. There was only one other known such cloth in Constantinople, the ‘Image of God Incarnate’ and it follows that this was the cloth that had been locked away. This series of continuous quakes must be identified with those commencing on Oct 26, 740 and they continued for the next 12 months. The emperor Constantine V interpreted the quakes as a divine sign that the Image of God Incarnate should not be viewed nor used for any imperial purpose, sealed it away in a golden case, and coincidentally the quakes ceased. This Covenant with God effectively consigned the Shroud to four and a half centuries of complete obscurity. There remained the memory of the full length body image, but it became erroneously associated with the Mandylion. Only the emperor was permitted to open the golden case and view the image. In his youth, King Bela III of Hungary was educated at the Byzantine court and for a time was betrothed to the emperor’s daughter. As heir designate he would have been permitted to view the image, and this may have enabled the Shroud like illustrations in the Pray manuscript, following his being crowned king of Hungary in 1173. The Imperial Covenant with God was eventually broken by Alexios III Angelos (1195 1203) probably in 1201. This is evident in a statement by Nicholas Mesarites referring to reenactments of the resurrection at the Pharos chapel involving the sindon that had wrapped the mysterious naked body after the Passion. Robert de Clari of course refers to a similar reenactment at the Blachernae church in 1204. For the full story you need to refer to the Markwardt paper. The Mandylion theory espoused by Wilson, and more latterly by De Wesselow has found many objections from historians aware of its defects, and they rightly complain that it has obscured more fruitful lines of enquiry. However there has been a considerable authenticist intellectual investment in the theory, and many are still reluctant to abandon it. I consider that Markwardt’s research has made a major contribution towards getting closer to the real truth of the history of the Shroud as the real burial cloth of Christ..","date":"2015-08-09","mins":"4:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-207823","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh, what a magnificent Grand Opus, It will be a major reference source for everyone interested in the Mandylion for many years to come.

There are several aspects which one could comment on, but I’ll contain myself to only a few observations. His suggestion that storage in the Gates of the Cherubim at Antioch, is very likely the basis of the story that the cloth was found in the Gates at Edessa has the ring of truth. We can only speculate what Bishop Abraham may have been told by the Edessans, it was no doubt second or third hand and very likely whatever was said became subject to the usual “Chinese whispers” variations; Add some court embroidery and the Byzantine story requires some skilful penetration to discover what truth one might find. I note that Mr Markwardt draws on the Syriac poem, Hymn of the Pearl, compiled at or near Edessa ~200 – 224 AD, and it seems fairly conclusive that the particular verses in question can only refer to the complete Shroud image! Clearly the full image must have been known at least to a select few in Antioch or even Edessa as early as 224 AD. Prior to the destruction of Antioch ~540, the cloth was taken from Antioch to Edessa, in whatever form it had at that time. In the Byzantine story, we are told that the Edessans attempted to pass off two false cloths (a copy made for the “Persian affair” and another worshipped in the Nestorian church). THESE WERE GIVEN BACK, ONLY THE ONE WHICH WAS THE TRUE ARTICLE WAS RETAINED. I suppose it is possible that there may have been a few other ancillary cloths in Abraham’s package, possibly including even the Sudarium of Oviedo. However we have the situation where the Shroud is housed at Edessa, a city which is subsequently destroyed, but that Bishop Abraham is now satisfied that he has the true cloth. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the cloth in Abraham’s possession is in fact the Shroud, in whatever form it had at the time. The only other possible conclusion is that the Antiochenes took the Shroud to some other city, for it to emerge in Constantinople at some later date, and that Abraham had some other cloth in his possession, which all in all seems a fairly unlikely proposition. There seems to be more to Ian Wilson’s hypothesis that the Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object, than Yannick Clement seems prepared to concede. The “Discipline of the Secret” is also an intriguing topic, which is also raised in Rev Dreisbach’s Atlanta 2005 paper, “Lazarus and Jesus” dealing with the Shroud during apostolic times, but which of course needs to rely on more speculation and less historical substantiation than Mr Markwardt has been able to bring to his own paper. We also see something of this discipline in apocalyptic works such as John’s Revelations. Regardless of any particular lack in detailed accuracy of Ian Wilson’s work, I believe Wilson has done more than anyone else to bring awareness of the Shroud into the public domain, possibly with only one or two exceptions; he had to work within the limits of material available to him, and I think it discourteous at best for his work to be denigrated in the way that it has been on this site on occasion. All in all, I believe we are getting closer and closer to a detailed knowledge of the early history of this wonderful artifact, the Love Letter of Jesus to Humanity in our milllenium..","date":"2012-04-29","mins":"10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/history-done-right/","cat":"history","title":"History Done Right."},{"id":"comment-42347","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I read both postings.

If it’s not a forgery, then you have to understand a few things about pseudo epigrapha in order to comment on them. In the first and second centuries, any Christian or heretic could write what they wanted, as there were no ecclesiastical controls before a movement towards canonicity became established. The Gnostic movement under Marcion and Valentinus was particularly active in this, and was roundly condemned by Iraeneus. Other Christian apocrypha sought to resolve certain conflicts, or were highly inventive to express certain theological points. For example, one notorious writing has two mid wives at Jesus’ birth expressing amazement that Mary was still a technical virgin (presumably intact hymen) in order to confirm the doctrine of the virginal birth, and reflecting the cultural context of the time. One mid wife puts her hand in and it withers as a punishment for this impertinence.

But it is relatively easy for modern forgers to acquire ancient papyrus, and then use it to manufacture evidence of “startling new ancient texts”. The present owner is said to wish to remain anonymous but it is interesting that there are also reports that he wishes to sell it. In the meantime he seems to have granted permission for Harvard to hold the fragment so it can be tested and examined by scholars. Non destructive tests are proceeding on the ink to see if it can be identified as authentic or not. There are comments from some experts who claim that it appears to be genuine while others are not so sure. Karen King is Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard, a highly pretigious posting; She is not an archaeologist, but a BA & Ph D in Religious Studies, and was asked to examine the fragment by the owner. She seems to have been associated with some feminist trends in Religious Studies, and I also note that she has also worked with Elaine Pagels who wrote controversially on Gnostic Studies a few decades ago. She has submitted a draft report for initial publication: “Jesus said to them, ‘My wife…’” A New Coptic Gospel Papyrus, by Karen L. King with contributions by Anne Marie Luijendijk. For those who wish to follow it up for more information, PDF can be found at: http://news.hds.harvard.edu/files/King Jesus Said To Them draft 0917.pdf There is considerable information in the paper about the fragment, what is known of its provenance, a translation and an extensive commentary with footnotes and citations. The fragment is said to have been written in the fourth century, the scribal work is inferior, is suggested that it is a copy of an earlier Greek work from mid 2nd C, and appears to have connections with both the Gnostic Gospels of Thomas and of Phillip. King has used the appelation “gospel” only to identify the fragment as a means of describing it. If the fragment is proved to be authentic, that is 4th C, then it might be interpreted as reflecting a possible conflict within a particular gnostic sect as to the merits of celibacy versus marriage. This conflict was also apparent within early Christian orthodoxy, because of the early expectation of the Parousia. Paul himself although allowing marriage, seems to have considered celibacy a better life option. By asserting that Jesus himself was married, the original author whoever it might have been, would be attempting to make a claim to validate marriage within his sect. The general consensus among scholars is that Jesus did remain celibate, the lack of any reference to a wife itself being strong negative evidence of this. By following the various links in the original posting above, you can come across some rather cute witticisms about Jesus being married, sample comments: “I can’t take you anywhere; we go to the temple and you topple the tables”; “So you’re a carpenter; then fix up the kitchen cupboards!” Etc..","date":"2012-09-20","mins":"2:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/19/hot-new-topic-the-wife-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Hot New Topic: The Wife of Jesus"},{"id":"comment-10872","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The quoted verses certainly appear to relate to a Shroud like image, not merely a facial image as shown on the Mandylion. It follows that the Shroud image was very likely known by a select few in Edessa, as the Hymn of the Pearl is asserted to have been written in Edessa. In my opinion, Scavone makes a strong alternative case for the Shroud to have been kept at Antioch, where the first Jewish Christians became strongly established after 68 AD. Prior to the destruction of Antioch he says it was taken to Edessa, and there are strong literary parallels between the Shroud being kept hidden at the gates of the Cherubim at Antioch and the story connecting the discovery of the Edessa image in the gate at Edessa. Following the death of Abgar, his heirs returned to paganism, although the earliest Christian church in Edessa was ~200 AD. Scavone’s hypothesis is that with this return to paganism, the Shroud was temporarily returned to Antioch, which explains why there is no recollection of the image in Edessa during the visit of Egeria. Frankly I don’t give a fig for any dogmatic assertions about whether the Mandyion and Shroud were one and the same object or not, regardless of who makes them.

It was removed from the Lirey Church by Margaret and her second husband Humbert for safe keeping in 1418 and duly receipted, as it was plain that in this small village church, it was a vulnerable target from the English, marauding Jacquerie, and various acquisitive clergy jealous of its pilgrim attractiveness, and various French officials. From 1418 Margaret and Humbert held annual expositions on the banks of the Doubs River and additional displays elsewhere, Liege 1449, Macon 1452. It seems that the Savoys had expressed an interest in purchasing it, and political conditions in France remained uneasy. Despite two marriages Margaret remained childless and with increasing age likely felt the weight of responsibility in ensuring an ultimate secure home for her precious relic. In 1452 she finally decided that the safest haven for it was with the House of Savoy who compensated her with the castle and estates. The canons of Lirey continued to agitate for its return, and in 1457 Margaret was threatened with excommunication if she did not return it as previously agreed by Humbert. Duke Louis of Savoy negotiated compensation to the Lirey canons. Margaret died soon afterwards in 1460. What might have become of the Shroud if she had decided otherwise and it had stayed in France?

It prompted me to check out a few demographic comparisons. Australia is somewhat similar to USA, although Baptists do not figure so prominently. Catholics are about 25% of the Australian population, as with USA. Part of this may be due to a heritage of England trasnportation of Irish convicts and the discriminatory laws during the early colonial era. In USA it has been sustained by Mexican/Spanish immigration. Judaism in USA is about 1.7% of the total population, with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. In Australia the 2006 census reported Judaism as only 0.3% of the population. The situation in NZ is quite different. A now nominally secular society, Catholicism was stable at about 14% of the total population for several decades. It had about the third or fourth largest following of the Christian denominations, after Anglican (= Episcopalian) and Presbyterianism (Scottish immigration). Methodism (= Wesleyanism / Welsh) also featured. The latest censuses quote Catholicism in NZ at about 12.3% of the total population, but it now has the second largest following after the Anglicans. Some of this is due to immigration from the Philippines and other SE Asia or Pacific countries. Judaism in NZ is minuscule compared to Australia and USA. About 3,800 claimed to be of the Jewish faith in the latest census, in a population of about 4,000,000, i.e. Less than 0.1%. Some writers have claimed that up to about 10,000 N Zers may be Jewish. As elsewhere, both Jews and Catholics are more prominent and influential in public affairs than their numbers would indicate – they both pull beyond their weight. There have been about two or three Jewish Prime Ministers of NZ, one of whom converted to Christianity. The present Prime Minister, John Key had a Jewish mother, but he claims to be agnostic.

The linguistic evolution from “Abgar” to the “Arthur” of the Grail legends would seem plain enough. There is also the Glastonbury legend with its connection to Joseph of Arimathaea. It is Markardt’s contention that the apostle Peter took the various Passion relics to Antioch, including the Shroud, and his papers on this have been discussed at various times. In 1098 crusaders captured the city of Antioch and claimed to have discovered the hiding place of the Holy Lance of Longinus. Curiously another artefact which might well be the true Grail was discovered there as recently as 1910. “In 1910, local Arabs unearthed, at the traditional site of Antioch’s ancient cathedral,42 a silver chalice comprised of an unfinished inner cup and a finished outer holder, akin to a reliquary, exquisitely decorated with ten human figures, in two groups of five.43 Professor William Newbold has noted that only in the middle of the first century did two groups of five men each govern the respective Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch and only at such time would a Christian religious object have displayed such a depiction.44 Dated to the first century and considered genuine by many archeological and scientific authorities,45 the Great Chalice of Antioch has been called “a most sacred Cup, in all probability the one which once served the Lord and his disciples at the Last Supper, the most precious object in Christian history, legend and tradition”.46 ” “Antioch and the Shroud”, p.4, Markwardt, 1998 99. The numbered references include citing of Eisen, Gustavus A., The Great Chalice of Antioch, Kouchakji Freres (New York 1923). In a separate paper, Markwardt has also proposed an alternative 1204 – 1355 route from Constantinople to Western Europe. He considers that the Cathar Crucifix may have originated as a result of the Shroud coming into the possession of the Albigensians at Languedoc in Southern France, through their connections with the Balkan Bogomils sect, which had similar doctrines. In the early 14th century the Cathars were suppressed, and subsequently Geoffrey I de Charnay acquired the Shroud pursuant to a royal grant.

My preferred position is essentially one of neutrality, in that I continue to be open to the possibility that Talpiot may have been the last repository of the Jesus family ossuaries. Certainly, no one can be in a position to assert it as such. The allegation that the Mariamne/Mara ossuary is that of Mary Magdalen, seems mainly to rest on the 3rd century Valentinian Gnostic gospel of Philip, where she is named a favoured companion of Jesus, hardly a persuasive source. I would suspect that the author’s purpose might simply be to ratify marriage as a legitimate lifestyle, unless he had a more lurid intent. I understand that this ossuary is unusually ornate and the inscription, unlike the others, is in Greek, clearly setting it apart from the others. Charles Pellegrino has adopted a much more cautious approach in his assertions than has Jacobovice. He considers that any ossuaries at the Holy Sepulchre site would have been moved from there in about 40 AD, when the city walls were extended, so that any claim for Talpiot does not compromise Holy Sepulchre as the original burial site. He also believes that no skeleton was ever placed in the Jesus ossuary, which he claims only contained a small carpal bone and cloth fragments. The name “Jesus(?) son of Joseph” is apparently preceded by a cross mark. Pellegrino’s response to critics is: “If nothing else but an ossuary inscribed with the words ‘Jesus, son of Joseph’ were found in a tomb, bearing fibre evidence indicative of a missing body and two apparently sacred cloths, if these are indeed the two cloths described in John’s gospel, with a cross mark attached to Jesus’ name, and a star on the lid – and if the antechamber bore a symbol known to the Jesuit order to this day as a glyph, translated as ‘Jesus Saviour of man’ – – if nothing else had been found, we would all be crazy not to look on with a sense of mystery and wonder.” We may interpret this how we may. Other acceptable explanations for the oddities in the chamber are easily found. For example the “Judah son of Jesus” might be explained by adoption, but passed off as a brother for his own protection. Conceivably he may have been the disciple described in John’s gospel as the disciple whom Jesus loved. The various names are listed in Mark 6:3 “Is he not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” The statistics I used for my Monte Carlo simulation were the Rahmani statistics of 286 names appearing on 231 ossuaries in a population of 917, some 686 being uninscribed. Witherington also gives a fairly similar proportion of names in the Jewish population of the time. Following Meier’s lead, I would have no problem with the brothers and sisters being directly related, although adoption would protect the doctrine of perpetual virginity, if that were an objection. I find the unusual combination of names a little too significant to ignore. Sadly the matter has now been too badly handled, for any satisfactory conclusion ever to be made..","date":"2013-12-29","mins":"4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/28/it-continues-james-son-of-joseph-brother-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"It Continues:  James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus"},{"id":"comment-69713","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, thank you for the reference to your paper, which I have now down loaded, read, and found most informative.

However I think that the status of the Talpiot tomb still remains ambiguous, because of the way the whole business was mishandled. It seems strange that the ultra orthodox interference of archaeological investigations is tolerated by those in authority, and security at such sites seem unduly lax. Consequently we remain seldom the wiser as to what such sites might have actually revealed, and entrenched positions persist as the accepted wisdom without amendment. Based on the observed frequency of names on ossuaries, I ran a number of Monte Carlo simulations of 1000 runs each. Even based on variations of the same names, the best I could achieve was six runs in a 1000 of four qualifying names (Mary, Joseph, Jesus, & [Jude or Matthew]).

The track is further compromised by the early Christians need for secrecy, and their systematic use of obscurity for protection against persecution, particularly of such items they deemed important or valuable. He gives a credible explanation for the concoction of the Abgar legend, believing it to be an allegory to record the conversion of the court of Abgar VIII the Great, but so written to conceal the true facts from imperial authority. He suggests that Bishop Avercius Marcellus was given temporary custody of the Shroud to assist in this conversion, and that the contemporaneous Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl composed in Edessa, together with the epitaph inscription of Avercius reflect this occasion. Other evidence is also mustered to support his argument. When Antioch was about to be destroyed by Chosroes’ Persian invasion ~540 AD, the relics were taken to Edessa, which had by then become a major centre of Syriac Christianity of diverse beliefs and practices. The contemporary legend of the image’s discovery in a wall at Edessa would seem to be an adaptation of an event that actually occurred in Antioch, merely to explain its emergence in Edessa.

I am surmising that this may refer to an early quote in the paper, where he quotes Athanasius of Alexandria, ca 328 373, who affirmed that a sacred Christ icon, traceable to Jerusalem and the year 68, was then present in Syria. His source for the Athanasius quote is the original Latin as given in Dobschutz. “…but two years before Titus and Vespasian sacked the city, the faithful and disciples of Christ were warned by the Holy Spirit to depart from the city and go to the kingdom of King Agrippa, because at that time Agrippa was a Roman ally. Leaving the city, they went to his regions and carried everything relating to our faith. At that time even the icon with certain other ecclesiastical objects were moved and they today still remain in Syria. I possess this information as handed down to me from my migrating parents and by hereditary right. It is plain and certain why the icon of our holy Lord and Savior came from Judaea to Syria.” The Latin referring to the icon as given by Dobschutz is: “Quo tempore etiam icona com ceteris rebus ecclesiasticis deportata usque hodie in Syria permansit.” and “haec certa et manifesta ratio est de icona sancta domini salvatoris, qualiter de Judea in Syria partes devenit.” Allowing that there is no definite article in Latin, and that the cult of icons had yet to develop to any great extent, and that Old Testament prohibition on images was probably still influential in that region in 68 AD, I am wondering what specific object you might suppose was in Athanasius’ mind as the references to “etiam icona” and “icona sancta domini salvatoris” ?

The particular verse has been a little contentious. Why would Paul be concerned about a cloak for himself when he could easily obtain one for himself in Rome? Or is he concerned that Timothy have a cloak for his journey? How come Paul has been in possession of the Shroud, if that is what is claimed, when it is far more likely to have been in Peter’s possession; And why would he leave it behind with a mate in Troy of all places; even it was at all credible that he was using it as a visual aid for his missionary work? It would seem most unlikely that the other apostles would permit him to do this? [It has been asserted that Bishop Marcellus Avercius of Hieropolis was permitted to use it for this purpose for the conversion of King Abgar VIII’s (the Great) court in Edessa around 185 AD, before returning it to Antioch where it was kept.] The authenticity of II Timothy is uncertain. My JB Introduction to the Pauline epistles acknowledges that some assert it as pseudonymous. Encyc Brit says it is likely pseudonymous thus: “The studies, utilizing computer technology, point toward non Pauline authorship with affinities to language and style of a later, possibly 2nd century, date. More refined and complex analyses, however, are still needed. Linguistic facts such as short connectives, particles, and other syntactical peculiarities; use of different words for the same things; and repeated unusual phrases otherwise not used in Paul offer fairly conclusive evidence against Pauline authorship and authenticity.” If based on II Timothy, then the argument that Paul had the Shroud would seem fairly weak..","date":"2014-05-19","mins":"6:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/14/jesus-long-hair-again-and-again-and-again/","cat":"history","title":"Jesus’ Long Hair Again and Again and Again"},{"id":"comment-121746","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max: Authorship of II Timothy: Paul, brought up in Tarsus, possibly studied under Stoics there, admittedly Jewish parentage (forebears had served in Roman army, granted Roman citizenship), Greek possibly more natural to him than Hebrew, granted he had joined the Pharisee party; Timothy, born Lystra, Lycaonia; Paul had circumcised him out of respect for his Jewish mother and to enable him to preach among Jewish communities.

Author of this section may have included the following: The Rev. Krister Stendahl: Bishop of Stockholm, 1984 88. Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Divinity, Harvard University, 1981 84; Dean, Divinity School, 1968 79. Author of Paul Among Jews and Gentiles and others. … ; …Emilie T. Sander: Associate Professor of New Testament, Yale University, 1973 75. Coeditor and translator of The Bible and the Role of Women.” I can agree that you may very well be correct in your assessment that the original was written in Hebrew and translated into Greek, and this may possibly have been as late as the 2nd century, which is when the article asserts the date of the idiom, This may explain the problems that the authors have in attributing it to Paul. I consider that the evidence that Paul was ever in possession of the Shroud is extremely slender and speculative, notwithstanding the claims made by David Hines. Paul’s first preaching was in Damascus [Acts ch 9]; Barnabas appears to have been an intermediary between Paul and the Church in Jerusalem [Acts ch 11]; Paul’s first mission is to Pisidia and his preaching there (first to the Jews) is set out in Ch 13. A summary of his subsequent preaching elsewhere follows in the relevant chapters in Acts. Nowhere in Acts, nor in Paul’s general epistles is there any hint that the Shroud played any kind of role in his missionary work. Your interpretation of the word “phailonen” is intriguing, but I don’t see that it alone is sufficient to assert that Paul was ever in possession of the Shroud. I would doubt that Paul was ever made aware of it. For David Hines to say that Paul would have demanded it from the apostles to aid his missionary work verges on the absurd. It is to credit Paul with a greater strength of charisma that the apostles would have been prepared then to acknowledge. Some of them had their own missionary objectives to attend to. To David Hines: For an alternative and more credible theory on the whereabouts of the Shroud I recommend two papers by Jack Markwardt: “Antioch and the Shroud”, Dallas conference 1998, and “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET”, Ohio conference 2008; http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf.","date":"2014-05-20","mins":"4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/14/jesus-long-hair-again-and-again-and-again/","cat":"history","title":"Jesus’ Long Hair Again and Again and Again"},{"id":"comment-171433","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I know of one theory that equates “the beloved disciple” with a presumed adopted son of Jesus. Because of then high mortality rates, many orphans were prevalent in ancient times, and other family members would then adopt them. Adoption gave the same legal rights as birth. Because of Jesus’ claim to be a king his identity was kept secret as his life would be in danger as the natural heir. If a king was defeated and killed, there was a need to forestall the possibility of pretenders to his succession. He is variously identified with one of the named brothers in Mark’s gospel, the one who leaned on Jesus’ breast at the Last Supper, the one who fled naked in the garden leaving his pyjamas behind (Mark), the disciple present at the crucifixion, and the original author of the fourth gospel. Clearly not all of these would necessarily apply to the same person. Adrie van der Hoeven’s 2011 paper “The Turin Shroud as John Mark’s temple garment” offers some fascinating speculations on the origins of the Shroud, and makes a good case for its originally being a temple garment. It is certainly worth reading, but unfortunately seems to suffer from an apparent confusion associating the writers of the first and fourth gospels as the same person, and this would seem an unlikely identification. As to the authorship of the fourth gospel, Encyclopedia Britannica offers the following: “Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown.” “Because both external and internal evidence are doubtful, a working hypothesis is that John and the Johannine letters were written and edited somewhere in the East (perhaps Ephesus) as the product of a “school,” or Johannine circle, at the end of the 1st century. The addressees were Gentile Christians, but there is accurate knowledge and much reference to Palestine, which might be a reflection of early Gospel tradition.” ” … The author of John knows part of the tradition behind the Synoptic Gospels, but it is unlikely that he knew them as literary sources. His use of common tradition is molded to his own style and theology, differing markedly with the Synoptics in many ways.” ” … Confidence in some apostolic traditions behind John is an organic link with the apostolic witness, and, from beginning to end, the confidence is anchored in Jesus’ words and the disciples’ experience although much has been changed in redaction. Traces of eyewitness accounts occur in John’s unified Gospel narrative, but they are interpreted, as is also the case with the other Gospels. ” Whether the author of the fourth gospel can be identified with the author of Revelations, (identified as John written on the island of Patmos) is also a credible possibility: “The “Johannine circle” bearing the tradition of John, the Apostle of the Lord, and from which emerged the Gospel and letters bearing his name, might have been a continuation of the prophetic conventicle of Ephesus in which John was prominent. The various writings do not have to be consistent except in their basic faith in Jesus Christ; and, as the situations to which they addressed themselves were different, different styles and content were required.” Hence the differences in style are not sufficient to dismiss a claim that the different writings may have had the same author..","date":"2014-11-15","mins":"2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/15/john-of-john-the-servant-of-the-priest-that-also/","cat":"history","title":"John of . . . , John the . . . ,  Servant of the Priest?

I continue to be in touch with Adrie, and hope to get to her 2008 paper eventually. John Mark scriptural refs are of course: Acts: 12:12 (Peter’s refuge from prison); 12:25 (Saul returns to Jerusalem with Barnabas & John Mark); 13:5 (accompanies Paul on mission journey), 13:13 (John leaves them at Pamphylia); 15:37 (Paul declines Barnabas’ suggestion that Mark accompany them, replaced by Silas); Col 4:10 (he was cousin to Barnabas, and he was then back with Paul). He is mentioned as disciple of Peter in I Pet 5:13. II Tim 4:11 (may be pseudonymous but has Paul asking for Mark’s help). The name Mark is not mentioned in the Witherington stats of Jewish names and is not mentioned in Rahmani stats of names on Jewish ossuaries. I had assumed that it might have been adopted from some type of Romanism (Marcus is a very common Latin name), The inference I take from yours above is that it was likely a type of family name or title associated with the Maccabees. John, son of Zebedee, is a leading apostle of Jesus, apparently enjoying his special favour, and tradition has marked him out as the author of the fourth gospel. He is Galilean, from a fisherman’s family, an unlikely candidate for a priestly scribe, and none of the gospels name him as John Mark. From John’s gospel, the “beloved disciple” took the mother of Jesus into his home, and there is a site in Ephesus that lays claim to this. Most exegetes seem to favour the final redaction of the gospel by a Johannine school in Ephesus. If Revelations has the same author, then it was written by John on the island of Patmos nearby (I think a prison colony). Contrariwise there is a tradition that John Mark was missionary to Egypt, and the Coptic Church has a strong tradition in this regard. I think there are many things about these times that will never be known because of a deliberate policy of secrecy by the early Church, as a defence against imperial and Jewish persecution.

Knowledge without faith is fascism!” He certainly knew something of the latter disease. And we have seen the general mayhem in our times that can result from uninformed fanatacism. We should not under rate the value of religious artifacts in the witness that they can give to the reality of faith. Our faith is founded in historic events, not legendary, nor mythological, nor even philosophical creations of the mind. Our faith has a tangible origin. It is reasonable then that there shall be artifacts which connect us with the reality of that history, those events, and those persons. Genuine artifacts or relics can serve several purposes, besides merely giving witness. They may satisfy an important psychological need to be mystically united with what they represent, and who they have been associated with. When used in an informed way, they have a valid proselytising or mssionary value. Some of us are happy to make that leap in the dark, and say “I believe”, while some of us need something more. It may be quite a simple thing: perhaps a persuasive argument from creation by design, the picture of a Roman flagra, or a crucifixion nail. Faith is a gift; it does not come from ourselves, but for some of us the gift comes but slowly, and it is helpful to have something more to prop us up in the interim.

I’m sorry that Colin took it so much to heart. Given time, I may be able to source it, assuming it was accurately reported. I note that the report that Colin mentions, is in indirect speech, and therefore not a direct quote, and the interpretation of it in terms of “church and state” seems to be merely a particular focus of the reporter. As with many young German youth of his generation, the young Joseph Ratzinger had been obliged to join the Hitler Youth, which would no doubt have exposed him to the evils of fascism and which would have later stood him in good stead as a churchman of his standing, hence my allusion to it. I certainly did not state “that any deficits of faith imply a (personal) tendency towards fascism” but intended that fascism is the natural consequence of pure reason unaided by faith. For example the origins of Nazism might be discovered in the writings of Nietzsche, who rejected absolute moral values and the so called “slave morality” of Christianity. His ideal was the “Overman” or “Superman” who would impose his will on those who are too weak and worthless to be anything but slaves. I have no particular wish to sustain a quarrel with Colin, and I would hope that all of us are more concerned with a pursuit in search of truth. I set little store by petty point scoring.

The legend has it that a drop of the Virgin’s milk spilled on the rock turning it white during the flight into Egypt fleeing Herod’s soldiers.

The only record of the story of Herod’s slaughter of the infants is to be found in the infancy narrative of Matthew’s gospel, and nowhere else.

(e.g: Matthew has Jesus preaching from a mountainous place like Moses, whereas Luke has him preaching from flat ground). It also helps Matthew to get the family into Nazareth, (because of Archelaus) as Matthew did not know that they were Galileans originally from Nazareth, as did Luke know.

The claimed family tree links between Othon and Jeanne are shown as Fig 31 in Wilson 2010, but I note they were recently challenged on this site by either Rinaldi or Nicolotti. Scavone’s thesis is that as Burgundy was close to the German border and a target for the Empire with Roman pontiff sympathies, while the Charnay Vergy families were French with Avignon anti pope sympathies, Jeanne de Vergy arranged to rescue the Shroud from Besancon for France. She later arranged to replace her Besancon requisition with a copy which has been discussed elsewhere on this site, and may have led to the D’Arcis confusion on the matter.

It does not surprise me at all that someone called Pr Marion found a use for them in some kind of visual analysis. If I’m to be challenged, I’d sooner it be based on something I said, rather than something I hadn’t, or that someone else is responsible for saying! 2) Max’s comment #32, note 7; He’s obviously done some astronomy research on times of sunset, sunrise, three stars appearing etc, and I assume he has the correct calculations. However there’s some little confusion concerning eclipses. Only Luke says “with the sun eclipsed”, other gospels merely say it was dark. The only way that there can be a SOLAR eclipse is for it to occur after Old Moon and before New Moon when the sun becomes hidden; But this timing does not fit in with the time of Pasch which occurs at Full Moon! You can have a LUNAR eclipse at Full Moon, but if so, it would not appear so remarkable as to darken the sky in the afternoon and would not cause comment; Only the face of the Full Moon would become hidden. The sun would still be visible. The cause of the darkness has to be the Ruah Qadim, the Dust Storm. 3) Obviously Joseph of Aramathea must have intended both the tomb and shroud for his own burial, for them to be so immediately available to him, If the present Sindon we know was in fact the Shroud he used, then it was not the sort of weave that one would buy off the shelf, he’d obviously imported it or purchased it sometime beforehand, possibly from Syria, assuming he had originally intended.that this expensive cloth be used for a Shroud rather than for some other purpose. 4) Even allowing Max his 2 1/2 hours for observing the prescribed burial rites, I see a problem in the way that the image appears, and his assertion that the body was completely wrapped. The problem is that there is no lateral image, which if some natural process was involved, would surely show up if the body was completely wrapped. But both the frontal and dorsal image appear as they would in a frontal and dorsal photograph, with no lateral imaging at all. What kind of process could have limited the image in this way? Are we expected to think that there were a pair of convenient lightning bolts taking frontal and dorsal images and projecting them onto the cloth? Or if they came from some mysterious power from within Rabbi Yeshua that he was able to command so that only frontal and dorsal images would show? If a natural process is the cause of the image, then It is rather more credible to see the body laid on the bottom half of the cloth where the dorsal image will appear, and for the top half to be brought over the head and over the body for the frontal image to form, without any further wrapping. The top half of the cloth could be weighted down with some of the 100 lb of mixture left over. This to my mind is the only credible way that no lateral image would show up.

Not only did he falsely accuse me of casting doubts on the Fourier Transform work, he now implies that I attributed the darkness to a lunar eclipse, which is just not credible. I have never had a lunar eclipse hypothesis about the cause of the darkness; Having had an active astronomy interest for some decades, I have been very well aware for many years that a SOLAR eclipse could not occur at Pasch depite it being so implied in Luke. My reference to a LUNAR eclipse was merely an aside to say that it was possible to have had a LUNAR eclipse instead. As the Full Moon would not rise until some time around 5:00pm to 7:00pm, it can hardly be attributed to have caused any kind of darkness in the early afternoon. I have always suspected that if the darkness did indeed occur, (and all three Synoptics say it did) then it had to be some other phenomenon such as a dust storm. The person called Max gave it a name and I merely did him the courtesy of alluding to it in my note above. I doubt if Max can claim proprietary rights over the origin of the Shroud as only a moment’s reflection will yield the answer – it is an expensive piece of cloth, perhaps not originally intended as a Shroud, but was pressed into service as being readily to hand. Joseph seems to have been the generous minded sort of fellow who would readily be open handed about this act of generosity. Concerning Ron’s comments in his last para above, a regular dust storm may have been familiar to both Matthew and Mark, but it is entirely consistent with their scriptural intent to assign a supernatural significance to the timing of it in association with the crucifixion, and it heightens the drama. Luke does not have the same familiarity with Jewish lore, and so assumes and attributes it to a solar eclipse, which is mistaken. Along with Ron, I am not convinced by the wrapping hypothesis. If the body’s sides were packed with insect repellent flora, then one should see some degree of graduation or fading at the edges of the two images, frontal and dorsal, where the “packing” starts, but the image edges seem to be relatively sharp. I think the question remains open, and it seems to me that the photographic like orthogonal projection of the image favours a mere draping of the cloth over the body, possibly with some temporary weighting using the ingredients left over. I don’t expect Max to agree with any of this, and I half expect that he will find some deliberate way of misinterpreting what I have said..","date":"2012-03-19","mins":"5:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"},{"id":"comment-154137","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I love this paper by Kim Dreisbach, and have referred to it from time to time. Mozarabic proper refers to those Christians who lived under Moslem domination in Spain. However the so called Mozarabic rite (more accurately Old Hispanic) was well developed even before the Visigoth period, its final form being determined by St Isidore of Seville, (d.636) before the Muslim invasion. The reference to ‘vestigia’ corresponds to the scripture text John 20:6 8. None of the four Greek texts from the parallel Greek web site, nor Jerome’s Vulgate text, refer to the imprints on the cloths. It would seem to be an early inference taken from the text of v.8: “8 Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed.” It raises the question of what was it that he saw that made him believe. Dreisbach quotes a few other interesting early liturgical sources, which I’ve recently mentioned to a few other Eucharistic Ministers at my local church. The E Ms are required to spread a corporal cloth on the altar before Mass on which the sacred elements are placed. Kim observes: As early as A.D. 325, Pope Sylvester I established: ‘that Mass be celebrated on an altar covered with a cloth of linen consecrated by the Bishop, as if it were the clean Shroud of Christ.’ Theodore of Mopsuestia (ca. A.D. 350 428) expresses this motif’s incorporation into the liturgy, describing the role of the deacons in the liturgy as follows: ‘When they bring up (the oblation at the offertory) they place it on the altar for the completed representation of the passion so that we may think of Him on the altar as if He were placed in the sepulchre after having received the passion … the deacons who spread the linens on the altar represent the figure of the linen cloths at the burial….’ There are also some fascinating comparisons with the burial and resuscitation of Lazarus.

I’m afraid it makes for some fairly tiresome and heavy reading.and could only recommend it to serious students of the movement, A more succinct syllabus of errors “Lamentabili Sane” of July 3, 1907 lists some 65 specific errors to be condemned. You can probably find both encyclicals by simply googling on “modernism encyclical Pius X”. The various errors are not ranked as ‘primary’, ‘secondary’ nor ‘tertiary’ but all are equally condemned Modernism seems to have had its primary roots in much of the 19th century biblical exegesis carried out by various German Protestant studies taken to excess. Catholic biblical studies have moved on since the early 1900s and encyclicals starting with the time of Pope Pius XII to our present Pope Benedict XVI, have actively promoted serious scholarship and biblical studies. Readers can come to their own conclusions as to whether they can accept David Roemer’s thesis: “The best explanation for the Shroud of Turin, in my opinion, is that it was generated by Gnostics in the 1st or 2nd century using a crucified victim and methods that have been lost to history.” I know of no evidence that would support such a position and cannot concur with it. With their emphasis on the spiritual, “true knowledge” and denial of the significance of the corporeal, Gnostics would have no good reason to manufacture such a relic.

The issues faced by a Pius X were certainly different from those now faced by a Benedict XVI, and the world is very different now. From the time of Pia’s photographs in 1898 however, here was independent testimony to a real suffering Christ, no mere archetypal myth derived from the seasonal dying and resurrected autumn god to be resurrected in the spring according to ancient myths, as a reductionist liberalism might have it, but a real Christ who had suffered and died as recorded in the gospels. It had to be the beginning of a true awakening. John’s mention of quantum mechanics, brings to mind that even in 1905, the renown physicist Ernst Mach was still able to deny the very existence of atoms. Today subatomic particles are the stuff of everyday life in our communications, and our understanding of material existence. The political emphasis has now shifted away from the concerns of European national.states of those times, to the global village and political awakenings in Asia and Africa. The interim has seen the rise and fall of Soviet Communism, two major world conflicts, civil wars, an Arab Spring, and the rise of radical Islam There is now the potential for some fool with the power to do so, to destroy this fragile planet from the very stuff of quantum physics, through nuclear destruction. In the meantime, the rest of us set about doing much the same in a questionably more benign manner by industrial pollution, the elimination of the Creator’s work through the destruction of species, and continue to exploit the vulnerable through their forced labour in sweat shops. The image of the suffering Christ depicted on the Shroud may awaken us to His reality in history or herstory as the case may be; We can ask why this had to happen; Was this the Redeemer of humankind? Did His sufferings open the gates of heaven as the old theology would have it? Or else we can go deeper and ask what was the message of this god man? That message was Love! Real love, without reservation! He asks that we follow Him in His example of Love! This man was certainly a radical, overturning conventions that imprisoned the culture of His time. To probe deeper into the message is the task that every generation must pursue each in their own era, to bring about God’s kingom on earth.

The 1934 source quoted by O.K. Needs further investigation to ascertain if R Pfister was correct in asserting that Z twist was common in Palmyra, presumably in the first century. Flury Lemburg is on record as asserting that nothing in the weave suggests that it could not have been made in Syria. However there are also specifically Mediterranean and French pollens. It has been assumed that these accumulated post 1355, because of its known history there. Might it have been much earlier? I suspect that C 14 testing has not yet advanced to the stage whereby small grains such as pollen dust can be reliably dated. It is known that Z twist textiles were recovered at Masada, whether they were manufactured locally, or imported, so Z twist was at least not utterly unknown there. Do we need to consider the possibility that the linen of the TS was manufactured in Northern Europe, perhaps acquired by a Roman centurion, and subsequently taken to Palestine. Joseph of Aramathea is said to have purchased a new shroud, so it could hardly have been acquired during the Gallic wars of 58 50 BC, some 80 years previously. But there may well have been Roman garrisons stationed in Gaul during the early 1st century. The Silk Road to Samarkand can likely be discounted, because as far as I’m aware, there are no known oriental pollens. Just thinking outside the square! The Palestinian pollens are too significant to be discounted.

She was previously Professor of Ancient History (1978 89) and Professor of Late Antique and Byzantine Studies (1989 94), at King’s College London. At Oxford, she is Chair of the Advisory Committee on Honorary Degrees and also sits on committees for Conflict of Interest, Select Preachers, and the Wainwright Fund. Ian Wilson’s repsonse to her several objections on his hypothesis runs to some 27 pages.

I dare say it would also cover several, if not all of Mr Clement’s objections. For after all, I believe it unlikely he is as well qualified as Professor Averil Cameron in such matters, in fact by comparison a “minnow” = “1, a small slender European cyprinid fish, … 4, a small or insignificant person” (Collins). Of course this is also only a joke, isn’t it, from another “squarehead”! But nevertheless, to be fully informed on such matters, as he apparently claims to be, perhaps he should download the paper and read it for himself. There is one thing in common that all these Byzantine scholars share, including Mr Clement. Not one of them has ever come up with an altrnative hypothesis on the whereabouts of the burial cloth, except DA who apparently claims it to have been in “Neverland”.

It scarcely derogates from the soundness of Wilson’s argument in response to Cameron. If I interpret Max correctly, at #15, 2/, I think he is identifying the Mandylion with the Manoppello relic, but that it is NOT of a “not made with human hands” icon, but in fact a man made copy of the sindon image. From what little I’ve read of Manopello, I’m inclined to concur that it is indeed a man made icon, and that the face geometry is a close fit with the sindon image. However if the Mandylion was in fact a separate object from the sindon, then another case can be made for it having been with other relics hoarded in Paris and destroyed during the French Revolution, and that Manapello may be yet another different copy. Coming back to the sindon: If it is indeed the burial cloth of Christ dating from the 1st century, and there are several reasons supporting its authenticity as we all know, then it had to be located somewhere. Unless one is to believe the ancient Abgar story, which looks increasingly unlikely because of Edessa reverting to paganism, then its most likely first destination after 68 AD is Antioch, where the Apostolic church first became established. Possibly it was taken there as early as 47 AD. But it could not have remained in Antioch much after 525 540 AD, because of its destruction by a great fire, two earthquakes, and finally Persian Chosroes I, invaded all of Syria and destroyed Antioch in 540. The Abgar legend may have its roots in the conversion of Abgar the Great, around 190 AD, and the subsequent establishment of Edessa as a major Christian center. The sindon and/or a copied icon, may have been taken to Edessa for a brief visit from Antioch at this time, giving rise to the story. So we have the destruction of Antioch no later than 540, and the emergence of the Edessa image in 544 AD, at the time of Chosroes’ abortive attack on Edessa. All of this is comprehensively traversed in two papers presented at conferences by Jack Markwardt in 1998/99 and 2008. Both papers are well documented and properly referenced, the most recent one at: http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf. Similarly the other can be found by checking out the 1998 conference. The Shroud and other icons could not have been preserved in Edessa after 1146, when it fell to Turkish Muslims. The most likely explanation is that it was taken from there by John Curcuas, the Armenian born commander of the Byzantine army in 944. Where else could the sindon have been: Armenia? St Catherine’s monastery at Sinai? Ephesus? All unlikely, and there’s no case to be made for them! Nevertheless, Icons apparently based on the sindon image, appeared all over churches in the Middle East, even as far as Armenia and Georgia. Early in the fourth century, the easterns discovered what happened to relics when they were revealed to Helena, they ended up at the imperial court, where Constantine made a talismanic bridle for his horse from one of the crucifixion nails. There was good reason not to reveal the whereabouts of the sindon and other holy images. It is hardly surprising that the whereabouts of the Shroud has remained an enigma for so many centuries. However it is an enigma on which the likes of Ian Wilson, Jack Markwardt, and various others have been able to shed some illuminating research, which they have approached industriously and comprehensively, from the purest of motives. Any comparison with the likes of the charlatan Dan Green is utterly odious..","date":"2012-07-19","mins":"12:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers"},{"id":"comment-15631","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Gabriel, this looks really exciting depending on how user friendly it is.

You’re probably aware that he makes a case for Othon taking (or sending) it to his home church in Bensancon, for which there appears to be some tradition. I understand that Burgundy was independent territory at the time, although both France and German interests had designs on it. A strong point for his case is that he is a direct ancestor of Jeanne de Vergy, wwhereas I find it difficult to see how Geoffrey de Charney could have come by it otherwise except by way of her dowry. The weak point of his case is that much of the Besancon church records were destroyed, either by fire sometime around 1350, or in later centuries by the turmoil of the French Revolution. The Templars may have known about it, or else something very similar, hence the Templescombe image, but what is the case for their actually having it in their possession? If Jeanne de Vergy had a copy made to replace the original she “rescued” from Besancon, this could go some way towards explaining the D’Arcis memo if there was some confusion as to which was the original.

Thus Crispino: “Nicolas Idruntino who, furthermore, writes that after the sack of 1204 he saw the precious relics of the Passion with his own eyes; the “othoni” and the “soudarion” among the others..”. On page 6 of his paper, Scavone mentions the same reference and comments: “In this passage, the key words are “with our own eyes.” The question must be asked as to just where it was that Nicholas actually saw the linens. To answer this, we must add what he says in another context: that, in 1206, Benedict and he had traveled to Athens and to Thessalonika debating the same questions of Church unification with the Greek theologians.” Scavone postulates that Nicholas saw them in Athens, that the list (mentioned by Crispino) is what was taken from Constantinople, and refers to the use of the Latin pluperfect tense and the Greek imperfect tense, as arguments that these were no longer in Constantinople. The two papers (Crispino & Scavone) need to be examined and considered very closely as to the relative weight to be given to each. For Othon de la Roche to have secured the Shroud, it had to be in Athens soon after 1204. Othon is also an ancestor of Jeanne de Vergy, and it would seem peculiar that Geoffrey de Charny would have been given such a valuable relic purported to be Christ’s burial cloth, in return for any kind of service he migh have rendered, notwithstanding that he was appointed to bear the oriflamme.

The point had already been made personally to me a number of times by a close friend, a priest, a conservative, who teaches theology in a NZ seminary, and whose opinion I happen to respect despite some friendly disagreements at times. Perhaps there may have been elements of this in the Abgar legend. However the focus in the legend is very much on the cloth with the image, and it seems to me that the story is of a type that seeks to explain the origin of the cloth, which was apparently deemed sufficiently important to require such an explanation. You will know of many such stories I’m sure, there are several such in the older parts of the OT, particularly Genesis and Exodus, and also in much folklore, primal and ancient religions etc. Something unusual, even if only a landscape feature, needs an explanation, often supernatural or legendary! While not necessarily agreeing with all the elements of Markwardt’s paper, I think he makes an excellent case of why Abgar VIII chose to place the story in the time of Abgar V, that it was for political reasons, to protect himself against Roman authority, as it suddenly became just a little too dangerous for him to admit to his conversion. However the discovery of the cloth seemed just too important an event not to make a record of it, even though couched in arcane language.

Either the cloth was the Shroud or it was some other cloth with an image. We would then have a plethora of cloths with images of Jesus, despite the Jewish aversion to images. The tale is set during Jesus’ own mortal life time, so it could not be the Shroud and Abgar V was a contemporary of Jesus. You will therefore have to believe in some multiplicity of cloths with images of Jesus. I should be reluctant to do so. I take it that you have now read Markwardt’s 2008 paper. In that case we will have to agree to differ on the merits of Markwardt’s 2008 paper. I note that there is no record in the gospels of Jesus multiplying images of himself for general wholesale distribution. It is also unlikely that the Shroud would have been sent to Edessa, a then pagan city, so soon after the crucifixion, as there are several references to it being kept elsewhere, including being kept by Peter, or being given to Pilate’s wife, and also being kept in Syria. I therefore find it more credible that the Shroud was hidden in Antioch, and with the impending destruction of the city by earthquake and by Chosros, that it may then have been taken to Edessa in the time of Abgar VIII, leading to creation of the legend. Alternatively, it may have arrived in Constantinople by some other different route entirely.

I have read both previously, the story about Izates, earlier today, and which certain others have unduly embroidered as I mentioned above. Ian Wilson makes the point that Edessa is not that far from Antioch, compared to other missionary journeys undertaken, and that it would be remarkable if some attempt had not been made to evangelise the city. However, in all cities that Paul ever visited, he always preached to the Jews in their local synagogues first. It seems that there had to be a Jewish presence in the city beforehand. Was there one such in Edessa? I’m not sure whether that is known or not, the local gods were Bel & Nebo. Acts states that it was Ananias who baptized Paul, but under protest. Was it the same Ananias who instructed Izotes? We don’t know, but there was a very limited number of names in those days, and it may have been a different Ananias. There is no reference to baptism in the Izotes story; Izotes is to be accepted into the Jewish faith, and there is no mention of Jesus, even obliquely. Now suppose that the Abgar legend was set down in the time of Abgar VIII. There are two 1st century local stories circulating about a messenger named Ananias, one about baptizing Paul, the other about converting a nearby king into the Jewish faith. Therefore in writing up a story about the conversion of Abgar V, the messenger will also be called Ananias, because that’s the sort of thing Ananias did and he’s a prime 1st century candidate for the role! So really I think we end up no wiser about the true situation at all. I think the point of all our discussion on this, concerns the timing of the arrival of a cloth with an image of Jesus on it, which became known as the Image of Edessa. We don’t know if that was the Shroud as Ian Wilson claims, or whether it was something else. It is possible that Abgar V may have been baptised; if he was, Christianity in Edessa was nonetheless short lived. The story about Addai arriving in Abgar V’s court with such an image, does seem to be a subsequent attempt to explain the arrival of the image, with the purpose of enhancing the status of Edessa. Pope Gelasius in the 5th century considered it spurious, and a fiction. I think it more likely that such icons would have been secretly and carefully guarded by trusted members of the early Church, and that any taken to Edessa, would only be because their safety was now threatened and Edessa had in that time become the safest place to keep them..","date":"2013-10-27","mins":"7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-48917","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"O.K.: Thank you for the comments and for the web ref on the Doctrine of Addai which I’ve now saved to my folder. There are clearly several elements in the story which can only postdate the crucifixion and resurrection. The section describing Hanan painting Jesus, may be Eusebius’ explanation of the image (shades of Bishop D’Arcis) but I believe the Image of Edessa was something more than this. I get the impression you are much more ready to accept the story at face value than I’m able to. There may be a few elements in the story reflecting memories of actual occurences. As I said previously, it would be remarkable if there had not been some apostolic attempt to evangelize Edessa, because of its relative proximity to Antioch. I could accept for example that Abgar V may have been converted to Christianity, but it’s by no means certain. I feel inevitably drawn to the conclusion, that any such special images of Jesus, whether Shroud or Manopello, or anything such, would have been secretly kept by trusted members of the early Christian community, and not distributed elsewhere, regardless of whether the prospective recipient was a king or not. I see the story as written to explain the eventual arrival of the image in Edessa, taken there because its safety had come under threat, and Edessa had now become the safest place to relocate it. Its arrival there had to be explained, but the explanation given I think cannot be accepted as factual. Markwardt’s attempt to rationalise the origin of the story may be closer to the mark than it would seem you’re prepared to accept. One merely has to change the names of the participants, because it had become dangerous to identify who they actually were. Concerning the frequency of names in apostolic times: Of 917 Jewish ossuaries, most of them probably 1st century to 70 AD, there were 286 names on 231 inscribed ossuaries. The name Ananias (Hananiah) occured 10 times, about 3.5% of all the names. It cannot therefore be concluded that the Hanan… in all three stories (Paul, Izotes, Abgar) is necessarily the same person..","date":"2013-10-27","mins":"3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-48691","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"John: I think the Gnostic link is only indicated if the particular verse in “Hymn of the Pearl” referring to the mirror image is taken to refer to the Shroud. That is by no means established and some historians have occasionally argued against it, but only perhaps because of their own particular perspective. The Abgar legend purporting to refer to King Abgar V, a contemporary of Jesus, and the establishment of Christianity in Edessa in apostolic times may in fact be a blind. I think it was Eusebius who denounced the Abgar legend as a forgery. Jack Markwardt argues that the Abgar referred to in the legend is in fact Abgar VIII (the Great) but for political reasons, it was written as a legend referring to the earlier Abgar to avoid the attention of the Roman emperor and the prospect of persecution. It seems likely that Christianity was established in Edessa no later than 200 AD, but not much earlier. Markwardt has several very early references which may refer to the Shroud. He argues that the TS was kept and hidden in Antioch, not Edessa, and the story of its discovery in the walls of Edessa is in fact an adaptation of its actual discovery in Antioch, when it was then taken to Edessa because of the impending destruction of Antioch.

Further commentary on the “Hymn of the Pearl” may be found on the Brian Colless web site I’ve mentioned above.

Markwardt makes the point that if Edessa was christianised in apostolic times, it would never have become subservient to the the Antioch church, which seems a valid point. His explanation of why the legend was made to refer to Abgar V, rather than to Abgar VIII, was a ruse to record an important religious event in Eessa’s history, while diverting political attention away from Abgar VIII becoming Christian. “Only the names were changed to protect the guilty.” It is also unlikely that a Christian missionary would seek to evangelize a king unless invited to do so. It seems that sons of Abgar V were pagan in any case, and any latent christianity in Edessa would soon be suppressed. I don’t think the charge of scholarly prejudice holds in this case.

In addition the author reviews whether these two topics are indeed connected or not. The Relationship between Ossuary Burial and the Belief in Resurrection during the Late Second Temple Period Judaism by Dina Teitelbaum; Carleton University, Canada 1997. So it’s a little dated, but well researched, considered and presented. Http://www.nlc bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq22102.pdf I learnt a lot from it and it’s well worth taking the time to read through it, by those interested in these two topics. Secondary burial in ossuaries may have commenced in Jerusalem as early as 50 BCE and continued into 70 AD; With the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish diaspora, the practice drastically diminished, and with Hadrian’s edict excluding Jews it ceased in 138 AD. Subsequently secondary burials became established in Southern Galilee. Rahmani is known to assert that the practice only commenced during the Herodian period from 20 BCE, while others asserted it can be dated to 200 BCE, but this early date is not now generally accepted. Author considers that the first affirmation of Jewish belief in resurrection is only found in II Maccabees and afterwards, from about 168 BCE. She sees it partly as a reaction to the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, and to some extent, reaction to the Book of Job, “Why do bad things happen to good people, while evil doers prosper?” She also connects it with Ezekiel’s earlier ‘Valley of Dry Bones’, although most exegetes have seen this text as referring to post exilic Jewish resurgence. She also connects the concept with the pervading Greek influences on notions of the soul. The relative scarcity of ossuaries (perhaps only some 2000 are known), in relation to demographic considerations, suggest that their use was principally a privilege of the well to do, and not necessarily associated with, nor an essential corollary to a belief in the resurrection of the body. But the issues involved are examined in considerable detail. She refers to the site known as the Caiaphas family tomb, and it would therefore seem that a Caiaphas ossuary would not necessarily imply his belief in the resurrection, nor need it be considered paradoxical. She observes that whereas some ossuaries have been ornately well decorated, the inscription of names is often rough, suggesting that inscriptions were not made in the work shop, but possibly on site. This of course might imply that the names were not inscribed accurately, by those sufficiently well lettered to do so, and hence inaccuracies might therefore be expected. There may therefore be no great significance in any presumed mis spelling of any occupant’s name on their ossuary..","date":"2014-08-04","mins":"6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus"},{"id":"comment-201058","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Stephen J notes in his commentary that 1933 being declared a Holy Year, the Shroud was also put on display that year, and was viewed by Pierre Barbet.

The ordinary familiar Egyptian cubit is 18 inches = 457mm. . The Royal Egyptian cubit was about 4 digits longer at 524 mm = 20.62 inches, and a granite stick was used as a standard. There were several other cubits around, the general idea being that it was the length from elbow to finger tip. The Shroud dimensions are 4340mm x 1090mm, so it’s a direct aspect ratio of 4:1, within 20mm. So the cubit used for the cloth was about 4340 / 8 = 542mm. That’s about 18mm longer than the Royal Egyptian, but there were even much longer cubits [e.g. Royal Persian “cubit(?)” is quoted as 640mm]. I found several sites that tended to concentrate around the 524mm, occasionally found bigger ones, but eventually dropped on to a site (which looks like it has a fundamentalist agenda, but is probably authoritative when it comes to cubits): http://www.worldwideflood.com/ark/noahs cubit/cubit references.htm It quoted the Assyrian cubit at 700 BC as 549mm = 21.6 inches. Its source reference is given as http://www.footrule.com which seems an authoritative source, but the site takes some navigating. Eventually it gives you the figure of 21.6 inches for the Assyrian cubit. The 542mm which seems to be the unit on the Shroud cloth is actually closer to the Arabic cubit, but it was the Syrians who had the reputation as weavers.

As I read the abstract, I surmise that the King’s 55cm cubit was comparatively rare, and that the more usual Royal cubit was 55.6cm. It would seem that the “footrule” site I’ve mentioned above in quoting 549mm (Assyrian 700 BC) is based on Guralnick’s rare King’s cubit of 55cm. The width of the Shroud cloth at 1090mm is suggestive of a cubit of ~545mm, which is ~3cm longer than the standard cubit, and about 1cm shorter than the usual Royal cubit. The cloth is almost certainly of Syrian weave (cotton contamination and 3:1 twill) and it seems a puzzle to me why a larger than standard cubit was used just for a cloth.

It was originally published in French and translated into English by the ‘Earl of Wicklow’ in 1953. My copy is by Image Books published in 1963. I am unable to comment on its present availability. It is considered the classic study of the wounds on the Shroud. Not only was Barbet an experienced forensic pathologist, researching the crucifixion wounds by experiments on cadavers and amputated limbs, he was also a competent classics scholar having access to several ancient Greek and Roman resources, to support his analysis. The section on scourging is at Chapter 4, ‘The Preliminary Sufferings’ which also includes the mocking and buffeting in the praetorium and the crowning with thorns. Dr Fred Zugibe more latterly, disagreed with some of Barbet’s analysis, alleging errors in his work. Learned opinion seems to be divided between the merits of the two. It is well worth attempting any effort to secure the book if you can, even searching second hand book stores if necessary. Possibly it may be found in some University Library. It is the classic work and if you wish to pursue the topic in depth, you need to be at least informed about it. It is also likely that Paul Vignon and Professor Yves Delage may also have covered the topic based on the Secondo Pia photographs of 1898, but would not have had access to the better 1931 photographs of Guiseppe Enrie in 1931. Vignon’s work presented by Delage to the Paris Academy in 1902 was titled “The Shroud of Christ”. His classic work in 1938 for which he was awarded the Academy’s Prize is titled “Holy Shroud of Turin: Science, Archaeology, History, Iconography, Logic”, and also includes work on his studies in comparative iconography..","date":"2014-08-09","mins":"5:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/09/request-for-help-can-you-point-me-to-some-information-on-roman-scourging/","cat":"history","title":"Request for Help:  Can you point me to some information on Roman scourging?"},{"id":"comment-143084","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Barbet makes the point that no artist ever came near to painting the exactitude of the scourge marks “Painters have been content with, at the most, vague, formless excoriations …” There were two executioners, the one on the right a little taller than the one on the left, and with a sadistic tendency to whip the legs as well. The whips were so aimed that they also flicked around to the front of the chest, as shown on the separate ventral image, a highly skilled artifice indeed if it was merely the cloth that had been scourged.

Jewish executioners could only impose 40 lashes (on sentenced Jews), but in practice imposed only 39, as a kind of margin to avoid exceeding the 40. St Paul as a Roman citizen (inherited from his Tarsus forbears) suffered only 40 lashes. However there appears to have been only practical limits for Roman soldiery inflicting the punishment on non citizens. These only needed to survive with sufficient strength to be able carry the cross bar (patibulum) to the place of execution. The gospel accounts report that Jesus needed assistance from Simon of Cyrene to do this, hence the scourging punishment was likely extreme. The advantage of tying the victim’s hands above his head to a post would seem to be that if he fainted, the punishment could still continue without undue interruption, although you’ve mentioned revival with salt water. I am unclear as to whether the victim was normally suspended by his arms alone, or whether it was more usual for him to have feet on the ground support as well.

I see some unresolved problems that need further clarification. 1) Barbet seems to have envisaged a flagrum fitted with two pellets, as the shape of the scourge wounds are in the form of a dumbell. He asserts that the arms were held above the head for the simple reason that there are no scourge marks on the forearms. He assumes that the victim was somehow made to face a post, as the great majority of the scourge marks are on the back. He seems to explain the much fewer wounds on the chest by the thongs whipping around the body. This could only occur if the pellets were at some distance from the ends of the thongs. 2) If the victim was made to face a post with his arms bound to it above his head, this would not preclude the thongs wrapping around to strike the non central front of the chest. Alternatively the arms may have been bound to an overhead beam, when free access to the chest would be possible. 3) There are many comments that could be made about the Faccini Fanti paper. First, there has been considerable Photoshop remassaging of the images used for the analysis, using the tools for ‘noise reduction’, ‘cloning’, ‘correction brush’, ‘filter diffusion’, and a few others. This might be thought to raise questions concerning the integrity of the imagery they obtained. The authors claimed to distinguish three kinds of marks. They carried out some scourging experiments using a 60 cm drum, cloths, white paper and carbon paper. They illustrate a weapon with three pellets on each of four thongs, but used a three thong flagrum, each thong having two pellets at its ends for the experiments. 4) They do not accept the proposition that the thong marks are caused by the scourging thongs as asserted by Barbet, but assert that this was by a different implement, and that these marks do not match the pattern of scourging. They envisage they were imposed by lictor type virgae rods. They simulated these using flexible pear rods. They seem to infer that these were inflicted as some kind of preliminary punishment. I suspect it more likely that they were imposed during the journey to Golgotha. 5) Their Fig 1 shows very many marks on the front of the chest, but their discussion on the wound sites seems quite limited, and not fully explored. I can only suggest that readers make of this paper what they will. My own conclusion was that I needed to know a lot more about their findings than was given in the paper.

They are content merely to sketch the scene and to say that it happened. Likewise we cannot then expect them to give the gory details of the scourging punishment. They give the bare factual account only. Their end point is the triumph of the resurrection. That is their goal, the proclamation of the resurrected Christ. As to details we might turn to Barbet. He focuses on a single blood flow, that on the forehead from the cap of thorns. He devotes more than a full page to it, as if in a forensic report. He concludes by saying: “I would defy any modern painter, unless he is a surgeon, with a thorough knowledge of the physiology of coagulation, and meditated for a long time on all the possible avatars of that thin thread slowly coagulating in the midst of the obstacles, to imagine and portray this image of the frontal clot. Even with such conditions, it is more than likely that some blunder would betray the forger and his work of imagination.” “As for the hypothetical painter whom people have dared to claim was capable, having painted or stained these negative images in the Middle Ages, of imagining (whatever his genius might have been) all the minutiae of this clot which is as pregnant with truth as if it were on a living man – it is enough to disgust a physiologist and a surgeon. Please do not talk of it! This image, and it alone should be enough to prove that nobody has touched the shroud except the Crucified Himself.

Pilate was procurator 26 – 36 AD. Pilate was completely in charge. When one has dogs, there is no need to bark oneself. A few of the primitive texts (e.g. “Pilate flogged him”) might leave the impression that P Ilate himself was the executioner. Having a garrison at his command this is unthinkable. All of the gospel writers to various degrees seek to impose the blame for Jesus’ death on the Jews of that time, and even their posterity. It reflects the ongoing tension between the various early churches and the local synagogues. They wish to make the point that a new age has emerged, the Jews no longer have an exclusive claim to be called the People of God, Jesus’ death and resurrection has changed everything. The early churches spread throughout the empire and seemed anxious not to offend the Roman overlords. This is evident in Acts and also the epistles. It is evident in their accounts of Pilate’s judgement. Concerning this judgement, Christian tradition has seen it differently. Both the Apostles’ and Nicene Creeds place the blame and responsibility where it should rest. “… And was crucified under Pontius Pilate …” The man is named! The Second Vatican Council explicitly exculpated the Jewish people, then and since, from the responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus.

Pilate is presented as an impartial judge, who wants to do the right thing, while the Jews are presented as a howling mob stirred up by their leaders. Pilate finally gives in, succumbing to the threat that he would otherwise be no friend of Caesar, and that a riot was imminent. He had been delegated supreme imperial authority, with a small army of 3,000 to support his decisions, and so the responsibility is ultimately his, as set out in the Creeds. Another example would be Paul’s interview with Governor Festus towards the end of Acts. Festus is presented as ready to release Paul, but Paul surmising that the Jews would only pursue their animosity towards him, holds out for an appeal to Caesar, as he is entitled to as a Roman citizen. It is only when we come to the Book of Revelations, with the recollection of recent persecutions, and the claims of imperial divinity, that we see a Christian challenge to this authority.

There are all together too many aspect to it. Consciousness creates a serious problem in materialistic philosophy. For example it cannot do justice to the concept of intentionality, and the distinction between the mental and non mental. Thus the materialist will have problems in developing a mechanistic theory of mind. However we can also recognise various levels of consciousness perhaps in connection with neurological disease, from full alertness, through a continuum to stupor, sleep and coma. These various levels will generally have a material origin. Consciousness is required, not merely in the observation of the merely physical world, which seems to be the nub of Professor Raman’s article, but also in the recognition of the abstract, such as symbolism, appreciation of art, exercise of imagination in reading a work of fiction, and indeed even in understanding the meaning of understanding. Consciousness has an important role in the observation of the physical world, but here we run into the problems of quantum mechanics, in that the state of a subatomic particle cannot be known until it is observed. This was a question hotly debated by Einstein, Schrodinger, Heisenberg and others in the first half of the 20th century. John Cribben’s work “In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat” articulates the problem for the ordinary lay reader. The mystery of parity at a distance is a very peculiar problem indeed. It appears to be a reasonable assumption, that the physical work should in fact exist, without the necessity of it being observed, that is – requiring consciousness. However it is extremely difficult, and possibly hazardous to one’s health, if an attempt is made to make the argument on grounds which are rigorously logical. It may well be in a similar category as Godel’s Theorem of Undecideability. As noted in the header, it is “Off Topic”, although it may have some metaphysical significance in our general discussions.

Is Resurrection Fundamental to the Shroud Image?"},{"id":"comment-14679","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I shall endeavour to confine my response to Yannick’s very long posting above, to only a few points. I feel that much of it is a repetition of remarks he has frequently made before, and I see little point in sustaining a long to and fro argument about these. 1) chromophore: It seems reasonably certain from what we have read, that indeed the chromophore lies in the impurity layer of the cloth, rather than in the textile itself. It would add to our understanding of the image if this matter could be confirmed by further investigation. However the now restricted access to the cloth is unlikely to allow further samples to be taken in the near future. Any further testing will need to be limited to already exisitng samples. 2) miracle or natural process?: I suspect that Yannick & I will continue to have differing views on this matter. I have already stated aspects supporting the miracle hypothesis as: (a) no dorsal deformation (bluntly – the buttocks and shoulder blades do not appear to be flattened as they would expect to be from the body weight, assuming the body was laid on its back – most likely position) – it as if the body was suspended in space; (b) the projection of front and dorsal views with no image of the sides, as might otherwise be expected from a Maillard reaction – the edges of the front and dorsal images are relatively sharp; (c) the fairly high definition of the image (modified by previous comments by Anoxie & Gabriel). Clearly the Vatican authorities are unlikely to proclaim the image as miraculous until all scientific avenues have been explored, which again is unlikely to be any time soon. Meantime personal viewpoints as to whether the image is miraculous or natural will depend on how the various results to date are personally perceived and interpreted. 3) Seismic activity as cause of image: I dare say that Yannick in his seismic quiescent province of Quebec, probably has little understanding of certain aspects of seismic activity. Despite my entreaties for him to do so, I rather suspect he has neither read nor understood Giovanna de Liso’s paper on her 12 years of experiments in Piedmont. Section 2(b) of her paper describes in detail her use and treatment of the textile samples she used. She seems to have made some effort to simulate the conditions of the Shroud cloth. Unfortunately the PDF of her paper is secured so that copying and pasting of the relevant extract isn’t possible without retyping. Meantime the seismically inert Quebecois may brand this cause as absurd if they so wish, but that doesn’t make it so! 4) Identity of the Shroud man: I have already written an article on the identity of the Shroud man, and Dan posted a reference to this some weeks ago.

My comment above was merely to identify a few arguments which MIGHT support a supernatural cause of the image, as against a naturalistic explanation. It seems to me that everwhere we turn to search for any kind of naturalistic explanation we seem to encounter difficult problems, of one kind or another. I am prepared to concede that some elementary observances were probably carried out, such as binding the jaws, and the feet; The hands were not bound to the extent that a wrist wound is plainly visible. Against the burial cloth being tightly bound around the body, are the following arguments: (a) the 3 D encoded properties correlate with the loosely draped model used by Jumper & Jackson for their distance calibrations; (b) If the burial cloth was wrapped tightly around the body and the image was due to a Maillard reaction, we would expect to see a very different image from the one that is manifest; (c) both frontal and dorsal images are what we might expect to see if they had been produced by projecting the frontal and dorsal light pixels on to a more or less flat screen. It may be that the halakah rituals were observed, but likely modified to ensure that all the blood was conserved. I concede that the imminent sabbath would not seem to hinder this – I understand that observance of burial rites were in fact a permitted sabbath activity. Absence of light may have been a practical difficulty. However if you insist that the body was completely wrapped, then my response would have to be that in that case the image cannot comply with a naturalistic explanation and that it must have been miraculous. Those who would prefer a naturalistic explanation would conclude that the body was not tightly wrapped in the burial cloth, as otherwise a different image would have resulted. Therefore I fail to see how you can assert that the body not being completely wrapped is a received idea from arch miraculists, when in fact a loosely draped body provides a better naturalistic explanation for the manifest image. Any kind of wrapping at all would never deter an arch miraculist! One problem with a loosely draped body, is that very likely it compromises any kind of gaseous diffusion model, as it would allow the gases to escape, A naturalistic explanation would then need to look elsewhere, such as the seismic activity explanation I have suggested as a possibility. This is what I meant when I said that everywhere we turn, we seem to encounter difficulties in searching for a naturalistic explanation..","date":"2012-08-10","mins":"6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/09/off-topic-is-consciousness-fundamental/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Consciousness Fundamental?

Following Cyrus’ release of the Jews from their Babylonian Captivity, those who had taken foreign wives were excluded from returning to Jerusalem, many of them settling in Egypt, the Arabian peninsula and elsewhere. In 324 BC Alexander founded the city of Alexandria, and following his death his successors there became the Ptolemaic dynasty. Ptolemy II was persuaded to establish the Great Library, and it accumulated a vast wealth of learning from the many travelers passing through it. Alexandria became a centre of both Greek and Jewish culture, for example the Septuagint being written there. But it was essentially a cosmopolitan city, and the ideas from many cultures were melded there. The two main influences I believe that contributed to the development of the concept of resurrection and an after life were 1) the Jewish exposure to Egyptian burial practices with its belief in an after life; 2) their exposure to Platonic philosophy, with its concept of an eternal soul, its theory of ideals, and the concept of the One. The hierarchy in Jerusalem, the priestly caste with its temple cult, who later became the Sadducees, rejected this notion, but it took root among the Pharisaic movement, which also happens to owe something to Persia, particularly Zoroastrianism, dualistic notions of good and evil. In the Gospel of John, we read that Jesus asserted that Abraham saw His day and was glad, and he quotes David’s psalm “The Lord said to my lord ‘Sit at my right hand … “. It is very clear that Jesus embraced this idea of an after life, and seems to make the claim that the concept was always present in Hebraic thought. The most avid of the early churches missionaries seem to have been the Hellenists, who with their Greek culture, were able to embrace this fundamental Christian belief, so that together with the ideas of brotherly love and high moral standards, it became the principal stamp of Christianity..","date":"2014-08-02","mins":"4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/02/the-key-to-understand-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-142069","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Pope Benedict demanded both reason and faith!.","date":"2014-08-03","mins":"7:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/02/the-key-to-understand-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-142195","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I have just provided extensive comment on the Jewish practice of secondary burial in ossuaries, their development of resurrection belief, and the question of whether the two are related or not, based on a paper submitted for Master’s Thesis: “The Relationship between Ossuary Burial and the Belief in Resurrection during the Late Second Temple Period Judaism”, by Dina Teitelbaum: http://www.nlc bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq22102.pdf My comments at posting ‘Paul Maier at Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus’, where the question of ossuaries was also being discussed..","date":"2014-08-04","mins":"6:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/02/the-key-to-understand-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-142094","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Aquinas had a similar problem.

This part of Isaiah is indeed written by the prophet that exegetes call “First Isaiah”, either Isaiah himself or his contemporary followers about 740 700 BCE. The USCCB version includes the following note concerning this verse: “[26:19] This verse refers not to resurrection of the dead, but to the restoration of the people; cf. Ez 37. The population of Judah was radically reduced by the slaughter and deportations that the historical disasters of the late eighth and seventh centuries B.C. Brought upon the country. In this context, a major concern for the future was for an increase in the population, a rebirth of the nation’s life.” The verse needs to be read within the context of those preceding it v.v 1 18. Nevertheless, regardless of prophecies relating to resurrection and the after life, and we might include Isaiah’s enigmatic prophecies of the suffering servant (e.g. ‘my servant shall prosper … ) which have similar messianic themes, they could only take root among the people where there was the fertile soil to do so. They could only be understood where there was a capability of understanding. Any development of resurrection theology occurred late in Jewish thought, and it was not universally accepted among them. It was certainly not the view of the hierarchy isolated from such influences in Jerusalem, notwithstanding the proclamations of any prophets.

My maternal grandmother, my Nana, was one of these last, and I remember a picture of the Shroud face she kept on her cottage wall. But it generated little informed discussion among us as children. The work of such pioneers as Yves Delage, Paul Vignon, and Guiseppe Enrie was a closed book to the grreat majority. For most Catholics, their knowledge of an image of Christ was confined to the legend of Veronica from the popular devotion of “The Stations of the Cross”. As a student undergraduate in 1960, our Dominican university chaplain had shown a group of us a slide presentation of what was then known of the Shroud. Very likely it had been based on the work of Pierre Barbet, which he first published in French in 1950, and was translated into English only in1960. Intriguing as his presentation was, it generated no further sustained interest from our Catholic student body. Between 1969 and 1973 further investigative work was initiated by the Turin authorities. The work of such men as Max Frei, belong to this period, and later John Jackson and Eric Jumper. Most of this investigative work was done in secret. Maurus Green had attempted unsuccessfuly to construct a history during the 1960s. Perre d’Arcis’ assertion that the cloth was a forgery had not been refuted, and the general view was that this revered impression, devotional though it might be, was nevertheless highly suspect. Ian Wilson highly trained in art history, realised that this perception could never be set aside until some attempt at a credible history prior to the 14th century could at least be postulated. The results of his attempts to construct such a history are well known. Prior to the publication of “The Turin Shroud” in 1978, few people had ever heard of the Image of Edessa, the Mandylion, the report of Robert de Clari, or the Hungarian Pray maunscript, let alone the legend of Abgar. Ian Wilson’s work changed the public perception of the Shroud, beyond all measure. From a mere object of pious devotion, the perception grew that maybe, just perhaps, this could well be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, imprinted with the true face and form of the Redeemer of mankind. It ill behoves smaller minds to denigrate the great contribution that Ian Wilson has brought to the wider public, in its perception of what the Shroud now stands for. Perhaps Wilson did not get it quite right, but that is no excuse for comparing his monumental work to such charlatans as Dan Green, and other sensationalist wannabes, but neverwillbes. In NZ, we have relatively few pests, some flies, wasps, and there are giant sandflies in our southern regions. They have it worse in Australia with their venomous snakes and redback spiders. In Quebec I’m told, they still have a few foxes, the lynx, and in the north even the occasional polar bear. It seems they also have gadflies, insects of no use to mankind whatsoever, who annoy and fasten on the butts of nobler animals. Socrates prided hmself in his arraignment on being such a gadfly on the state of Athens, but Yannick Clement is no Socrates!.","date":"2012-08-27","mins":"1:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/23/scholarly-incompetence-or-dishonesty/","cat":"history","title":"Scholarly Incompetence or Dishonesty?"},{"id":"comment-15535","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick: Whether the Shroud is or is not the Mandylion, is not the issue.

I tell you that you will never win any support for your ideas, regardless of any merit they may have until you cease this stupid thick headed attitude of charging Wilson with bad motives. In 1973, there were only three British people involved in any kind of Shroud research at all. They were Dom Maurus Green, Dr David Willis, and Ian Wilson. There were no others. Green is on record as being open to Wilson’s early ideas on the history of the Shroud. In 1969, the Cardinal of Turin had appointed a Commission, all Italians from his own Piedmont area. By 1973, he had included the Belgian, Professor Gilbert Raes, and subsequently the Swiss Max Frei, It was not until 1978, that the STURP team was established, and included American scientists, such as Jackson and Jumper. BUT It was not the STURP members who made the impact with the public, that changed the public perception of the importance of the Shroud. They were all scientists, and concerned with pursuing their science, and obtaining their results.

It was the cotton contamination which had suggested to me that the weave was of Syrian provenance, but since then it became evident that there was in fact a medieval trade in cotton to Europe, possibly as early as the 12th century, could even be earlier.

There were three Assyrian cubits: Standard Late Assyrian cubit 51.5cm; Royal cubit (religio mythological royal emblemata) 56.6cm; Slab featuring King Sargon 55cm; It seems that the Royal cubit may well have been used for the cloth, but it is not exact. This may be due to some historic stretching and shrinking, or even some weaving practice such as selvedging, trimming, loom margins etc. It has been suggested that the cloth may have been intended for a special purpose such as a temple garment (van der Hoeven in 2011), which could explain why a Royal cubit may have been used. At this stage, I feel the issue needs looking at in a little more depth than we’ve managed to do just by blogging.

I’m fairly sure (from memory) that they were able to confirm Dead Sea halophytes. 2) Work by Kohlbeck & Nitowski on Jerusalem travertine aragonite limestone particles: “New evidence may explain image on Shroud of Turin” by Kohlbeck and Nitowski. Biblical Archeological Review (BAR), vol 12 n. 4, 1986, pp.23 24) A problem with lack of peer review, but at face value, might be considered indicative. Needs corroboration. The title is a misnomer, in that the paper seeks to corroborate that the TS man made contact with limestone dust identical with that found in Jerusalem. 3) Gabriel has sometimes mentioned that strontium studies could be of considerable value, I think in terms of percentages present, which could assist in location provenance, not sure about whether radioactive decay of Sr can be used or not for purposes of dating. We have sometimes discussed this topic. 4) Roger’s work on vanillin may be useful for dating, but seems temperature dependent, and the cloth has been subject to sporadic high temperatures from fires. Rogers also, I understand, considered that the flax for the linen was processed in accordance with a description by Pliny the elder – Yannick may be able to comment on this aspect. 5) Superficiality of the image is a distinctive feature – often suggested that it is confined to a starch(?) coating, rather than the cellulose of the fibrils. Yannick Clement has often commented on the need to have a much better understanding of the chromophore. 6) The geometric distortion of the image is minimal – it seems to conform to an orthogonal projection, such as a photograph might, no lateral stretching, and no side views of the body are visible. This implies constraints on the disposition of the cloth, whether it was merely draped as many think, or whether it was fully wrapped and tied as Max Patrick Hamon has claimed. I think it may also have implications for the image formation process. I personally find it difficult to imagine how a chemical process might produce such an orthogonal image.

Possibly Stephen Jones follows Ian Wilson’s text a little too slavishly, But he makes the point that Vignon originally identified 20 such markings, Wilson reduced these to 15, but Jones also mentions that some enthusiasts claimed to have identified 60. Whatever, 15 correspondences are too many to dismiss so lightly. Prior to the 6th C, there were considerable variances in the very few portraits of Christ now available, one such portraying him as a beardless Apollo. Augustine asserted that nobody knew what Jesus looked like, but suddenly in the sixth century, the iconography seems to have become fairly standardised. It has to be apparent to any fair minded judgment that whatever template was used for these depictions, there must have been a select few who had access to the Shroud facial image, and these various markings were included in that template. This is not to make a case that the template was wholly based on the Images of the Shroud or the Edessa nor that the Edesssa was necessarily the Shroud as asserted by Wilson, but it is interesting that much of the iconography seems to have radiated out from Edessa. Perhaps there were other images available at the time or earlier copies which contributed to the template. Jones makes a telling point when he comments: “An interesting argument is that in the law courts (where proof `beyond reasonable doubt’ is required), cases of plagiarism or breach of copyright will be settled in the plaintiff’s favour if it can be shown that the text (or whatever) is supposed to have been copied contains errors present in the original. Similarly, in tracing the texts of ancient authors, the best evidence that two versions are copies one from another or from the same original is when both contain the same errors. A charming example is an intrusive colon within a phrase in two fourteenth century texts of Euripides: one colon turned out to be a scrap of straw embedded in the paper, proving that the other text was a later copy.” [Patterson, C., 1999, “Evolution,” Cornell University Press: Ithaca NY, Second edition, p.117]. If a scrap of straw can be accepted as evidence of copying Euripedes, then 15 Vignon markings on 6th century icongraphy has to be even more compelling that the Shroud facial image was certainly known at that time!.","date":"2012-09-22","mins":"4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-215871","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It seems that Lead may be used in silver smithy work, not usually as part of the main alloy, but occasionally for some solders and also as an aid in decorative work. The Wikipedia article on Alloys identifies no silver lead alloy, and most solders for silver seem to be an alloy of tin and silver. “In silversmithing or jewelry making, special hard solders are used that will pass assay. They contain a high proportion of the metal being soldered and lead is not used in these alloys. These solders vary in hardness, designated as “enameling”, “hard”, “medium” and “easy”. Enameling solder has a high melting point, close to that of the material itself, to prevent the joint desoldering during firing in the enameling process. ” From a very comprehensive Ency Brit article on “Metalworking”: — From Inlaying: … … “Niello is the process of inlaying engraved ornamental designs with niello, a silver sulfide or mixture of sulfides. The first authors to write on the preparation of niello and its application to silver were Eraclius and Theophilus, in or about the 12th century, and Benvenuto Cellini, during the 16th. According to each of these authors, niello is made by fusing together silver, copper, and lead and then mixing the molten alloy with sulfur. The black product (a mixture of the sulfides of silver, copper, and lead) is powdered; and after the engraved metal, usually silver, has been moistened with a flux (a substance used to promote fusion), some of the powder is spread on it and the metal strongly heated; the niello melts and runs into the engraved channels. The excess niello is removed by scraping until the filled channels are visible, and finally the surface is polished.” From section on Lead: ” … In the 12th century the German monk Theophilus, in his treatise on metalworking, refers to lead only in connection with casting rods for stained glass windows and as a material through which silver sheets might be hammered; … Lead could even be useful, in the proper disguise, to simulate rich ecclesiastical objects, for not all religious institutions were wealthy: a group of 14th century caskets covered with lead tracery, gilded to look like precious metal, have survived in church treasuries. These were used as reliquaries, but some were originally made for secular purposes.” “The Renaissance passion for collecting bronze medals and plaquettes led to a demand for cheap replicas, and these were made with great precision in lead. The metal also played an important role in the goldsmiths’ trade. The fashion for elaborate relief ornament of the Renaissance and Mannerist periods called for a degree of skill in modelling that was beyond the powers of the average goldsmith. The practice therefore grew up for the pattern makers of Augsburg and Nürnberg, Germany, to sell lead models of ornamental details and figures from which goldsmiths working elsewhere could in turn make molds.” So fundamentally, it would be good to know something about the casket commissioned by Margaret of Austria in 1509. Where was it made? Who made it? How was it made? What did it look like? What was its shape and how large was it? Was it made from silver sheets fastened together, perhaps by rivets or soldering? Or else from a single sheet hammered into shape and sealed with soldering? Or was it cast as one piece by say the lost wax method? What ornamentation did it have? Could this have included niello work, or something similar? Could lead models have been used for the purpose of ornamental molds? In brief, it is unlikely that lead was alloyed with the parent silver for the casket, and doubtful that it would be used for any soldering purposes if made from sheets. However lead might have been present, either as minor contamination from the methods used, or else significantly present in any niello like work, or other similar ornamentation..","date":"2015-12-08","mins":"2:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/ssg-member-wants-to-know/","cat":"history","title":"SSG Member Wants to Know"},{"id":"comment-16771","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is Yannick who is confused. If he’s bothered to read my comment above, he has failed to comprehend what I’ve written. Perhaps he could use Google translate to read it in his native Quebecois better to understand it. Nowhere in there have I asserted that Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object. I dare say it is progress that he seems prepared to concede that the iconography was influenced by the Shroud facial image. But where was it? He says that there’s no mention of a burial cloth in Edessa prior to the relic’s transfer thence to Constantinople. He says perhaps it was in Constantinople, but likewise there’s no mention of the burial cloth in Constantinople, and it wasn’t taken there by Helena. He says perhaps it was in Palestine, Where in Palestine? It certainly wasn’t in Jerusalem after 70 AD, and it certainly wasn’t in Antioch after 540 AD when the city was destroyed. Rebuilding work had commenced there shortly beforehand following eathquakes. Perhaps the Shroud was discovered then, and where’s the nearest other city? Why, Edessa of course! And where does this 6th icongraphy commence, also Edessa! Perhaps he imagines it was in St Catherine’s monastery in Sinai, or perhaps it was in Armenia, or Georgia – Sorry, no record! In the fourth century, Athanasius, the Bishop of Alexandria (ca. 328 373), affirmed that a sacred Christ icon,12 traceable to Jerusalem and the year 68, was then present in Syria: “…but two years before Titus and Vespasian sacked the city [i.e Jerusalem], the faithful and disciples of Christ were warned by the Holy Spirit to depart from the city and go to the kingdom of King Agrippa, because at that time Agrippa was a Roman ally. Leaving the city, they went to his regions and carried everything relating to our faith. At that time even the icon with certain other ecclesiastical objects were moved and they today still remain in Syria. I possess this information as handed down to me from my migrating parents and by hereditary right. It is plain and certain why the icon of our holy Lord and Savior came from Judaea to Syria” Syria must surely mean Antioch. No record in Edessa? Consider these lines from the Edessan poem “Hymn of the Pearl”, in a sindonistic context: “On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness.

John’s gospel does not mention what side the chest wound was inflicted, and the cloth itself would convey the impression that it was on the left. I wonder why the artists showed the correct location of the chest wound on the right, despite the reversal of the arm positions. Perhaps they were following the Easter hymn “I saw water flowing from the right side of the temple” which seems to be based on Ezekiel 47:1 describing the prophet’s vision of the heavenly temple, and applied it to Christ.

The most commonly used cubit derived from ancient Egypt about 3000 BC, and my source (Encyclopedia Britannica) says it pervaded the ancient world and survived into medieval times. But there were several variations in its exact length. An ordinary cubit is given as 45.7cm. The royal cubit was 52.4cm and was standardised by a royal master black granite cubit. Encyc Brit says in some ancient cultures it was as long as 53.1cm. I tried checking out the Assyrian cubit but the website I wanted was down at the time. If it’s 55.6cm as you say, then it seems an anomalously long cubit, granted that there seem to have been signficant Assyrian influences in first century Palestine, (Romans seem to have sometimes delegated governorship of Judea to Assyria – I know this occurred during the inter regnum of Herod the Great and Archelaus for example) But it seems to me that tetradiplon does not convey the meaning of length units. Very likely the cloth was of Assyrian provenance, and so a whole number of Assyrian cubits might well be expected in its dimensions. If only the length is being stated, why not use the word octo instead of tetradiplon?

Apparently few examples of the old script survive although an interest in its revival as a type of ethnic expression has surfaced in the last 100 years or so, e.g. In “Welcome” signs. I personally do not make the connection that Stephen mentions as an “M”. The “Funeral Sermon and Prayer” in the ‘Pray’ manuscript is the oldest known surviving contiguous Hungarian text, written by one scribal hand in the Latin script and dating to 1192 1195. It is found on f.154a of the Codex Pray. I would surmise that by 1192, the old runic script might well have been considered to have pagan connotations, as occurred with the Baltic runes, and there could have even been some revulsion at the idea of including them in a Christian worship hand book. It is possible that the symbol mentioned may be a stylised ‘a’ for “Alpha”, or it may denote something else entirely. It does not have the appearance of a lower case Greek alpha. However if it is intended to be an “Alpha”, I might surmise that it could indicate a new beginning, being associated with the Resurrection scene.

However Markwardt’s ‘Antioch and the Shroud’ 1998 99, also cites several early Syrian sources, and citing references, in discussing the distribution of Passion relics. Samples: “In 1910, local Arabs unearthed, at the traditional site of Antioch’s ancient cathedral,a silver chalice comprised of an unfinished inner cup and a finished outer holder, akin to a reliquary, exquisitely decorated with ten human figures, in two groups of five. Professor William Newbold has noted that only in the middle of the first century did two groups of five men each govern the respective Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch and only at such time would a Christian religious object have displayed such a depiction. Dated to the first century and considered genuine by many archeological and scientific authorities, the Great Chalice of Antioch has been called “a most sacred Cup, in all probability the one which once served the Lord and his disciples at the Last Supper, the most precious object in Christian history, legend and tradition”. [p.4] “In Syria itself, archeologists have discovered, in fourth century tombs, amulets and molded figures connected with the life and passion of Christ, including a zigzag lance, the Cup of the Last Supper, and so called “objects from the resurrection of Lazarus”. Were such resurrection objects actually intended to represent the burial linens of Christ and not those of Lazarus, it could indicate that the lance, the cup, and the Shroud were all copied in Syria during the fourth century. After exhaustively studying the evidence for many years, Professor Gustavus Eisen concluded that these artifacts had, in fact, been modeled upon actual sacred objects that were once kept in seclusion for their safety and were later lost when concealed upon the approach of persecution or war.” [pp 8 9] “Hints of a lost Syrian sindonic history are to be found in the legends of the Holy Grail, an object which, in recent years, has been increasingly linked to the Shroud. Some seventy five years ago, Professor Eisen concluded that the earliest Grail legends attempted to account for the loss of real sacred objects known in fourth century Syria and that these stories reflected a passionate desire to locate and recover such objects from concealment.” [p.13] [daveb]: It would therefore seem that interest in the Grail considerably predates the 12th century, and that they merely reflect an earlier tradition of the loss of the Grail in the 4th century, possibly hidden by the Arian presbyter Theodorus at Antioch in 362 AD to conceal them from confiscation under order by the emperor Julian the Apostate. Theodorus would not reveal the hiding places even under torture and eventual martyrdom.

The latest claim as a forgery comes from Dr Christian Askeland, an assistant research professor at Protestant University Wuppertal, Germany. Dr. Askeland is an evangelical Christian who is also affiliated with Indiana Wesleyan University, an evangelical college in Marion, Indiana. He claims to have identified reasons why the fragment is a fake, including a comparison with a Coptic version of the Gospel of John. Dr Askeland would seem to have his own personal evangelical agenda in asserting the fragment a fake. Among the more objective reports on Dr Askeland’s assertions is a NY Times report at: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/us/fresh doubts raised about papyrus scrap known as gospel of jesuss wife.html? r=0 An extract: “Malcolm Choat, a Coptic expert at Macquarie University in Australia who cautiously contradicted the doubters in his paper last month for the Harvard journal, said in an interview that the new evidence was “persuasive,” but “we’re not completely there yet” — until the John and Jesus wife papyruses can be studied in person or using high resolution images to understand their relationship. Roger Bagnall, a renowned papyrologist who directs the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, and who early on deemed the Jesus’ Wife papyrus likely to be genuine, said in an interview about the skeptics, “Most of the people taking this view wanted it to be a fake, and they haven’t asked critical questions about their own hypothesis.” ” Dr Karen King has never asserted that the fragment is any kind of evidence that Jesus was married, but this is a line that much sensationalist reporting has attempted to represent. If the fragment was ever to turn out to be authentic, it would only indicate that its source group was probably caught up in a debate as to the merits of celibacy vs marriage, and someone favouring marriage had attempted to resolve it by falsely asserting that Jesus was married. Dr Askeland’s assertions come within weeks after Harvard had obtained the results of scientific testing which indicated that the fragment might well be genuine, dating to the 6th to 9th centuries.

Everyone knows that.” That is incorrect and is a popular error promoted by skeptics and anti authenticists. It was first popularised by two Catholic scholars about 1905 as an attempt to discredit Secondo Pia’s photographs of 1898. Herbert Thurston was a Jesuit scholar, and was assisted in his research by Canon Ulysse Chevalier. These two gentlemen seemed to have had an agenda of mythologising traditional beliefs, following a Germanic trend, whereas the photographs were strong evidence that the gospel records were reasonably factual. They produced a paper creating the impression that the draft of Bishop Pierre D’Arcis he originally intended to send to anti Pope Clement VII at Avignon had in fact been dispatched. D’Arcis had his own financial problems to repair his cathedral and was put out that pilgrims were diverted by the Shroud exhibitions at Lirey. Also he may well have been confused by reports that the Shroud had in fact been copied, notably to replace its being taken from Bensancon. Clement VII ordered D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under threat of excommunication.

The exact 4:1 aspect ratio of the TS, is suggestive of it being cut with its resewn selvedge to exact dimensions. Cubit measures varied widely between civilizations, one civilization may have used two or even three different cubits for different purposes, and there is also some confusion in the literature. Unless granite master standards are available (as in Egypt), the local cubit must be determined from measurements of buildings and monuments. Original Egyptian cubit was 457mm; Royal Egyptian cubit was 524mm; Some civilzations used a cubit of up to 560mm. Cubit of the Assyrians derives from their conquest of Babylon 1350 – 612 BCE. Flinders Petrie & Jules Oppert, 19th c. Pioneer archaeologists made numerous measurements of Babylonian buildings; Petrie wrote extensively on the several cubits in use (even including Stonehenge). The Petrie Oppert Assyrian cubit is 546mm (+/ 5mm). Eleanor Guralnick 1996 measured several Sargonid slabs & monuments 721 705 BCE; Guralnick – standard late cubit 515mm, religious royal cubit 566mm, King Sargon slab 550mm. Measurement of TS is commonly taken as 4.34m x 1.09m, and is therefore consistent with the Petrie Oppert Assyrian cubit. Nearly all Egyptian thread is ‘S’ twist, and so TS is unlikely to be of Egyptian provenance. ‘Z’ twist does occur elsewhere in Middle East, despite comments by CF. Various cloth fragments of the sealed tomb of diseased family at Akeldama included both ‘S’ & ‘Z’; At Murraba’at, Grace & Elizabeth Crowfoot recorded seven twill weave fabrics including herringbone twills with ‘Z’ spun warp and mixed ‘S’ & ‘Z’ spun weft, possibly imported. ‘Z’ spin seems to have predominated in northern Europe. Methchild Flury Lemburg on examining the stitching of the TS resewn edge commented that she had only ever previously seen that stitch used at Masada and nowhere else. It is also perhaps significant that only in the Raes corner (resewn?)is there any evidence of cotton, therefore TS is hardly likely to be medieval. None of the above provides irrevocable proof that the TS is of ancient Assyrian provenance. However it is fatuous to assert in the face of the above that there is any conclusive proof that it is not. The evidence is at least not inconsistent with the TS being of Middle East provenance, even of about the 1st century.

Wilson comments further: “Also found at Masada were examples of exactly the same two double thread selvedge as seen on the Shroud, a mode of construction which Gabriel Vial back in the 1980s had described as ‘tout a faite inhabituelle’ – most unusual.” [Gabriel Vial, Bulletin du CIETA, 67, Lyon, 1989, pp 27 29.] O.K. Comment: I disagree that isolated pieces of evidence should be taken only on their own merits. That is not how any legal argument can be mustered. One looks for “weight of evidence”, “coroboration”, I prefer to think in terms of Venn diagrams, where the weight of evidence converges to a singular answer. Twills and ‘Z’ twist were common in northern Europe, and doubtless we can find ells to match, but there are no Dead Sea halophytes there, and they didn’t use Masada type stitching.

Essentially David Roberts is creating a story based on an extremely rare Greek word, in fact the only place it can be found is in Tim 4:13. English transliteration is “phailonen”, and you won’t find it in your on line Greek lexicons. Now try an English Greek lexicon, look up “cloak”, you’ll get about 46 entries, including “phainole” and interestingly, “mandua” (check mantle, mandylion?). Jerome tranlsates phailonen as Latin “paenulam” = a woolen cloak, and translators after him have followed this lead. Hugh’s ref on “Paul’s cloak” makes some very relevant comments. The full text of Tim 4:13 tells Timothy to bring with him the cloak(??) that Paul left with Carpus, along with the books, but especially the parchments. One interpretation is that the phailonen may have been some kind of carrying case (book jacket?) for the literature. Paul would have had easy access to obtaiing a cloak for himself in Rome; alternatively if a cloak is indeed meant, maybe he intended Timothy to use it on the jouorney as winter was approaching. I think it verges on the preposterous to suggest as the video does,that Paul was toting the Turin Shroud around with him as a visual aid to convert the pagans, and he wouldn’t be leaving it with some mate in Troy.

Manuscript, and there is no clear attestation of them until the end of the 2nd century. References to Paul’s various known associates may be an attempt to give some credibility to a Pauline authorship, and the verse II Tim 4:13, (Bring the books & manuscripts with you) may be a similar attempt. It would seem that Jerome thought the word “phailenon” a typo, for the word “phainole”, and others followed likewise. Alternatively it might have been a short lived new word perhaps for a carrying case for the books, that not even Jerome was aware of. There are several better and more viable explanations for the whereabouts of the Shroud, than it being part of Paul’s baggage. Some of these are mentioned in Albert Dreisbach’s 2005 Atlanta paper “Lazarus and Jesus”. Revelations 19:11 14 is highly suggestive; the horseman whose name is “Faithful and True” rides into battle, BUT his cloak is already soaked in blood, and behind him are armies dressed in white linen. There are a number of early references to altar cloths being likened to the Shroud of Christ; VGR above mentions the gospel of the Hebrews where it is given to the servant of the priest (van der Hoeven suggests that it was Mark); there are other references to it being given to Pilate’s wife, thence to Luke, thence to Peter; there are references to Peter wearing it as a turban during ordinations, but more likely this may have been the soudarion.

The three stories all take place in Bethany. In Matt and Mark, the story takes place in the house of Simon the Leper, “and a woman comes in with an alabaster jar of ointment”. However in John’s story,it is in the home of Mary, Martha and Lazarus, and it is Mary who anoints him.

In order to fulfil this commandment in a meticulous and Pharisaic way, even for his all white linen temple garment, Mark probably applied a margin to his mantle by making a long seam a few centimeters from one of its long edges, and made a hole in the corners of this margin, to which a blue cord could be fastened (for out of temple situations, such as in the House of Caiphas in the Upper City and perhaps also Caiphas‟ office palace in Antonia) or loosened (for in temple situations, especially for when in the Chamber of Hewn Stones in the Court of the Israelites).” Page 5, para 4: “Now, in order to remain a secret disciple he had to prevent anyone from recognizing the rolled up burial shroud as his temple sindōn. It would be sufficient to cut off the margin along the ornamental seam, for then this seam would look like an ordinary functional hem, applied to prevent the edge from loosening, and not like the unique ornamental seam of his „talith‟. And he did not have to cut off the margin for the complete length of the cloth, for the seam was only visible in the last and next to last layer of the roll, formed by the ends of the cloth when it is doubled in the middle and rolled up from the fold. And on removing the two ends of the margin he of course simultaneously removed its two holes to which the blue cords were fastened.” Hoeven at least recognises the issue and attempts to deal with it..","date":"2013-03-21","mins":"8:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/20/was-the-shroud-of-turin-a-tablecloth/","cat":"history","title":"Was the Shroud of Turin a Tablecloth?"},{"id":"comment-27993","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I agree with Ron that Hoeven’s theory is far from perfect. I even believe there may be a few glaring errors in it. For example, (s)he seems to me to identify the writers of the second and fourth gospels as the same person, merely on the basis that their Jewish names were John. In the fourth gospel, “the disciple that Jesus loved” is more usually identified with the writer of that gospel, and there seems to be a strong tradition that this was a son of Zebedee, a fisherman, not a temple secretary. This “loved disciple” is the one who hesitates to enter the tomb, but is then supposed to recognize his temple garment. Augustine of course has a different take on “and then he believed (the women)”. However, I think Hoeven makes a credible case for it being a temple garment. In view of Max’s comment, is it possible that it was actually Joseph’s temple garment? It was actually Gamaliel II in the 2nd century who insisted on being buried in a plain weave linen cloth, to counteract the then Jewish trend for extravagant and costly funerals, and the requirement for plain weave shrouds dates from this example. Hoeven covers the case for the requirement of a ritually clean burial cloth by it being a temple garment.

Although Matthew, Luke and John merely say that Joseph (and Nicodemus) wrapped the bosy in a clean shroud, Mark (earliest gospel – source Peter?) says that Joseph PURCHASED a shroud which wouldn’t seem necessary if it was already in possession as a table cloth. A.A.M. Van der Hoeven wrote a paper in 2011, “The Turin Shroud as John Mark’s temple garment” with a considerable amount of supporting evidence, and which seems more credible.

Here’s the opening paragraph: “In this article I will show how the garment left by the young man who “ran away naked” (Mark 14:51 52) became the burial shroud of Jesus. The properties of the Turin Shroud for its identification as a garment, even a priest‟s garment, are its Pharisaic enlarged border and cut off corners (and fringes), its apparel weave, the threads‟ possibly sacerdotal Z twist, and its images of a priest‟s oval ornament and seal with its cord. The most outstanding biblical fact that identifies Jesus‟ shroud as a priest‟s garment is the beloved disciple‟s belief that Jesus had risen because he saw the shroud rolled up and placed aside (John 20:7 8), just as a priest‟s garment was always rolled up and placed aside in the temple. In this article I argue that the beloved disciple was the secret disciple John Mark, the Sanhedrin‟s priest secretary.”.","date":"2013-03-20","mins":"11:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/20/was-the-shroud-of-turin-a-tablecloth/","cat":"history","title":"Was the Shroud of Turin a Tablecloth?"},{"id":"comment-181885","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"At some risk of provoking my dear friend Louis, I see the main value of Crossan as the illumination he provided with his “Power of Parable”.

Ehrman’s personal reaction against his evangelical background towards agnosticism, may only serve to underscore the significance of his insistence on the real historical existence of Jesus, supported by his considerable reputation as a NT scholar, as well as his non biblical references. J P Meier’s “Marginal Jew” has the advantage of a minimalist approach to the question, and therefore leaves no question as to the value of his conclusion. Citing the late first century dates of NT composition is a weak argument against their authenticity, and under rates the value and strength of oral tradition in pre literate societies.

I am not aware that M Flury Lemburg has ever asserted that there were any funeral cloths like the TS at Masada. The extract I’ve mentioned in Ian Wilson’s text is confined solely to the type of stitching in the invisible weave between a side strip and the main cloth when the cloth was originally made up. The apparent purpose would seem to be to create the impression that the cloth was an entire weave by providing selvedges on both the outer edges. It was only revealed when the backing cloth of the TS was removed under the direction of Mme F L. Her comment was that in her 40 years of working with ancient textiles, she had only come across this particular stitching from cloths recovered from Masada. There is no mention there of what purpose such Masada cloths were intended. One might well suppose that if a tailor was expert in the method, he might apply it to all sorts of purposes where invisible weaving was desired. I am well aware of Diana Fulbright’s paper on other Akeldama Judean cloths, and there is previous recent comment on her paper on this site, some of it for whatever reason adverse, and even hostile. I suspect it may have been because a correspondent disliked her findings, or because of professional jealousy, accusing her of being no expert in such matters, an ad hom argument rather than ad rem. As I recall, the intention of the Fulbright paper was to demonstrate that 1st century weavers, Judean and others, were quite capable of intricate, elaborate and complex weaves, including the 3:1 herring bone twill such as on the TS. Plain weaves for burial cloth purposes, only became fashionable for the well to do in the 2nd century when Gamaliel II set such an example, to discourage a previous extravagance in funerary attire, which up till then seems to have been a fairly normal type of practice..","date":"2013-07-26","mins":"5:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/25/what-did-wilson-andor-flury-lemberg-actually-observe-about-stitching/","cat":"history","title":"What did Wilson and/or Flury-Lemberg actually observe about stitching?"},{"id":"comment-39776","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"CF: “I do think, however, that Fulbright needed to make it clearer which of her examples were wool and which linen or silk.” Charles, I really cannot see that the criticism is valid.

The thrust of her argument seems to me to be twofold: 1) Against the popular press argument that the TS was proved to be non authentic by the single sample Akeldama discovery of a plain weave shroud present in the tomb of a leprous and tubercular family, which had been sealed, presumably to prevent public infection; 2) Against the argument that elaborate weaves were beyond the competence of 1st century weavers when there were any number of counter examples, not only from the 1st century, but was widely and extensively prevalent for several centuries beforehand.

He may return to his ivory tower where no doubt a trail of sycophants may admire his further efforts on Byzantine scholarship, and other such related topics. His tirade contains gross errors, subjective judgements presented as fact, and contradictions. The one true scientist he mentions in his catalogue of scholars, Galileo, had nothing to say on the Shroud that is recorded. Furthermore his treatment of the Galileo case is superficial; the matter was much more complex than his invented categories of exoheretics and endoheretics allows. Galileo’s error was essentially an error of political judgement. He had won acclaim from fellow scientists, church, popes and cardinals for his discoveries. His casting of Simplicio as the protagonist of the Ptolemaic system was widely seen as an ungrateful lampooning of his former patron Pope Urban VIII. The Dominican inquisitors with their commitment to Thomistic philosophy had a vested interest in presenting newly discovered works of Aristotle, which were contradicted by the new physics. The critical document that condemned Galileo is now widely seen as fraudulent, or the best that might be said for it was that it may have been some clerk’s draft that Bellarmine had in fact rejected. The catalogue of “experts” listed by DA are essentially all historians of one type or another, and they are the ones who must deal with it.

The appearance of the Vignon markings on early iconography and coinage could have had only one origin, the marks that we now see on the Shroud.

Included in the paper is an indication that the so called Image of Edessa may well have had a part in the conversion of Abgar the Great. In summary: 1) A 6th c. Entry in the Liber Pontificalis records that Pope Eleutherius (174 189) received a letter from ‘British king Lucius’ (Britannio rege Lucio) asking that he might be made a Christian through his agency. Venerable Bede in 731 repeats this account, and that the king’s baptism was soon effected. However, Britain in the 2nd century was under Roman rule and had no king. 2) In 1904, Adolph Harnack deduced that the entry was not intended to refer to Britain, but to the ‘Britio Edessenorum’, Edessa’s citadel, and not to King Lucius, but to King Lucius Ælius Septimius Megas Abgarus VIII of Edessa, otherwise known as Abgar the Great. 3) Abgar’s letter to Eleutherius could only have been sent with his most trusted confidantes, his ‘pasgriba’ and father in law Ma’nu, and his wife (Ma’nu’s daughter) Queen Shalmath. 4) There is only one documented late 2nd c. Ecclesiastical journey which begins in Rome and ends in Mesopotamia, that by Avercius Marcellus, bishop of Hieropolis (180 200), recorded on his epitaph and repeated in two other accounts. 5) Avercius recounts that he is a disciple of a holy shepherd who feeds flocks of sheep on mountains and on plains, “And to Rome he sent me to contemplate majesty, and to see a queen golden robed and golden sandaled; there also I saw a people bearing a shining mark.” The reference to a queen would seem to imply Queen Shalmath. 6) On departing Rome, Avercius writes: ““And I saw the land of Syria and all its cities, Nisibis I saw when I passed over Euphrates”. He would have travelled on the Silk Road, through Edessa and Antioch. The glaring omission of both these cities in the narrative may suggest that something historic, but too dangerous to acknowledge, may well have occurred there. 7) Avercius also seems to write: ““But everywhere I had brethren. I had Paul.” The Doctrine of Addai records that a Christian named Palut serves as an aide to the missionary Addai, and on his death assumes leadership of the Edessan Church. A cleric named Palut was appointed by Bishop Serapion of Antioch in 198 to establish orthodox Christianity in Edessa, and in 200 was ordained first bishop of Edessa. 8) Avercius writes further: “Faith everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands from a fountain and this it ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread.” A “fish of exceeding great size” could hardly refer to the eucharist (more usually rendered as a small fish held in both hands, and also separately mentioned by the reference to bread and wine). 9) The reference to the ‘great fish’ might well indicate that Avercius was entrusted with temporary custody of the Shroud as part of his missionary kit to Edessa, and may explain the inclusion of the the portrait in the Abgar story. As I have explained at #6, the account of the conversion of Abgar and Edessa was too dangerous to set down in its literal form, but was written up as an analogy. Only the names were changed, to protect the guilty!.","date":"2014-01-06","mins":"5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"id":"comment-72437","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think I can agree with most of what O.K. Has written above. I cannot recall a single paper contributing to our understanding of the TS that was ever written by a scholar with “no interest whatsoever in the Shroud”. In fact such an inference would be self contradictory. It is evident that the phantom of Yannick continues to misunderstand such issues, as did his more corporeal predecessor. What does it mean to say that a document, such as the Doctrine of Addai, is unauthentic? Clearly it was written by some person of influence living in Edessa, with an interest in that city, and with a deliberate purpose in mind, apparently in an attempt to explain how Christianity came there, and as Eusebius mentions included in the Edessa archives. As such it is pseudonymous, a common enough practice for good reasons, as even Yannick’s current hero, Dale Martin mentions in his video. It was not written by some random individual from Babylon for no purpose whatsoever. It is a serious mistake, as Markwardt shows, to take the story at its face value, as a letter from Agbar Ukkama to Jesus, and that Jesus provided a written response, and then claim that the story therefore has no significance. However, those brought up on a diet of literalism, will never understand such a distinction. The tradition of the “disciplina arcana” was never accepted nor understood by the 15th century Protestant reformers, determined to claim a strict literalism in the scriptures, and this outlook has permeated and persists in much of ordinary secular scholarship even yet. Yannick and the army of scholarly detractors, will never be able to penetrate the meaning of the Abgar legend, so long as they continue their narrow focus on a literal interpretation of the text. The Doctrine of Addai is pseudonymous, not only in its authorship, but also in its caste of characters, as Markwardt has effectively shown with a most credible explanation of its actual meaning.

Eusebius gives a version of the story in 325 AD, which he claimed to have obtained from the Edessa archives, but asserts it as a forgery. He does not mention the portrait, most likely because he is something of an iconoclast. Jack Markwardt offers to my mind a very credible explanation. He notes that it was unlikely to have been written in the 1st century as it would then make Edessa so apostolically pre eminent that it would never have subordinated itself in 200 AD to the Church in Antioch. Markwardt postulates that it was written at the behest of Abgar the Great to mark the city’s conversion to Christianity. It was written as an allegory out of caution. A papal mission to Edessa could only have occurred during the reign of the tolerant emperor Commodus between 180 AD and 193 AD. An Edessan coin during this period shows Abgar the Great with a cross on his tiara, and also the emperor Commodus. In 194 AD the succeeding emperor Septimus Severus took Abgar’s rule from him for supporting Parthia against Rome, but he was retored to favour in 198 AD. On the accession of the less tolerant Severus, Abgar neutralised the Christian imagery of his coinage. Pope Eleutherius would only have dispatched a mission to Edessa during the period 180 AD to 189 AD. Abgar would not have accepted baptism after 193 AD. In 201 AD, Severus banned conversions to Christianity. The dilemma of recording the significant event of the city’s conversion was overcome by invoking the “disciplina arcana” and writing it up as an analogy (parables again!). Thus in the Abgar legend, we can make the following substitutions: Abgar the Great seeking redemption becomes Abgar Ukkama a first century monarch seeking a cure; Abgar’s letter to Pope Eleutherius becomes his distant predecessor’s correspondence to Jesus; Ma’nu the royal emissary to Eleutherius becomes Hanan the 1st century archivist as emissary to Jesus; Eleutherius who authorises a papal mission becomes Jesus approving a posthumous apostolic mission; Bishop Avircius the papal missionary becomes Addai Christ’s emissary; Palut, Avircius’ companion and future bishop of Edessa, becomes Aggai, Addai’s principal aide. There is much more to it. For those who wish to pursue Markwardt’s explanation further, refer: “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” By Jack Markwardt, 2008 Ohio Conference: http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf Markwardt also asserts that the Mandylion had a role in Abgar’s conversion, but believes it was mainly stored in Antioch, until that city’s destruction by earthquake and the Persians, when it was then taken to Edessa. Certainly there was some venerated cloth object in Edessa, very likely with an image, and generally known as the Image of Edessa, or Mandylion, and quite conceivably it may have been the Shroud, but showing only the facial image..","date":"2014-01-06","mins":"7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"id":"comment-72852","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Mention Wilson, and suddenly Yannick develops a blind spot, and no matter what one has to say on the subject, it’s like a red rag to a bull, we get yet another lecture telling us how no historian agrees with Wilson.
