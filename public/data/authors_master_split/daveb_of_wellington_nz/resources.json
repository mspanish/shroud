A frequent like complaint against his article expressed by several on this web site, including authenticity sceptic Colin, is that it is utterly unsupported by any scientific evidence, and in the opinion of many is actually contradicted by such scientific evidence as there is. Touche! Of particular value in the ongoing debate in my view is the several fascinating related art works that have come to light as a result, which many of us were utterly unaware of. The existence of these works is a significant phenomenon, but it is in the interpretation of their significance which remains elusive. Which influenced what? Charles’ advocates seem to be taking the position that the Shroud falls within the genre. Contrariwise, his opponents might tend to take the position that it was the revelation of the authentic burial cloth of Christ that produced and influenced the genre and the consequential art works. One significant criticism I think is that the article is highly speculative, relying as it does on the ‘flaky paint’ idea which remains utterly unsubstantiated, and cannot explain the particular properties of the image. Whether the approach would satisfy the “historical critical” method mentioned by Andrea Nicoletti from time to time is a matter I am not qualified to comment, but I would say that it does not seem to be particularly evident here. Charles has mentioned that he has been in contact with various experts concerning his thesis and has claimed to have won some support. I would guess that they are of a like mind to his own, no doubt art experts in their various field, and unsympathetic to any pro authenticity argument. I would wonder how well they understand what work has been achieved in the scientific investigations of the Shroud, how little they might actually know about it, and if any of them have anything resembling a scientific qualification of any kind. The whole business underscores the necessity of a multi disciplinary approach in evaluating the object. Specialists locked in their own little world by themselves may be able to shed some light on singular aspects of the Shroud, but left to themselves will not give the answers that many of us crave and seek concerning this fascinating topic. Whether it is a matter of textiles, artistic significance, historic documentation, the cloth’s origins, how the image may have been produced, its properties, corroborating evidence, forensics, botany, chemistry or physics, burial rites, significant contaminations, liturgical significance, there is plenty here that needs be considered. Only a holistic approach to the problem is likely to produce a satisfying answer. Each must consider how work by others in related and unrelated fields must be weighed against one’s own endeavours. This too often seems to be sadly lacking, with the inevitable result that it takes us all into blind alleys!.","date":"2014-11-04","mins":"4:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"id":"comment-169024","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"CF: “The chances that it was the burial cloth of Christ were always remote and I think pope Francis is right in not encouraging that belief.” Quote from following thread, ‘Papa Francesco’ Wire Service quoting Pope Francis: “I’m pleased to announce that, God willing, I will go on a pilgrimage to Turin on June 21 to venerate the Holy Shroud and honour Saint John Bosco on the 200th anniversary of his birth.” Charles responded to Antero’s comments on skeptics’ attitude by citing his credentials, which is fair enough, but continues to refrain from responding to the evidence from Science. I gather that is because he makes no claim for competence to do so. But I don’t see that it can be an excuse to ignore it. He mentions the various liturgical ceremonies, which is the phenomenon, but it is in the interpretation of the phenomenon which I believe is astray. The question is, “Which influenced what?” He sees the production of the Shroud for the purpose of a convenient prop in the celebration of the ceremonies.

It is correct that the ‘suffering servant’ section seems to be from the end of the Babylonian exile, whereas the ministry of the original prophet Isaiah extended from 742 – 701 BC. Chapters 40–55 (Second Isaiah, or Deutero Isaiah) are generally attributed to an anonymous poet who prophesied toward the end of the Babylonian exile. From this section come the great oracles known as the Servant Songs, which are reflected in the New Testament understanding of the passion and glorification of Christ. Subsequent chapters 56 66 (Trito Isaiah) are post exilic. I see it is as no coincidence that there is a very close correspondence between Isaiah’s suffering servant, which he likely identifies as Israel, and the sufferings of Christ. The document Lumen Gentium sees the Old Testament account of the Jewish people as a type of pre figuring of the New Testament events. I see it all as part of God’s purpose in revealing himself in the person of Christ over the course of very many centuries.

There is a persuasive argument that this is Jerusalem road dust from the TSM walking to the place of execution and from a fall during this journey. As to any other limestone present, it will depend on whether it is in the form of dust or has merely been shown to be optically present. If in the form of dust it would be desirable to know if it is Ca CO3 or aragonite, the two different minerals indicating separate sources. If it has been only shown to be merely optically present, it is easily explained by absorption during the retting process of the flax in a limestone environment, which would include the environs of Jerusalem; retting would also explain the presence of iron, quantification of trace minerals such as strontium potentially indicating a specific site. The pattern of the poker holes would suggest it may have then been folded to match the size of an altar table. It has been argued that the holes may have been formed by grains of incense when the cloth may have been used as an altar cloth or even a corporal as Max suggests. The ancient historical sources equating the altar cloths with the burial cloths is at least suggestive that it may have been used at some type of special liturgy for this purpose. If the limestone is dust, it may have adhered to the cloth from the tomb or else from a limestone altar table.

I would surmise he is well enough versed in what constitutes fraud, and no less to write about particular cases, perhaps even more so than any historian. Thurston may have offered his own explanation for the origins of the Shroud, but it is Markwardt’s charge that it was Thurston and Chevalier who entered a conspiracy to deceive by impugning the Shroud’s reputation. Part of his conclusion is as follows: “In order to defeat the conservative clergy, Chevalier and Thurston entered into a civil conspiracy when, with knowledge of a plan by their progressive colleagues to cause serious injury to the reputation of the Shroud of Turin, they employed improper means designed to accomplish that end. Confronted by the truly confounding nature of the scientific evidence presented by Pia’s photographic negatives, they were forced to base their entire case against the authenticity of the Shroud upon the D’Arcis Memorandum. By publishing a fictional transcription of that document and manufacturing a convenient date for same, Chevalier effectively created the false illusion that the memorandum’s charges of forgery were credible because they had been submitted to, and reviewed by, the Pope in Avignon. By purposefully truncating his translation of that document, so as to exclude evidence that would have shown it to be a mere draft and would have contradicted Chevalier’s arbitrary dating, Thurston effectively confirmed this false illusion.” There is more which can be read in Markwardt’s paper. “Several years after publishing his abbreviated translation of the D’Arcis Memorandum, Thurston authored several articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia that labeled the Shroud a scandalous product of unscrupulous medieval miscreants and he steadfastly maintained this position for the rest of his life.” The 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia article that Thurston wrote remains on line on the New Advent site today but is now merely of archival interest. Despite the Pia negatives being available to him, Thurston’s article maintained that the image was painted, and made observations on the blood stains that are patently false, as determined by the 1978 STURP project.

The second half of Luke’s Acts deals with his journeys with Paul, yet they often seem not consistent with some of Paul’s theology expressed in the epistles. A particular perspective: Matthew is concerned to portray Jesus as the new Moses, and his gospel is directed at a gentile community. So he arranges to bring the infant Jesus out of Egypt, based on what may be a fictional massacre by Herod. He has Jesus preach his sermon from a mountain (like Moses) whereas Luke has him preaching from level ground, And there are other pointers to this Mosaic interpretation by Matthew.

It tended to develop with the rise of the individual agricultural revolutions following the hunting and foraging periods of the several civilisations. Probably one of the earliest alphabetic script of about 1400 BCE concerns an epic of the Phoenician god Baal Hadad, a young virile god who dies in the autumn but is resurrected in the spring. The cult had an attraction for the early agricultural Israelites, and was often condemned by the prophets, notably Ezekiel. A feature of such fertility cults sometimes involved human sacrifice in order to fertilise the soil. Following the return of the exiles, many of those who had married non Jewish spouses were forbidden to return to Jerusalem and there was a strong Jewish settlement in Alexandria, eventually giving rise to the Greek Septuagint. I have sometimes wondered whether their exposure to Egyptian funerary practices, together with the philosophy of Alexandrian Greek Platonism may have influenced the maturing development of resurrection theology from about 200 BCE. This developing pattern seems evident in some of the later deutero canonical works of the Septuagint..","date":"2015-07-25","mins":"3:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/24/barrie-schwortz-to-speak-at-49th-annual-jalsa-salana-uk-convention-in-hampshire-england/","cat":"article","title":"Barrie Schwortz to Speak at 49th Annual Jalsa Salana UK Convention in Hampshire, England"},{"id":"comment-205458","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin, I have been narrating these Passion readings every Easter at my parish church for at least 20 years, probably longer.

I haven’t included the informative annotations but you can easily check them out yourself, if you wish to learn more. The meaning is plain enough. Mark’s is the basic original narrative, and the other evangelists have built on it either adding material known to them, or else omitting material by way of refinement. The basic events are that Joseph took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and placed him in the tomb. What part of this don’t you understand? Individual additions are: ‘laid in a tomb hewn out of the rock’; ‘rolled a stone against the entrance’; ‘no one had yet been buried there’; ‘it was Joseph’s tomb and he had hewn it’; ‘Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes’; ‘bound the body with burial cloths along with the spices according to the Jewish burial custom’; ‘there was a garden and the tomb was close by’. All perfectly consistent! Mark 15:45 46 44 Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died. 45 And when he learned of it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 46 Having bought a linen cloth, he took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb. Matthew 27:58 60 58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be handed over. 59 Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it [in] clean linen 60 and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed. Luke 23:52 54 52 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 53 After he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried. 54 It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin. John 38:38 42 38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body. 39 Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds. 40 They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. 41 Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. 42 So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by..","date":"2015-07-13","mins":"3:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne"},{"id":"comment-206366","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"So an anti hoaxer has been hoaxed into believing that the Shroud of Turin is a hoax, the victim of his own anti hoaxing smugness!

A place of refuge from various threats is a recurring theme in the OT. The vessel carrying the tablets of stone given to Moses was called an ark, was carried through the desert by the ancient Israelites, and is finally placed in the Holy of Holies in Solomon’s temple. In New Testament Christianity, the Church will be seen as a type of the ark, outside of which there is no salvation. On the Sea of Galilee, the lives of the apostles are threatened by the storm, and by drowning, but Jesus comes towards them across the stormy waters, or in another version of a similar story he is with them in the boat but is asleep, and they wake him to calm the storm.

Maybe he’s a post modernist who doesn’t believe in facts anyway, so what’s his opinion worth? He’s obviously ignorant of Ian Wilson’s credible reconstruction of the the Shroud’s history, supported by extensive documentation. Fact 1: 544 AD, Persian prince Khosraw with formidable army is repulsed from Edessa’s walls; Attributed to protective powers of the Jesus imprinted cloth, confidently referred to as being brought to Edessa during reign of Abgar V, five centuries earlier. Cloth had been recenty found sealed above the city gates, where it had been hidden when Abgar’s successors reverted to paganism. Contemporary accounts refer to it as “not by hand made”, some call it a “sindon”, and also as “tetradiplon”, doubled in four, that it was therefore a much larger cloth folded considerably smaller than its full size. Fact 2: Previous depictions of Jesus in art, had shown him as beardless. From this time on (544) the distinctive depictions of Jesus as long haired and bearded, with many of the incidental features of the “Shroud” face (Vignon markings).emerge and are extensively copied and distributed throughout Eastern Christendom. Yet, prior to 430 AD, St Augustine of Hippo had previously mentioned a general ignorance in his time about the physical appearance of Jesus. Coinage is issued showing the Jesus likeness. Fact 3: 943 AD: Byzantine general with large army at Edessa’s walls, negotiates for surrender of Jesus imprinted cloth, in return for sparing the city and the release of Muslim prisoners. Cloth is taken to Constantinople. Under Byzantine religious culture, public showings are extremely rare. Fact 4: 1130 AD: High ranking western visitors to Constaninople are occasionally shown treasures of the relic collection. Normandy based monk Orderic Vitalis and others report that the Edessa cloth, besides Jesus’ facial imprint, displays ‘the form and size of the Lord’s body to all who look upon it’. Fact 5: ~1192: Hungary’s ‘Pray manuscript’ shows body of Jesus laid out totally naked in identical ‘crossed hands’ style to Shroud. The drawings depict the mysterious triple poker holes (ordeal by fire about 679 AD?), as well as indications of the 3 in 1 herring bone weave of the Shroud textile, Fact 6: 1204: French led Fourth Crusade sacks Contantinople with pillaging of several relics. Edessa Mandylion disappears. In 1205, letter to Pope Innocent III complains of loss of “the linen in which Our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death”. Wilson makes a strong case for it being kept in secret by the Knights Templar until their suppression by Philip the Fair 1307 1314. Fact 7: 1344: French knight Geoffry I de Charny, first known Western owner of the Shroud fights Turks in Smyrna. In 1349, back in France, he seeks and obtains permission from Pope Clement VI to build a church in his home village of Lirey, where the Shroud is later exhibited. Connections can be made between Geoffrey I and an earlier namesake of the Knights Templar burnt at the stake with Jaques de Molay, both high dignitaries of the order. Geoffrey de Charney is killed at the Battle of Poitiers 1356, before he is ready to divulge his ownership of the Shroud. Fact 8: 1356; Bishop Henry of Troyes praises Geoffry I de Charny for his founding of the Lirey church. In 1389, his successor Bishop D’Arcis of Troyes instigates royal officials to seize the Shroud from Geoffrey II de Charny but are folied. Bishop D’Arcis writes forceful letter to Pope Clement VII, claiming that Bishop Henry had looked into the matter and that it had been cunningly painted. Pope Clement VII declines his request that showings be stopped and orders Bishop D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication. Letter from Bishop D’Arcis is devoid of any documentary or factual evidence or proof, even though any documentation would have been available to him. His charge seems to be based on hearsay. Conclusion: To say that the Shroud emerged out of nowhere in 1353 is a gross exaggeration. A credible history can be reconstructed. We do not have the testimony of two bishops, but only one bishop who alleges that his predecessor found that it had been “cunningly painted”, apparently based on hearsay. Clearly the image was not painted, cunningly or otherwise. He did not convince Pope Clement VII, but quite the reverse. Still, the author probably got paid for his efforts of misrepresentation. Clearly it is the readers of “Bent Spoon” who are being scammed! ..","date":"2012-02-05","mins":"2:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/31/bent-spoon-article-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Bent Spoon Article on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-206429","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There were several “world wide” flood stories in the Middle East that predated the Genesis story of Noah. It is typical of civilisations subject to random flooding bringing disaster that they will produce flood stories, and they even extend to India and other widely scattered locations. In ancient Egypt, there were no such flood stories, presumably because the annual flooding of the Nile was predictable, and seen as benign and essential for maintaining soil fertility. The most notable story, was included as the eleventh tablet in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which dates from the third millenium, and was introduced subsequently, and is known from the library of Assurbanipal. Following the death of his companion Enkidu. Gilgamesh goes on a quest to search for the secret of immortality. The secret is held by Utnapishtim, who dwells at the mouth of the rivers, and had been saved from the disastrous flood wrought by the gods. In this story, the flood is seen as a deliberate spontaneous but erratic act to destroy humanity. Utnapishtim as a protege of Ea is saved by means of an ark he builds, as in the Noah story. In some other versions, he goes under the name Ziusudra or Atrahasis which date from the second millenium. The writers of the Noah story evidently became acquainted with such stories during the Babylonian exile, so that it is a fairly late inclusion in Genesis. However the Judaic authors have their own agenda and interpretation, seeing the Lord their God as just and merciful, that man is perverse, and that God saves his faithful ones, and so design the moral of the story to suit their own purpose. Although the Utnapishtim story remains as the best known, the Noah story is best seen against a general background of such flood stories, rather than any particular one. The original concept of an ark, may have been suggested by a peculiar rock formation such as that apparently in the neighbourhood of Mt Ararat, and is an aetiological component of the story, designed to explain its origin, and also to provide the saving transport in the story. The ark is a potent symbol both in Judaism and in later Christianity. A peculiar salt pillar formation is probably behind the story of Lot’s wife. Such aetiology is a common feature of ancient and primal myths.

Certainly Prof Fanti has no known medical forensic pathology qualifications enabling him to make such a judgement. The caution is based on Pierre Barbet’s insistence that a dislocation will result in a shortening of the arm, not a lengthening. Barbet has the arms stretched out at right angles to the body for nailing to the patibulum lying on the ground. On elevation, the body sag results in the arms taking a position at 65deg to the vertical. He writes: “… there has been a good deal of talk about the arms being lengthened by dislocation, and I have had some difficulty in convincing good friends of the shroud who are not, however, versed in anatomy; this is a matter that need some understanding. Dislocation could only take place in the joints of the shoulder and the elbow. A dislocation of one or the other would shorten the arm and would not lengthen it.” A shortening is not what is seen on the Shroud image. The result of suspension from the wrists can result in an elongation of four or five centimetres at the most, and this conforms to the geometry of the arm taking up the position from horizontal to 65deg as the hypoteneuse of the triangulation. “Doctor at Calvary” Pierre Barbet, 1963; ‘The Wounds of the Hands, p.107. Barbet had his original French work published in 1950; It would seem that the Padua and Palermo medical authorities have yet to be aware of it.

Some vary in their general approach according to the make up of their congregation. It seems that the parent bodies of the earlier churches are still in existence and I have heard that among some Union Churches there is some feeling of isolation from their various parent churches who seem reluctant to acknowledge them.

Let us suppose that I am unable to accept the literal truth of the resurrection of Jesus as expressed in the gospels and in the preaching of Paul. I may for instance find reasons why the apostles were mistaken, that the evangelists in proclaiming the message of Jesus iced the cake by introducing a mythic element of bodily resurrection, or that their message really meant something else and that the myth has been perpetuated in the church, and that we have failed to understand what was really meant. However I am impressed by the social teaching of Jesus, his message of brotherly love, his sense of liberation from the fetters of the past, his sense of justice, of what constitutes true religion in the works of mercy, of doing good to others, even one’s enemy. I may see this as a message that needs whatever it takes to survive, and to be embraced by all mankind. I might then see the resurrection of Christ as present in spirit in the body of the church, or present in a sense of fellowship, or present in the persons of the suffering. I reach out to this Christ as if he himself were truly present in these ways. Is this not a better way than that of the atheist who rejects any sense of the divine or any sense of mystery? Is it fair to cast the stones of judgment against those who have honestly come to such a decision, for there are many of them? Perhaps they follow more closely to the teachings of Jesus than those who prefer to rely on tired old doctrinal formulae. That is the challenge and decision point for the Christian to make.

I would concur with Louis that there are too many doubts about the Manopello image, but Badde has his two witnesses with the Oviedo relic, and of course there are many more independent witnesses in the New Testament and even a few in the contemporary secular literature. J P Meier’s response to criticisms of the alleged unreliability of the NT seems to have been to have adopted a minimalist approach in his attempts to deal with the historical questions. Bultmann’s legacy still survives, even though he is now considered passe. He was correct in asserting that Jesus survived in the kerygma, in the proclamation of the apostles, but wrong in asserting that his bones were somewhere in Palestine. That apostolic proclamation was that Jesus did indeed survive death and was resurrected in body and spirit, not merely in his teaching. The legacy of Bultmann is pervasive. Within the last year or so a posting here confirmed that many clergymen (even a majority) in England rejected the bodily resurrection as a literal truth. It also seemed to influence Hans Kung. The Jesus Seminar remains an influential movement. In 1967 here in NZ, a Presbyterian theologian, Lloyd Geering, gained a high profile when he was arraigned before the General Assembly for denying the resurrection and disturbing the peace and unity of the Presbyterian church. The charges were brought by a conservative group of laymen and a conservative minister, but were dismissed without being much discussed. Geering became a highly influential spokesman in the NZ religious scene. Googling on his name will reveal a highly prolific literary output on religious themes, all of course denying the resurrection, and denying the notion that God is a real supernatural being who created and continues to look over the world. Aged now 97, he has until recently continued to have a high outspoken and controversial profile. He was honoured in 1988 as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 2001 as Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. In the 2007 New Year Honours List he was made a Member of the Order of New Zealand. In 2009, his status as a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit was re designated to that of Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. My own personal belief is that God wills that all shall be saved (c.f. Lumen Gentium). However rejecting God in the certain knowledge of his existence would be a sin for which there could be no forgiveness. Consequently He wills that belief shall remain a matter of faith only.

If a government can obtain supply, then this is usually no more than a matter of routine, and it would be exceeding rare for a G G to withhold the Queen’s assent, even if he had personal or conscience objections to the bill. The most notable case of a G G acting against the wishes of Parliament was in 1975 when Governor General Kerr dismissed Australian Labour Prime M Inister Gough Whitlam, as Whitlam was unable to get his legislation past the Opposition dominated Senate. Kerr dissolved Parliament by proclamation, declared Opposition leader Malcolm Fraser as interim Prime Minister on condition that supply would be granted, and then called for a general election which Fraser won by a land slide.

Much of the core Passion story seems due to Mark, which a strong tradition says he had from Peter. However both Matthew and Luke also introduce new material, which they know about independently of Mark and of each other. John also seems to take Mark as the core story, but introduces a lot more. So far that’s four very nearly independent witnesses. However John goes further, and stymies any apparition fable that may have developed by introducing the story of Thomas, the reluctant believer, and Thomas is told to touch the wounds in the hands and the sides. You can’t touch an apparition, nor a ghost! In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke has some disciples on the way to Emmaus and they encounter the Lord, at first unrecognised. He eats with them, as he did when he first appeared in the upper room. Ghosts and apparitions don’t eat, nor do they need food. Mary Magdalen mistook him for the gardener. Could she mistake an apparition for a gardener? Paul an avid persecutor of the first followers, and a well educated man (a Pharisee), was so overwhelmed by his encounter that he became the greatest missionary the church has known.

The first missionaries here were English Anglican led by Samuel Marsden in the early 1800s. Irish goldminers, and ex convicts from Australia gave a Catholic presence, and Bishop Pompallier with his French Marists arrived here in 1837. The colony’s founding document was the Treaty of Waitangi signed by most of the Maori chiefs from about 1840, after which there was extensive British immigration. Many of the settlers had been familiar with the religious dissensions and strife in their home countries. Some were glad to leave them behind, others brought their dissension with them. In 1870 the NZ Parliament passed the Education Act which made education free, compulsory and secular. The secular clause had a profound effect on the NZ religious outlook. Heavy NZ involvement in two World Wars on the other side of the globe, and subsequently in the Pacific also had their effect in forming the NZ psyche. We are led to believe that NZ is fundamentally now a secular society, but there is still a strong Christian presence, and for the most part there are good relations between the several denominations. There are about eight universities in New Zealand from Auckland in the north to Dunedin in the south, a few of which have Religious Studies departments. Geering was a significant forming influence in the founding of these departments. The Presbyterian Church in NZ has had a reputation for heresy trials, and consequently Geering was arraigned before the General Assembly as a result of promulgating his beliefs. As I mentioned above, he has had a prodigious literary output, and in his time was the darling of religious broadcasters, and a favourite of lecture circuits.

The word “depingere” = ‘to paint from’ conveys well enough the idea of ‘depiction’ rather than ‘to apply paint’ as does “pingere”. There are several possible reasons why Pierre D’Arcis might be motivated against the expositions at Lirey. He would not know of the Byzantine traditions of images “not made by human hands”, the gospel Passion narratives omit any reference to an imaged cloth, and he would see it as his episcopal duty to suppress any new superstitious cults from arising. Pilgrims were flocking to this small country village, whereas his own cathedral was languishing in a state of disrepair.

It suffices more or less to refer to the text in the comment above provided by Colin on May 4 at 2:00 am. Firstly, D’Arcis himself had not spoken with the alleged artist. He is reporting what he believes the investigations of Bishop Henri found some 34 years previously, and he was writing in Latin. He is claiming that Bishop Henri inquired into the matter, and who did Henri consult? D’Arcis says that Henri was urged by many “responsible people” to investigate it, and that Henri consulted “many theologians and (others)” who declared it could not be the true Shroud of Christ. Why? Because the gospels did not mention it, and if it had occurred then the evangelists would have done so! That is a fairly specious kind of reasoning, In the situation of the early Church there were excellent grounds for not mentioning certain matters that needed to be kept secret (disciplina arcana). Note that no names of specific theologians who Henri is said to have consulted are mentioned. D’Arcis then continues: “In the end, after a thorough investigation and interrogation, and that the fact would not remained hidden until today, he discovered the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by (the?) artist who painted(?) it, namely that it was the talented work of said man, and not miraculously wrought or bestowed by divine grace “ Note that this artist remains unnamed, unknown, and Latin having no definite article, it could have been anyone who painted any cloth like the Shroud some 35 years previously. Does Bishop D’Arcis provide any corroboration for his allegation? Not a citation, no reference from his episcopal archives, no quotation from what Bishop Henri had written, all indirect reporting. Furthermore no document has ever been found or identified written by Bishop Henri that would corroborate anything that D’Arcis claims about Henri’s investigations. Contrariwise, it is known that Bishop Henri was effusive in his praise for the De Charney’s efforts in founding the Lirey Church with its canons, and had nothing to say against their character, which would hardly be the case if there were any suspicion of fraud. D’Arcis’ claims appear to be reduced to hearsay, and what he believed to be the case from what he had heard. He may well be a hostile witness, as his cathedral is losing pilgrims to a tiny village church, and is badly in need of cash for major repairs. What we know of D’Arcis’ writing is mainly due to Chevalier and Thurston, writing about 1905 and who had their own agenda, in following the developing Germanic theology, which sought to mythologise the Passion and Resurrection narratives in the scriptures, whereas Pia’s photography and Delage’s forensics had given them a more literal likelihood and challenged this direction. This situation in the Church at the time prompted Pope Pius X to write his well known encyclical against Modernism, “Pascendi Dominici gregis” on Sep 8, 1907. A reading of this encyclical will demonstrate the directions that many churchmen of the time sought to achieve. Skeptics who cite the D’Arcis memorandum as evidence against the authenticity of the Shroud are on swampy ground! If Bishop Henri solis ever discovered how the Shroud “was cunningly painted” then no one else ever since has yet been able to deduce this secret!.","date":"2015-05-06","mins":"6:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198531","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"In 1344 Geoffrey I de Charney had already won a hero’s reputation for his part in capturing the harbour fortress at Smyrna. Back in France in 1349, he petitioned Pope Clement VI to found a collegiate church in his home village of Lirey with six canons. On 1350, Jan 1 in an unsuccessful attempt to regain Calais, he is captured by the English and taken prisoner, not being released until 1354 when he now petitions Avignon Pope Innocent VI for his church. In the meantime he is credited with having written a manual on the ideals of knightly chivalry. His epaulettes were decorated with the motto “Honour conquers all!” Hardly the character of a person given to any kind of fraud! He is so highly thought of, that he is appointed to the coveted role of porte oriflamme, and is killed defending his king at the Battle of Poitiers 1356, 19 Sept. He leaves a widow and a young son Geoffrey II, who is still a boy. It is likely that the Shroud was displayed in Lirey during his life time, probably in 1355, as the medallion struck for the event shows his arms on the dexter side while those of his wife are displayed on the sinister. The year would match the date implied by the D’Arcis memorandum. Bishop Henri of Poitiers was appointed to the See of Troyes in 1350, having previously been Bishop of Gap. He survived until 1370, some 14 years after the death of Geoffrey I. He was succeeded by two short term bishops before Pierre D’Arcis. It seems that Troyes remained relatively untouched by the wars, and there would seem to be little that would have imperilled the diocesan archives during this time. In 1356, 28 May, only a few months before the disastrous Battle of Poitiers, Bishop Henri goes on record as praising Geoffrey I for his founding of the Lirey Church. There seems no suggestion that the Lirey expositions are a reason for any caution in this regard, and they do not seem to be mentioned. At some subsequent date, Geoffrey II marries Margaret de Poitiers, niece of Bishop Henri through his brother Charles de Poitiers. They have two daughters, Margaret de Charny and Henriette. Clearly the relationship between Bishop Henri and the de Charnay family were rather more cordial than the Bishop D’Arcis’ letter would allow. There is no reference to Henri’s investigations, nor his consulting with unnamed theologians, nor of some chat with an unknown artist, nor is any such evidence cited by D’Arcis. Bishop D’Arcis received little sympathy from the Papal Legate on the substance of his complaint, and was twice enjoined by Pope Clement VII to perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication. If there was any evidence he could quote to bolster his case, it was readily available to him in the diocesan archives, but the best he can do is only to give a vague time lapse of 34 years as to its timing. There is no quotation or citing of any text from Bishop Henri’s alleged investigations. The document is redolent of hearsay, misguided zealotry, and not a little self interest. During the Christmas of 1389, a disaster overtook D’Arcis’ Troyes cathedral which had been under construction for the past century. The entire nave collapsed because of the failure of one of the arches, and the rose window of the north transept fell out. Decades of fund raising had gone to waste and he had a cathedral filled with rubble and broken glass. He had to hire 30 labourors merely to clear the mess. In the meantime, thousands of pilgrims who might have provided the funds for his much needed remedial work, were flocking to a tiny village church within his diocese, but over which he had no control because of its collegial status. How galling it must have been for him. Of the paint that he claims was so cunningly applied by his unknown artist, there remains not a vestige. If Bishop Henri ever discovered the secret of the image as alleged, then he imparted it to no one, nor was it known to his successor Bishop D’Arcis, nor has anyone else since ever discovered this marvelous secret..","date":"2015-05-07","mins":"6:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198594","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“I see that now you don’t call anymore into question the authenticity of the d’Arcis memorandum. Now you are trying to call into doubt the content.” No, both! Markwardt I think makes an excellent case, substantiated by citations. Some of his conclusions: “The progressive clerical conspiracy against the Shroud successfully suppressed the simple truth that Pierre D’Arcis, sentenced to perpetual silence and fearing that a papal investigation would prove his charges baseless, thought better of having his draft memorandum transcribed and then prudently discarded it. … The conspiracy’s enduring influence is attributable both to the estimable standing and reputation of its participants and also to the false premise that they had conducted thorough research, amassed numerous authentic and corroborating documents, and based their conclusions upon hard documentary evidence.” “In 1903, Herbert Thurston confidently pronounced the Shroud a fraud and sanctimoniously proclaimed that “…the probability of an error in the verdict of history must be accounted…as infinitesimal”. A review of the complete record, however, persuasively establishes the ultimate irony that an inauthentic document and an inauthentic translation were used to undermine the case for the Shroud’s authenticity and that Chevalier and Thurston’s “verdict of history” was procured with manufactured evidence, withheld material facts, and false testimony.” My comments above addressed what substance there might be in the draft, and found it seriously deficient. D’Arcis would have had complete and free access to all and any evidence in Bishop Henri’s archives, but provides not a single document, not a single fact, not a single phrase from Bishop Henri against the expositions. It is all hearsay. It is even suggestive of malicious motives, because of his own problems. The best that can be said is that perhaps he honestly believed that survival of the burial cloths were too improbable and saw it as his duty to protest against what he saw as an abuse of a relic cult. And so he made the best case he could, but his apparent inability to cite anything from Bishop Henri’s archives indicates that he had no real evidence. The Papal Legate remained unimpressed, likewise Pope Clement VII. The cordial relations between Bishop Henri and the De Charnay family are relevant, as it is unthinkable that Henri would be so effusive in his praise if he had any real objections to the expositions which would have occurred at an earlier date. His status as bishop would have been a weighty consideration in allowing the marriage of his niece to Geoffrey II some years later.

Assuming that it does exist and that it is by d’Arcis, it seems to express his feelings about the Shroud. Does daveb think it is all lies? Does he think that Henry of Poitiers did not suppress the exhibition of the Shroud? Does he think that Bishop Henry, or Bishop d’Arcis, was lying?” Chevalier created the impression that the memorandum was in fact dispatched to Clement VII. My recollection of Markwardt’s paper is that he asserts that it was a final draft sent to a specialist scrivener expert in preparing formal documents addressed to the papacy, but there is no evidence that it went any further than this. Markwardt’s reasons for stating this are Chevalier’s deliberate omissions, subsequently compounded by Thurston. Hence it is an ‘alleged memorandum’. There is no evidence that D’Arcis’ predecessor, Bishop Henry objected to the expositions except the claim made by D’Arcis, who was unable to cite any document by Henry or provide any reference in his draft, nor even a definite date when it was supposed to have been sent, nor is there any present extant archived document by Henry to the purpose. Contrariwise, Bishop Henry is known to have been effusive in his praise for Geoffrey de Charney’s efforts and character. There are several possible reasons why D’Arcis objected to the expositions and prepared his draft. D’Arcis was financially strapped for much needed maintenance and repairs to his own cathedral, whereas pilgrims who might have been expected to support it, were flocking to the small village church at Lirey for the expositions, so he made the best case he could in raising his objections. He may have truly believed that the Shroud was a forgery, or else he may have been mistaken in what was in fact painted. The Latin verb “depingere” can also have the meaning of “copy”, whereas “pingere” is more usual in describing something painted. One explanation is that Jeanne de Vergy may have commissioned such a painting to replace the cloth taken from Besancon, and this is the actual cloth mistakenly referred to by D’Arcis some 35 years later. In view of any local ecclesial objections to the expositions, it is not surprising that they went into abeyance. However the English defeats of the French, resulted in De Charnay’s widow and family being somewhat pauperised and deprived of much needed finance. Hence the subsequent decisions of Geoffrey II and Margaret de Charney to renew the expositions, resulting in the D’Arcis’ objections. An additional factor for caution in asserting authenticity, was the possibility of the Shroud being one of the many pillaged relics from Constantinople, with the implied threat of possible excommunication of those still involved..","date":"2015-05-04","mins":"3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198348","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Much as I would like to refresh my at one time excellent school boy Latin, I don’t really have the time to search the entire classical corpus to find a specific use of a particular word which might or might not satisfy the challenger.

Ian Wilson also has asserted that it may mean “to copy”.

Verbs that more specifically mean to copy include: transcribo (transcribe), imitor (imitate), sequor (to follow), none of which really convey the idea of copying a picture, and clearly Pierre D’Arcis was of a similar mind.

Barbet discusses the ‘Wound in the Heart’ at great length and in great detail, and he conducted a number of experiments with cadavers, piercing them in a similar way as shown on the Shroud. He obtained similar results as recorded in John’s gospel. In death, the right auricle is always filled with blood, and the ‘water’ that flowed out was pleural fluid. Barbet obtained the same flows. The blow given was a Roman legal requirement before the body could be released to family, to ensure that death had occurred, and if the person happened not to be already dead, death inevitably followed this blow, the “percussio”. It was a blow taught in the military academies. The exact wound is depicted in the “Dying Gaul” statue in Rome. Certainly, Barbet approaches his subject as a committed Christian and Catholic, but his analysis throughout his work is thoroughly professional, and indeed at times he is critical of the pious interpretations of other writers, who adduce certain mystical or miraculous aspects to what are purely physiological occurrences. There is both pre mortem and post mortem blood flows on the Shroud and the Sudarium. Particularly in the case of the Sudarium, there is more pre mortem blood, as it seems to have been a type of hood placed over the head towards the end of the crucifixion to hide the grimace of the death rictus from passers by. In the case of the three persons taken down from their crosses at the request of Josephus, only one survived, and yet none of them had been given the death blow, the “percussio”. In the case of the blood flow across the back, Barbet makes a case for it having occurred during transport from the cross to the tomb. Barbet is of the opinion that rigor mortis is manifest on the Shroud image. All four gospel accounts were written during the first century of the common era, but drew on pre existing oral traditions and reports. The Passion and Crucifixion narratives draw mainly on Mark as their basis, set down about 65 AD, but also use their own independent traditions and witnesses, corroborating one another. They are unanimous that death had occurred. The Quranic version on this interpretation was set down some hundreds of years later, cannot be said to have the benefit of eye witness, and to this Christian, seems to have been written from a perspective to suit a doctrinal position only. While Josephus is able to cite one single case of a survivor of crucifixion, I believe that no good case can be made that Jesus of Nazareth survived this terrible cruel punishment.

Consistent with other such discoveries, only 15 had inscriptions, of which 6 were female clan members. Of the 9 male ossuaries, at least one of the names Yeshua or Youssef appeared, and on five of them both names appeared. Two of these ossuaries were of brothers with pet names Yeshu and Youssi. In one case the bones were identified as Yousefus cousin to Yeshuus. Of the two remaining ossuaries one was identified as Youssef bar Yeshua, and the other Yeshua bar Youssef. Professor Oulis discounted the likelihood that the ‘Yeshua bar Youssef’ box could be that of Jesus of Nazareth. “The names were very common in 1st century Jerusalem”, he explained, “although admittedly this is a very unusual case.” However,” he continued “We will need to review our statistical approach.” He referred to previous published papers where the expected occurrence of this particular inscription was said to be 1 in 10. “Clearly,” he said “Even under the most favourable conditions, as at this tomb complex, the rate cannot be more than 1 in 45, and even this is exceptional.” It has not been possible to verify Professor Oulis’ claims, as early after the arrival of the archaeologists, an influx of Haredim, opposed to such excavations, assailed the party, pelting them with stones.

The news aspect is that a geologist claims to be able to associate the soil on the contentious James ossuary with the Talpiot tomb. However there are two caveats 1) the soil is very common, and the ossuary might well have come from another tomb with similar soil; associating it with Talpiot relies on various marker trace elements, and it has yet to be ascertained if other tombs in the area have similar or different quantities of these traces. 2) Golan the dealer expresses doubts, claiming that the ossuary came into his possession in 1976, whereas Talpiot was only excavated in 1980. However Golan seems to be a fairly shady type of character, and his 1976 claim may only be a ruse so that he can retain possession of a pre 1978 ossuary as the IAA lays claim to any discovered after 1978. Much has been made of the missing 10th ossuary which some have claimed was merely a plain box, but which others have believed to be the James ossuary. If Golan is correct it just may have been acquired as a result of an earlier break in, but in that case it would still seem to leave open the question of the tenth missing ossuary. Naturally “Jesus’ bones” feature in the report, that’s the sensationalist bait only. I clearly recall when I became interested in this subject that James Cameron was insistent that the Jesus ossuary only ever contained a small carpal bone and some shreds of cloth, presumably a shroud. So if Cameron is correct, the bones of Jesus is no issue at all. At the time he had expressed hopes of getting some kind of match with the Turin Shroud, but of course nothing ever came of it. One might speculate I suppose, that it may possibly have been an early repository for the Shroud, but excluding the bones. Cameron’s more cautious approach was I believe in complete utter contrast to that of Jacobovici, who was clearly after making something more sensationalist out of the whole circus, with a purported marriage to Mary Magdalen, a son to them both, and the Jesus’ bones aspect. When the controversy first broke, opponents were quick to point out that the names on the ossuaries were very common in 1st century Palestine, and the tomb could have belonged to anyone. However it seemed to me then that these tended to ignore the probability of the particular combination of the full list of names, Perhaps there may have been some ten families in Jerusalem with a similar combination of names. I really need no reminder from Louis as to his position and his detailed research on the Talpiot affair, as I’m well aware of his position on this matter. My own position verges on benign indifference. I merely find the combination of names inscribed on the ossuaries a curious coincidence, that may have a quite reasonable explanation not yet understood. But quite likely as Louis claims, it has nothing to do with the Jesus family at all. I’m not sympathetic to any claim that Jesus was buried at Talpiot, but that might not exclude the possibility that some of his relations might have been. We still have little idea where the Shroud might have been kept, it had to be kept somewhere, and it might not have been retained in Joseph’s tomb. Perhaps Pilate’s wife had it all along..","date":"2015-04-05","mins":"6:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"id":"comment-195520","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"This posting began with two news items, one concerning a NY Times report concerning a geologist’s work who claimed to have identified the soil on the James ossuary as being consistent with the contentious Talpiot tomb. Anyone at all is free to comment on this blog site about items that appear here. My original comment is at April 5, 6:39 am, and having reread it, I see nothing to retract in it, but consider it to be a fair statement of the position. It does so happen that I have particular training in statistics and applied probability, more so I would say than most other professional scientists, including even archaeologists, and a training which I often used and applied in my own professional career. Louis clearly stated: “Just one fact: one in every ten ossuaries in Israel is said to have the inscription, “Jesus, son of Joseph” .” That has been shown not be a fact at all, but as I said earlier, only hearsay and doubtless incorrect. In order for there to be 1 in 10 ossuaries with the pairings of ‘Jesus’ and ‘Joseph’ inscribed on them, then 1 in 3.16 males in 1st century Jerusalem would need to have had one of those two names. That is clearly not the case. ‘Jesus’ and ‘Joseph’ may have been as common as Bob, Jack, Charlie, Bill, Bruce or Trevor in modern day western society, but certainly not as common as he implied. As at 1994, out of 231 inscribed ossuaries held by the Israeli Antiquities Authority, the name “Yeshua” appeared on only 10 ossuaries, and the name “Joseph” on only 19 of them. The rate of occurrence might now have changed with further discoveries since then, but I should suspect hardly radically so. Only two other ossuaries have been identified with an inscription corresponding to “Jesus son of Joseph”. The rate is clearly not 1 in 10! The ossuaries currently on hand, may be considered to be a sample of all 1st century ossuaries, including those yet remaining to be discovered. There is no substantial evidence that 1 in 10 of all ossuaries in 1st century Jerusalem have that particular inscription, in fact quite the contrary. I stand by my earlier claim, that out of any 100,000 similar sized families, perhaps only three such families had the identical combination of names as those inscribed on the Talpiot cache. To make my position quite clear, I consider that Talpiot makes no challenge at all to Jesus having been buried in the tomb of Joseph of Aramathaea, that this tomb may well be the site of the current Holy Sepulchre church in Jerusalem, nor does it make a challenge to His resurrection from the dead, and no good case is made that he was married to anyone, nor that he sired a child.

Other familial relationships also occur, cousins and third generations or they may be unrelated. The probability that the relationship is a specific parental relationship cannot exceed 0.20. The probability of any ossuary having the said inscription cannot exceed: 0.3119 x 0.350 x 0.0664 x 0.20 = 0.000145 In a tomb containing 20 ossuaries, the probability is 0.00290, that is 1 in 345. For there to be a probability of 1 in 10 of an ossuary with the said inscription occurring in a family tomb, there would need to be 690 ossuaries present. No tomb is known to have that many ossuaries. Conceivably a public cemetery might. So far there are three ossuaries known to have the particular inscription, and this would seem to fit the case.

It included the Upanishads, the Vedas, and the Bhagavad Gita. Compared to the polytheisms in eastern and other religions, it seemed that the specific polytheism in Hinduism was more in the nature of “kathenotheism” or “one god at a time ism”. That is, all these various gods were really only different aspects of the Hindu concept of the One. Recently I attended a lecture by a retired Doctor of Divinity who referred to the ancient and medieval view of the three tiered universe, with God above in the sky, earth in the middle, and Sheol below. We now know that this concept is incorrect. He preferred to think of everything existing “within God”. That possibly comes close to Hindu and other eastern concepts. The Catholic historian Anne Fremantle referred to three fundamental heresies that have in various forms bedevilled Christian orthodoxy from its beginnings: Pantheism, Polytheism and Prometheanism. Pantheism confuses the Creator with Creation; Polytheism confuses other supernatural beings with the one deity; Prometheanism puts man in the place of God. It is in avoiding these confusions that marks out Christian orthodoxy so distinctly from other religious expressions. The origins of various religions tend to follow a pattern: the obvious one is a search for the mystical and divine beyond material reality; another aspect can be found in the legitimisation of secular governance such as in the “mandate of heaven”, the religious coronation of kings who at one time had a distinctly priestly function, and is still evident in those nations with an establishment religion; a third can be found in the various social mores of the particular culture as a form of social control. While all of these different religions are part of man’s historic search for God, I feel that it is also part of the divine plan of God’s patient and persevering search for man to bring everything to Himself. As for distinctions between science and religion, they are both only distinct aspects of the one truth, and cannot fundamentally conflict. Any perceived conflicts are only due to our limited finite understanding of the truth which with our limited understanding we find confusing. The controversies following Darwin’s work on evolution is a case in point. Established religion believed they had a correct view of Creation in the Genesis stories which were at odds with Darwin’s discoveries. However Teilhard de Chardin was able to attempt a synthesis of the two concepts, but not without further controversy. No doubt some new genius will eventually arise who can offer an even more successful synthesis of these two aspects giving us a theology which sees God as Creator in terms which the body of science might be able to more readily accept..","date":"2015-04-27","mins":"4:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"id":"comment-197779","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Sampath: Alexander the Great reached as far east as the Indus Valley, and the Silk Road linking China, India, Samarkand and the Levant was well developed by 200 BC.

During the period 1969 76, a secret commission appointed by Cardinal Pellegrino attempted to analyse the stains on the Shroud. The several scientists included Prof Frache at Modena (forensics & blood), Prof Filogamo at Turin (blood analysis). At that time the normal tests for blood included: Peroxidase method commonly used to detect hemoglobin; benzidine turns blue, phenolphthaline turns pink; tests unsuccessful; failed to dissolve granules with acetic acid, oxygenated water, glycerin of potassium. Clearly they faced a problem which they were not able to resolve at that time. When their work was put to Adler around 1978, he had at that time had achieved some success with examining blood under UV light and with the resulting fluorescence. The tests that Adler was able to perform seem to have been constrained by the inability to put these ancient stains into solution by the normal methods used when faced with a recent sample.

The hymn is interpolated into the ‘Acts of Judas Thaddeus’ written in Edessa. The hymn tells how a prince the son of a king is divested of his shining robe, and is sent into Egypt to wrest a pearl from a serpent. He succeeds in snatching the pearl from the serpent, he returns home, and his robe now seems to be an image of himself. It is clearly an analogy of Christ sent to redeem humanity from Satan. “On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness. And the image of the King of kings Was depicted in full all over it…” It would therefore seem that Bardaisan had seen the full body image of the Shroud at the time that Bishop Avercius Marcellus, primate of Hieropolis, was sent by Pope Eleutherius to baptize Abgar VIII and his court at Abgar’s request, and given temporary custody of the Shroud from Antioch using it as a kind of visual aid for his mission. Other royal scribes wrote up the incident as an analogy, the ‘Doctrine of Addai’, including it in the royal archives, and relating it to an earlier king Abgar V Ukkama, to conceal its true meaning from the despotic anti christian emperor Septimius Severus who succeeded the more tolerant emperor Commodus in 193 AD, after the baptisms had occurred. It would seem that the noted Gnostic Christian Bardaisan considered the Shroud image as authentic enough for him to write his hymn, and it would therefore seem to give the lie to any hypothesis that the Shroud was some kind of synthetic artifact created using some unknown and unspecified process by any Gnostic technologist of the 2nd century..","date":"2014-04-09","mins":"7:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/08/lawrence-e-schauf-for-the-prosecution-the-trial-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","title":"Lawrence E.

The fact that atheists may use the Shroud to interpret and rationalise the scriptural texts as an explanation of what the women and apostles believed about the resurrection is no argument. Christians have recourse to the Scriptures to explain their belief, and yet the devil may also quote scripture, check out the Temptation of Jesus in the desert recorded in Matthew. I first came across the “Hymn of the Pearl” during the 1980s while studying ‘Ancient Religions’ under Dr Brian Colless of the Religious Studies Dept of Massey University in NZ, and using his own translations of several ancient texts from a variety of sources, Babylonian, Iranian, Phoenician and others. Dr Colless has a view that the ‘Hymn of the Pearl’ may in fact be Iranian and does not seem to consider the possibility that it is Syriac, that it may even be more Christian than Gnostic, but that may be arguable. It is not necessarily a view held by other experts in ancient literatures. For example Markwardt cites sources that attribute it to Bardaisan, the notable Christian Gnostic hymnodist of Edessa during the reign of Abgar VIII.

Mario shows the cloth loosely draped over the head, but a few of us were not convinced. You need to go to Shroudscope; You can measure the dimensions between the various features. Using a tape measure, find the distance between the tip of your nose and the bump on the back of your head; It’s probably about 37 cm – 40 cm. Try to identify these features on shroudscope and measure the distance. I think you might be persuaded that the cloth was placed firmly over the top of the head. Why then is there no top of head image? Possibilities: (i) type of funerary cap or jaw strap masking the Shroud cloth; (ii) the imaging process acted near vertical only; (iii) a mystery. 3) Orthogonality of the image, no imaging of sides: Loose draping of the cloth, with the intention to complete the burial rites after the sabbath might be a sufficient explanation, but a few believe that the wrapping would have to be completed on the day of burial regardless. That means the imaging process would have to be constrained vertically. I’ve previously been an advocate of a paper by Giovanna de Liso, (a protegee of Giuilo Fanti), who carried out a lot of research on imaging caused by seismic action in Piedmont. She seems to have obtained images which may be associated with seismic variations in geomagnetic & geoelectric fields, but many are not persuaded by it.

To debate between themselves if they wish to continue this discussion. Some have argued that if a burial commenced before sunset on the eve of a sabbath, then completion of many of the rites was permitted, including wrapping of the corpse. Assuming authenticity, that creates real problems on the question of image orthogonality, and the action would have to be constrained vertically. I mentioned De Liso’s paper, and I think it a great pity that many of her findings seem to have suffered lack of follow up by others, except for some rather absurd speculations. One of the effects of earthquakes is the release of radon gas from within the earth, a radioactive inert gas, one of the decay products from uranium. It is very common in apartment basements, a leading cause of cancer, and is also used in its treatment. De Liso only ever obtained seismic images in the presence of radon gas, along with variations in the electro magnetic fields. Regardless of whether or not the imaging was caused by radiation, I think it possible that the radon may have had some kind of collimation effect resulting in the orthogonality. It is obviously just speculation, but otherwise it is all part of the intriguing mystery. “Shroud like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010.

There may well be something on the web describing how Mattei approached the subject, as to what assumptions he may have made about the disposition of the Shroud as a burial cloth. There is a brief You Tube video showing him at work on the clay model for the statue, and he seems to be making diligent measurements from a photograph of the Shroud. From a subjective comparison of the statue with its cloth template, it seems to me that an assumption of an orthogonal projection might well have been the fundamental underlying basis for his work. There are of course several other images of the statue which can be found on the web. Does anyone else know anything more about Mattei’s assumptions for matching his statue to the Shroud image?

I generally found that the expert was best at giving much needed advice, or at working only in his own field of specialist expertise, but that it was often necessary to set the parameters within which he would work and he should not go beyond them. And they should not be relied on to give a useful decision. The industry within which I worked was complex, drew on most of the engineering disciplines, and of course several other non engineering disciplines as well. My first position as a young greenhorn was as an engineering cadet in a general civil engineering office. The culture was such that they regarded with some tolerant bemusement the various experts from Head Office that often descended on them intruding on what they saw as higher priorities. There was an unofficial Office Manual which was required reading by all office new comers, so that experts might be given their proper regard.

Among the relics discovered by Queen Helena were three crosses and some crucifixion nails hidden in a deep well, revealed by a local inhabitant. Many legends are associated with the discovery, and the True Cross (Vera Crux) was said to be identified by a miraculous cure. Although several relics were sent to her palace in Rome and elsewhere, the Vera Crux was kept in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem until it was captured by Chosroes II of Persia in 614. The Byzantine emperor Heraclius recaptured it in 627 taking it first to Constantinople, and then returning it to Jerusalem. Although hidden for many years, the relic made its reappearance in 1099 during the first Crusade. In 1187 a Frankish army under Guy de Lusignan was camped at Sepphoris and carried it into battle against Saladin. The crusaders were utterly routed on the Field of Hattin, and Saladin paraded the relic through the streets of Damascus in triumph. The cross beam was eventually lost; fragments found their way back to Europe as Relics of the True Cross, some no doubt bogus. Sepphoris is an ancient city in Galilee, rebuilt by the tetrarch Herod Antipas, and is about 8 km north of the Nazareth of Jesus’ boyhood. After The Horns of Hattin, Saladin was master of the Moslem world, and rode through the streets of Damascus with the captured True Cross tied to his horse’s tail and dragging in the dust. Did his soldiers use it for firewood? Despite the valiant efforts of Richard I during the Third Crusade, the True Cross remained in Moslem hands. The beam itself disappeared, but fragments of the cross that came off were collected and brought back to Europe after the Crusades, some no doubt bogus. Although the so named True Cross was an inspiration and death sentence to many brave men of the time, no trace of the relic is believed to exist today. Was this focal point of the Crusaders, the True Cross as it was called. Perhaps we will never know. The important thing remains that for those soldiers who took up the cause of the Crusades, it was real enough to die for.

The rest was enclosed in a covering of silver, and committed to the care of the bishop of the city, whom she exhorted to preserve it carefully, in order that it might be transmitted uninjured to posterity.” ‘ Note that Rome isn’t mentioned. However, it is known that Helena took the Titulus to Rome and it was in the Church of San Gerusalemme there, see Thiede’s and D’Ancona’s ref above. They make a good case for the present titulus relic being authentic. Arizona C14 tests raised doubts. However the carved text inscriptions seem persuasively authentic, in which case if the present relic isn’t the original, then it would seem to be a replica of the original. The Wiki article indicates that part of the Vera Crux was broken up to be dispersed throughout Christendom as relics. It would seem that the portion Helena left in Jerusalem was substantial, and it was this portion that was often carried by the Crusaders into battle and later captured by Saladin.

Teilhard seems to see the breakthrough as “cephalisation”, and he uses self coined words like ‘noogenesis’ and ‘noosphere’ to signify the coming of consciousness. Only hydrogen, helium and some lithium could be formed as a consequence of the Big Bang, the lighter elements are formed as a result of nuclear reactions in stars up as far as Iron (atomic no. 26); all other heavier elements require a super nova explosion to form, so we are actually made of star dust. Up until the 18th century it was believed that a ‘life principle’ was required to form the more complex organic compounds. In 1828 Friedrich Wohler announced he had succeeded in synthesising urea from ammonium cyanate without using a kidney, and this signified the commencement of organic chemistry.

This article did not touch on any theories of the history of the cloth, but a later article may do so. An earlier article endeavoured to present material on some of the scientific aspects, and this can be found on the same web site. An attempt was made in the earlier article to be conservative in the scientific assertions made, and the more radical claims made by certain investigators were treated cautiously or left open. Sources on crucifixion practices included the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and an article on the Herodians by Margaret J Thorpe. A quotation from an early sceptic of the Shroud’s authenticity, a Jesuit historian Herbert Thurston, was also given. A 3 D image from a very recent web site was also used and cited. Dr David Willis, one of the very few English investigators on the Shroud’s medical evidence was also quoted, and Dr Pierre Barbet’s papers were also of assistance. I note that the exegetical advice given.on John 20:25 28 and Acts 12:7 does not appear to be quite accurate, as a better transliteration of the Greek root word for hand used in those texts is “kheiron ” (or “chiro “), but this does not derogate from the principal argument used there. I rather suspect that DA’s aversion to Ian Wilson derives from his disagreeing with Wilson’s theories or speculations on the history of the cloth. However he can hardly disagree with Wilson’s presentation on the identification of the Shroud Man as Rabbi Yeshua, when even Herbert Thurston was prepared to concede this. The question of identification is relevant, as tens of thousands were punished by crucifixion, and therefore identity is a fair question. I am not a blind follower of Ian Wilson’s theories. My personal belief is that both Jack Markwardt and Daniel Scavone, although both disciples of Wilson, come closer to the mark, by asserting that the burial cloths were in Antioch for some centuries before arriving in Edessa, and that very likely Jeanne de Vergy came by the cloth through her ancestor Othon de la Roche, and that it was kept at Besancon, rather than being held in secret by the Templars as Wilson asserts. Any attempt to resolve the whereabouts of the cloth after the sixth century must still deal with the matter of the Vignon markings on both coinage and iconography. It is apparent that the Shroud image was then known. If not in Edessa, where was it? Noone has come up with an alternative theory, not even DA. It was certainly not in “Neverland”! I note that DA has asserted that the Byzantines did not appear to rate the burial cloth very highly as a relic as they kept it hidden. I think that although he may know all there is to know about Byzantine sources, he may have failed to understand the Byzantine mind set when it comes to the sacred. He ought to know for example that the most sacred moments of eucharist worship are concealed from the common gaze, as contrasted with that in the western liturgies. That says a lot about the Byzantine attitude to the sacred, which cannot be judged from a western stand point. I’m sure that he must already be aware of this, but it is not evident to me in what he writes.

Circles represented the mathematical ideal of curved orbits. Eudoxus 400 350 BC, had proposed a model of 27 nested spheres as a geocentric model but which was inadequate for Venus and Mars. Aristarchus of Samos 310 230 BC proposed a heliocentric model but was unable to win support except from Seleucus in Babylonia. Eratosthenes 276 194 BC, a remarkable astronomer, director of the Great Library, calculated the earth’s diameter to within 15% from the sun’s solstice angle at Aswan, accurately measured the angle of the ecliptic, compiled a star catalog (lost), and a calendar including leap years. Hipparchus d.~127 BC, gave the fatal blow by rejecting the heliocentric model, discovered precession of the equinoxes, calculated the year to within 6.5 minutes, compiled first known star catalog of 850 stars in six magnitudes as used today, and introduced the ideas of epicycles, eccentrics and deferrents, provided trig tables. Ptolemy’s Almagest in 13 books, (fl 127 145 AD), drew heavily on Hipparchus but modified his geocentric model, extended the catalog to 1022 stars. The Ptolemaic system remained Western Christendom dogma until the time of Copernicus and Galileo. Around 1609 Kepler had derived his laws of planetary motion and determined that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse. He had written to Galileo, but Galileo refused to modify his theory of circular orbits. Why? Because he wished to preserve the theory of ideals as represented by circles! The Copernican Galilean Kepler heliocentric model could only remain as an unproven hypothesis until the 19th century when it was finally proven by two major projects. These were the quest for the discovery of stellar parallax from the extremities of the earth’s orbit, to which many astronomers dedicated their efforts but were frequently frustrated in their attempts by inadequate equipment and faulty conceptualisation. It was only finally resolved by the realisation that corrections had to be made for the varying angle of light incidence from Alpha Centauri, an analogy realised from the change in wind direction when turning about while sailing up the Thames River. The second project was Foucault’s erection of his pendulum suspended by a single filament in Paris demonstrating the actual rotation of the earth. From the time of Aristarchus’ first proposing his heliocentric model to its final proof by stellar parallax and Foucault’s pendulum is some 2,200 years.

The non uniform thread was clearly hand spun, and cotton contamination is minor and readily explicable. It does not seem to fit the pattern of a medieval provenance.

If the Shroud is of Middle East or oriental origin, it is unlikely to be medieval. There is no cotton in the main cloth, Raes found cotton in one of his samples but not the other. The main weave could not have been carried out in a workshop where there was also cotton present, else there would be more cotton contamination. The reasonable conclusion would have to be that the cotton has arisen from some subsequent repair. If Oxford found cotton, they were dealing with a repaired section of the cloth which cannot be considered representative of the whole.

A.M. Van der Hoeven, http://www.Jesus King.info, October 14, 2011 As Kelly states, Adrie makes a good credible case together with a plausible story for the Shroud having been a type of temple garment. I was in touch with Adrie a few months ago, when she graciously contacted me. One problem for many will be her associating the authors of the first and fourth gospels as being the same person, viz John Mark. There is no tradition for the authors being the same person, and likely NT scholars would see valid objections to it. So we differ on that aspect, but I don’t see that necessarily derogates from the Shroud having been a temple garment. It might just as well have been the garment worn by Joseph of Arimathea, or even his own intended shroud. Plain shrouds for burial did not become obligatory until the 2nd century under Gamaliel II, who objected to the excesses of luxuriant funerals, which sometimes resulted in pauperising families. I see no reference to herring bone weave, Z twist in her paper as being any kind of requirement. Her biblical references as to requirements include Ex 28:5 6, Nu 15:38. Other related papers can be found on her web site above. Significant that white linen garments are frequently mentioned in both the OT and NT, so there must have been some degree of active production of them. The inventiveness and enterprise of artisans, weavers and merchants for producing exceptional or special quality products of any genre is a common enough feature of any market place. Joseph is said to have been a rich man, and this might account for no other comparable linen cloths of similar weave being discovered.

They are fine for informing about little known information and for giving expert opinions, but you never put them in charge of anything as they are so narrowly focused that they don’t see the big picture. An expert demands to see an exact replica of a cloth, most of which have long since perished and no longer exist if they ever did, or the remains of a particular type of treadle loom, as if that were the only way of creating the cloth, or else specific references in historically proven documents which he can tease to pieces and if it suits him show to be false.

It is an attorney’s joy to find an expert that will support his client’s case, as it is his opponent’s. Thankfully we don’t rely on experts for verdicts in court cases. The generalist on the other hand sees an exceedingly complex weave in a carpet of comparable size originating within a 1000 km of Jerusalem, some 500 years beforehand, but it is discovered in a Scythian prince’s grave in Siberia. If that is possible, then it is no less possible that a 3:1 herring bone weave in linen, less complex than any Persian carpet, should be available in 1st century Jerusalem, no matter how it originated, nor how it arrived there. That is not writing a novel, but it is facing the reality of true possibilities. There are 2nd century and later apocrypha referring to the keeping of the burial cloths, and it needs no relic cult to find a reason for their being so kept.

Another fact confirmed by His Majesty was that it was traditionally affirmed, that at one point in the past, he edges of the Lenzuoli (Sheet) had become so tattered as to cause embarrassment or criticism of the Custodians, and those areas were repaired and rewoven using identical techniques, but obviously with similar, yet newer, materials containing dyes and other medieval manufacturing ingredients, in an attempt to better blend the new sections in, as best possible, with the original fabric. ” Etc.

It is calculated from the amplitude of the movement of seismographs and then standardised to a distance of 100km from the estimated epicentre. Yes there are other more sophisticated measures in use, more difficult and time consuming to calculate, but in theory they should yield pretty much more or less the same results. Shallow earthquakes will be felt to be more significant in their effects than deep earthquakes of the same intensity. The intensity needs to be distinguished from the Modified Mercalli scale which gives a subjective measure of the effects of an earthquake at various places. The intensity is an absolute measure of the earthquake, the Mercalli attenuates with distance from the epicentre. A quick Google on “Earthquakes in Israel” shows that it is moderately seismically active. In 2013 there were several shocks of around 3.5, In 1927 there was a 6.2 which killed 500, injured 700; and in 1837 an earthquake left 7000 dead. The effects of an earthquake event will depend a lot on how well buildings and structures have been engineered against earthquake. There are various techniques commonly used, such as ensuring components are tied together, spiral reinforcing of columns, base isolation in foundations, and other standard techniques. The design philophy is usually to ensure the structure can survive a moderate earthquake, and in a severe earthquake will fail in a safe and controlled manner. These techniques are commonly used in Japan, California and New Zealand, where earthquakes are most significant and there is a heightened awareness of their effects. In locations of only moderate seismicity, damage may be more severe, as there is often less awareness of what can be done, and sesimic design does not receive the same attention. There are several problems with the Carpenteri et al paper published in Meccanica. One is that the authors for some unknown reason have focused on the year 33 AD, when they might have looked more closely at the year 30 AD, possibly a more credible date for the crucifixion. Most informed students of the Shroud are unlikely to accept the proposition that the crucifixion / resurrection earthquakes affected the 1988 radiactive carbon dating results. It has never arisen with the dating of any other artifact, no less likely to have been so affected. Personally I can accept the possibility that sesimicity may have had a bearing on the formation of the Shroud image, for reasons I have given elsewhere. But this is not to say that the image formation mechanism is as outlined by the authors. It is credible that the high energies involved in earthquakes may have released neutrons. But we have yet to see replication of images so formed. The images produced by De Liso apparently required the release of radon gas, which produces gamma radiation, not neutrons. There were other necessary components as well including concurrent variations in the geo magnetic and electric fields. With all the talk and theories of image formation, there has been a sad lack of attempts at persuasive experiments to produce images on linen cloth from cadavers, or even from time expired laboratory test animals. The best De Liso could come up with was a dead snake and a metallic key. A more concerted effort is required if the various theories are ever to be brought to any kind of conclusion. Scriptural references to the crucifixion / resurrection earthquakes: Matt 27:51 (crucifixion), 28:2 (resurrection) (specific); Mk 15:38 is suggestive (veil of temple torn in two); Luke 21:45 (likewise); John does not refer to darkness nor earthquake..","date":"2014-02-17","mins":"6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/16/the-shroud-of-turin-story-brings-up-all-the-usual-issues-about-click-bait-journalism/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Shroud of Turin story brings up all the usual issues about click-bait journalism"},{"id":"comment-211454","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Shroud would seem to have had many different custodians over the course of centuries.

Extract from my notes of 2008: “He discounts the birth stories in Bethlehem and concludes that, very likely, Jesus was born and grew up in Nazareth; His education in Galilee would probably be limited to that attainable by an eldest son of a tradesman, he essentially spoke Aramaic, with only sufficient Greek for commercial transactions, and likely some Hebrew. Meier discusses the fourth century doctrines of Mary’s perpetual virginity, but considers that the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus mentioned in the gospels are in fact blood brothers or sisters of Jesus – he refers to the typical use of the Greek word adelphos (brother or half brother) rather than other terms (e.g. Anepsios) in common use for relationships such as cousin or step brother – thus he rejects Jerome’s and other patristic interpretations of these relationships. ” It is based on the evangelists’ use of the word adelphos, when another common word “anepsios” would have sufficed if they were cousins. However it occurred to me that adoption was very common in this period, because of the high mortality rates, and the general prevalence of orphans. Under both Jewish and Roman Law, adoptees had precisely the same legal rights as those of natural descent. It is fairly easy to find examples where emperors adopted sons and these succeeded to the imperial throne. Under those circumstances, “adelphos” would be the appropriate term. Other interpretations would tend to strain too much at the meaning of “adelphos”. It is interesting that St Paul makes much of the notion that we are all made sons by adoption, and consequently heirs to Christ. A direct quote from Meier’s summary “Roots of the Person”, chapters 8, 9, 10: “During the reign of Herod the Great, and probably towards its end (ca. 7 4 BC), Jesus was born in the hill town of Nazareth in Lower Galilee. His mother was Mary, his putative father, Joseph. We hear of four brothers of Jesus (James, Joses, Jude, and Simon) and at least two unnamed sisters. It may be significant that all the names in the family hark back to the glorious days of the patriarchs, the exodus, and the conquest of the Promised Land. Jesus’ family may have shared in the reawakening of Jewish and national and religious identity that looked forward to the restoration of Israel in its full glory. That is all the more likely if Joseph claimed to be a descendant of King David. At any rate, judging by the fiercely religious focus of Jesus’ life once it becomes visible to us, we may reasonably suppose that his family had been deeply devout Jews of a peasant Galilean type: firmly committed to the basic practices of the Mosaic Law (especially to its “boundary symbols” of circumcision, Sabbath, and pilgrimage to the Jerusalem temple), but not given to the niceties of Pharisaic observance. ” “As the firstborn son, Jesus would have been the object of Joseph’s special attention, both in training him for a trade and in seeing to his religious education. The fact that Joseph is notably absent during the public ministry is best explained by the traditional idea that he had already died. Jesus’ mother, brothers, and sisters survived into the period of the ministry, though not without some tensions between themselves and Jesus.” “We are specifically told by various evangelists that the family thought Jesus mad (Mk 3:21), or that his brothers did not believe in him (Jn 7:5), or that Jesus refused a request of his family to see him (Mk 3:31 35). It is therefore all the more startling, when we glance ahead to the history of the early Church, to find Jesus’ brother James prominent in an early creedal formula listing witnesses to the resurrection (1 Cor 15:7) and in the leadership of the Jerusalem church (Gal 1:19; 2:9, 12) Acts 15:13 21; 21:18) – with other family members following in his steps.” “In the face of all this information about members of Jesus’ family, the total silence about a wife or children is best taken as indicating that Jesus chose the highly unusual – but not unknown – path of celibacy.” “Growing up in Nazareth, Jesus would have spoken Aramaic as his everyday tongue, while also learning some Hebrew from the local synagogue services, and perhaps more Hebrew from formal instruction provided by his father. As he started to learn the trade of woodworker from Joseph, he would have found it useful, or even necessary to acquire some Greek phrases for business purposes. Frequent visits by his family to Jerusalem for the great feasts would have exposed him to more Greek in that polyglot city. Although he might have used Greek when dealing with Gentiles, and Hebrew when debating the meaning of Scripture with professional Scribes, the bulk of his teaching, directed as it was to ordinary Palestinian Jews, would have been delivered in Aramaic.” “Jesus’ teaching was delivered orally, and oral teaching could in theory have been the sole conduit of Jesus’ own education in the Scriptures and Jewish traditions. In the oral popular culture in which he grew up and later taught, literacy was not an absolute necessity for common people. Yet the matrix of a devout Jewish family, Jesus’ own preoccupation with the Jewish religion, and the debates over Scripture that Jesus held with professional scribes and pious Pharisees during his ministry all make his ability to read the sacred text a likely hypothesis.” “Jesus the woodworker of Nazareth was poor by our modern American standards, though relative to his own society he was no poorer than the vast majority of Galileans. Actually, not knowing the grinding destitution of the dispossessed farmer, the city beggar, the rural day labourer, or the rural slave, he was not at the bottom of the socio economic ladder. While we would find the economic and political realities of Antipas’ Galilee unbearable, they were on the whole preferable to the chaotic last days of Herod the Great, the chaotic first days of the Jewish War in the late sixties, or the sense of oppression by foreigners that the presence of the Roman prefect aroused in Judea.” There is more, and much of it dismisses the more fanciful and even some popular notions concerning this marginal Jew..","date":"2015-09-29","mins":"9:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/28/the-shroud-of-canterbury/","cat":"article","title":"The Shroud of Canterbury"},{"id":"comment-211478","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"John, I can certainly agree with the notion that the Shroud was Christ’s gift to humanity in general. But if it is to be debated as to who should possess it as an earthly object or as a property right, then I believe that a good case can be made for St Peter having first claim, and it does not have to be on any kind of finders keepers basis. We do not need to debate the primacy of Peter among the apostles, and I think we can assume that as given. In John chapter 20, we read how “the other apostle” arrived at the tomb first and saw the linen cloths, but did not go in, but he gave way to Peter. “4 They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first; 5 he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in. 6 When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, 7 and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place. 8 Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed.” Jn 20:4 8 The stone had been rolled away, and the tomb was now accessible to all and sundry, including the Roman and Jewish officials. The burial cloths were still there, and they had held the body of their master. What to do with them? As head of the apostles, I think Peter would see it as his duty to take possession of them. There is good testamentary evidence that he did precisely that, even taking them to Antioch when they eventually abandoned Jerusalem, and where he became its first bishop. I know that some sources give a variety of versions as to what happened to the cloths, including one involving Pilate’s wife, while others say that they were given to Peter. Peter’s custodianship tends to be corroborated by various subsequent writers. I think he has the best claim.

Forensic pathologists have considered that the figure of the image is anatomically genuine, and given that the Shroud was first exhibited in the West in 1355, well before the time of Leonardo, it seems difficult to able to assert that sufficient anatomical knowledge was then available for it to be a work of human art.

The biblical account indicates two sightings of the star, one before the wise men began their journey (probably from Babylonia or Persia) and the other near their journey’s end, when the omen “came and stood over where the young child was.” A celestial object near the horizon of any given observer might be considered by him as pointing out some spot on Earth below. Chinese annals record novae in 5 BC and 4 BC; in the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler advanced the view that the Star of Bethlehem may have been a nova occurring in or near some conjunction of bright planets. Several striking planetary conjunctions also took place within 10 years of the chronological point now taken as the beginning of the Christian era. A triple conjunction in early 6 BC, in which Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn stood at the points of a triangle, has often been mentioned as a possible explanation of the star. Prior to that, in 7 BC, Jupiter and Saturn were for eight months within three degrees of each other and three times within that period passed within one degree. Several years later, on June 17, 2 BC, the bright planets Venus and Jupiter would have appeared to observers in Babylon to have merged just before setting in the general direction of Bethlehem to the west. Alternatively, interpret it as a literary device. Several notable people in ancient times were said to have had asterism phenomena at their birth as a signal portent.

Whether Erman’s book will find a postive response among the hallowed halls is an open question. The origins of this general decay in Academia can probably best be traced to two French clowns Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, who by their theories of deconstructionism became the leading exponents of what has come to be known as the post modernist school of philosophy. The principal feature of this movement is that it is largely unintelligible and incoherent to any reasonable minded person, Its second characteristic is its assertion that there is no objective truth, which is the principal reason why I fear that Erman’s book will fail to engage. It is easily seen therefore that such a philosophy is necessarily the spawn of the father of lies! Notwithstanding its general incoherence, post modernism has become extremely influential in shaping much social thinking and the soft sciences in current western thought, their outgrowths, and the so called “mythicists” mentioned in this title posting are merely one more symptom of it. There is an objective truth, for Jesus said “I am.the Way, the Truth and the Life”, and his followers not only knew him, and that he certainly existed, but they laid down their lives for what he taught, for who he was, and in asserting his resurrection. There are no mythicists who would be prepared to do the same for whatever it is they might beieve in. Perhaps Erman may need to write a companion volume “Did the Apostles Exist?” Ha!

From 1948 until his retirement in 1972, Frei was head of the Zurich Police Scientific Laboratory. He had worked on many important crimes and accidents including the air crash which killed UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold. Although retired, Frei was still in 1978 consulted on crimes by police forces of many nations. He had established an international reputation for himself by the analysis of microscopic substances. Up until that time it seems that the more usual application of palynology had been confined to the examination of core samples for archaeology and palaeontology purposes. Frei first became involved with the Shroud in 1973 under Cardinal Pellegrino’s Turin Commission, and was appointed for the purpose of notarising the photographs taken by Judica Cordiglia in 1969. Frei had previously published an article on the faking of photographs in 1955. He was given his first permission to take his sticky tape samples at this time in 1973. Wilson makes the point that, although Frei was initially skeptical about the authenticity of the Shroud, this skepticism had gone as a result of his own work, an admission which apparently caused him some emotion. His upbringing was Zwinglian Protestant, and he was far removed from Catholic leanings. In his 2010 book, Wilson traces some of the subsequent history of the pollen investigations including the involvement of Whanger, Danin, Baruch and Litt. Wilson concludes: “While there remains good reason to believe the fundamental soundness of Frei’s identifications, the argument for the presence of Middle Eastern pollen grains on the Shroud can no longer be advanced with quite the assurance it could thirty years ago.” It seems to be a most unusual and almost self contradictory conclusion..","date":"2014-08-24","mins":"5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/coming-out-of-the-closet-on-pollen-and-plant-images/","cat":"books","title":"Coming Out of the Closet on Pollen and Plant Images"},{"id":"comment-146125","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Comprehensive article on Faidherbia albida is at: http://database.prota.org/PROT Ahtml/Faidherbia%20albida En.htm Article’s geographic emphasis is mainly Africa where it seems pervasive and is highly valued there for a variety of purposes, but it does occur as far north as Israel.

She writes: “In my earlier articles I showed that John Mark can be identified as the secretary of the Council of the Temple, which formed a distinct priestly block within the Great Sanhedrin. In this office he had to wear ritually clean and white linen temple garments (Ex 28: 5 6). But, as the young man who ran to Jesus and said that he had observed all the commandments from his youth (Mark 10:20), he had also fulfilled the commandment of Nu 15:38, (etc)” I believe that much of her paper seems speculative and if I understand her rightly in some passages she seems to confuse John Mark with the writer of the fourth gospel. I tend to view it all as little more than a fascinating speculation.

Re Max comment, March 7, 8:52am: Source for statistics on name frequencies is: “L. Y. Rahmani, A Catalogue of Jewish Ossuaries, Israel Antiquities Authority and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Jerusalem: 1994)” which can easily be found.on the Internet. The IAA quoted this source in their attempts to rebut Talpiot as being “The Jesus Family Tomb”. My purpose was to show that, despite these names being very common in 1st c Jerusalem, the likelihood markedly increased when the full Talpiot combination was considered. In a population of 917 ossuaries, 286 names appeared on 231 inscribed ossuaries; 686 ossuaries were uninscribed. Agreed that the relatively small sample of 286 names will introduce a sampling error when applied to the full Judean / Galilean population at the time, and it cannot be an exact calculation without knowing the full census of names. However the principle that the likelihood is very much greater when a combination of 7 or 8 names is considered, instead of just individual names on their own certainly remains valid. It is not a “very weak argument”, and it is not “misleading”! 2. Re Max comment, March 7, 9:12am: Your words not mine. You must draw your own conclusions. I couldn’t possibly comment! I hold a respectable degree in civil engineering, have had a fascinating 40 year career spanning a wide spectrum of engineering and management disciplines. I also hold majors in mathematics and religious studies, and minors in literature and various other liberal arts disciplines and accounting management. Before I lost my hearing, I also used to play Beethoven sonatas, and had several dramatic interests. I have found this comprehensive approach to suit my temperament best, providing me with a well rounded outlook, rather than having a narrow focus on an obscure specialty of my own invention! 3. Re Ron comment, March 7, 10:15am: Presence of the carpal bone in the Jesus ossuary is highly suggestive of a wrist nailed crucified victim, and could be expected. To invoke the isaiah scripture “not a bone will be broken” is highly dubious, and is merely following a literalistic interpretation of an evangelist’s comment. I don’t know that the carpal was in fact broken. There is no known record of a Jesus family tomb in Nazareth, but there is a possible candidate at Talpiot. After the resurrection, Matthew has the disciples returning to Galilee, whereas Luke has them staying in Jerusalem. Certainly there were family members who were living in Jerusalem (e.g. James). There are also various other traditions as well, some of them highly questionable, and merely supportive of claims made by various ancient churches. The question of the James ossuary remains contentious. Excavation work at the site was hindered by ultra Orthodox rabble indulging in their regular pastime of stoning the archaeologists. The work at the site had to be hurried, and it is credible that errors were made. The IAA initiated a vindictive prosecution for fraud against the collector Oded Golan, probably because he was suspected to have been involved in the antiquities black market. The IAA was later obliged to abandon their case against him. The Golan “James” ossuary was taken to Canada and subject to various scientific tests – electron microscope, ultra violet – and the inscription dated to 63 AD, the year of St James martydom, Subsequent tests showed that the patina on this ossuary matched the patina on the other Talpiot ossuaries. Concerning the so called Mary Magdalene ossuary, this is just one of the outrageous claims made by Jacobovici, which does nothing to enlighten the case. If Talpiot is indeed the family tomb, the presence of the “Judah son of Jesus” ossuary can be explained by the prevalent practice of adopting orphans, possibly the credible sort of compasionate action that Rabbi Yeshua might well have done. I’ve commented elsewhere about this. I am not asserting that Talpiot is definitely the “Jesus Family Tomb”, and surely there are vested interests contaminating the case; Although I find the combination of names reasonably persuasive. But there are enough signposts to show how badly the whole business has been mishandled, and sufficient doubt remains as to justify being more open minded about the possibility, than the rantings of fundamentalist Christians who imagine that their cherished beliefs are being over turned in reacting to allegations that are not even asserted. 4. Re Yannick comment, March 7, 4:52pm: This has to be one of the more coherent cases that I have seen Yannick make in respect of the Mandylion and Shroud being two separate objects, although I don’t necessarily agree with his conclusions. There was more than one cloth taken from Edessa to Constantinople. In the summer of 944 AD, the Emperor deputed Abraham, bishop of Samosata to receive the Mandylion. Apparently he recognised the Orthodox copy as spurious, and was only satisfied when he had the Monophysite and Nestorian copies also handed over to him. One of these may have been the cloth which came to be known as the “Veronica”, and possibly later as the Holy Face of Manoppello..","date":"2012-03-07","mins":"7:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/even-more-on-archaeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Even more on Archaeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"id":"comment-16807","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Pierre Barbet commented extensively on the disposal of the bodies of executed criminals during Roman times in his “Doctor at Calvary” translated from the original French of 1950.

In addition to his medical qualifications in forensics Barbet was also a competent scholar in the classics, Latin & Greek. He quotes several authorities: Horace, Seneca, Petronius, Artemidorus, Cicero etc. The usual practice was for corpses to remain on the cross to be devoured by birds of prey and wild beasts. However the bodies could be asked for by families who wished to ensure a decent burial. It seemed to Barbet that the law authorised this without hindrance and without payment. Even the ashes of those condemned to the stake were returned to their relations (Pandectes). That such clemency was the rule is proven by cases where free authorisation is refused are pointed out as exceptions. He quotes Cicero who bitterly reproaches Veres for extorting heavy payments for giving up bodies to families; he says that such extortion is against the law. However a judge might refuse to surrender the body where there is hatred against the criminal, or in cases of high treason. Vespasian demanded that certain conspirators be cast into the common sewer, and after the Battle of Philippi, Augustus refused permission of a notable prisoner. Flaccus, prefect of Egypt refused burial for certain crucified Jews in 38 AD. It was therefore not exceptional that Jesus would ask Pilate for the body of Jesus.

I am gratified that I no longer seem to be in a minority of one, in being prepared to be open minded about the possibility of the Talpiot site being indeed the Jesus Family Tomb. The various outageous speculations of Jacobovici had the unfortunate effect of provoking a fairly predictable response from the Christian far right, in such videos as “The Jesus Tomb Unmasked” as if the discovery of a Jesus ossuary had to be a denial of the resurrection, whereas the Pellegrino comments clarifies the situation, and even adds to the case. It is to be expected that wrist nailing would indeed pop out a few carpal bones, such as the one found there. Likewise, it is also to be expected that the IAA would also wish to cover their butts, considering the incompetence with which they seemed to have dealt with this site and the artifacts found there, a potentially highly significant finding for primitive Christian historiography. Much is made in the “Jesus Tomb Unmasked” video of how common in 1st c Judaism were the particular names found at Talpiot. However they conveniently avoid the question of the particular combination of names. Of the 10 ossuaries registered, 6 were incribed with a total of 7 names. If the James ossuary is included (it has the same patina as the others), then there were 8 names. Here are the frequencies(f) of the names found, that are included in a total population of 231 ossuaries with 286 names: Mary (Miriam, Maria): f = 20, p = 6.99%; Talpiot occurrences x = 2; Jesus (Yeshua) f = 10, p = 3.50%, x = 1; Joseph (Yosa) f = 19, p = 6.64%, x = 2; Judah (Judas, Yehuda) f = 18, p = 6.29%, x = 1; Matthew (Mattitiyahu, Mattai) f = 8, p = 2.80%, x = 1. Given that there is a collection of 1st c Jewish ossuaries inscribed with seven names at random, then the combined probability of obtaining the Talpiot combination falls to: P = 8.73 x 10^( 5) = 1 in 11,456. If the exercise is reworked to include the James ossuary, then the probability falls to 1 in 38,140. So that considering the combination as such, changes the likelihood completely from that peddled by the deniers. It is now probably far too late to obtain any other useful or meaningful scientific evidence about this case, as the ossuaries have been cleaned of their contents which have been placed in some common grave. The only thing that can be hoped for, is to look for some textile match between the fibre traces and the Shroud or Sudarium artifacts. I’m not aware of any progress in any such attempt. Although the body of Jesus may have been originally laid in some other tomb close to Golgotha, (Holy Sepulchre???) it seems not unreasonable that his burial cloths and any other residue, should be placed in an ossuary at a family tomb. The cloths after all were unclean and a place had to be found for them in accordance with prescribed requirements. Joseph of Aramathea might well have been the kind of wealthy patron who would be prepared to make such provisions for Jesus’ family. I think it is a shameful scandal the way this whole matter has been treated, and it reflects no professional credit on anyone involved with it..","date":"2012-03-07","mins":"3:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/even-more-on-archaeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Even more on Archaeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"id":"comment-9085","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, Your words not mine.

And there are many comments that could be made about it. Creation of ley lines was a common practice in ancient times (Iron Age), and there are several examples in Britain. Their retention into medieval times was accomplished by siting churches, monasteries, cross roads and other notable features on the old sites. As well as linking various ‘sacred sites’ (e.g. Stone circles) they had a practical use as aids to path finding for travellers, a sort of ancient GPS, and adjcaent features were inter visible determined by the visible horizon, roughly 22 miles. Stephen Skinner’s “Sacred Geometry” gives a good description of them. Modrn surveying has demonstrated that they were set out extremely accurately for their time. Linking the Shroud with the Holy Grail, Joseph of Arithmathea with Glastonbury / Avalon, and Arthurian legends, seems to have originated from about the time of the crusades, from about the twelfth century. Encyc Brit comments re Avalon: “Avalon – island to which Britain’s legendary king Arthur was conveyed for the healing of his wounds after his final battle. It is first mentioned in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae (c. 1136), while the same author’s Vita Merlini (c. 1150) described it as “the island of apples [‘Insula pomorum’], called fortunate.” It was ruled by the enchantress Morgan le Fay and her eight sisters, all of them skilled in the healing arts.” “Geoffrey may have been attempting to connect his “island of apples” with Celtic mythology’s traditions of an elysium; and the name Avalon is certainly close to the Welsh word for apple, afal. Sir John Rhys, however (Studies in the Arthurian Legend, 1891), preferred to link the name Avalon with that of Aballach, a (hypothetical) dark Celtic divinity. Avalon has been identified with Glastonbury in Somerset, and this may be connected with Celtic legends about an “isle of glass” inhabited by deceased heroes. It is equally likely to have been an attempt by the monks of Glastonbury to exploit the Arthurian legend for the benefit of their own community.” Jack Markwardt’s two papers linking the Shroud with his Antioch theory, provides comment on the linking of the Grail story with the Shroud and Britain. It seems to have resulted from a mistranslation referring to an alleged British king, but which actually may refer to Abgar the Great. “A sixth century entry in the Liber Pontificalis records that Pope Eleutherius, whose papacy extended from approximately 174 to 189, “received a letter from British King Lucius [Britannio rege Lucio] asking that he might be made a Christian through his agency In 731, the Venerable Bede reiterated this precise account and further reported that Eleutherius’ compliance with the king’s request for baptism ―was soon effected. Nevertheless, because second century Britain was under Roman rule and had no king, these two texts presented a historical conundrum, one which remained unsolved for almost fourteen centuries and until 1904, when Adolph Harnack, a respected Biblical scholar, deduced that the Liber Pontificalis entry had been intended to reference not Britain, but, rather, the Britio Edessenorum, Edessa’s citadel, and not King Lucius, but King Lucius Ælius Septimius Megas Abgarus VIII of Edessa, otherwise known as Abgar the Great.” “Hints of a lost Syrian sindonic history are to be found in the legends of the Holy Grail, an object which, in recent years, has been increasingly linked to the Shroud. Some seventy five years ago, Professor Eisen concluded that the earliest Grail legends attempted to account for the loss of real sacred objects known in fourth century Syria and that these stories reflected a passionate desire to locate and recover such objects from concealment.” “A mere seventy years after Crusaders had discovered the Holy Lance in Antioch, Chretien de Troyes wrote the first of Western Europe’s Grail romances and coupled the mysterious Grail with a bleeding white lance. Soon thereafter, Robert de Boron mentioned an image of Christ on a shroud, identified the chalice as the Grail, and related that Joseph of Arimathea, the Shroud’s first owner, had died in Syria, in stark contrast to later tales which, integrated with the Arthurian legend, placed him in Britain.” Markwardt’s two papers: “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” 2008, http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf “Antioch and the Shroud” 1998, Dallas conference: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf Sorry I had to spoil the fantasies!.","date":"2013-01-18","mins":"3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/18/facts-by-legends-rumors-and-imagination/","cat":"books","title":"Facts by Legends, Rumors and Imagination"},{"id":"comment-8874","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I read “The Jesus Family Tomb” back in 2008, and have regularly followed up web discussions, mainly hostile, since then, Despite all the web hostility, I’m inclined to think that the Talpiot tomb was indeed the Jesus Family Tomb. Randy makes a valid point above in quoting Pellegrino’s belief that no skeleton was ever placed in the Jesus ossuary, but only the burial cloths. The case was not helped by Jacobovici’s highly dubious interpretation of some aspects of the case, including citing the aprocrophal “Gospel of Philip” and taking on board the Dan Green hypothesis that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were husband and wife, and that Judah was their son. The various names of Jesus’ family members can be found in the gospels Mt 13:55, Mk 6:3. The early 4th century Fathers in their doctrine of “Mary ever Virgin” asserted these were cousins of Jesus or other close relations. John P Meier in “A Marginal Jew” is insistent that they were indeed brothers and sisters of Jesus, because of the gospels’ use of the Greek word “adelphos” in preference to “anepsios”, I’ve mentioned elsewhere on this site the extensive practice of adoption of orphans in 1st century Judaism and also throughout the Empire, because of the high mortality rates. Under both Jewish and Roman Law, legal adoption created the same rights as did birth. Meier’s assertion can still maintain the “Mary ever Virgin” doctrine, if the various brothers and sisters were indeed adopted, and Mary and Joseph certainly seem to have been the compassionate type of people who muight well do this. Likewise Judah could well have been the adopted son of Rabbi Yeshua, but the secret would be kept to avoid the implied threat to the lad’s life as son of “King of the Jews” The case of the Talpiot tomb was badly handled by the Israeli Antiquities Authority from the very beginning, and they seem seldom to have ever shown any interest whatsoever in early Christian archaeology. Nor was it helped by the casual treatment of the original 1980 discovery by the IAA, the challenge to cherished beliefs by protagonists of the Christian Right, archaeologists miffed that others were trespassing on their professional territory, and by a thriving black market in forgeries, each stake holder having their own personal agenda on the discovery. The opportunity to have explored one of the most potentially significant findings of early Christianity has now been irretrievably lost. Pellegrino has expressed some hope that a match might be found between the Jesus ossuary fibre traces and the Shroud or Sudarium, but I’m unaware of any progress in this matter. The IAA and other “nay sayers” have made much of the fact that the names on the ossuaries were very common in 1st c Judaism. They conveniently overlook the unlikelihood of getting the full combination of names. I carried out some probability analysis at the time together with some “Monte Carlo” simulation tests, based on the frequency of individual names found on 1st c ossuaries. The odds for seven of the names occurring were calculated at 1 in 11,456; If the James ossuary was also included, the odds worked out at 1 in 38,140. It has to be significant! As Pellegrino has said: “If nothing else but an ossuary inscribed with the words ‘Jesus, son of Joseph’ were found in a tomb, bearing fibre evidence indicative of a missing body and two apparently sacred cloths, if these are indeed the two cloths described in John’s gospel, with a cross mark attached to Jesus’ name, and a star on the lid – and if the antechamber bore a symbol known to the Jesuit order to this day as a glyph, translated as ‘Jesus Saviour of man’ – – if nothing else had been found, we would all be crazy not to look on with a sense of mystery and wonder.” Based on the precedent of the Talpiot Tomb discovery, I would not be too hopeful that the present work by Jacobovici and Tabor will receive any more sympathetic treatment, particularly if Jacobovici has pursued his usual tendency to flights of fancy. If apostles are involved, we can for instance expect to see howls of anger from those ancient churches which still claim to hold their remains, whereas many of these claims are highly dubious..","date":"2012-03-01","mins":"7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/fasten-your-seatbelt-more-archeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Fasten your seatbelt: More Archeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"id":"comment-8878","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The use of ossuaries seems to have been fairly common in 1st c Palestine, from the time of say Herod the Great, but the practice ceased in 70 AD.

Any archaeological research involving burial sites is usually hampered by ultra Orthodox Jews, so the work has to be done unduly quickly. The IAA removes any ossuraries, any contents are buried in a common grave, and the ossuaries are then internally cleaned which removes practically all useful DNA information. This happened in the case of Talpiot. The “James” ossuary went missing, but was later found in the possession of a dealer, who was accused of fraud, although the case against him was eventually abandoned. As with most tombs, Talpiot had at some time been plundered by thieves, and also had been entered by medieval Crusaders, who buried three skulls there, and may have also marked the entrance with the “Jesus, Saviour.of man” glyph (circle and chevron), unless it was done by early Christians. If the “Jesus” ossuary had contained the Shroud, and other burial cloths, then one wonders when they might have been removed. Both the Mandylion and Sudarium were known in the sixth century, so it seems unlikely that they were removed by the Crusaders, despite any thoughts that the Shroud may eventually have fallen into the hands of the Knights Templar. One might fall back on the Abgar legend, or speculate that the thieves may have purloined the cloths off to early Christians. Possibly reasonable objections to Talpiot being the Jesus family tomb, include no mention of Nazareth or Galilee on the ossuaries, traditions that some of the family members were buried elsewhere, and the expensive costs involved for such an ordinary family. We might speculate that if Joseph of Aramathea was prepared to fund a costly burial cloth for Jesus, he might also be seen as a wealthy patron to ensure a respectable burial place for the rest of the family. One of the compelling or persuasive factors for me, is the very low probability of the combination of names, mentioned in my 7:27pm posting above, Any player of a Numbers gambling game such as Lotto, knows that it is quite easy to draw one or two numbers of a combination, but the highest prizes are reserved for those who are able to beat the odds with a full line of six or seven qualifying numbers, which seems to be the case at Talpiot..","date":"2012-03-02","mins":"4:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/fasten-your-seatbelt-more-archeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Fasten your seatbelt: More Archeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"id":"comment-8899","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks Ron for referring me to the video which I watched through to the finish. I decided not to post a comment there as I have no wish to make all my personal details known to Google as required by their Sign up process. The video is yet another unfortunate example of how badly the whole business of Talpiot has been handled, including a whole lot of butt covering. Much is made in the video of the incorrect allegation that the “bones of Jesus” had been discovered, whereas you’ll note in Randy’s posting at the head of this blog that no such assertion is made by Pellegrino, only some traces of fibres and a small hemispherical carpal bone in the Jesus ossuary. The video chases this straw man diversion of “bones of Jesus” whereas it appears that there were virtually no significant skeletal remains at all. Why were there no bones in this ossuary? The answer is fairly obvious, but the video does not touch on this aspect at all, but responds to an allegation that in fact is not asserted. Again, much is also made of the common use of the names found in 1st c Palestine. I think I’ve already covered that aspect in my postings above. The frequencies of the names used in my analysis were identical to those published in “L. Y. Rahmani, A Catalogue of Jewish Ossuaries, Israel Antiquities Authority and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Jerusalem: 1994)”, probably the same source as used in the video. Certainly, the names were common, but when the full combination of names found is considered, the probability falls to very long odds indeed: The odds for seven of the names occurring were calculated at 1 in 11,456; If the James ossuary is also included, the odds worked out at 1 in 38,140. It has to be significant! Rather like the Lotto ticket analogy I mentioned. The whole investigation was contaminated by Jacobovici’s quest for sensationalism, and his more outrageous statements which I’ve dealt with at length above. It is now too late to pursue the investigation in any meaningful scientific way, unless a correlation between the ossuary fibres and the Shroud/Sudarium cloths can be taken further. I don’t see that there is a significant problem between the two different tombs at “Holy Sepulchre” and Talpiot; Holy Sepulchre, close to Golgotha may be where Jesus was laid, in accordance with tradition, but the osssuary with the burial cloths could still be taken to a family tomb at Talpiot. Incidentally, the James ossuary had an identical patina to the other ossuaries at Talpiot, suggesting that there may be more to it than admitted. The whole business has been incompetently handled from the outset, and early Christian histiography is the poorer for it. I will continue to have an open mind about it, but I do find the combination of names highly persuasive..","date":"2012-03-02","mins":"5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/fasten-your-seatbelt-more-archeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Fasten your seatbelt: More Archeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"id":"comment-30992","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I read that cellulose is a complex polysaccharide with the formula (C6:H10:O5)n, consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand D glucose units. It is highly hydrophilic and can exist in crystalline and amorphous forms. The Fanti paper apparently asserts that the data from the calibration experiments demonstrate that the cellulose progressively degrades over long perionds of time and this can therefore be used for dating purposes. I do not understand what is going on here, nor what in fact the experiments are supposed to be measuring. Perhaps someone more chemically enlightened can explain it. Are the chains breaking up into fewer glucose units? Are the glucose units giving up some of their water content? Are the proportions of crystalline and amorphous components varying? Or is there some other explanation? Apart from the C, O, H atoms there appear to be no other elements involved, and so I am not clear on what the various spectral analyses might mean. One might guess that the various mechanical tests provide some measure of amorphous / crystalline proportions, perhaps water content, or even average chain lengths? Each of the various cloths used for calibration will have its own history, and the cellulose in each will therefore have reacted in different ways according to particular environments of exposures to light, temperature and humidity, as well as frequency of use, folding, and handling. Has consistency in the calibration results been demonstrated by various systematic samples from each cloth, or was only one sample from each cloth taken? A major reservation has to be that only one fibre of alleged provenance from the TS has been tested to demonstrate the final conclusion of a first century origin. This is no better than what was done for the C14 tests, and some might say it does not even match that low standard. The wide scatter between the three methods used, have been averaged out to provide the first century result. Another verdict might be that the three methods would seem to yield inconsistent results. Empiricism is sometimes a last resort when a more rational scientific approach is unavailable or unyielding. It may often be seen in the social sciences, the softer sciences such as finance and economics, earth sciences and hydrology.

The work of Orit Shamir seems mainly confined to the textiles found in the Christmas Cave at Qumran in connection with the Dead Sea scrolls.

I look for consistency, not endeavouring to prove one feature from another. All four evangelists mention Joseph of Arimathaea. Matthew and Luke are probably sourcing Mark. However John’s independent gospel also mentions him and includes Nicodemus. That is close to corroboration. Luke adds the gloss “”He had not consented to what the others had planned and carried out”, which discounts the assertion that he has voted against Jesus. The story does not smell to me of invention, partly because it is not an obvious story to invent, as indicated in your comments. I am happy to place other interpretations on the text, that “he bought fine linen” as a possible form of literary shorthand for some other kind of acquisition. I have suggested other possible sources above, one view being that it was at one time a temple garment, possibly John Mark who some say was the Sanhedrin secretary (see van der Hoeven), possibly even Joseph’s own garment, or possibly even intended as Joseph’s own burial shroud. It is not so incredible that a wealthy Jew, even the putative Joseph of Arimathaea, should be able to lay his hands on a fine linen cloth even on Preparation Day. Burial was one in fact one of the few works permitted on the sabbath. The assertion that the Shroud of Turin doesn’t match with funeral clothes in 1st century Palestine may rest on the fragments of one solitary plain weave shroud discovered by Israeli and British archaeologists (yet another case of a single sample being used for purposes of false generalisation). In fact it was not at all unususal to be buried in one’s own normal attire. In Jesus’ case, his clothes had been taken from him prior to his execution, the soldiers throwing dice for his seamless tunic. He was utterly naked on the cross, which was the usual practice, not even the loin cloth of artistic convention. My comment on extravagant funerals does not rest on Diana Fulbright’s paper, but on an Enclopaedia Britannica extract concerning Gamaliel II (2nd century AD). “When he died, he was buried, according to his own wish, garbed in simple linen, to discourage the expensive burials that had impoverished many Jewish families.” You may quarrel with Encyc Brit if you so wish.

If it was naturalistic, than it has to conform with the laws of nature, the process has to comply with physics and chemistry, and for that matter quantum mechanics. The image is superficial, so that if it can be classified as a scorch, then it has to be limited to what can scorch superficially. If the scorch was radiation derived, that might restrict the wave band. As there’s 3 D content, I think that might exclude contact. Perhaps it is a mix of causes.

We do not know that the image was a by product of the Resurrection or not. I’m certainly prepared to concede that the image may have been caused by some supernatural agency. However, I’m also prepared to allow that it may equally have been some naturalistic cause as yet unknown. To say that it must have been supernatural because we don’t yet know what caused it, is to employ a weak argument from our position of ignorance. Arguments against it being supernatural are: the image is of a very dead corpse, and nobody’s idea of a glorified risen Christ; minor imperfections in the image argue against it being a miracle, as we would expect a high degree of perfection which is absent in the actual image, as there are minor distortions. There is a gulf of ignorance concerning the action of corpses on 1st century linen wrappings within 40 hours of death, which no one has taken the time or trouble yet to explore. Instead they are fiddling with gadgetry such as eximer lasers, maybe because it’s the latest thing, instead of doing some hard experimental work to check out other options. De Liso in Piedmont spent some 12 years checking out seismic action on forming Shroud like images, and produced the only persuasive imagery I’ve ever seen. But a lot more work ought to be done to check out other options.

A scientific explanation for the cause of the Shroud image is a long way from being fully explored. In 2003 Ray Rogers treated Edgerton linen, similar to that described by Pliny the Elder, with dextrin and saponaria, and allowed it to evaporate; He then exposed it to ammonia vapour for 10 minutes. After 24 hours a light colour was observed, which was superficial and did not penetrate the medulla. As far as I know, little has been done to carry these experiments forward, or to corroborate them. Your claims of logic are in my view not logic at all, but are wishful thinking. Having said that, I would still be prepared to admit the possibility of a supernatural agency, but only after the proper science has been proven fruitless, which I personally think, may be not at all likely!

It provides some fascinating insights into the radical approach to leadership Pope Francis is applying from his Jesuit formation into his mission of transforming the Church. There are not only the more obvious signs of selfish exploitation mentioned by John Klotz in Francis’ references to the pollution of rivers such as in the Philippines, but also the more subtle signs in weather change, such as the expected devastating typhoon in Okinawa. We are particularly conscious of this in NZ and the Pacific, brought about by man made global warming. Despite its mid latitude geography, the Antarctic upper atmospheric ozone hole now extends to NZ, and our mid summers now impact on us resulting in one of the highest UV light exposures on the planet. Ice shelves and glaciers are melting with the consequence of rises in sea levels flooding low lying Pacific islands, already evident in Kiribati and elsewhere. Weather systems are becoming more and more unstable resulting in frequently changeable extremes. One of the principal causes is man made atmospheric pollution brought about by our excessive use of fossil fuels. Accidents are inevitable with deep sea oil drilling, and occasional foundering of monster oil tankers, such as those that occurred in the Caribbean with major damage to sea life. Man’s selfishness knows no limits and the earth suffers the consequence. Our approach to stewardship has been ambivalent.

But then he goes on and on, and allows his own religious perspectives to intrude and this then gets him into trouble! But there can be no doubt that the Shroud itself must have a religious dimension to it. There can be no escaping it! Many consider it a likeness of the founder of their own religion, the ony true religion, the only true likeness that can be verified, and they revere and worship this founder. And we do not know yet how this image was formed. Science has so far failed to ascertain how.

If Science has an answer – let it speak – but for the present it can only remain silent and speculate.

I reiterate: I do not know if De Liso’s images were on an impurity layer, or on the cellulose fibres, neither does Yannick Clement, and possibly neither does De Liso. He then delivers a long lecture on the work of his favorite scientific hero, states the importance of Rogers’ work, that Rogers was insistent that the chromophore was on the impurity layer, that Rogers conclusion was infallible and that all should acknowledge it, and then allows that Rogers was only probably right, and finally concedes that Rogers could be proved wrong. This is inconsistency at its worst! He then accuses myself and Carlos of being in the “supernatural freaks club of Fanti”. This probably refers to an inference he makes that Professor Fanti apparently expects that the Resurrection has left some material trace on the Shroud. I do not know if that is Professor Fanti’s position or not; it may be. But it is certainly not my position, and the accusation is completely unjustified.

It was not merely a spiritual event. But it was supernatural. The apostles saw and touched Jesus after the Resurrection; Thomas was invited to put his hand into His side, and to touch Him. Jesus was seen to eat and drink with the apostles at Emmaus. That is something which a mere spirit is incapable of.

We do not as yet know how the image on the Shroud was formed, and there is general disagreement as to whether this was caused by a naturalistic process, or whether it may have been a miraculous event, either miraculous by a providential concomitance of the circumstances that produced it by a naturalistic process, or else by the direct intervention of the Deity. All perspectives have their supporters, and I see little point in debating a preferred method without knowing and understanding a lot more about the image than we have at present. Such a debate generates more heat than enlightment. At some time in the future, when further access to the relic may be allowed, Science may be able to discover a more definitive answer than is possible at present. In the meantime, I believe all options as to how this image of Jesus Christ was formed are open. Regarding evidence of the Resurrection from the image: Clearly initiation and completion of the imaging process occurred within some 40 hours of death, as there is no sign of corruption, Whether the actual image was apparent immediately, some hours afterwards, or some years afterwards is not known. But the initiation process was complete within 40 hours. What happened to the body? If it had been unwrapped from its burial cloth and taken, this would have left some trace, such as smearing from fluids, blurring of the image, or damage to the fibrils of the linen. But there is no such evidence. We can only be left with the conclusion that this cloth is at least persuasive evidence of the Resurrection as a real event in our time and space and hence in physical reality..","date":"2012-12-17","mins":"3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is-it-absurd-to-think-that-the-shroud-can-show-a-physical-trace-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","title":"Is it absurd to think that the Shroud can show a physical trace of the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-20770","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Vaguely from a Thermodynamics 201 course some fifty years ago, I think it depends on whether it’s adiabatic, isotropic or isothermal!

It has to be agreed that it is problematic, and frequently not as specific as we would like it to be in the 21st century. But then there are reasons for this: The early Christians followed the OT prohibitions on images; frequent persecutions created reasons for secrecy, so there are only veiled references to such secrets in obscure and analogic (coded) format. The cult of icons developed in the 6th & 7th centuries and were followed by periods of iconoclasm: Icon worshippers were persecuted 726 – 786 and 814 – 842. Icon veneration was only restored in 843. The Byzantine practice of religion tended to protect the most sacred of relics from the common gaze. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, when the Crusaders set about their pillage of relics, papal threats of excommunication of those found to be in possession of them would discourage disclosure. Possibly the best survey of such documentation at present available is that by Daniel Scavone: “Acheiropoietos Jesus Images in Constantinople: the Documentary Evidence” by Daniel C. Scavone: : http://www.sindonology.org/scavone acheiropoietos.pdf Scavone has also addressed the problem of the period 1204 – 1355: “BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400”; http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers.htm This paper does not favour the Templar theory, although from Louis’ comments, there would seem to be more to come to light on this aspect. Other writers have also attempted to address the whereabouts of the Shroud during the first 500 years of Christianity, such as Jack Markwardt. The material they have to work with is often obscure for the reasons given above, but might be considered if not persuasive, then at least highly suggestive. Given the circumstances of history, that is probably the best that can be done for the present, until such time as more enlightening information might come to light. But it is not the desert implied by the comments: “(a) a lack of written record which extends over 13 centuries, and which some might consider stretches credulity somewhat where a1st century provenance is concerned, and (b) a lack of written record between (say) 1300 and 1357.” Read Scavone and make of it what you will..","date":"2014-07-28","mins":"6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"id":"comment-141006","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"In 1464, the same year that Duke Louis of Savoy made a settlement of 50 gold francs with the Lirey clergy for the loss of the Shroud, theologian Francesco della Rovere, soon to become Pope Sixtus IV wrote a book in which he mentions, “… the Shroud in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was taken down from the cross.

The Wiki site I mentioned, does mention the antikythera as a real object and makes the point that it was a type of mechanical computer. The hoax aspect comes from various fringe groups who interpret the discovery of such devices in weird and preposterous ways. After mentioning Archimedes’ description of his orrery, a type of planetarium. Sprague de Camp devotes some two pages in describing the antikythera and its discovery in some detail, and yet my text was published way back in 1963. More would be known about it now. It was essentially an astronomical computer, enclosed in a wooden box about a foot high, the size of a table clock. De Camp describes its working and gear trains in some detail. Apparently the Egyptians did not have leap years in their calendar, and so there was provision for resetting the device when the months went out of synchronisation. Some repairs made to the machine would indicate that it did indeed work. It must have required some very complex gearing as it would be relying on the Ptolemaic model of astronomy, rather than the later simpler Copernican model. The ship containing the device sank about 65 BCE. De Camp writes: “Nothing more is heard about such devices for over a thousand years. Yet they must have been built, for about 1000 CE, al Bhirini, an Iranian savant who traveled in India, described a similar machine”, and he makes some comparisons with the antikythera. Regarding the Besancon Shroud, which you also commented on: Scavone suggests that the original Shroud was sent by Othon de la Roche to his home cathedral in Besancon. He postulates that this was obtained by his descendant Jeanne de Vergy who rescued it as the church was in a bad state of repair, and was later destroyed by fire. He suggests that she later replaced it with a copy, which gave rise to the confusion from the Pierre D’Arcy memorandum alleging fraud, and as no one knew what the original looked like, the Besancon clergy accepted it, believing it to be the original. I may have read that the Besancon shroud included a copy of the ventral image only. Make of this what you will, you can check Scavone’s paper, “BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400” ; http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers.htm ..","date":"2014-08-01","mins":"4:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"id":"comment-214863","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Modern interest in the Shroud originates with the then startling photos of Secondo Pia in 1898. In 1902 Yves Delage presented the forensic work of biologist Paul Vignon and associates to the Paris Academy. The secular mood prevailing within the Academy at the time, created problems for Delage which are a matter of record, the Secretary of the Academy for instance refusing to publish the full text of the presentation. Both the photos of Pia and the work of Delage & Vignon presented a challenge to a certain dangerous Modernist trend within the Catholic Church at the time as it seemed that the Shroud imagery corroborated the texts of the gospels to the extent that the texts could no longer be dismissed as mere mythology according to the Modernist agenda. By manipulating the Pierre D’Arcis texts, Ulysse Chevalier was able to create an impression that the Shroud was an artifact dating from medieval times, and this argument was picked up by Herbert Thurston. The Catholic Encyclopedia article of 1907 14 was authored by Thurston, is solely based on Chevalier’s thesis and slanted history of the D’Arcis memorandum, with no consideration of what was then known of the image, such as its peculiar photo negative properties and the work of Delage and Vignon. His judgment that ‘the immense preponderance of opinion among learned Catholics was adverse to the authenticity of the relic’ is fundamentally his own opinion, with its sole basis being a questionable interpretation of history with no consideration of any scientific aspect. Following the publication of his ‘Shroud of Christ’ in 1902, Vignon carried out further research, travelling extensively, studying icons and identifying features common to the Shroud image, culminating in 1938 with publication of his “Holy Shroud of Turin: Science, Archaeology, History, Iconography, Logic” and was accordingly awarded the French Academy Prize, the Academy seemingly relenting on its 1902 response to Delage’s presentation. In 1931, much improved photographs were provided by Guiseppe Enrie, These were studied by forensic pathologist Pierre Barbet, who conducted several experiments on cadavers and amputated limbs, and who published works 1935 1950. Further forensic studies were carried out by Dr David Willis in England. The reaction of Pope Pius XII upon being informed of Barbet’s findings was the tearful response: “We did not know; nobody had ever told us!” Until 1969, King Umberto and the Turin guardians had resisted all attempts at scientific investigation and the taking of samples, notwithstanding that the Savoys had from time to time taken threads or other small samples for occasional gifts to family members or other notables. All investigations up until then were solely based on the Pia and Enrie photographs. The Pellegrino secret Commission of 1969 76 appears to have been the first time that the Shroud was ever subject to any kind of direct scientific scrutiny, but was limited in scope. The Raes textile samples, and Frei’s pollen samples date from this time. There had been some general awareness of the Shroud image among the Catholic faithful, as I recall seeing copies of the facial image among family homes during my childhood and youth during say 1948 60 and I recall reading magazine articles about it. Fr Peter Rinaldi had published his article in the Passionist monthly magazine “The Sign” in 1934, and also creating some interest in Scientific American”. The more recent film “The Silent Witness” also created considerable awareness. But perhaps it was only with the publication of Ian Wilson’s book in 1978, that propelled the Shroud to a greater awareness among the anglophone public. Whatever the shortcomings in Wilson’s own research, the sheer scope and coverage of the many different aspects of the Shroud in his book, certainly acted as a major catalyst for public awareness..","date":"2015-11-20","mins":"6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/19/just-in-time-for-christmas-the-relic-master/","cat":"books","title":"Just in time for Christmas:  The Relic Master"},{"id":"comment-14198","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There’s a lot of interesting material out there on miracles, despite Joanne Mc Portland’s “no nonsense” approach, and her apparent classification of miracles as religious bling “nice to have – but not really necessary”.

Prior to this, its dimensions were said to be 4.34m x 1.09m (Wilson). The ratio length to width is almost exactly 4:1, suggesting a cubit of about 545 mm. Multiply 1.09 by 4, the answer is 4.36m, i.e. 2 cm longer than 4.34m. Now suppose a 2cm strip was taken from one of the ends, so that the original length was in fact 4.36 cm. If Evaristo is correct, and not less than 2 cm was removed along the length of the cloth during the time that the edge piece was removed, then the original width of the Shroud could not have been more than 1.09m, but which is in fact its current width. That is if there is any significance in the highly suggestive 4:1 ratio. The original width ought not to have been less than 1.11m, and applying the 4:1 ratio, the original length ought to have been 4.44m, that is, 10 cm longer than it is now. 2) Methchild Flury Lemburg is on record as saying that she had only ever seen the same stitching of the side seam in cloths at Masada. [I’m aware of course that Charles Freeman does not accept this, and his lady wife considers it a more common stitch] Mme F L offered the explanation that the Shroud came from a much wider bolt of cloth, and that the selvedge on the original remnant bolt was removed and resewn to provide the Shroud side strip. We are now being asked to accept the explanation that the edge was resewn under Savoy, by either Valfre or another, and who used a stitching identical to that which Mme F L says was exclusively used at Masada. Notwithstanding any of this, Evaristo’s claims would seem sufficient to be able to assert that it is very likely that at various times, pieces were in fact removed and then skilfully resewn as to leave little trace of their removal. The bottom line is that it reinforces the need for properly representative sampling, which was certainly not done in the case of the 1988 C 14 invasion..","date":"2014-05-22","mins":"4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"id":"comment-123479","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Charles, a most interesting and fascinating observation.

No. Of threads = 109 x 38.6 = 4,207 threads. Each thread is 4.34m long. Total length of warp threads = 4,207 x 4.34 / 1000 km = 18.26 km.

No of threads = 434 x 25.7 = 11,154 threads. Each thread is 1.09m long. Total length of weft threads = 11,154 x 1.09 / 1000 km = 12.16 km. Weight / thread = 53.6 tex (gm / km); Weight of weft threads = 12.16 x 53.6 = 652 gm. Total estimated weight by this method gives 950 gm. Area of cloth = 4.34 x 100 x 1.09 x 100 = 47,306 cm2. Average weight = 0.0201 gm / cm2. Needs adjustment, as underlying assumption that threads are straight, whereas weaving would require longer threads than given by overall dimensions. Raes is said to have calculated 25 mg / cm2, implies he applied a correction of +25%. Backing cloth would increase overall weight. Conclusion: The weight of the Shroud held by 10 hands would I think not create the greatest damaging tension in the cloth. Most of the expositions were outdoors. I believe the most significant tensions would be created by windage (aerodynamics). These forces would be of two kinds: 1) billowing normal to the cloth (equivalent to aerodynamic “lift”) 2) drag forces tangential to the cloth. It seems likely that individual expositions may have lasted several hours. In addition the cloth would have been subjected at each exposition to: removal from reliquary, unwrapping / unfolding / unrolling, transport to exposition site, return transport to chapel, refolding / rerolling, placement in reliquary. There would be localised handling at suspension points with concentration of stress forces, and some abrasion which would be cumulative. Also occasional accidents were always bound to happen. Hygiene practices being what they were, bacterial contamination would add to localised degradation. Likely there have been hundreds of such expositions, and that’s only the ones since 1355. Other damage may have occurred prior to 1204. The need for occasional repairs is, I think, self evident. It eventually led to the disastrous restoration of 2002..","date":"2014-05-23","mins":"5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"id":"comment-123720","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Further note on windage stress during outdoor expositions: Despite occasional bans on washing lines in some modern urban developments, the practice of hanging laundry outdoors to dry will be familiar to most. Even mild to moderate winds results in flapping of the cloths, technically known as “flutter”. It is caused by shedding of oscillating vortex trails at the trailing edge. Cloth is particularly prone because of its lightness and flexibility, and because it lacks any rigidity. The effect is to cause periodic varying tension stresses throughout the material, concentrated at the suspension points, and eroding the residual fatigue life of the fibres. Linen being brittle would be more prone to fatigue damage than cotton or linen / cotton admixtures. Thus if bed sheets were changed weekly, and laundered say once a fortnight, 100 expositions might correspond to four years of regular laundry suspensions. Check the corners of your bed sheets if they’re hung out and pegged on the clothes line. Linen ones would be more susceptible than cotton.

For some years I studied several religions, “Ancient Religions”, Ancient mythologies”, Primal Religions” (Aboriginal, Polynesian, Micronesian, Maori, African”, Oriental Religions etc towards part of a Religious Studies major acquired extra murally through Massey University in NZ. A recurring theme in most of these always seemed to me to be part of the quest for the numinous, sometimes through animism, or totemism, sometimes through ancestor worship, sometimes through a heightening of spiritual awareness (occasionally by various intoxicants), the assigning of various gods as the guardians of nature. To early agricultural humanity, fertility of the soil was extremely important if the groups were to avoid famine, and hence the various fertility cults. Later religions often had scriptures which aspired to a higher philosophy, Religion in these societies often had other functions as well, the proper ordering of the community and good governance. No matter that much of this was imperfect, inadequate, and even occasionally perverted and astray. I view much of this as part of God’s plan towards humanity’s spiritual awakening to bring about an awareness of Himself. I believe that not only did Man search for God, but God also searched for Man to bring Man unto Himself. In the fulness of time, when the time was eventually right, He sent His Son into the world so that Man could be brought closer to God. But the task remains as yet unfinished, which is the duty of mission, The Vatican II document “Lumen Gentium”, the Constitution of the Church, is all embracing and all inclusive on just who comprise the “People of God”!

It is interesting that the stone head has a landscape framework similar to some mandylion representations, and it may be that there is a barely discernible epsilon on the forehead. The statue would seem to post date 1204 when it may be assumed that the full image of the Shroud would then be known. If the epsilon is indeed present, it would seem that for some reason the sculptor has associated the Shroud face with the Mandylion image. I know of no other mandylion with the epsilon sign. I think it may be presumptuous to attempt to read what may have been in the sculptor’s mind by this association. By no means can it be asserted as proof that they were one and the same object, but it may be thought highly suggestive. The involvement of the templars as custodians of the Shroud post 1204 is contentious. Daniel Scavone downplays the likelihood. He notes that only relatively junior templars confessed to worshipping a head, and then only under torture, and they would not have been privy to the innermost secrets of the order. Scavone claims that the same accusation was levelled against the Cathars, and it was only at the suggestion of the inquisitors that the confessions of worshipping a head were obtained. As the templars were in Constantinople during the fourth crusade, many of them would have heard the legends of the mandylion, a few may have seen it, and Robert de Clari claimed to have seen the Shroud image exhibited at Blachernae. So they knew of both, but that does not necessarily imply that they ever had custody of either. But it’s sufficient to explain the Calvary as a templar construction. There is also the well known templar mandylion representation at Templecombe. The Master of Normandy burnt at the stake with Jaques de Molay in 1314 was an earlier namesake of Geoffrey de Charnay. I don’t see any of this as making such a strong case that the templars were ever the custodians. Louis seems to be an advocate of the templar involvement in the custody of the Shroud.

According to the tradition based on a historic account written by Father Donato from Bomba in 1640, it arrived in Manoppello on an unknown day in the year 1506, when the physicist and astrologer Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, while was talking with some people, met a foreign man. He was invited to follow him into the Church. He received a mysterious wrapped veil. … While Father Donato was unrolling the veil, thus discovering the image of Christ, the foreign man disappeared.” “The veil stayed at the Leonelli family for almost one hundred years; but in 1608 the several heirs started to contend for it. … (etc)” “Father Heinrich Pfeiffer, Jesuit and Professor of Iconology and History of Christian Art at the Gregorian University of Rome, thinks the veil of Manoppello is the Roman Veronica. According to the historic reconstruction, Veronica, called “acheiropoietos”, reached Constantinople in VI century (coming from Jerusalem and then from Camelia, in Cappadocia). It stayed there until 705, when it disappeared mysteriously, perhaps to save it from the iconoclastic movements of the time. It was in Rome under Pope Gregorio; after several vicissitudes, it was carried into St Peter’s Cathedral, becoming an important destination for thousands pilgrims. After the demolition of the chapel where Veronica was held, in 1608, no trace of the veil was found. The veil appeared in Manoppello is thought to be the historic and legendary Veronica.” “In 1978 Sister Blandina Paschalis Schloemer, a clever iconographer, said on account of some researches and investigations that the sacred face in Manoppello and the sacred face of the Sacra Sindone (the Holy Shroud) in Turin are exactly superimposable.

His is only one scholarly voice, but the programme Meier set himself was long overdue and necessary. There are others who will attempt the task that Louis espouses. Nor do I agree that Meier’s work will be the cause of Christians falling away from their faith, quite the reverse. The modern quest for the historical Jesus had its beginnings with the publication of the work of Schweitzer (1906 10) and Bultmann (1934). There followed an outpouring of other works by various scholars, which was given added impetus by the development of multi disciplinary methods of modern criticism applied to ancient literature, and in particular to biblical literature. While many attempts had scholarly value, the efforts of some authors were highly speculative sometimes even degenerating almost to the form of a novel, while yet others verged to the opposite extreme of reductionism and scepticism and a general rejection of the Jesus of traditional Faith, almost on principle. Towards the end of the 20th century, the promoters of the “Jesus Seminar” for instance, adopted a kind of committee approach to validating the various sayings, yielding a reductionist approach biased towards general scepticism. The various Christian churches reacted to this “historical quest” in various ways; ranging from the fundamentalist literal approach of interpreting the scriptures and rejection of such novelties, to others with a more readily liberal acceptance of some of the assertions made. Meier’s conclave, or imaginary round table, of a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew and an agnostic – all honest historians cognizant of first century religious movements – brought a much needed discipline into this quest for the “Historical Jesus”, that other such attempts had failed to do. Those scholars who follow Meier now have a sound basis on which they may build. That many in the Western World are falling away, can be attributed to a variety of causes: the unduly loud voice of secularism, and indifferentism, the cult of the individual, a post modernist philosophy, and a selfish hedonism, to name a few of the army of Legion. It cannot be attributed to the scholarly work of such as John P Meier. Elsewhere, others are heeding the call of the gospel.

I dare say that Mgr Meier does devote some time to preaching the fulness of the gospel, when he is not pursuing more scholarly work. “A Marginal Jew” is not the only work he has written, but it is probably his most significant. He is William K. Warren Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame. His fields include biblical studies and Christianity and Judaism in antiquity. Before coming to Notre Dame, he was professor of New Testament at The Catholic University of America. Meier makes careful distinctions between the “The Real Jesus”, the “Biblical Jesus” and the “Historical Jesus”, and we might also add the “Jesus of Faith”. It is to the “Historical Jesus” that Meier turns his attention in “A Marginal Jew”. Certainly there are limits to what the historical method can achieve, and in order to discover the “Jesus of Faith” we must look elsewhere, such as to Benedict’s “Jesus of Nazareth”. However in a rational age, this “Jesus of Faith” must surely need to correspond to the “historical Jesus” rather than some idealised pietistic fantasy.

Arguments may be marshalled in its favour and sources cited. But essentially it comes down to a matter of Faith. It is certainly beyond normal human experience. I may claim that it was an actual event and is an essential ingredient of Christian Faith, but I can hardly claim it as an event accepted by a consensus of historians as an historic event.

Marcus Borg states that the suggestions that an adult Jesus traveled to Egypt or India and came into contact with Buddhism are “without historical foundation”. John Dominic Crossan states that none of the theories presented about the travels of Jesus to fill the gap between his early life and the start of his ministry have been supported by modern scholarship. Leslie Houlden states that although modern parallels between the teachings of Jesus and Buddha have been drawn, these comparisons emerged after missionary contacts in the 19th century and there is no historically reliable evidence of contacts between Buddhism and Jesus.

I personally find it intriguing that it was at Sepphoris, as you say only 5km from Nazareth, that the True Cross (Vera Crux) eventually disappeared when the Crusaders were defeated by Saladin who captured it as a war trophy during the battle of Hattin. I liked the romantic idea that it was as if the wooden cross had returned to the home town of Jesus, where he himself had worked in wood, and had included it in a romantic little essay I published in my parish magazine. Sepphoris had been rebuilt by Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee until he was banished in 39 AD.

The driving forces for that extinction primarily involve the selfish exploitation of the environment. Our air, water, and land are all yielding to onslaughts from interests seeking immense wealth, whatever the environmental costs.” Curiously I had just read a short article from our Archdiocesan newspaper that I picked up last evening at church; Wel Com, April 2014, “In search of the Ark” by Kieran Fenn, which addresses this issue. It is just a little too soon for the article yet to appear on the Wel Com web site. Fenn draws on Valdes, A.A. ‘The Bible Questions People Ask’. I was aware of the Babylonian origins of the Noah story and so the article attracted my attention. Some extracts: “The author took a pre existing story, with all its interestng details, to transmit a religious teaching. The first lesson was that the flood came because of human frailty, a lesson for our own endangered planet..” “Sin accumulated to the point of corruption and perversion that provoked a catastrophe. With all this, the world came back to to the chaos that existed before creation. The order that God has put into creation could be destroyed by human responsibility. … No reason is given Noah; he is told to do it and wait. Ridicule from his contemporaries would follow, and Noah’s only answer could be ‘God ordered me to do so. I obey.’ No complaint comes from his lips over four chapters; no other biblical character is told so little and saying so little. Finally God reveals the secret of the rain. The message is clear according to the ways of the Old Testament. If humanity obeys God’s orders, it will be saved. If it disobeys, it faces self destruction. God specifies the measurements, materials and form of the ark. We have to shape our lives according to God’s dimensions and then we will transcend any storm. Those who do not listen to God’s guidance will drown.” Reserves are one way of assisting the survival of threatened species, and NZ conservationists have been active in ensuring the survival of many species of our vulnerable indigenous bird, insect, reptile and plant life by moving colonies to predator free near by islands, and taking action against exotic introduced predators. We have recently scored a major success in the UN against whaling in our Southern Ocean. However there is a much wider issue, that of the survival of the planet. The depredation of large forests which in the past have ensured atmospheric stability, aggravated by our ever increasing use of fossil fuels, the consequential global warning, melting of the ice caps with rising sea levels, and the drowning of low lying islands and present coastal areas which will no longer be inhabitable. Most of us are already experiencing the effects of climate change, its effects on changing food production patterns, more frequent climate disasters, and major fatalities in local populations. Adam was given steward ship of the earth. Too often he has seen this as a license to exploit rather than conserve. There are still lessons to be learnt in the story of Noah.

The Faccini Fanti paper is their particular interpretation, and neither are they forensic pathologists. In particular the Type I weapon they illustrate cannot be the weapon used to produce the Type I flagellation marks. It shows four thongs with three pellets each thong located near the tips. Barbet states that the majority wounds occur as dumbbells in pairs, implying two pellets for each of two thongs. Most of the flagellation marks on the front of the body are produced by the tips of the thongs whipping around to the front, implying that the pellets were at some distance from the tips. The Faccini Fanti Type II wounds they say are not clearly visible to the naked eye and have been elucidated by image enhancement, a method unavailable to any medieval copyists.

Crucial to his case is the actual date of composition. There had been an exposition of the Shroud at Turin in 1868, so that it may have come to Elgar’s attention fairly early in his life (1857 1934). Secondo Pia’s attempts at photography occurred during the eight day exposition commencing on May 25, 1898, and he succeeded on May 28, the Shroud being returned to the Royal Chapel on June 2. The Wiki entry states that Elgar composed the work during 1898 99, although another source I referred to gave 1896, which would seem to be too early if Pia’s photos were the inspiration. Possibly the 1896 date may be unreliable judging from the Wiki commentary, which has the entry: “Elgar’s account of the piece’s genesis was that after a tiring day of teaching in late October 1898, he was daydreaming at the piano. A melody he played caught the attention of his wife Alice, (etc)”. Other possible intriguing solution are given in the Wiki account, including various popular tunes which Elgar stated were incorrect, and also other explanations including an approximation to the math constant pi, from the intervals 3 1 4 2, although apparently this is a fairly common sequence in composition. The Roman liturgy for the Easter Saturday vigil Paschal Candle ceremony requires the celebrant to cut on its surface a cross with the figures of the current year, each figure being placed in one of the cross quadrants, and to inscribe the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet above and below, and saying “Christ yesterday and today the beginning and the end Alpha and Omega all time belongs to him (etc)”. He then inserts the five grains of incense into the form of the cross as symbols of the five wounds. I am unable to comment on the Greek practices, whether an L shape or cross was incised. The allusion to the swastika as a combination of four gamma symbols is interesting, but I think only illustrates that symbols can be a rich and imaginative source of inspiration. The swastika itself is a very ancient symbol and would pre date Masada. It’s form is usually reversed from its more familar Nazi form. It can be found in ancient India and also China. My Chinese daughter in law from North China frequently decorated eggs with rows of such symbols as signs of ‘good luck’. Elgar composed several religious works, including a number of Oratorios both before and after the Enigma Variations. Was the Shroud the inspiration for the Enigma? Who knows? Like many artistic creations, it may have had manifold inspirational influences, some no doubt subconscious, although Elgar seems to have made it clear that there was one particular enigma behind it. As we have now come to learn, the Shroud is certainly enigmatic!.","date":"2013-06-11","mins":"5:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/11/the-poker-holes-on-the-turin-shroud-deliberately-put-there-to-designate-the-cloth-as-sacred/","cat":"books","title":"The poker holes on the Turin Shroud deliberately put there to designate the cloth as sacred?"},{"id":"comment-36744","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The gammadion is extensively discussed on a few “Sacred Texts” sites. It seems to have had an Indo Aryan origin but other cultures also imported it. Earliest examples associate it with the sun, whence sun god, whence any supreme god according to the culture. It was Indian Buddhism that introduced the symbol to China. The central position sometimes included a disc or wheel indicating the sun, and the arms supposedly the rays pointing in all directions. There were variations, sometimes only with three spokes somewhat similar to the Manx three legged symbol. A problem I have in interpreting the Shroud “poker holes” as a gamma symbol is that the shape of the hole pattern depicted above is an inverted gamma pointing in the opposite direction. It is more like an L or even 7. Depending on which one of the four patterns is observed, two show an L and two show a gamma, because of the folding when the holes occurred. If the ‘L’ is intended as an abbreviation for “Lumen” then this is Latin, not Greek of course, whereas the holes seem to have occurred during a Greek speaking period rather than during Roman Latin. If, however the pattern is intended to be a Gamma, then I wonder if it can be associated with the Trinity. The Greeks picked up the Hebrew habit of gematria (Gk “esopsephia”) during New Testament times (e.g. Rev use of the numer 666 for antichrist).

Constantine VII of course closely inspected the Mandylion on its first arrival in Constantinople, commenting on the “watery” appearance of the image, while his step brothers were unable to discern it very well at all. In addition we have the references quoted by Albert Dreisbach in his paper “Lazarus & Jesus” at the Atlanta conference in 2005: “… we should not be overly surprised to discover as early as A.D. 325, Pope Sylvester I established: that Mass be celebrated on an altar covered with a cloth of linen consecrated by the Bishop, as if it were the clean Shroud of Christ. ” “Theodore of Mopsuestia (ca. A.D. 350 428) expresses this motif’s incorporation into the liturgy, describing the role of the deacons in the liturgy as follows: ” “When they bring up (the oblation at the offertory) they place it on the altar for the completed representation of the passion so that we may think of Him on the altar as if He were placed in the sepulchre after having received the passion … the deacons who spread the linens on the altar represent the figure of the linen cloths at the burial….” These allusions, although they do not specifically refer to a cloth with an image, clearly demonstrate that the burial cloths were considered particlarly significant in the liturgy, they were clearly in the minds of the liturgists, and it is rational to infer that there must have been some specific known object giving rise to this outlook, for an emphasis to be made on “burial cloths” in the liturgy..","date":"2013-06-13","mins":"6:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/11/the-poker-holes-on-the-turin-shroud-deliberately-put-there-to-designate-the-cloth-as-sacred/","cat":"books","title":"The poker holes on the Turin Shroud deliberately put there to designate the cloth as sacred?"},{"id":"comment-8865","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“… hopefully I will continue to see Christ more in others and not just his image on the shroud.” Seeing Christ in the image on the Shroud is the easy part; I’ve ussually found that seeing Christ in others can somtimes be very difficult indeed.

Effectively that nothing in the weaving or sewing techniques speaks against a high quality product of textile workers of the first century AD. It might equally be said that it is within the capability of 20th century textile workers, although the process of extracting the linen from the flax is clearly quite different. The important point she makes however is that the cloth cannot be rejected as not being of 1st century provenance simply on the grounds of the weaving or sewing techniques used. However, elsewhere she rejects it as being of medieval provenance because of the width of the cloth. She refers for example to bed sheets which commonly had a seam running down their middle, as medieval looms lacked the width of ancient types. I think it a serious error of logic in focusing on only one property at a time and then making a judgment simply on that. It may not suit the scientific mind set, but it is how evidence works in our law courts. The TOTAL evidence must be weighed to arrive at a successful conclusion. I prefer to think in terms of Venn diagrams. Thus evidence might satisfy Propositions A, B, C and D but not satisfy Propositions E and F. It may be that E and F are so critical as to negate the conclusion, or it may be that they are can be considered as not so relevant. However if all propositions A through to F are in fact satisfied then there is clearly a strong case. In the case of the TS, there are several points of evidence that point to its authenticity. Some of these are very strong, others less so. The question of weaving and sewing tends perhaps to be the type of evidence that allows the admissibility of authenticity without it being necessarily corroborative. The forensic evidence is particularly strong and tends to be coroborative. The question of halophyte pollens demonstrates that the TS was certainly at some time in Palestine, other pollens that it was there during the months of March or April. The arogonite limestone is persuasive but needs further independent confirmation. It is important not to lose sight of the whole picture. Experts may carp and niggle over particular aspects exclusive to their particular specialty. But experts never get to sit on juries, their role is advisory only.

My response to that question would have to be: “Quite possibly. But that there are some big ‘howevers’ “. Hugh has mentioned Fanti’s general approach, essentially measuring age related changes in the spectral and mechanical properties of linen. You can find his related papers or references to them on Barrie Schwortz’s shroud.com web site. Two in particular are: “Non destructive dating of ancient flax textiles by means of vibrational spectroscopy” Authors: Giulio Fanti, Pietro Baraldi, Roberto Basso, Anna Tinti; and “A NEW CYCLIC LOADS MACHINE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF MICRO MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SINGLE FLAX FIBERS COMING FROM THE TURIN SHROUD” Authors: Giulio Fanti, Pierandrea Malfi. I will confine my technical comments to the mechanical testing, the Cyclic Loads machine. Cyclic load testing has been used for several decades to measure the fatigue characteristics of engineering materials, particularly metallic materials such as steels and aluminium, and has a reputable history in engineering. It is particularly suitable for testing materials which are susceptible to very many cycles of heavy loading over the life of the different components, such as engine parts and highly stressed components in railway bridging where heavy loadings are repetitive. Typically all materials will fracture after a certain number of cycles for any given stress, down to a certain stress called the “endurance limit” below which no number of repetitions will produce fracture. Another mechanical characteristic of materials is the “Young’s modulus”. This is the stress required to produce unit strain, All materials will stretch when subject to a tensile load. The strain is defined as the amount of extension divided by the length of the sample; the stress is the load divided by the cross sectional area. Young’s modulus is calculated by dividing the stress by the strain. Several materials show elastic behaviour so that up to a certain elastic limit, strain is directly proportional to stress and Young’s modulus is fairly constant over this range. Many materials however, such as aluminium are not elastic, and their stretch behavior increases with loading, so that for these more plastic materials the modulus is defined by adopting an appropriate engineering convention for them over the range of loading. The mechanical properties chosen by the authors as seemingly age related were: breaking stress; two Young’s Moduli 1) relating to the last part of the increasing loading cycles, 2) relative to the first part of the decreasing loading cycles; two loss factors relating to dissipated and stored energies and other factors. Mechanical properties of the flax fibres versus known ages of the samples were then correlated. The authors write: “This goal was reached performing stress strain measurements in 350 loading unloading cycles of 85 different flax fibers belonging to samples of 12 different historical and modern flax fabrics, see Ref. [14], dating back to up to more than five thousand years ago, obtaining approximately 16,000 manual acquisitions.” The authors thus obtained five correlation curves for their five parameters. A measure of the “goodness of fit” when carrying out such work is the “Pearson’s correlation coefficient” = R. If R = 0.0, then there is no obvious correlation between the parameter and age and consequently no obvious relationship; If R = 1.0 then there is perfect fit and the parameter gives a very high predictability of true age. For the five parameters, the authors claim values of R between 0.90 and 0.95, which on the face of it would seem to be quite high correlation ratios. Rather than taking a simple average of the five dating methods, the authors then proposed a “weighted mean” of the five methods giving greater weight to some apparently more reliable parameters than others. They claim: “The resulting uncertainty of the historical dates deriving from the measured mechanical parameters has a standard uncertainty of about 200 years.” Taken singly, the five individual parameters give a very large range of possible dates for the TS, and with quite large margins of error. The oldest date is 556 BC, error 336 years; youngest date 456 AD error 538 years. However their weighted mean is 372 BC error 214 years. I might be happier with this last result, if the authors had given a correlation coefficient for their choice of the weighted mean formula. There are many extraneous factors that can affect the mechanical properties of flax fibres. The authors note the possible historic effects of humidity and heat. They claim that these effects are manifest in the appearance of the fibres, such as their colour. Various fibres were rejected for testing on these grounds. Other effects, not evidently considered, result from the history of the parent fabric, such as repetitions of folding, rolling and methods of storage and their particular environment. Gian Marco Rinaldi above has referred to the subjective selection of apparently older fibres, which may raise a doubt as to the integrity of the selection process. I do not agree with Hugh’s conclusion that the results show such poor correlation that the method cannot be considered as useful. However we need to know a lot more about the raw data, than has been forthcoming to date. There is certainly the problem of obtaining sufficient calibration samples. Acceptance of any new scientific method always requires its replication and peer review by other independent investigators, and of course so far, this has not happened. In principle however, the method of mechanical testing might provide a type of credibility check on other more established dating methods, but because of the importance of extraneous effects mentioned, and these will always be unknown, it seems likely that quite large errors of at least 200 years or more, can never be eliminated..","date":"2015-06-28","mins":"5:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/update-on-new-book-by-giulio-fanti-and-pierandrea-malfi/","cat":"books","title":"Update on New Book by Giulio Fanti and Pierandrea Malfi"},{"id":"comment-13263","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Radical Muslims would know how to do deal with it.

They might have been placed along the sides of the body, and then Max can have his tight wrapping together with image formation which could then be orthogonal. The gospel accounts say the tomb was in a garden, and it was spring, so maybe there could have been some fresh floral packing as well. Danin and others have asserted they see images of various flowers, others say they don’t see them.

The principal authority cited (Wacks), seems prepared to concede the presence of the coins but could not agree with its main advocate Fr Filas that it was a Pontius Pilate coin with the lituus which he says was not issued until after August 30 AD post dating the April 7, 30 AD date often proposed as the date of the crucifixion. This is the date that Meier favours, however a date in 33 AD is also admissible when the lituus coins would have then been available. However the reference also suggests that an earlier coin issued would fit the case, viz: “If the Shroud coin image was caused by a coin of Coponius or Ambibulus, it would cause no problems concerning the dating of the Shroud to the time of Jesus, Wacks points out, since coins circulated for decades and longer in the ancient world. The coins of Coponius and Ambibulus are among the most common of all Prefect and Procurator issues … and they were struck only about 20 years before Jesus’ crucifixion. ” Personally I don’t see the coins, but that may be my lack of perception. It is interesting that Wacks is prepared to concede an earlier coin may be there, and his main difficulty seems to be in agreeing to Fr Filas’ interpretation, that it is a lituus coin rather than with the fact(?) of the coins. I would be inclined to ignore the authors’ contention that Jews viewed the coins with disfavour because they hated Pilate. I’d be certain that they used the coins in everyday transactions without a moment’s thought.

Those who have asserted their presence may possibly be seeing pareidolia. Those who deny their presence may lack the necessary perception. I doubt that the matter will ever be resolved because of the inherent graininess of the image. Nor does image enhancement, such as smoothing and blurring resolve the matter, as any positive results may merely be an artefact of the process. Even the very clear image of a man’s face on the planet Mars was no more than a trick of nature from mountain shadows, a pareidolia. I don’t think that denial of the coins on eyes should rest on claims that it was a pagan practice and unlikely to be practised in Jewish burials. Charon’s obol to pay the ferryman was a single coin placed in the mouth, not two coins on the eyes.

What I take from the article is that the Jews were able to accept the coins as suitable for temple use, as they were able to interpret the symbols in terms of their own culture. However I am a little confused concerning the assertion that the Romans made an effort to avoid offending Jewish sensibilities, by not including images of persons or animals on their coins. From the story in Mark 12:14, which both Matthew and Luke also include, we know that the poll tax coin must have had an image of Caesar (presumably at this time, Tiberius). “Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar’s.” Matthew 22:15 22 Clearly the silver denarii had an image of Caesar.

It signifies no more than what family members believed was a respectful duty towards the deceased.” They needed only one coin to pay Charon, so why two?

The term “Charon’s obol” is a catch all phrase commonly used by some archaeologists to refer to the much more general practice of placing coins or other similar material about the head of the deceased, usually upon the eyes. Strictly the term can only apply to a single coin placed in the mouth. Few expressions of religions have not been affected by cross culturation, and it is evident throughout the various expressions of Christianity today. Iranian religion for instance had a profound influence on Judaism, associated sects particularly the Essenes, and also on Christianity. This is no new discovery.

As well as several papers in English Literature, Language, and Applied Mathematics and Statistics, it also included a major in Religious Studies. This last was no mere narrow focus on Biblical Studies, which I have not neglected, but was extremely broad ranging. As well as the core subjects of Universal Religions, (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism), it included papers on Primal Religions (African, Pacific, NZ Maori, Australian Aboriginal), Oriental Religions (Chinese & Japanese), Ancient Religions (Egyptian, Babylonian, Iranian, Persian), Phenomenology of Religions, Critical Issues in Modern Religion, and many more. I have presented seminar papers on the Bhagavad Gita, on Baal Hadad, the Epic of Gilgamesh, Teilhard de Chardin, Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII, Japanese Shinto and various others. I have been acquainted with and studied the Hindu Vedas, the Upanishads, the Darius inscription, the Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl, the Zend Avesta, Boethius and Augustine, and oh yes, Biblical Studies. I have read such authors as Rudolf Otto, Ninian Smart, Eric Sharpe and many more. I continue in later life to be intrigued by the manifold human expressions in religious matters.

Strictly, Charon’s obol is a single coin placed in the mouth, and coins that are sometimes found in the mouths of skulls, have sometimes dropped there from the eye sockets. The ancient practice extended from Ireland, to Britain and most of Europe, and further east. There were actually more Roman graves with coins in the skulls (about 50%) than ever occurred in Greece. Greek playwrights were fond of lampooning the practice, because of its association with paying the ferryman. (What would happen to the deceased, if they did not pay the ferryman?) On another web site, a Magyar grandmother explained the practice of placing coins over the eyes, so that visitors might not see their own death reflected in the person’s eyes. Clearly there are a variety of cultural reasons for the practice. The eyes are the windows of the soul, and visitors should not intrude thus far into the deceased’s privacy.

I have carried out several Monte Carlo simulations during my working career and also since then during personal research projects, so I’m well acquainted with what they can and cannot do. Typically each possible outcome depends on a number of events all with different probabilities and frequency distributions. A random number generator then determines whether a particular event occurs or not according to each event’s probability, and the outcome for a particular simulation obtained. Several simulations, perhaps 1,000, are then run, and the overall probability distribution for the outcome obtained. Several different approaches may be possible. I have some difficulty in envisaging how a Monte Carlo simulation might be applied in deciding whether a perceived object is real or not. Can you elucidate what you envisage? Turning now to the authors’ paper and the overall problem: 1. From the paper, it would seem that if several investigators asserted that they could see very much more than 2 inscriptions (say mean plus two S Ds) then that ought to be evidence that the inscriptions are in fact real, but if less than this they may only be pareidolia. If the investigators all claimed independently to see the same inscription in the same place, that would be good evidence that the inscription was real. However there are other issues that I’ve mentioned above, the scaling issue, and the selective bias of the observers in the model experiment. 2. A wicked thought occurred to me last night. In university sponsored psychology experiments it is common to use psychology students as the observers as being part of their practical training. This creates a selective bias. The students become trained guinea pigs, and after some experience may well guess the real purpose of the experiment, and so develop a skill in detecting the expectation of the experimenters, and seeking to please their professors, give a result that meets that expectation. The experimenters being trained psychologists would be aware of this, and consequently the use of psychology experiments in this environment may be vulnerable to a mischievous intent, and consequently result in a suspect report..","date":"2015-11-11","mins":"2:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/11/psychological-influences-in-seeing-inscriptions-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Psychological Influences in Seeing Inscriptions on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-214504","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I’d need to think about it a lot more.

Frei was founder and director for 25 years of the scientific department of the Zurich Criminal Police. Presumably his services were extensively and frequently used to secure criminal convictions in all of that time. His services had also been used for criminal work in Turin, when he was asked to notarise the 1973 shroud photography. His basic training was in botany. May we not assume that the techniques he used in retrieving and identifying pollens from the Shroud would not be too different from his practice in his criminal cases. Scientific standards and protocols may be refined, improved and made more rigorous in the course of time. Would not Frei be following the protocols he had developed during the course of his criminal work and accepted as good practice at the time. Does the criticism arise from measuring the standard of his work against a more recent and different standard? In his 2010 book, Wilson tabulates a full page detailed catalogue of 58 pollens identified by Frei, adapted from a posthumous work on Frei’s behalf by Professor Heinrich Pfeiffer. Further charts were publised by Dr Werner Bulst. Professors Danin & Baruch identified 91 species of thornbush exclusive to the Middle East. Dr Thomas Litt criticised the Danin/Baruch work as it appears that Baruch had not removed the pollens from the tapes to ensure accuracy of identification as apparently Frei had done. It was only at that stage that Danin disowned Baruch’s work. I now find it perplexing that Frei’s own work should be brought under a cloud. What is the nature and source of the criticism, and how robust is this criticism? It is vital that this matter be resolved. Otherwise Frei’s pollen samples are persuasive evidence that the Shroud during its history has at various times been in Southern Israel, in Jerusalem during March April (Passover), and in Anatolia, as well as Western Europe.

The structure of the wall of a pollen grain is oftentimes so characteristic that in some cases species may be identified by pollen grains alone. On the other hand, there are cases in which pollen grains of very like structure occur in quite unrelated plant families. Because of their high resistance to decay, their widespread dispersal by wind and water, and their abundant production by plants, pollen grains are very common constituents of geologic sediments, both recent and ancient. Because of these features pollen grains have provided much information on the origin and geologic history of terrestrial plant life.

I seem to have been blocked from posting on that thread, else told it’s a duplicate comment. I’ll try posting it out of context here instead. Here goes: Concerning the D’Arcy memorandum alleging that the image was painted: The position is clearly set out in Markwardt’s 2001 paper “Conspiracy against the Shroud”, and Wilson 1978 also comments on it. In 1900 Ulysse Chevalier apparently had available to him a near finished Latin draft from the Troyes diocesan archives addressed to a Scribe, which would imply that the alleged memorandum was never even sent to the Scribe, let only to Anti pope Clement VII. However rather than producing this draft, Chevalier cobbled together a text from prior separate notes, which included editing marks such as marginal notes, cross outs, and substitute wording, and manufactured for it an end of 1389 date; as by its archival retention it would be clear from the near finished draft for the scribe that the memorandum had not in fact been sent to Clement. Markwardt refers to the two source documents: “In 1993, Hilda Leynen discovered that two distinct drafts of the D’Arcis Memorandum were maintained in the Champagne collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, one very rough and containing bracketed words, and the other a relatively neat and polished product.” From Chevalier’s cobbled Latin text, Herbert Thurston published an English translation in the Catholic periodical “The Month” in 1903. Wilson 1978 provides the full text of Thurston’s translation as Appendix B, the fraud apparently even escaping Wilson’s attention. The relevant text cited by Markwardt is included in his Note 6: ‘6 The memorandum refers to an alleged investigation conducted, in about 1355, by Henri de Poitiers, Bishop of Troyes. “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered the fraud and how the cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed.” ‘ Wilson makes the point that Latin lacks a definite article, and that the verb used was not “pingere” (to paint) but “depingere” (to copy). Thus the key phrase can be just as easily translated as: “… by an artist who had copied it … ” which sheds rather a different light on the whole bizarre episode. Thus relying on a questionable translation of a fraudulent memorandum may be the stuff by which art historians might make a living, but to others it may seem rather slender grounds for asserting that the origin of the Shroud image was ever an artist’s paint brush! Very likely, D’Arcis’ alleged copy assuming it existed, may have been commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original she had taken from St Stephen’s at Besancon for safe keeping and the venerable cleric was confused about the matter. The 1880 assertion that both the Besancon and Piedmont Shrouds were authentic burial cloths beggars belief, would seem to be based on no more than an excessive piety, by 1880 the French Revolution would already have deposed of the Besancon icon, the reverend gentleman would no longer have had access to it, nor would he have had access to the 1898 Pia photography..","date":"2014-11-26","mins":"4:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/25/environmental-study-of-the-shroud-in-jerusalem-videos/","cat":"video","title":"Environmental Study of the Shroud in Jerusalem Videos"},{"id":"comment-173258","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If the cloth was on its way for sale in Jerusalem, then you’d be concerned about conserving its sale value and you wouldn’t be folding it into 52 squares with 1 foot sides.

Margaret de Charnay used a donkey to transport it across the hills to the Savoy castle, and held her precious relic in such high regard, that she’d be careful about such matters as folding. They wouldn’t be storing it that way in the imperial collection at Constantinople either. The solution that cries out as the most likely explanation, is that it was stored that way, perhaps hurriedly, to conceal and hide it from those who would pillage it, somewhere in the Middle East, perhaps by a custodian monk in Antioch, or even perhaps by a few of the apostles in a time of persecution.

It had been folded twice lengthwise and then with 12 loose folds concertina fashion. The pattern is discussed in Wilson 2010, his Chapter 6 and Fig 12. The looseness of the folding suggests storage in an earthenware jar similar to those used for the storing of the Dead Sea scrolls. Guerreschi and Wilson simulated the folding and storage on British Television in 2004 obtaining an identical water stain pattern. Perhaps the water stain pattern was incurred during a journey by camel train from Afghanistan, or from hiding it from imperial authorities in Antioch by monkish custodians of the Syriac Church, or even by a few of the apostles, or conceivably even ‘en route’ from Athens to Besancon. I think it doubtful that the De Charnay family would have considered that Dead Sea earthenware jars would be a suitable method of storage, as they had other means available.

Mark 6:3 – “Is he not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.” The doctrine of Mary’s perpetual virginity originated in the 4th century, but possibly from an earlier tradition, Jerome and other Church fathers offering various explanations for this verse. These explanations have not been accepted by John P Meier in his “A Marginal Jew”. . Monsignor Meier’s credentials are excellent – a Catholic priest in good standing with his Church – professor of New Testament at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., who has been both president of the Catholic Biblical Association and the general editor of the Catholic Biblical Quarterly. He is possibly the foremost biblical scholar of his generation. His “A Marginal Jew” is cited in Jesus of Nazareth by Pope Benedict XVI. Meier discusses the fourth century doctrines of Mary’s perpetual virginity, but considers that the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus mentioned in the gospels are in fact blood brothers or sisters of Jesus – he refers to the typical use of the Greek word adelphos (brother or half brother) rather than other terms (e.g. Anepsios) in common use for relationships such as cousin or step brother – thus he rejects Jerome’s and other patristic interpretations of these relationships. The on line CCB version of Mark includes a note affirming the traditional doctrine and asserting that ‘adelphos’ may be extended to other relationships. I think I would prefer Meier’s scholarship on the matter ahead of the CCB editors. However another explanation, not apparently considered by Meier is possible. Adoption was much more common in the ancient world. High mortality rates meant that there were very many orphans. Under both Jewish and Roman Law, adoption gave precisely the same legal rights as birth, and in that case ‘adelphos’ would seem an appropriate term for adopted siblings. Mary and Joseph may well have had such a generous spirit. It is even conceivable that Jesus himself may have adopted one of his “brothers”, and perhaps this was the “Disciple whom Jesus loved”; such a relationship would have been a secret one for the lad’s own protection as natural heir to the “King of the Jews”.

The “brothers and sisters” of Jesus identified in Mark 6:3 might well have been “in utero” siblings, or they may have been adoptees as a concession only. Chasteness involves rather more than physical acts or biological physique, and is more properly attributed to an attitude in a person’s mind. That in no way compromises any other doctrine concerning the purity, and piety of the Mother of Jesus, nor need it compromise the awe and reverence that the faithful can approach her as intercessor.

In Mt 12:46, his mother and his brothers appear but are not specifically named. Luke is silent on the matter.

A possible and attractive inference is that this was the author of the gospel and there are a few clues that point to this, in that the author never otherwise identifies himself. As to the actual authorship of the gospel, there is some varied opinion. “Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown.” We need to ask ‘Is it likely that a Galilean fisherman, the son of Zebedee, would have the education and skill to write a Gospel of the quality and abstract thought that we find in John?’ The names of people in 1st century Palestine were limited in number, perhaps about 4.4% of the men were named John. As to Ephesus, excavated ruins there have been claimed as the home John shared with Mary, but that might just be fancy. There are other traditions. One contributor even identifies the author as John Mark, but this has little other general support. It cannot be ruled out that the disciple standing there was indeed a family member.

There are many reasons for this obscurity, dating from the times of the apostles with its Jewish tradition of what was or was not kosher, the many early persecutions of Christianity, the avaricious depredations of tyrants in confiscating church treasures, the need for concealment of things most precious, the history of iconoclasm, the initial reluctance to display Christian imagery, Byzantine superstition and its whole secretive approach towards liturgy in general, the concealment of Passion relics in the Emperor’s palace, Byzantine prudery when it came to displaying nudity, and so on. For example, there was uncertainty in displaying images of Christ for purposes of battle standards; a series of defeats determined that such displays were contrary to the divine will. The Shroud itself displays an abject defeated Christ, and is not the stuff to inspire confidence as a protective device in the defence of cities. Following 12 months of continuous earthquakes in Constantinople, the Image of Camulliana, the Image of God Incarnate, was kept concealed in a box for some hundreds of years, and was only opened towards the end of the first millenium. Nevertheless there are clues. They might be found in Galatians 3:1, the inscription of Abercius alluding to his being accompanied in his travels by an image of a “large fish”, the Edessan Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl, the discovery of the Image of Camuliana and its parading around Cappadocia, hinits in the Mozarabic rite, the references to images “not being made by human hands”, the development of epitaphioi displaying a Shroud like Christ, Western visitors’ reports of the burial cloths being held in Constantinople showing an image, the report of Robert de Clari, and various others. However the whole approach is one of secrecy, and there was often the underlying belief that such imagery was not for the public gaze. This seems only to have been relieved towards the end of the Byzantine era. This is what makes it so difficult to be specific about such evidence as there is. It is also obvious that there was often confusion and misunderstandings in the record, with many false trails.

There are problems with the hypothesis that Paul was travelling with the Shroud to assist his mission. Early traditions place the burial cloths in Peter’s possession, Paul had yet to earn the trust of the Jewish apostles, and so it would seem unlikely that they would release it to him. Paul’s first journey about 40 AD took him only as far as Iconium and ‘Antioch’ in Pisidia. Adrie vd Hoeven has postulated that the Shroud was originally John Mark’s temple garment, so it is possible that Mark had it in his possession. Mark was a kinsman of Barnabas and accompanied them only as far as Perga when he left them. Paul’s second journey 45 49 AD took him further north into Galatia. Barnabas had proposed taking Mark with them, but Paul refused in view of Mark’s earlier desertion. They quarreled, and Paul took Silas instead. If Paul had the Shroud on this journey, it could only have been allowed by Peter. Subsequently Paul and Mark were reconciled. As I said, there are problems. Nevertheless Galatians 3:1 (not pseudonymous, but written by Paul) may be thought highly suggestive, and a solution of what visual impact was given to the Galatians begs for an answer.

He seems to have picked up the idea from scientists at an Albuquerque pre STURP conference, some of whom had been involved in the nearby atomic bomb tests. Many will recall Wilson’s illustration of a permanent shadow of a pipe line hand valve left by the Hiroshima 1944 explosion. For radiation to be the primary cause of the image, it would seem necessary to have recourse to a miraculist explanation, which seems to be the road that Giulio Fanti and his associates seem to be pursuing. However a miraculist explanation ought only to be pursued when other explanations, particularly naturalistic explanations have been exhausted, and this is far from being the case. Quite simply, the experimental studies have not been pursued. No one can say what happens to a linen cloth fabricated to the ancient processes, containing a dead body for say 36 hours given inhibition with aloes and other spices, under the right environmental conditions. Ray Rogers succeeded in obtaining some coloration of Edgerton bleached linen treated with dextrin and saponaria on exposing it to ammonia. This is as far as experimental work has gone. It says nothing about image resolution of detail. Rogers believed that Maillard reaction was the primary cause, but also believed that it required something else. He was dismissive of radiation being involved, because of the superficiality of the image which could not be attained by radiation. Giovanna de Liso’s 12 years of experiments in the moderately seismic area of Piedmont has produced to my mind some of the most promising images so far. She claims that images only formed under certain combinations of specific conditions: earthquake, release of radon gas (common in earthquakes), simultaneous variations in the geo magnetic and electric fields, and in the presence of iron bearing rock. It is conceivable that radon gas may have an important bearing, perhaps on collimating the molecules forming the image. Perhaps this is why the image is orthogonal apparently aligned parallel to the gravitational field. Perhaps the time dependent instability of these molecules were a key factor in image intensity producing the 3 D effect. There remains considerable scope for further research before nauralistic explanations can be excluded. Notions of a body floating in space between two parallel horizontal layers of linen being spontaneously radiated by body emanations tend to bring serious Shroud research into disrepute, and is properly labelled by skeptics as pseudo science of the worst kind. Throw away the excimer lasers, and concentrate on some proper and credible scientific experimental research.

Rowe claims there is no discernible damage to tested artifacts, and supports this with a few visual samples of tests done. The Shroud conservationist team were concerned at the possible effects of oxidation on the image, and coupled with electric plasma discharges the method sounds somewhat hair raising. It is not clear to me whether the method would be effective on small samples which might be another option.

I suspect adherence has a lot less to do with doctrinal positions, than more human aspects such as a sense of community. I’ve known young people who migrate to the city, find that the old historic parishes lack this, nobody speaks, all living their own little lives, not like the early Christians at all, who seemed to understand these things so much better.

He suggests that the story of Lazarus’ raising from the dead was planted by the evangelist John in his gospel, for a specific purpose, seemingly with some possibly secret allusions to the Shroud. Whether his interpretation is correct or not, it carries some fascinating material.

All three have a striking resemblance to the Shroud image. There are various references to a full body image, the “Image of God Incarnate” around this time, so it was known to the Byzantines. By contrast, copies of the Mandylion only ever show a disembodied head, and the fatal flaw in Wilson’s theory is that the Mandylion’s supposed concealed image of the body was not known until after its arrival in Constantinople in 945. The Image of Camuliana was taken to Constantinople in 572 AD, and became the basis of military labara, and became known as the “Image of God Incarnate”. Some have attempted to identify it with the Veronica or the Veil of Manoppello, but I’ve never seen any convincing argument for this. Others have suggested it did not survive the iconoclasm periods. The most likely explanation, due to Markwardt is that it was hidden away following a series of continuous earthquakes in 740, after which the earthquakes ceased. The re enactments of Christ’s resurrection in the Pharos chapel are reported in 1201, and so it is evident that the covenant of concealment had then been broken under Alexios III.

There is rather more substance to Markwardt’s argument for Peter taking the Shroud to Antioch, than it merely being an “awesome icon”. One also needs to refer to his 1999 and 2008 (Ohio) papers as well. He refers there to written accounts which assert that the Shroud was given to Peter, he was the first bishop of Antioch and so that he took it Antioch seems a fair inference. His 2008 paper expands on this, and although various church treasures were allowed to be confiscated by Julian the Apostate, the icon was concealed to be rediscovered at a later time. In a similar way, when Antioch was besieged by Persian Chosroes, most of the church treasures were allowed to be pillaged, but Ephraim its warrior bishop set out on a special mission to Anatolia and was allowed to be reinstalled on his return, so his abandonment of the city was not seen as an act of cowardice. Soon afterwards, the Image of Camuliana was discovered and paraded around Anatolia by Byzantine priests and then taken to Constantinople. It is the very first image which was attributed to be “acheropoeitos”, not made by human hands. It became the template for military labara, and subsequently there are references to a full body image by various emperors and others in Constantinople well prior to the arrival of the Mandylion there in 945. It is a reasonable inference that this was the icon that Ephraim had taken to Anatolia, but dying before he could retrieve it. Contrariwise the only argument that Peter may have taken the Shroud to Rome, or that it subsequently found its way to France during the first millenium, are the third century Shroud like images in the catacombs, which might merely indicate some known acquaintance with its likeness, and flagellation scenes such as in the Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter. There is no dovcumentary evidence, not even a myth or a legend concerning a mysterious image in Rome or elsewhere, except the later Veronica images of a Byzantine provenance. There is rather more to the story of Ms Hood than appears at first sight. It is known that wolves roamed the Black Forest in medieval times, that they sometimes ate grandmothers and little girls, and that various woodsmen there might sometimes rescue them. As for “talking wolves” certain Pharisees were once described as “wolves in sheep’s clothing” could clearly talk, and some of them no doubt indulged in cross dressing. The story is a factual archetype, and if Markwardt’s paper is to be likened to a fairy story, then a better tale is needed for an analogy.

His chief writing, The Dialogue of Destiny, or The Book of the Laws of the Countries, recorded by a disciple, Philip, is the oldest known original composition in Syriac literature. Bardesanes attacked the fatalism of the Greek philosophers after Aristotle (4th century BC), particularly regarding the influence of the stars on human destiny. Mingling Christian influence with Gnostic teaching, he denied the creation of the world, of Satan, and of evil by the supreme God, attributing them to a hierarchy of deities. Aided by his son Harmonius, Bardesanes wrote many of the first Syriac hymns to popularize his teachings. Their literary value earned for him renown in the history of Syriac poetry and music. Of the “Hymn of the Pearl” Markwardt writes: “Bardaisan (154 222), a Gnostic Christian, a philosopher, and the composer of numerous Syriac psalms, was born of nobility at Edessa. According to tradition, he attended school, as a youth, with the future Abgar the Great,and Segal concludes that ―certainly he frequented the court of Edessa. As the king’s life long friend and a frequent visitor to his royal court, Bardaisan would certainly have viewed the Portrait of Edessa, perhaps when it was first presented to Abgar, and certainly after it had been placed in one of the royal palaces, and he is, no doubt, the source of the several obvious metaphorical allusions to the Shroud which appear in the Hymn of the Pearl.” However, the idea that some Gnostic artisan was able to create the Shroud image by some unknown means is utterly speculative and can have no supporting argument except speculation. There is only one case of a crucifixion victim being crowned with thorns, the random act of a Roman soldier with a perverse sense of humour. For any such Gnostic artisan to create the image from a crucifixion victim he would have to find another who had been so crowned. The image itself contributes nothing to Gnostic argument, but on the contrary reinforces orthodox Christian belief. If the “Hymn of the Pearl” is intended to refer to the Shroud image, it is remarkable that one such as Bardesan was able to put it to such good purpose..","date":"2014-02-09","mins":"6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/08/russ-breault-and-pastor-caspar-mccloud-discuss-the-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"Russ Breault and Pastor Caspar McCloud Discuss the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-77832","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I am not at all curious, Kelly.

Thurston was a well known Jesuit Shroud skeptic. It seems that both Thurston & Chevalier sought to follow a German trend in biblical studies, emphasising the mythic elements in the scriptures. However Secondo Pia’s photographic negatives, and Vignon’s & Delage’s forensic analysis tended to corroborate the literal truth of the Passion story. The two worthy Churchmen therefore sought to discredit the authenticity of the Shroud by massaging the significance of the D’Arcis memorandum. It will be recalled that Pope St Pius X wrote agains the Modernist trend, which seemed to be manifest in the Thurston / Chevalier agenda.

Perhaps the one thing they had in common was the claim to posession of a “Secret Knowledge” (Gnosis). Up until about 1945 with the discovery of the Nag Hammadi scrolls, practically all that was known of the gnostics was seond hand from their enemies the early orthodox Church Fathers. The publication of Elaine Pagels’ book “The Gnostic Gospels”, based on the Nag Hammadi texts extended the general understanding of gnosticism, although few scholars accept Pagels’ interpretation of these texts. The only possible Gnostic reference to the Shroud image is that contained in the “Hymn of the Pearl” generally attributed to Bardaisan (154 222), a “Christian Gnostic”, the author of several Syriac hymns in Edessa, a contemporary and confidant of Abgar VIII the Great, the probable instigator of the Doctrine of Addai. At the conclusion of the Hymn of the Pearl, the Prince protagonist, who seems to be a Christ figure, sees his robe in a new light: “On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness. And the image of the King of kings Was depicted in full all over it…” Some writers see in these verses the image of the Shroud. It would seem to indicate that Bardaisan may have been privy to viewing the full body mage of the Shroud at the court of Edessa. This is as close as one can get to any gnostic involvement in creating the Shroud image. However that it was a gnostic creation is a long stretch from Bardaisan’s merely viewing of the image!.","date":"2014-02-10","mins":"3:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/08/russ-breault-and-pastor-caspar-mccloud-discuss-the-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"Russ Breault and Pastor Caspar McCloud Discuss the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-200178","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My summary notes on Dr Acetta’s personal experiment, where he injected a radio active chemical into his own veins: “Dr Accetta’s experiment to explain the image formation on the Shroud: Dr August Accetta is an American radiologist, and founder of the Shroud Center of Southern California, 8840 Warner Ave, Suite 200, Fountain Valley CA 92708, USA http://www.shroudcentersocal.com” “Dr Accetta injected into his own veins a solution of methylene diphosphate, containing radioactive technetium 99m, a radioisotope with a short half life.

The lack of such records is therefore an inadequate argument to assert there was no such relic cult. It is plain enough that Helena did in fact pursue her pilgrimage to Jerusalem, regardless of the timing of the earliest records of her journey. She clearly saw value in retrieving these relics. It would make little sense to pursue such logistics if it were unlikely to result in a popular response from the imperial subjects. The Reformation iconoclastic rejection of relics can be seen as a reaction against the excesses and commercial exploitation of relics by a financially strapped medieval church.

Henry VIII’s Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More misrepresented Richard III as a monster, that in fact he was not, to shore up the questionable authority of the Tudor House, so that it became the received wisdom as portrayed in the Bard’s play, but More himself had good cause to relent this error in the course of time, himself becoming a martyr under the Tudor monarch’s ambitions.

Certainly in the first few centuries of the church, the catacombs give witness to the practice of the eucharist being celebrated there. The current use of saints’ and martyrs’ relics being included in church altar stones can be traced to this tradition. We have recently discussed the presence of very early icons being discovered in the catacombs. I should think that the mind set which places value on relics very likely finds its origins in burial rites which go back as far as prehistoric times and can be found in most ancient civilisations. To some extent it finds expression in the various forms of ancestor veneration, and the respect shown to the remains of the dead. In its mildest form, the earthly remains become a sign of the value of the person’s earthly life, respect is to be shown to them, and where there is a belief in an after life they connect us with their spirit. If Charles had ever spent any time at all in the Pacific area, he would only be too well aware of the sacredness that Polynesian and Maori peoples place on their burial grounds and the human remains of ancestors, which go well beyond any Eurocentric concepts or ideas. He may not consider this to be relevant. On the contrary, it is a very natural and human practice indeed, and it reflects deep seated values in the human psyche, which are more universal than one might admit. What was it that drove Saint Helena on her mission of retrieving early Christian relics from Jerusalem? At the very least she realised how the value of such relics would add to the prestige of imperial authority, because of the natural human awe placed on such tangible objects. There may be elements of ‘contagious magic’ associated with the cult of relics, but there are also honest motives of true piety as well..","date":"2014-09-07","mins":"6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/11/the-top-ten-relics-of-christ/","cat":"video","title":"The Top Ten Relics of Christ?"},{"id":"comment-209060","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Extract from Liturgy of the Word, 22nd Sun in Ordinary Time, Year B, set for this Sun, 30 Aug, 2015: “Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows* in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained by the world.” James 1:27 In light of the above thread of polemic, it seems particularly apt!

For each experiment, the groups were split in half, all were aged 18 21, university students (presumably all from the same university, and possibly therefore of a particular local culture), about two thirds female, one third male. They were all shown an A4 size photograph of a piece of ordinary modern linen and told that it may have words on it. Those who were informed that it was a photo of a religious artifact reported on average 1.7 (24 group) or 2.3 (80 group) words with religious significance, with an SD of about 0.7, while those in the control group reported much fewer words but all of no religious significance. A few issues readily come to mind. How representative is such a group from such a narrow age range; what university faculties were represented or were they all psychology students; would a preponderance of female observers result in a greater tendency to see pareidolia; is there a localised religious bias, i.e. Were they Southern baptists, or from Yale or Harvard; etc.? There might also be a scaling factor, an A4 photograph is much smaller than a 4m x 1m linen cloth. From the report it would seem that the average observer in the religious context might see perhaps two religious words, more or less. If many more words were reported by several observers, would that mean that the words are in fact very likely present, rather than not, and would a larger artifact need to be adjusted for scale? In any real experiment, the objective must needs be limited. From this experiment it may be concluded that there is a psychological susceptibility to a suggestion that religious words may be present when they are not, but it cannot inform when words are in fact faintly present..","date":"2015-11-11","mins":"6:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/11/psychological-influences-in-seeing-inscriptions-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Psychological Influences in Seeing Inscriptions on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-192236","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"And I say you cannot prove it, regardless!
