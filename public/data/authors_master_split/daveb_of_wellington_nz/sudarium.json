A computer simulation overlay/morph as she suggests can’t be all that too difficult to set up and it would be a fascinating exercise to see the results. Her scientific conservatism in referring to such tests as “exclusion type” is understandable from her disclipined approach, but the correspondence found is at least peruasive if not corroborative for the ordinary layperson. Worldwide, the occurrence of blood type AB is 5.1%, about 3% in Europe, and about 8% in the Middle East. The random probability that two blood stained cloths would both be AB, is about 0.25%, giving quite a high likelihood that the two cloths are indeed associated. A concurrence in mitochondrial DNA, if it could be so shown, would tend in lay persons terms to be absolutely conclusive.","date":"2012-08-02","mins":"8:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/02/how-good-is-the-match-up-between-the-sudarium-and-the-shroud/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"How good is the match up between the Sudarium and the Shroud?"},{"id":"comment-14570","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Check a copy of an article by Jim Dunning originally published in “Ireland’s Magazine”, and can be viewed on a website devoted to “Mystics of the Church”.

His actual words in his contribution to the First International Congress on the Sudarium of Oviedo were : ‘The result is not easy to interpret due to the well known difficulties of dating textiles and to the conditions under which the sample was kept when it was taken in 1979 until it came to us in 1983.’ A supporting statement from the Conference reads : ‘Textiles left alone in normal atmospheric conditions are prone to becoming highly contaminated…. The Carbon dating should be nothing more than a stimulus to more precise investigation under better conditions.’ ” “Since then more precise investigations have taken place. In particular, scientific comparisons have been made of the bloodstains on the Sudarium with those on the Shroud of Turin. Tests have shown that the man whose face the Sudarium covered, like the man of the Shroud, had a beard, moustache and long hair tied up at the nape of his neck into a pigtail. Since there were no signs of breathing he must already have been dead. The stains show a series of wounds produced in life by some sharp objects, such as thorns.” There also references to pollen samples, history of the Sudarium, and comments on matching with Shroud, blood type etc. Etc. ..","date":"2012-08-07","mins":"8:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/02/how-good-is-the-match-up-between-the-sudarium-and-the-shroud/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"How good is the match up between the Sudarium and the Shroud?"},{"id":"comment-31922","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Gerard: There is a reasonably good article on comparisons between the Shroud & Oviedo cloth on a “Mystics of the Church” web site by Jim Dunning; “THE SUDARIUM OF OVIEDO AND THE SHROUD OF TURIN”, by: Jim Dunning; Article was originally published in “Irelands Own” magazine.

It is at least definitely arguable. And it all depends on who is right, Zugibe or Barbet. And it also depends on how the crucifixion was carried out. There is not necessarily a majority of Shroudie medical experts who concur with Zugibe. What did Zugibe do to prove his hypothesis? He fundamentally had a volunteer step up to a cross; he bound his feet to the upright; and the volunteer had his hands strapped into gauntlets fastened to the crosspiece. Let’s not kid ourselves that this represents a real crucifixion. Did the crucificerius carry the full cross, or only the cross piece? Barbet argues that he only carried the cross piece (patibulum) and that the upright (stipes) was already in place. Others have asserted that he carried the full cross and after the nailing, the cross was raised and dropped into a ready made hole and stabilised maybe with a few rocks. Now if it was just the cross piece, then after the hands(wrists) had been nailed, it would be the work of not more than five men to lift the cross piece onto the upright. During this raising process, the full weight of the body is taken by the arms, and that would have required wrist nailing. Once the cross piece is in place, and at this point there is a tension of 207 lbs on each arm, (very difficult to breathe), then the feet are nailed to the upright. This is not like stepping up to a footrest! If he carried the full cross, then he is nailed to the cross with it lying on the ground. The cross then has to be raised into position. This is a fairly tricky process, but it might be done by placing the base of the upright near the hole and anchoring it. Executioners then have to raise the cross, probably using ropes which have to be fastened near the top of the cross without slipping; when it is upright, they have to get it to drop into the hole, and then stabilise it. This is altogether a more complicated way of doing the job, and I therefore tend to favour Barbet’s scenario of cross piece only. The gospel accounts claim that Jesus died within a few hours, and Pilate was surprised at his rapid death. Asphyxiation seems more likely. The Shroud image shows a distended chest, which is one reason why Barbet favoured asphyxiation as the cause of death. You see indeed it is quite credible!.","date":"2015-12-01","mins":"12:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"id":"comment-215839","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, from what you have written above, it seems that you may be of the view that the Mandylion and the Shroud were the same object. Are you able to provide any references that the Image of Camuliana was no more than a facial image, as I have been unable to discover any such evidence, although I think it may be Fr Heinrich Pfeiffer’s assertion. I do not know the reasons for this viewpoint. Otherwise I believe the Camuliana may be a better candidate for the Shroud, and became known in Constantinople as the Image of God Incarnate..","date":"2015-12-07","mins":"6:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"id":"comment-215407","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Jim, if the victim’s merely standing, then you need to come up with a better explanation than Zugibe’s mere shock and trauma as the cause for the rapid death. See Barbet, “Doctor at Calvary”, he devotes a whole chapter to it, Ch 3, ‘The Cause of the Rapid Death’. He also carried out far more experiments of various kinds than Fred Zugibe ever did. To achieve this, there can be no seat (sedile) nor foot rest. You have a nail through the foot at the base of the second inter meta tarsal space, and it can only support your weight by pressing against the Lisfranc space line separating the tarsal bones from the meta tarsals. That’s painful, so you transfer your weight back onto the arms. With your arms at 65 degrees to the vertical, that results in 207 lb tension in each arm. That’s not only painful but exhausting. So you transfer your weight back on to your feet. Etc, etc. The distended chest of the shroud image gives it away as cause of death by asphyxiation. Pilate was amazed at the rapid death. What do you think it was if not asphyxiation? But first, check out Barbet’s chapter 3 !.","date":"2015-12-01","mins":"2:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"}]
