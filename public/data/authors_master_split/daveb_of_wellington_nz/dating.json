I’m not sure what is to be gained by retracing the steps. Dan refers to the Marino Benford paper of 2005. It can be found at the shroud com site under benfordmarino. A more recent paper is even more telling. “Chronological History of the Evidence for the Anomalous Nature of the C 14 Sample Area of the Shroud of Turin” by Joseph G. Marino and Edwin J. Prior, 2008. It lists and discusses some 45 points of evidence over some 27 pages plus an Appendix. It can be found at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/chronology.pdf It includes a few web references to houses which specialise in invisible mending of the type. I recall one such is http://www.withoutatrace.com located in Chicago. Their web site describes their skills and craft. Up until about 1842, the usual method of displaying the Shroud was for it to be suspended hand held by five bishops. There are many contemporary illustrations of this method, clearly most deleterious to the cloth. Only subsequent showings from 1868 had it static in a frame. Although much of the comment postulates a 16th century reweave, it is quite possible that it was actually done as late as 1868 when Princess Clotilde replaced the backing silk lining. That would certainly skew the C14 tests. Thiebalt Heimburger has written extensively on the absence of cotton contamination elsewhere. I have recently seen photographs of the STURP team closely examining the Shroud all over in microscopic detail. They are all insistent that the Raes sample is the only location where there is cotton contamination. It all comes down to the poverty of scientific thought in electing to take non representative samples, for such an important crucial test. This is quite irrespective of the farcical way in which such decision was made.

Following graduation I followed it up with several supplementary papers in the topic during the following 20 or so years. My first formal text was by Paul G Hoel, Professor of Mathematics, University of California in L.A. Published in 1962, It was an excellent work, and despite other subsequent texts I often had cause to refer back to it, and occasionally still do. Towards the end of my career for some ten years during the 1990s I was advising the Internal Audit of a major NZ Corporate on the design of their sampling systems for audit purposes. I believe a scientist seeks to obtain an absolute rigorous truth, which in theory is actually unattainable. He has to be satisfied with building a theory which is as close to the truth as the evidence will take him at that particular time. But he knows that ultimately it will be surpassed as new knowledge comes to hand. The history of scientific progress adequately demonstrates that. In engineering, the engineer is expected to deliver within an acceptable time frame, he has little time available to him for research, and he has to be content with an acceptable economic solution that his knowledge can take him at that particular time. In our Law courts the attempt to arrive at the truth is one notch lower than that of the scientist, and persons are condemned or liberated on the balance of reasonable probabilities, and a weight of circumstantial evidence may be sufficient. In Audit, the quest is one notch lower again, and the auditor is content to give his assurance on such evidence as he may judge is sufficient according to the various tests he can economically apply. Hoel discusses the question of the validity of sampling tests at length as early as Chapter 3 ‘Nature of Statistical Methods’. “A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about the frequency function of a random variable.” “A test of a statistical hypothesis is a procedure for deciding whether to accept or reject the hypothesis.” He then distinguishes between two types of error. The Type I Error occurs when the hypothesis is actually true, but the sample falls into the critical area when the hypothesis is therefore falsely rejected. The Type II Error occurs when the hypothesis is actually false but the sample falls within the true area, and so the hypothesis is falsely accepted. Sampling therefore does not yield an absolute truth, but only a relative truth, it is no more than one particular method for making a decision. It is an underlying assumption of course that the samples will also pass standard tests for being adequately representative, and there must be a sufficient number of samples which adequately demonstrate the amount of dispersion. In the case of the 1988 C 14 samples on the Shroud, there was in fact only one small sample taken, and there have been several valid questions raised that it was not in fact truly representative of the whole. This single sample was split three ways, and the individual laboratories split their shares of the sample again so they could each run three individual tests on their share. The control pieces have been criticised as inadequate, and of a different type from the sample and not comparable to the parent cloth. Their results have been reported as apparently failing even a standard chi square test. Even so, it might be asserted that the tests could be a valid result as far as the original sample was concerned. However it cannot be asserted that the tests have been sufficiently rigorous to make any definitive statement about the age of the original cloth. It is certainly not an absolute truth, it hardly passes as any kind of relative truth, I would not pass it even as an adequate audit test, and scientists ought not to hang on to it as passing any kind of worthwhile authentic scientific test!.","date":"2014-10-04","mins":"4:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/04/an-abstract-for-today/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Abstract for Today"},{"id":"comment-33268","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The idea that the the 1988 C 14 project would serve only as a “ranging shot” won’t wash.

A) The apostles were Jews, and had a tradition against any kind of image representation, particularly in light of the first commandment forbidding “graven images”, so they might have felt compromised by it; b) the images might not have yet formed but possibly could have taken some years to become visible (see ref to Volckringer patterns below) so they did not see it at the time; c) if the images had formed, they may have decided to keep it secret for any number of reasons, protection of the cloths from Roman and Jewish authorities, or because it seemed a departure from their Jewish tradition. However consider the following gospel texts: John 20:5 10: “5 He (John?) bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in. 6 When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths* there, 7 and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place. 8 Then the other disciple (John?) also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed. 9* For they did not yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead.” What did he see that made him believe? Was it just the empty tomb? Was it just the burial cloths set aside? Or did he see the image? We do not know! John 20:11 12: “11 But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb 12 and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.” Did Mary see two angels, “one at the head and one at the foot where the body of Jesus had been” Or did she interpret the sight of the image as angels?

Do parallel universes exist, or multi verses? We do not know and we may never know. It is fair to speculate providing we are logically consistent and can agree about semantics. I might speculate for example that this universe in which we exist is actually a subset of a higher universe. A goldfish might imagine that his bowl is the entire universe, but we might place him in some other aquarium. For him, he has moved to a different universe. An ant on a table may imagine that the universe has only two dimensions, but we say there are actually four which are commonly known, although some would have it there are actually ten or twelve but the others are curled up. At the Resurrection, the body of Jesus was transformed in a way that we do not understand, except the bounds of our known universe were no longer any constraint for him. After some forty days of popping in and out of his friends presence to say goodbye, he returned to his Father. To talk of the emission of neutrons, and other atomic particles, is trite. These are bounded by this world, in a way in which the resurrected body of Jesus was not. For Him, this world of ours was merely a subset of a higher universe, and maybe that’s the real secret of the Shroud image. But of course, that’s only my speculation, and neither I nor anyone else can demonstrate it by any experiment!

Clearly the emphasis has been given to presentation time only, which raises a concern that issues raised by the more contentious papers will not be given the airing needed to explore and argue pros and cons, or how solid is the evidence presented, or to challenge assertions made which some may feel are needed. The example that Dan gives above would only be one such perhaps of many others that need to be challenged and argued before the informed forum of those attending. It would seem that presenters will have their way and air their ideas, but will depart without being given the benefit or opportunity of full discussion, which might lead them to improve or refine their ideas, or for that matter adopt an entirely different approach, or even backtrack.

Doubtless the more contentious items will be discussed during the various social get togethers, and participants may come to their own conclusions.

He claimed that nail passed through Destot’s space and severed median nerve resulting in reflex retraction of thumb into palm. His calculation of 207lb arm tension would result in tearing of the palm, but could be supported by wrist nailing. His experiments with amputated limbs seemed to support his assertion. Consequently there has been a tendency to accept his conclusion. 2) The only mention in the scriptures of Jesus being nailed to the cross, rather than bound by ropes, is in John 20:25. Barbet asserts that nailing was the usual Roman practice in Palestine. Author of John’s gospel uses the Greek word ‘cheira’. Apparently this word can mean hand, wrist, or forearm. Jerome’s Latin Vulgate translates it as ‘manus’, hand. The Latin for wrist is ‘carpus’. As the Latin Vulgate was the primary authority, generations of artists showed the nails as passing through the palms of the hands. The Greek word ‘cheira’ also occurs in Luke’s Acts of the Apostles at Acts 12:7, describing Peter’s release from prison. Again, Jerome tranlates it as “manus” rather than “carpus”. Consequently, most of the English translations have “and the chains fell from his hands”. A moment’s thought will realise that “the chains actually fell from his wrists”. More recent translations including USCCB translation use the word “wrists” for Acts’ ‘cheira’. 3) Frederick Zugibe was highly critical of Barbet’s conclusions. He maintains that Barbet was confused about the location of both Destot’s space and median nerve, notwithstanding Barbet’s thumb retraction experiments. FZ considered that the thumb being hidden on the TS was merely because the natural relaxed position of the thumb in death or asleep is in the palm. He suggests an alternative path for the nail from the base of the palm with exit on the wrist as shown on TS. He illustrates an instance of this with a needle showing the path of a blade through the hand of an actual stabbing victim. The paper also includes several other interesting illustrations, including his crucifixion experiments. His crucifxion experiments involving foot support, ressulted in arm tensions of only about 65lb compared to 207lb when freely suspended by arms alone. This tension could be sustained by the path he proposes. “PIERRE BARBET REVISITED” BY Frederick T.

Barbet was successful at easily driving nails through amputated wrists, whether it was through the Destot space or elsewhere.

It is a fact that cellulose degrades over time, there’s no doubt about that. He has results from known samples that show how under certain passive conditions of storage, what an average rate of degradation might be expected. However the degradation rate can also be affected by other extraneous factors such as frequent handling, a kind of ‘fatigue’ action that needs to be added to the passive rate of degradation. It should be a simple matter to discover the rate how such samples might degrade by say repeated foldings. Fatigue tests are routinely carried out in much of materials testing, particularly in engineering metals. [Fatigue rates can also be affected by stress concentrators such as recessed corners] Fanti has the engineering labs at Padova to arrange for any of his students to set up such tests himself. I think it significant that what determinations he has made place the age of the Shroud much older than the C 14 tests showed, and I would suspect that any such fatigue effects cannot sufficiently account for this difference.

It is made opaque by a glazed or unglazed finish, called the Holland finish, consisting of oil and a filling material. However originally it was applied to any fine plain woven linen imported from Europe, particularly the Netherlands. Was the Holland backing cloth sewn by the Poor Clare nuns, bleached or not? I don’t know. I was surprised to discover that the spinning wheel was a relatively late invention. The earliest clear illustrations come from Baghdad in 1237, and quickly found its way to India, although India is sometimes credited with the invention. The first spinning wheels were operated by hand, and although known in Europe by the 14th century did not come into immediate general use. By this time, the Chinese were using water power to drive their spinning wheels, but this was not developed in Europe until the 18th century. A citizen of Brunswick is said to have added the treadle in 1533, and its more general European use might well date from this improvement. Prior to the adoption of the spinning wheel, yarn was hand spun, by whirling a distaff holding the fibres onto a free hanging weighted spindle. However in France, the distaff and spindle were not displaced until the 18th century. Adoption of the spinning wheel meant that five spinners could keep a weaver fully occupied. In the early Middle Ages, the main European textile centres producing linen fabrics seemed to have been in Flanders, notably Ghent, Ypres and Courtrai. Sicily and Palermo seemed to have specialised in silk around 1130. Textile specialists seemed to have been quite migratory, as a result of foreign invasions, or the later religious wars and persecutions. English textiles in the 13th and 14th centuries were mainly linen and wool, the trade being influenced by Flemish fullers and dyers. In 1564 Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter for Dutch and Flemish settlers in Norwich, for production of damasks and flowered silks. Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 caused many weavers to migrate to England. How might all this bear on the question of banding, and the bleaching of linen? I think it almost certain that the Flemish fullers were bleaching completed cloth, rather than just the unwoven yarn. They would require large areas of reasonably level open fields to carry this out, where the cloth to be bleached must be spread out for several months. Flanders and the Netherlands would have met this requirement. So very likely this was the method by no later than the 13th century. The earlier slower spinning methods of distaff and spindle, might have been conducive to a production process where the unwoven yarn was bleached before weaving. The spinning wheel in the 16th century would have set the closure on any remnants of this process, if it still then persisted. Was bleaching of unwoven yarn terminated much earlier, say in the 4th and 5th century as some have asserted? The only way of answering this question I think, is to look for the latest and most recent examples of banded linen cloth. Someone must know of any such examples, which would settle this question, once and for all..","date":"2013-12-17","mins":"6:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/16/bleaching-and-banding-my-guess-is-that-rogers-is-right/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Bleaching and Banding:  My guess is that Rogers is right"},{"id":"comment-78609","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"So the Daily Telegraph hacks get a story and write it up with all the usual cliches, journalese, and inaccuracies that paparazzi the world over are renown for. But it’s worthwhile checking out the PDF paper in Meccanica. The paper itself contains a fair amount of speculation and reliance on dubious records of earthquakes around 33 AD. Difficult to guess how they assessed the crucifixion/resurrection earthquakes to within one decimal place of 8.2! The one interesting fact(?) to come out of the paper is that large earthquakes may apparently generate neutron emission from crushed rock, and they cite some experimental evidence for this. It is possible that this may have been a factor in creating the image, if indeed the neutron emission actually occurred. However as for it skewing the C 14 dating of 1988, Christopher Ramsey’s comment is most relevant. To paraphrase, “Why in this case only, and in no other?” It would seem that the Torino School of Engineering is still adhering to the myth of the validity of the 1988 dating. I would suggest that they might consult with their colleagues in the Statistical Maths department there, and get a handle on how representative the sampling regime for these specimens may or, more likely, may not have been! I note that at the very end of the paper, Giovanna De Liso’s paper happens to be cited. Her work represents some 12 years of experimental field study in the seismically active area of Piedmont. She mentions there the stringent conditions required for the production of Shroud like images during earthquakes. They required aloe inhibition, concurrent variations in the geo magnetic and electric fields, presence of iron bearing geology, and the release of radon gas (common during earthquakes). One problem would seem to be that the decay of Radon releases not so many neutrons, as it does gamma radiation, an entirely different matter. While one may applaud the various attempts to discover the secret of the imaging process, it seems to me that an unduly large amount of research effort is being expended at this institute in pursuit of an agenda driven presumption, that the image was the result of some kind of radiation emanation, while other possible, even more probable causes seem not to be pursued at all..","date":"2014-02-12","mins":"6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating"},{"id":"comment-78785","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I am presently unaware of Sir Colin Humphrey’s work, and so am unaware of what astronomical events he may refer to in his derivation of a death date of AD33. The only astronomy event I can recall in the gospels is the Star of Bethlehem in Matthew, which might have been any one of a number of such events, or it may only be a literary device. John’s gospel records that the Friday of the crucifixion occurred on Preparation Day, the day before Passover. This could only have occurred in the years AD30 & AD33, and so would exclude AD29. John P Meier in his “A Marginal Jew” opts for AD30. He bases this on the sequence that: Jesus was born towards the closing years of Herod the Great, 7 4 BC; John the Baptiser began his ministry AD27 28; Soon after Jesus began his ministry, “then aged about 30”; Jesus’ ministry lasted no more than about two years and a few months. Consequently Meier opts for the year AD30, as AD33 would have him closer to age 40. “Pilate quickly condemned him to death by crucifixion. After being scourged and mocked, Jesus was crucified outside Jerusalem on the same day. He was dead by the evening of Friday, April 7, 30. He was about thirty six years old.” The authors of the Meccanica paper refer to major Middle East earthquakes, said to have occurred in year AD33. They might have cast their net a little further, but are silent on any seismic events in year AD30. Possibly they are drawing on a hearsay tradition that he died at about age 33, and so derived the AD33 date. Perhaps they should have researched the death date a little more. I take Hugh F’s point about the geological distinctions between sedimentary and igneous rocks, which may be relevant. De Liso’s Piedmont site refers to the presence of gneiss, a metamorphic rock, whereas the Jerusalem site is essentially sedimentary aragonite limestone. I am unaware of the possible presence of iron bearing strata at the Jerusalem site, which seems to bear most significantly on her findings. Despite correspondents’ reluctance to admit radiation as the primary cause of the TS image, the seismic events of the gospel narratives may yet prove to have been a significant factor. It is known that Ray Rogers was not entirely happy about Maillard reaction being the exclusive cause, and felt that there had to be something else as well. The release of radon commonly occurring during earthquakes may have been an essential factor and been that “something else”. The crucifixion / resurrection earthquakes are mentioned in all four gospels, and cannot be easily dismissed as a literary add on.

On all sides stances were taken and angry messages exchanged. Even I found myself an intermediary in the cross fire. When the dust began to settle, it was Turin who had won. On 10 October 1987 Cardinal Ballestrero calmly faxed all interested parties that the seven laboratories had been reduced to three, chosen on the basis of their experience in the field of archaeological radiocarbon dating. The three were Oxford, Zurich, and Tucson (Arizona) – all of them AMS laboratories. The stipulated ‘experience’ criteria was the very reverse of the truth, the rejected Harwell alone having vastly more experience than all three of the chosen ones put together.” “Although whatever went on behind the scenes remains far from clear, Gonella had got his way, and at daybreak on 21 April 1988 representatives of the three chosen laboratories duly assembled at Turin Cathedral old sacristy … … While the scientists watched from the pews, the Shroud was solemnly brought into the room and unrolled before them.” “Incredibly, it was only at this point that Gonella and his close friend Giovanni Riggi proceeded at length to deliberate on the best location from which to take the sample that was to be apportioned between the three laboratories. Some have claimed that the debate between the two scientists took two hours. … … etc” There seems to be a total mismatch between the objective observations of an experienced recognised authority, Ian Wilson, and the current defensive recollections of events by Professor Gonella. A fascinating study in subjective perceptions of events versus their actual reality!

Isaiah chapters 50 & 52 were likely composed about 538 BC by a school of prophets in Babylon following the tradition of this prophet during the exile. As such they cannot be New Testament history but the verses are part of an oracle. As such they require a particular understanding and careful interpretation. They are commonly included in the Good Friday liturgy readings because of their aptness to the sufferings of Christ. But what were the prophet’s intentions in describing the tribulations of his “suffering servant”? It may have been in the hoped for rise of a prophetic figure that would release the people from their exile and enable them to return to their home land. Many scholars now hold that the suffering servant is Israel in a collective sense. Christians see them as a prophecy of the sufferings of Christ. However to read them as a specific detailed historical literal description of the visage of Jesus of Nazareth some half a millenium after they were written is a step too far. In the case of the apostle Thomas needing to see the nail holes and the wound in the side, the explanation is more simple. He was not present when Jesus appeared to the others, and it as an expression of his incredulity that Jesus had risen and appeared to them. When Jesus does appear to them again when Thomas is present, Thomas acknowledges him immediately. Bernard says he is convinced that the Shroud is not related to Jesus because of what the scriptures say. In fact the image on the Shroud reflects the gospel accounts of Christ’s passion quite accurately, and they go further by being more forensically accurate than could be known to any medical science at the time of its discovery in medieval times.

Part of the difficulty with C14 dating of the fragment is that the fragment is so small, that the sample taken was likely inadequate for any kind of valid test. A forger can easily obtain ancient papyrus on the black market, so although dating of the papyrus is a necessary indicator it is not a sufficient test. It is however apparently more difficult to forge the ink, and it seems that the ink has passed the necessary tests which were a critical aspect of proof. It has been asserted that parts of the text are a direct uplift from the Gospel of Thomas, and if true then this would be a valid cause for suspicion. If ever proven to be truly authentic, I see no problems with the content of the text. A variety of interpretations are possible. Vatican experts have made the point that it may be merely an allusion to the Church as the Bride of Christ. I would suspect however that all it means was that some Gnostic group were likely debating whether marriage in general was an acceptable state for their followers, where celibacy had previously been a strict rule. The debate is also indicated in Paul’s epistles, which merely show his preference for celibacy. One way the group might have sought to resolve the issue might have been to assert that Christ himself was married. The absence of any kind of tradition or canonical scripture concerning a wife, persuades most exegegtes that he was not.

He discovered traces of cotton in Piece 1, “gossypium herbaceum”, Middle East origin; absent in Piece 2; An interim deduction was that the cotton was loom contamination and that therefore the cloth was of Middle East provenance. Subsequently in 1978, the STURP team failed to find cotton elswhere within the cloth, apart from minor surface detritus. The conclusion therefore had to be revised that the area around Piece 1 was somehow unique. This is the area from where the C14 samples were taken. Charles: “Are you suggesting that these elusive invisible weavers were actually able to reproduce banding so perfectly that the STURP photographs did not show the reweave?” Yes!! Firstly these “invisible weavers” are hardly elusive. One of the modern practioners consulted by Benford & Marino are identified as Mr. Michael Ehrlich of ‘Without A Trace, Inc.’ in Chicago. Its website (www.withoutatrace.com) may be consulted to discover the type of work they do. I recall that B&M also consulted others similarly engaged. In their 2005 paper “New Historical Evidence Explaining the “Invisible Patch” in the 1988 C 14 Sample Area of the Turin Shroud;” http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino.pdf , they provide a review of the history of weaving in Europe. They make a case for Savoy dowager duchess Margaret of Austria as carrying out the repairs. In her time 1520 60 there were some 30 to 40 master weavers prominently known throughout France, most quite capable in the skills of French reweaving. Others have suggested that the work may have been commissioned by Princess Clotilde following the 1868 exposition. Clotilde would have had access to such resources. Flury Lemburg was apparently unaware of the art, notwithstanding her knowledge of ancient textiles. She clearly believed that such mending would have been apparent on the under side, whereas the practice of “invisible reweavers” was to make the mending invisible on both sides. CSB: “So typical of this site. When you have nothing useful to say, try putting someone else on the spot with a question.” Louis’ question I believe was intended to be rhetorical. It is evident that few of the final protocols were followed.

I believe the solvents attempted were: acetic acid, oxygenated water, glycerin of potassium. However the granules could not be dissolved, so that their attempts were unsuccessful. John Jackson had reported this to John Heller at some later date when he was recruiting him for the STURP project. At that time Heller’s Institute staff had been working with blood porphyrins and had learned how to make them fluoresce. The fact that attempts to dissolve blood stain samples had failed seems to have been the determining factor to resort to “microphotospectrometry”. I should like to know if the tests that you propose require the samples to be dissolved, and if so can a suitable solvent not used by Frache & Filogamo be identified that can still preserve the integrity and value of the test.

So I know more than a little about drawing conclusions from sampled data. The laboratories may have had a good grip on the theoretical and technical physics aspects of Carbon 14 dating. But it is only too obvious that they had little idea on how a proper and persuasive scientific conclusion can be reached when they accepted such a poorly constructed sampling regime for their testing, peer reviews notwithstanding. Of the three persons mentioned, only John Jackson was any kind of a scientist. Whether any of Jackson’s previous research work had depended on his being able to design appropriate sampling protocols, I am unable to comment. For any further understanding of the problem, I can only recommend any elementary Applied Statistics text book. It does turn out that the sampled area in this case was anomalous, and merely illustrates the folly of it.

Marino & Benford had their reasons for doubting that the sample was representative, apparently based on photographs, rather than the mosaics, which seem to have been something of an afterthought.

And yet a number of such pathologists have made detailed studies of the Shroud image wounds and concluded that they are precisely what one would expect. The ‘lance wound’ for example was well known to Roman gladiators engaged in mortal combat. The ‘Dying Gaul’ statue in Rome shows precisely this wound. Evidently the sculptor was familiar with it. The question of wrist nailing is simply a matter of translation semantics. The Greek root ‘chiro ‘ refers to any area between the palm and the forearm. It is used in two biblical texts, John 20:25 27 (doubting Thomas)and in Acts 12:7 “The chains fell from his ‘hands’.” In both cases, ‘wrist’ is a valid translation, and is certainly more apt in the second text, and is now found in modern translations. However Jerome translated ‘chiro ‘ as ‘manus’ in both cases rather than ‘carpus’. Consequently generations of artists have shown a palm nailed Christ. There is a more fundamental question raised by Dr Berry’s general approach, and that is the role of skepticism in the attainment of certain knowledge, a question which has been debated by philosophers since the ancient Greeks and well into modern times. A persistent skepticism is in fact self defeating, as it asserts that no certain knowledge is attainable, which is in fact an assertion about knowledge. Kierkegaard was of the view that ultimately, knowledge could only rest on a kind of faith. Skepticism serves as a useful check on rash speculation, but one certainly cannot live by it, without going insane. But if Kierkegaard is correct, I wonder what it is that Dr Berry places his faith in. Is it his profession? Is it himself? Is it some vague notion of proper standards in scientific investigation? I suspect it is probably not some personal view of a Deity, but I could be wrong. Perhaps he is not so very different from the rest of us, and lives by the balance of probabilities and likelihoods.

Entering “cotton” on Dan’s search engine above brings up several separate postings, all hotly discussed. The latest seems to have been last October 22, which notched up 36 comments including several by both you and Colin. I also searched on shroud.com, also with a large number of results, and I don’t have time to spare on canvassing them all. Barrie Schwortz was of course part of the STURP team and often asserts that there was no other interwoven cotton. The “sticky tapes” are not the only reason for this assertion. The STURP scientists are known to have examined the whole cloth microscopically, there are several photos of their doing so. Cotton was not then the issue it became post 1988, but it is asserted that their examination revealed no interwoven cotton. There are of course traces of cotton as debris, as with several other types of particles. I’m prepared to accept this assertion as being sufficently authoritative. I note that the final comment on the 22 Oct 13 posting makes the rather telling observation by one “sw”: “The average weight of the Shroud linen ranges between 20 25 mg per square centimeter. The weight of the carbon14 sample is 42 mg per square centimeter.” However the source for this is not stated. Perhaps someone else has the time to be able to corroborate it. I also note that I had asserted there that the deliberate mixing of cotton and linen for separate warp and weft threads for making fustian began in Egypt about 200 AD, spread through North Africa not reaching Spain until the 13th century. In 1973 Gilbert Raes of course had found cotton in one of his samples (adjacent to the C14 site), but none at all in the other. I think I had sufficient grounds for asserting that there was no interwoven cotton found by the STURP team in 1978, even after they had microscopically examined the cloth. If there was a first century Gallic origin for the cloth, as a result of trade or military occupation, there could of course be no cotton at all..","date":"2014-03-11","mins":"6:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-127945","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Contradiction: ” he would have adhered to the tradition of the day …” No medieval artistic representation shows the systematic pattern of the scourge wounds of the Shroud.

Apparently “sloppy science” is not to include dogmatic conclusions from non representative samples satisfying no formal protocol when it comes to C 14 dating. Wiki has some interesting observations on cotton. Although used in Mexico from the 5th millemium BCE, in the Old World its origin is in India. It was unknown to the Greeks and Arabs before Alexander’s excursions took him to the Indus. Subsequently it was used in Iran, but there is little contemporary info on its cultivation there. Even in 1350 AD, it was little understood in northern Europe, and there were preposterous stories even then about lambs growing on trees in India whose branches bent down so they could feed. There was an active cotton trade which seems confined to the Middle East up until roughly the end of the first millenium CE. All this tends to constrain the time and place of cotton contamination on the TS. If the TS were of European medieval origin then the cotton would have had to been added some time well after 1350, as it seems that cotton was virtually unknown there beforehand. This would make it a subsequent contamination. One old suggestion mentioned by Wilson in 1978 is that the linen cloth may have been woven on Middle Eastern looms previously used to weave cotton. However others have claimed that the only cotton present is in the Raes sampling area. All this points to the likelihood that the cotton is a relatively late addition, probably deliberate, in order to effect a repair. It would seem that this repair is what the C 14 laboratories accurately dated to the 14th century. But of course it may have been skewed by the much older linen cloth, lacking vanillin, and the repair could have been much later than the 14th century..","date":"2013-06-26","mins":"8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/25/cotton/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cotton"},{"id":"comment-60521","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I am under the impression that the banding occurs because the bleaching was done to the hanks of unwoven yarn, not the finished cloth.

We read in various places, “linen of purest white”, which might suggest that finished cloth was occasionally bleached. The bleaching itself seems to have been a process that would take considerable time, several months. Bleaching of linen seems to have been favoured over dyeing, as linen is apparently resistant to the dyes used in ancient times. So Charles is probably correct with his unavoidably ambiguous comment as to the timing of the various methods used.

There are plenty of the marks of this on the Shroud. They are scattered over the whole body, from the shoulders to the lower part of the legs. Most of them are to be seen on the back portion which proves that Jesus was bound with His face to the column, with His hands above Him, for there are no marks on the forearms which are quite visible. These could not have failed to receive some blows, if they had been bound lower down. A considerable number of marks are however to be found on the chest.” “One must add that only those blows have left a mark which produced an excoriation or a contused wound. All those which only caused ecchymosis (a severe bruise) have left no mark on the Shroud. Altogether I have counted more than 100, perhaps 120. This means that if there were two thongs, that Our Lord received about sixty strokes apart from those which left no mark.” “All the wounds have the same shape, like a little halter about three centimetres long. The two circles represent the balls of lead, while the line joining them is the mark of the thong.” “They are nearly in pairs of two parallel wounds, which makes me think that each flagrum had two thongs, and they are laid out in the shape of a fan, the centre of which would be the executioner’s hand. On the thorax they are oblique, horizontal on the loins, and oblique once more on the legs. At this level, one can see in the frontal image long oblique furrows (similar to the halter like wounds at the back), which must have been produced by the ends of the thongs. Having struck the calves of the legs with their leaden balls, they have turned round the outer edge of the leg and lashed the front with their points.” [Comments on evidence of complete nakedness of subject during scourging] “Finally there must have been two executioners. It is possible that they were not of the same height, for the obliqueness is not the same on each side.” “Doctor at Calvary”, Pierre Barbet, pp.91 92. My comments: There is clearly some difference from Barbet’s interpretation and the reconstructed flagrum shown in Plate 9 D of Ian Wilson’s “The Shroud” 2010. Barbet claims two thongs (the wounds occurring in pairs), plate 9 D has three thongs. Further, Barbet envisages that the pellets were at some distance from the ends of the thongs allowing the lash to whip around to the front; whereas plate 9 D shows the pellets at the ends. My personal belief is that the flagrum was probably the sort of weapon that varied quite a lot in design according to the taste and particular sadism of its user or designer, as well as what materials were readily to hand. I think it significant that a definite pattern of scourge marks is evident, consistent with how one might envisage a scourging as a formal part of execution might occur. These were not a random pattern of marks that might occur during any masochistic orgy of flagellants, but were clearly a formal execution. As for the marks being a forgery, Barbet concludes by saying: “Painters have been content with, at the most, vague, formless excoriations; is there one of them who could have imagined and realised these minute details?” I am also aware that there have been additional investigations by Italian researchers, who claim evidence of a different kind of whipping like the sort from lictors’ fasces, to “encourage?” the condemned to complete the journey to the final place of execution.

The inference has to be an intention to disguise in order to match the main cloth. As early as 1973, Prof Gilbert Raes had noticed differences in the two pieces given to him. Not only was cotton (gossypium herbaceum = ME origin) present in Piece 1, absent in Piece 2; But there was a size difference in the threads. [Thread size is measured in “tex” = grams per km] (As I understand from Thibault, he discovered cotton was interwoven with linen threads.) The warp threads were a near but not exact match: Piece 1 = 16.3 tex; Piece 2 = 18 tex; There was a more significant difference in the weft threads: Piece 1 = 53.6 tex; Piece 2 = 73.1 tex. I would presume that Raes took what he considered to be representative values, or they may be some kind of average. The original linen threads would be hand spun, and so some variation might be expected. But the weft difference seems significant to me. As the corner was vulnerable from handling during expositions, the decision may have been taken to replace or add in some new linen threads. The give away is the fact that dyes and/or lakes were used to disguise at least some of the material. There is much more about this in the literature. But we cannot now know to what extent any new linen was added, which is why I assert that the radiocarbon dating is meaningless in terms of the age of the main cloth.

To my mind the only significance in these variations are either a) the labs operate to different standards in their procedures; Or b) the very small sampling area itself is not homogeneous; Or c) Both (a) and (b)! It is then clearly a glaring statistical error to infer from these data that the Shroud is so uniformly homogeneous, that any further representative sampling is redundant, and that an induction on the age of the TS can be made based solely on the extant samples. The Principal Reason why I say they are meaningless, is because the sampling area is anomalous to a degree that cannot now be determined; not merely by known contaminants, such as those identified by Rogers and Raes and others; But more significantly because it cannot now be determined to what degree new linen may have replaced the old !

The House of Savoy had full custody and ownership of the Shroud from 1532 until Umberto’s death in 1982. Its stewardship was always conscientious, attentive and protective.

Umberto II was not any kind of royal twit despite any averse reputation of the breed that such republican types as Thomas may hold of the species. His exile was occasioned by the founding of the Italian Republic in 1946, following the toppling of the fascist regime of Il Duce at the end of WWII. There followed frequent bouts of instability and changes of toothless governments with news of yet other Italian elections a regular, risible and recurring news item.

A problem with suggesting an earlier date, is the presence of vanillin, which would be expected to be lost in the fire.

If one had the time and inclination to peruse the chronology and list the number of times the Shroud was known to have been displayed, handled, moved, transported, folded or rolled, removed and replaced, one could I suppose arrive at an absolute minimum. The number would not be so tiny as implied by the word “paucity”. I’ve decided against troubling myself as the task would indeed be onerous and I doubt there is any point in attempting to move one so wedded to scientism. It would seem that French reweaving is so successful as to be quite undetectable by any methods known to present day science, even when the known anomalies are evident.

Flury Lemburg’s understanding of such reweaving is that it would be evident on the backside of the cloth, whereas Ehrlich’s more painstaking process does not. There is a comment there attributed to the custodian’s scientific advisor Prof Piero Savarino: “In the 1998 booklet, he stated that the 1988 C 14 testing might have been erroneous due to “extraneous thread left over from ‘invisible mending’ routinely carried out in the past on parts of the cloth in poor repair” (Savarino and Barberis, 1998: 21).” This clearly suggests that there are other areas of patching on the Shroud which may be either known or unknown. As the Raes area from where the C 14 sample was taken appears to be the only area where there seems to be cotton contamination, it would seem to be the normal procedure when such invisible reweaving work was done (assuming that there are indeed other such areas) would be to remove such extraneous cotton thread on the work’s completion. This would make it extremely difficult to ascertain whether any future samples taken for C 14 testing come from a patched area or not. It would be necessary to search for other clues such as signs of gum arabic, dye azarin etc. It illustrates the hazard of C 14 testing on the Shroud, assuming of course that reliable C 14 testing of textiles is indeed feasible.

The founder of the house of Savoy was Humbert I the Whitehanded (mid 11th century), who held the county of Savoy and other areas east of the Rhône River and south of Lake Geneva and who was probably of Burgundian origin. His successors during the Middle Ages gradually expanded their territory. By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Victor Amadeus II (reigned 1675–1730) was raised in 1713 from duke to the status of a king as ruler of Sicily; in 1720 he exchanged Sicily for Sardinia. He and his successors also acquired important territory in northeastern Italy. From 1453 until 1577, the Holy Shroud was housed in Chambery, except for a short sojourn 1535 61 in Turin after which it was then returned to Chambery. In 1578, it was moved to the new Savoy capital of Turin, and eventually housed in the Guarini chapel in 1668 by Duke Charles Emmanuel. The accession of Charles Albert in 1831 contributed to the cause of Italian unification by a modernisation of government and the granting of a constitution under Piedmontese leadership and fighting against Austrian power during the war of independence 1848 49. Under Victor Emmanuel II (reigned 1849 78) the kingdom of Italy was formed in 1861 with the House of Savoy at its head. In the new state the role of the monarch lost its former prominence as a parliamentary system of government evolved. The king was in a pivotal position only in times of crisis. Victor Emmaunel III remained as figurehead king during the Fascist regime, abdicating in favour of his son Umberto II in 1946, at the conclusion of WWII hostilities, when Italy then became a republic. Nevertheless Umberto II as head of Savoy but in self imposed exile, clearly continued to assert his claim of ownership of the Shroud until his death in 1983, when his will bequeathed it to the Pope and his successors. As far as is known, the Italian government as such has never asserted any claim of ownership, nor did the Italian government ever challenge the terms of the will making this bequest. Clearly the ownership of the Shroud was properly to be considered as severable from any state property of the House of Savoy, and it is therefore a grave error to presume that the Shroud at any time ever belonged to the Italian state government. It also appears to be a grave misapprehension of the Turinese guardians as to their proper role which does not extend to ownership. They are merely guardians, and should not presume otherwise, as their actions have sometimes indicated such a misperception. I might mischievously suggest that the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople may have a greater claim to ownership of the Shroud than any person or institution in Turin!.","date":"2015-09-07","mins":"7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"id":"comment-209715","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“These are tiny details, of the kind daveb usually thinks I make too much of, … ” Hugh you are taking my name in vain quite unjustifiably.

Your use of the term ‘ownership’ as a jargon for meeting an objective is understood, however there is a suspicion abroad that something rather more is too easily inferred. Despite his exile after 1946, it seems clear enough that Umberto II still considered he had a right of proprietorship over the Shroud, declining to grant permission for any scientific investigation until 1969. Thus not until Cardinal Pellegrino’s Commision was any agreement reached, Umberto’s representative on that commission being Prof Luigi Gedda. Fr Rinaldi had also considered it wise to consult Umberto as part of his prior lobbying for the 1978 STURP investigation. Following the death of Umberto in 1983, a greater sense of proprietorship seems to have been presumed by the Turin authorities, notwithstanding Umberto’s bequest of the Shroud to the Pope and his successors. This was evident in Prof Gonella’s hostile reaction to the protocols specified by the Pontifical Science Advisor Prof Chagas for the 1988 radiocarbon dating, and the disastrous setting aside of those protocols, and the deliberate exclusion of the knowledgable STURP team. Instead we had what seems to have been a tragi comedy circus of a two hour discussion between Profs Riggi and Gonella, to discuss where a single sample was to be taken, and the most ill suited choice eventuated. One might also see it in the lack of adequate consultation in the 2002 so called restoration, with the consequential loss of material information, a result that appears to many to have been caused by incompetent ignorance. In the monasteries of medieval times, an abbott was solely responsible for the principal decisions concerning his monastery, but he was always obliged to consult all those who might have an input or be affected by his decisions beforehand.

The debate is even reflected in some of Paul’s epistles, which sometimes express a preference for celibacy. Obviously no religious group can survive indefinitely without some form of marriage, otherwise it would die out.

Knowing the state of his fences, it would be quite foolish of him to extrapolate the number of sheep in this one small field on the edge of the property with all its strays, and to attempt to estimate his ovine population from that.

Van der Hoeven, http://www.Jesus King.info, October 14, 2011. However there seems to be too much speculation for me and some confusion and inaccuracies in this particular paper, but it raises the question of just what purpose it may have served. Nevertheless vd Hoeven does include some interesting observations on the cloth, which suggest it may have served as a temple garment. How did Joseph of Arimathea come by such an exceptionally fine cloth at such short notice on what was probably a public holiday = Preparation Day, when the markets probably closed early? The paschal lambs were being slaughtered at the temple at the time of Jesus’ death. Van der Hoeven offers one explanation. Or was it Joseph’s own temple garment? Or did Joseph intend it as his own burial shround? All these are possible answers, or perhaps none of them and something else!

Raes, Rogers, and now Heimburger, have been able to identify or verify it. It demonstrates that the sample was not representative of the whole, but we do not know the extent of this interference. It is significant that Rogers found vanillin in the area, whereas none was apparent in other threads examined. The whole exercise is an object lesson in the need for representative sampling. The choice of site was unhappily influenced by the understandable concerns to conserve the integrity of the relic. It is interesting that Fanti’s mechanical dating tests indicated a much earlier age, even though with a much greater range of error. However I note from Colin’s recent tests, that sulphuric acid has the effect of weakening linen but not cotton. It would seem a remote but real possibility therefore that if the image was produced by an acid process that Fanti’s results may have been skewed by this factor. I have been doing a little reading up on aragonite. It has exactly the same chemical formula as calcite, Ca CO3. However common calcite occurs in a rhombohedral form with Ca surrounded by six closest oxygen atoms, and generally seems to be produced by sea calcium combining with dissolved CO2. Aragonite is orthorhombic in structure with Ca surrounded by nine closest O atoms. Another associate mineral is dolomite, nominally Ca Mg(CO3)2, similar to the calcite structure but with Mg and Ca occupying the metal cation sites in alternative layers. Other dolomite associates occur with manganese and iron substituting for the magnesium. Aragonite is the form that occurs in mollusc shells and in pearls. It can degenerate to calcite over the course of geological time, but is stable in cool environments, and so occurs in the limestones of caves and other cool locations. Aragonite is much less common than calcite, but is certainly common enough, and hardly as rare as suggested by some writers. What is significant is that a few of the Ca atoms in aragonite can be substituted by barium, strontium and lead, but occur in various proportions at different locations. Kohlbeck’s Shroud and Jerusalem tomb samples of aragonite included traces of iron and strontium but no lead. Clearly there ought to be the potential of quantifying the iron and strontium as markers in these samples to determine a match. If there were a match, then it would seem fairly conclusive, that despite the general prevalence of aragonite, that the Shroud aragonite could then be definitely associated with the Jerusalem aragonite. The tests could be corroborated by control samples of aragonite from other locations. Unfortunately the aragonite dust on the Shroud was removed along with other debris by the notorious 2002 restoration. It is rumoured that such debris is stored and catalogued somewhere in Turin. If it were made available, it might just be possible to test the strontium iron and any other markers to see if they do indeed match the content of Jerusalem aragonite.

It cannot be interpreted outside that single sample as being representative of the entire Shroud cloth. If the test failed (as it seems to have done), then there are two possibilities: Either a) this sample was not homogeneous as divided among the three laboratories; Or b) the testing methods between the three laboratories have an intrinsic systematic error, yielding different ages for a homogeneous sample. Given what is now known of the sample, then a) would seem to be the more likely. If on the other hand, the chi test had succeeded, it could only be interpreted as: Both c) the sample, and only this sample, was adequately homogeneous within normal limits of error; And d) the methods used by the three laboratories could be asserted as evidently mutually consistent. But e) it could not be asserted that the results are adequately representative of the entire cloth, as representative samples were not taken. The more usual and conventional use of a chi square test, is to apply it to a full range of samples, alleged to be representative. If that test failed, then it could be concluded that the samples were either not truly representative, or that the cloth is heterogeneous. So that fundamentally, the only value that this particular test had, was as a comparison between the three laboratories, and as a test on the homogeneity of the single sample.

The papyrus C 14 date range 650 870 CE may show that it is not an original 4th century text or not, depending on how much confidence one is prepared to assign to these particular tests. That another laboratory can come up with a Ptolemaic date for the same artifact must raise questions on the method. We have seen enough debate on this site for the 1988 dating of the TS, to know that not all are prepared to accept the method as infallible and that issues can arise. The use of papyrus as a writing medium was replaced in the West by parchment and vellum around the 3rd century. However it continued to be cultivated and used by the Arabs of Egypt down to the 9th century when the making of paper from other plant fibres rendered papyrus unnecessary. However the use of papyrus for books and documents continued sporadically down to the 12th century. If there is any substance to the 650 870 dating, then it may be that the fragment is part of a later copy of an earlier gnostic text, or not. It is equally conceivable that notwithstanding the dating results, that it is indeed a 4th century original. And of course it may just as equally be the work of a master forger.

I think we would have to say that the artist has definitely seen the Shroud. However Colin is right. Illustration 4, which has the same artistic style as 3 (and therefore likely the same artist), definitely shows the wound in the palm of the left hand, and at the wrist junction on the right hand.

I have yet to read the paper in detail, but already some comments occur to me. Gazay makes the assumption that Shroud & Mandylion were one and the same object, thus following the Ian Wilson theory, which is commonly challenged by Byzantine Art historians and others. It is curious that the Calvary has the likeness of the Mandylion presentation in a frame showing landscape aspect. If they were the same object, then in 1304, already the Mandylion would have been taken out of its frame, and be then recognised as the Shroud. It is unlikely that it would then be reinstated in its frame. If so this would have happened well before 1204, when the Shroud was then known (Patriarch of Constantiople’s complaint to Pope on crusaders’ despoliation). Alternatively they were in fact two separate objects – possibly the Mandylion was a copy of the face on the Shroud, hence the alleged likeness. Daniel Scavone has maintained the view that the Knights Templar worship of a head was a fabrication by the inquisitors who had previously levelled the same charge against the Cathars. Any Templar admissions of the head were generally made by lowly ranked knights who would not have been privy to the secrets of the inner circle. It is therefore not conclusive that the Templars did in fact worship a head. However some Templars may have known about the Shroud, particularly if they had some links or association with the families of Othon de la Roche or the de Charnays, notwithstanding that Breton is on the west of France and Lirey / Bensancon are in the east. The Templars would still be active in 1304, as the first arrests under Philip the Fair did not occur until 1307, Jaques de Molay being burnt at the stake in 1314. When I first saw the article, I immediately thought of the keramion, the clay tile said to be found with the Mandylion in Edessa about 525 AD. Does anyone know what the keramion looked like, or what happened to it? Did it look anything like the Shroud face, and could the Calvary have been modeled on the keramion?.","date":"2013-02-20","mins":"5:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/20/paper-chase-and-historical-c14-challenge-relations-of-a-breton-calvary-with-the-shroud-and-the-templar-knights/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase and Historical C14 Challenge: Relations of a Breton Calvary with the Shroud and the Templar Knights"},{"id":"comment-25084","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A dogmatic assertion which neither Yannick Clement, nor Byzantine Art historians, and not even Ian Wilson can make one way or the other.

In the Breton Calvary described by Francois Gazay, the figure appears to be cherub like (a head with wings), which Gazay says implies that this veil was not made by human hands. Gazay also claims to identify certain Shroud like facial features in the 1304 Breton Calvary. These are probably not so apparent in the Tronoen case. The story of the Veronica begins with the 2nd century so called proto “Acts of Pilate” which the early church Fathers knew about, but these Acts were redacted and added to over the next 150 years or so, and the legend of Veronica grew and developed with the redactions accordingly. A few factors incline me to some skepticism about the story of the Veronica, along with the Mandylion. We may acknowledge that there is some kernel of truth behind all such legends, but much of the time we can never know for certain what that kernel is. Even allowing for Jewish aversion to images (and remember Luke was not a Jew), is it not surprising that in spite of having at least three such tales of Christ creating an image of himself, not one of them is mentioned in any of the gospels (not even Luke). We have the Doctrine of Addai (Abgar legend) the Veronica, and the image we know on the Shroud. Early portraits of Christ show him as a beardless Adonis, and St Augustine had no idea of what he looked like, despite three possible putative genuine portraits. I suspect that both the tales of the Veronica and the Mandylion were the result of a type of “Chinese Whispers” emanating from rumours concerning the Shroud image, which only a select few knew about. At some time the Shroud image was copied – perhaps its identity as a burial cloth was concealed as postulated by Wilson. As these copies spread, perhaps the Veronica and Mandylion legends became associated with a few of the superior copies. This would account for the common likenesses in the various reproductions, assertions of three distinct image creations, while allowing separate identities for the three objects. I merely offer this as an interesting speculation, which I think has more credibility than other attempts at explanations..","date":"2013-02-21","mins":"3:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/20/paper-chase-and-historical-c14-challenge-relations-of-a-breton-calvary-with-the-shroud-and-the-templar-knights/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase and Historical C14 Challenge: Relations of a Breton Calvary with the Shroud and the Templar Knights"},{"id":"comment-44809","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My reading of the posting only, suggests there must be typos in the various dimensional abbreviations.

I personally considered the Benford Marino paper well researched and adequately documented, but with only one matter that I could take issue with. I also note that Mme Flury Lemburg still appears to be in denial over the possibility of “reweaving”, despite the fact that Michael Ehrlich routinely carries out such invisible reweaving at the present time (or at any rate in 2005 when the paper was written). Flury Lemburg’s understanding of such reweaving is that it would be evident on the backside of the cloth, whereas Ehrlich’s more painstaking process does not. I also note the Preface comment: “This paper was peer reviewed by two scholarly history journals, Viator and the Journal of Medieval History. Neither journal suggested any major or substantive corrections. The minor amendments suggested by the peer reviewers were included in the final version of this paper.” The matter I have a problem with is due to an attributed comment by the custodian’s scientific advisor Prof Piero Savarino: “In the 1998 booklet, he stated that the 1988 C 14 testing might have been erroneous due to “extraneous thread left over from ‘invisible mending’ routinely carried out in the past on parts of the cloth in poor repair” (Savarino and Barberis, 1998: 21).” This clearly suggests that there are other areas of patching on the Shroud which may be either known or unknown. A fairly recent comment by Thibault Heimburger stated that no cotton was found anywhere else on the Shroud, only the area from which the C 14 samples were taken. I can only conclude if the two separate comments by both Savarino and Heimburger are both correct, that it was mere chance that the C 14 sample included a cotton thread (although there was also said to be gum arabic and other clues) and the more usual procedure in such work would be to remove such extraneous cotton thread on its completion. It is strangely coincidental that the one area of the cloth which was used for the C 14 testing was also the only area that included remnant cotton..","date":"2013-05-16","mins":"5:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/16/paper-chase-nobody-goes-to-the-trouble-oh-yes-they-might/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase:  Nobody Goes to the Trouble.

At Notre Dame where she had obtained her doctorate, she became a Catholic and joined the Carmelite order of nuns, taking the name of Sister Damian of the Cross. Her involvement with Shroud studies was considerable including: obtaining microscope slides of Jerusalem flora for matching with the Frei samples, her studies of tombs in Jerusalem, and her work wih Kohlbeck and Otterbein, identifying the dirt on the Shroud as Jerusalem travertine aragonite limestone. An excerpt from a letter to Fr Otterbein includes the following: “Limestone (calcium) samples were collected from as far south as 30 miles from Jerusalem to as far north as the Galilee and Mt. Carmel. As previously reported, Kohlbeck and Damian had matched a heavy calcium concentration from the foot area on the Shroud of Turin to samples collected in Jerusalem. This evidence was called into question, so sampling around Israel was performed to assertain if such a test was valid. From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Therefore, the match between Jerusalem and the shroud is a valid one. The Shroud of Turin was indeed in Jerusalem at one time during its history.” Clearly Dr Nitowski was convinced that the TS had Jerusalem provenance. But like so many other studies it seems open to the criticism that it was not subject to peer review. Is the evidence still available? Can her tapes, slides, record of results be otherwise confirmed?

Also Giovanna De Liso in her seismic experiments used linen which she says had only ever been washed in Marseilles soap since 1860; Her cloths were soaked in water or oily solutions of aloe, myrrh and tolu balsam in various percentages; sometimes she added Na Cl, bovine blood or her own blood, in attempts at discovering an image reactive mix. A naturalistic solution may be found, but it will depend on hitting on the correct reactive mix.

Nevertheless, I still remain open to the possibility that it may in fact be the Jesus family tomb. My reason for this is the statistical probability of the combination of names which I consider a strong argument in its favour, controversy re the James ossuary notwithstanding. I recall that one of the participants, I forget whether it was either James Cameron or Tabor, was quite insistent that no bones were ever found in the Jesus ossuary, except for a small carpal bone, but there were fragments of linen. I have just looked for a more recent update, which you may like to follow up. It is published on a Humanist site, written by Paul Donahue, and includes comment on a 587 page work “The Tomb of Jesus and his Family?” by James H Charlesworth, which contains reports by 28 scholars. Take away the slight anti religious bias, and despite Charlesworth’s claim that there was a consensus that it was not the Jesus family tomb, it left Donahue with the impression that this claimed consensus was not the case. I have no problems with the ossuary that claims to be that of a son of Jesus, as adoption was common in those times, but it would be politically astute to claim in public that Judah was in fact a brother not a son, for his own protectiion from the authorities.

If there were oppressors, these could only be the Romans, but the real enemy of the early Christians is painted as the Jewish establishment. St Paul himself seems to have been an educated man with the trade of a tent maker, joined the sect of the Pharisees, and as those who stoned Stephen lay their cloaks at his feet (like a football coach), he clearly had some influence there. A Roman centurion is not too proud to ask Jesus to heal his servant. The disciples are able to find supporters among influential women. This does not paint a picture of desparate down trodden serfs looking for revolution. Jesus’ message was revolutionary, “Blessed are the poor”, the parable of Dives and Lazarus, his liberating attitude towards women, turning the existing conventions upside down. The disciples do not at first embrace the story of the Resurrection, but have to be convinced before they can accept it. And then these same disciples are prepared to give their lives for it.

These indications may include: 1) Fanti’s mechanical testing suggesting the possibility of a 1st century date; 2) Historic arguments that the Shroud was in Constantinople in 1204; 3) Indications from the Hungarian Pray manuscript that distinctive features of the Shroud were known in 1195, prior to the alleged C14 dating; 4) Forensic arguments that the image is that of a real crucified person who suffered the punishments reported in the gospels including a crown of thorns and percussio wound to the chest; 5) the otherwise inexplicable cause of the image; 6) the unsmeared blood stains; 5) Presence of Jerusalem limestone; Etc, etc!

His investigations persuaded him that there were anomalies indicative of highly skilled mending.

I was impressed with the case they made for the titulus and wrote a review for my parish magazine at the time. With so many reliable eye witnesses attesting to it there can be no doubt that the original relic existed and survived as late as 980 AD, the earliest date given by the C14. The sequence of the lettering is Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek and Latin at variance with the sequence in Luke and John, although the first line is damaged. The Greek and Latin reads from right to left, either because of the inscriber’s ignorance or as a parody of the Hebrew. The O.K. Story on Pope Lucius II is fascinating and one I had not been aware of. An alternative explanation for the present relic being a replica might that the original was destroyed in one of the many medieval fires in Rome, as were the papal tombs mentioned. However the caligraphic commentary suggests that the original still existed when the replica (if that’s what it is) was made. In early 2010 I also wrote a fanciful piece “Just a simple block of wood” with a reference to the True Cross and the Titulus, with some commentary on those relics.

A PDF can be found on the shroud.com site at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf. Downloadable and readable! As well as the more apparent manouverings by Tite and the other labs, a key aspect has to be Flury Lemburg’s insistence that only the one sample would be necessary, as she deemed the cloth to be homogeneous. Her assertion is highly questionable in itself, but despite her high reputation as a textile expert, it seems she was totally ignorant about standard elementary requirements for any kind of scientific representative sampling methods, let alone the need for observing proper scientific protocols. It is an example of how a highly assertive but unfortunately ignorant person can destroy the outcome of such an important scientific project.

Perhaps Colin needs to redefine his terms – otherwise it looks like “ostrich head in the sand” stuff. I think the comment does Science and his scientific colleagues a disservice.

Notwithstanding Exodus stories, Egyptians made little use of slave labour, but used agricultural workers during the off season (Nile Inundation) who were generally well looked after with beer and bread. Egyptians had a good grasp of empirical mathematics as shown on “Rhind” and “Moscow” papyri, several model problems copied by Ahmes ~1650 BC from an earlier work. Greeks were impressed by their schools and adopted their methods. They pioneered land and engineering surveying, could set out accurate right angles (groma) and had levelling instruments. They had not deduced Pythagorean triples, although Babylonians knew of at least 15 triples 1000 years before Pythagoras. Egyptian numerary system was adequate based on repetition of denary symbols, but not nearly as sophisticated as Babylonians’ was. Egyptian fractional system was abominable and was based on “Horus eye” – repeated bisections.

So Jesus had to show them it was OK to have images of him. But the lesson has been slow to take. 5. The reason why God allowed scientists to make an error in the C14 dating, is so they might learn some humility. This lesson has also been slow to take (evident on this site for example). “My ways are not your ways. It is the Lord who speaks!” 6.
