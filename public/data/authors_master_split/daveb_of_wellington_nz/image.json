They then measured his cloth body distance (normal or vertical??) and obtained an exact match with micro densitometer readings on a true Shroud negative. I am under the impression that that is the fundamental experimental basis for asserting that the luminance provides an accurate 3 D height map for the image. I imagine that more rigorous experiments may have been carried out since then with better equipment. However to obtain a true contour map, I should think that it would be necessary to add the height of the draped cloth at its various points, to the z coordinate. Although J & J seemed to think that there “was only one true way” of draping the cloth, clearly there’s some scope for variation in the height of the cloth. The bronze statue cast by sculptor Luigi E Mattei at the Pontifical Institute of Notre Dame of Jerusalem centre and shown on this site recently seems fairly persuasive evidence, even allowing for some artisitic licence. . (2) As Gabriel hints at above, the fact that there is this correlation between cloth body distance and luminance, must say something about the image forming process. I am thinking that if it is a chemical process for instance, then the gas(?) molecules as they are emitted from the body are perhaps inherently unstable, and in the time they take to arrive at the cloth are partly converted to their stable form with various concentrations depending on the distance they’ve traveled, resulting in the different intensities of luminance, and the consequential correlation with cloth body distance.

Barbet was a French surgeon who studied the photographs of the Shroud in great detail. In addition he seems to have been a competent Latin & Greek scholar, and draws on several ancient works which describe the usual practices. Furthermore he had access to the distressing reports of witnesses to crucifixion experiments carried out under the Nazi regime in the Dachau death camps. His original work was published in French in 1950 under the title “La Passion de N.S. Jesus Christ selon le Chirurgien” by Dillon & Cie. It was translated into English by “The Earl of Wicklow” under its own title. The edition I have access to was published in paperback by Image Books, New York 1963. The usual practice after scourging was for the condemned person to carry (not drag) the ~120 lb patibulum (cross beam) to the place of execution where the upright (stipes) was permanently set in place. Barbet estimates the stipes at not much more than 2.5 m high, based on the fact that an unmounted infantryman would sometimes dispatch the victim with a spear to the heart. (This might be an underestimate by Barbet as it seems that the ~2m lancea was used which would allow some further height). In Jesus’ case the carrying of the patibulum was assisted by Simon of Cyrene. It was usual for the victim’s arm to be bound to the patibulum during this portage. Barbet’s sources suggest to him that nailing was the more usual practice rather than binding for fastening the victim to the cross, although in one particular region (not Palestine) binding was more usual. The victim would lie on the ground and his “arms” (not his hands) would be stretched out along the line of the patibulum and be nailed to it. It would then be an easy task for four soldiers to raise the patibulum with the victim attached (say 220 lbs) and fasten it to the stipes, either as a T (Tau) or t, depending on whether the stipes was notched or end bearing. The body would sag under its own weight, and the feet would then be nailed. Sometimes a foot pedestal would be provided, allowing the victim to exercise a see saw motion allowing him some breathing, but this would prolong the agony. The blood flows from the wrists would follow gravity, and thus Barbet measures the angle of the arms at between 65 and 70 degrees to the horizontal, quite a steep angle. Barbet also deals with the apparent lengthening of the arms on the Shroud image. He discounts joint dislocation as a cause of this, as dislocation usually results in a shortening of the arms due to muscle contraction (Ask anyone who’s had a dislocated shoulder). The humerus can however be separated from the shoulder blade a little if it is violently stretched. Barbet says that the maximum stretch is only 2 inches, and this conforms with the triangulation commencing with the arm stretched out horizontal and then lowered to 65 degrees from body sag. I feel that this account may be inadequate to explain the apparent lengthening of the arms that we see on the Shroud image. My own view of this is that it will depend very much on the disposition of the cloth when the image was formed, its folds, creases etc, and I see this as a problem in projective geometry, which I have endeavoured to raise on this site from time to time. If the cloth lay at some angle to the quasi plane of the arms, then the projection of the arms on to the cloth will appear to be lengthened. Regarding Paul’s point that he had read that the hands cannot reach the genital area as shown on the Shroud: This is only true if the legs are straight out. Rigor mortis would hold the knees bent, and this is shown on 3 D imaging on the thierrycastex.blogspot.fr site. The genital area is then easily reached..","date":"2012-09-05","mins":"11:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/a-different-approach-to-what-some-see-as-problems-with-the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A different approach to what some see as problems with the image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-15956","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks for the hint Ron.

Ron: I’m not aware that other “forensic experts” have claimed that shoulders were dislocated. Barbet says “No!” on the basis that muscle contraction would in fact shorten the arms. But would muscle contraction operate in a case of rigor mortis? I wouldn’t know. Barbet says you can only get a 2 inch extension from stretching the shoulder ligaments. Otherwise the action of dislocating the shoulders during the laying out of a body seems to me unduly violent, merely to place the hands in that position, Nevertheless the arms do appear unusually long. That is why I suggest it may be a projective geometry property regarding the angle between placing of the arms and the disposition or folds in the cloth at the time of image formation.

It’s essentially based on elementary equilibrium statics. The 196 lb tension in each arm provides a vertical component of 83 lbs each countering half the weight of the body. This 196 lb is near the maximum tension in the arm. The victim would engage a seesaw sort of action to maintain breathing as long as he was able, transferring some of his weight to his nailed feet, thus momentarily relieving some of the arm tension. The 196 lb arm tension has a 178 lb horizontal component, maintaining his sideways equilibrium, and at the nails should transfer a net compression of 178 lb along the beam of the patibulum. (Timber stresses are tricky to assess accurately because of the grain) I don’t know the particular art work Max mentions or how it might relate to crucifixion trauma. However I believe I have read that the two shoulders on the TS do show some significant difference, various ones suggesting that it might have been occupationally incurred, such as frequently working with heavy timbers.

Interestingly, I discovered that in his youth, Barbet had been a sapper, working on railway construction, and was familiar with men carrying railway sleepers (cross ties) on their shoulders, and occasionally tripping during this. This relates to the carrying of the patibulum which he estimates at 120 lb. He postulates that Jesus was not bound to the patibulum, but carried it on his right shoulder in much the same way, and then was easily assisted by Simon of Cyrene. He has an interesting discussion on injuries to his back and knees during his falls. He considers that the full cross was Tau shaped T, and was not more than about 6ft 8 in in height. After being nailed to the patibulum with arms fully outstretched while lying horizontal, a ladder would be placed against the stipes, which the victim would then mount with his back to the stipes, while four soldiers would then easily lift the patibulum with the victim attached and place it on the top of the stipes. Weight of the patibulum and the body would not be more than 286 lb, so he is estimating the body weight as 166 lb. From the blood flows he measures that the arms in the crucified position are 65 degrees to the vertical, which is 25 deg to the horizontal. He considers that the normal distance between shoulder blade and wrist is slightly less than 24 inches. In the suspended position, this gives a hypoteneuse of 24 / cos 25 = 26.48 inches, giving a lengthening of the arm of about 2.46 inches. This is close to his maximum limit of 2 inches from ligament stretch. From the triangle of forces, it can be calculated that the tension in each arm must be: T = 166 / (2 x sin 25) = 196 lbs, a fairly traumatic tension to hold for 3 hours. Severe cramps would rapidly ensue, together with the issues of asphyxiation and other trauma. Whether this tension would be sufficient to cause eventual shoulder dislocation, I am unable to say, but Barbet apparently discounts it. If the image is considered by some to show shoulder dislocation, as has been commented, this may have resulted from repositioning of the arms in a state of rigor mortis during the eventual laying out. I am still holding to the view that the apparent lengthening of the arms on the image may be a matter of projective geometry, involving the angles between the cloth and arms during image formation. This may be an issue that needs further consideration..","date":"2012-09-07","mins":"5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/a-different-approach-to-what-some-see-as-problems-with-the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A different approach to what some see as problems with the image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-16125","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I’m reading into your last comment here, with GRADUAL pressure release, that you’re envisaging a process maybe analgous to a long exposure on a film giving multiple fuzzy images of the same object creating an impression of long arms.

You have to be very careful with the nomenclature. Diimide = diazene isn’t diazine and isn’t diamide. My reading of diimide is that it’s used for preparation for certain stable plastics – polyiimides not polyamides. An Encyc Brit extract if you can make any sense out of it: “Polyimides are polymers that usually consist of aromatic rings coupled by imide linkages—that is, linkages in which two carbonyl (CO) groups are attached to the same nitrogen (N) atom. There are two categories of these polymers, condensation and addition. The former are made by step growth polymerization and are linear in structure; the latter are synthesized by heat activated addition polymerization of diimides and have a network structure.” “Network polyimides are formed from bismaleimide and bisnadimide precursors. At temperatures above 200° C (390° F), bismaleimides undergo free radical addition polymerization through the double bonds to form a thermosetting network polymer. Bisnadimides react somewhat differently at elevated temperatures. The nadimide group first decomposes to yield cyclopentadiene and maleimide, which then copolymerize to form the network polyimide structure.” “Polyimides are amorphous plastics that characteristically exhibit great temperature stability and high strength, especially in the form of composites. They are used in aircraft components, sporting goods, electronics components, plastic films, and adhesives.” I’d be guessing that Ray Rogers discovered that image discolouration occurred when image fibres were reacted with diimide..","date":"2014-04-15","mins":"7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/15/good-chemistry-questions/","cat":"science","title":"Good Chemistry Questions"},{"id":"comment-16966","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Penrose is one of most brilliant mathematical minds of our present age. He would know that Godel’s theorems of incompleteness are intended to apply to rigorous logical systems of mathematics, such as those attempted by Russell & Whitehead. They resolved a puzzle in Cantor’s transfinite numbers as to whether there was a transfinite number between aleph(0) and aleph(1), or whether there was a continuum of such numbers. In fact it was shown by Godel’s theorems, that the answer is undecidable. Whether there is in fact a chemistry or physics equivalent to Godel’s theorems I think can only be seen in analogy. There might be such an answer in the indeterminate questions of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg’s principle of uncertainty, and the quantum pairings of remote particles notwihstanding the limits imposed by speed of light. I think I prefer Teilhard de Chardin’s approach to the evolution of consciouness. Teilhard worked on his theories during the 1920s 30s, but because of the constraints imposed by his Jesuit order they only became available after his death in 1955 with the publication of such works as his ‘Phenomenon of Man’ and ‘The Divine Milieu’. It is remarkable that fundamentally he foresaw the development of the Internet. A paleontologist and mystic, rather than a rigorous philosopher, Teilhard’s ideas are too speculative for some tastes, but nevertheless his ideas seem to have a wonderful cohesion. He sees the breakthrough in consciousness with the development of encephalisation, and nervous tissue, but I suspect his ideas go further back to even the intrinsic nature of matter. “Teilhard’s attempts to combine Christian thought with modern science and traditional philosophy aroused widespread interest and controversy when his writings were published in the 1950s. Teilhard aimed at a metaphysic of evolution, holding that it was a process converging toward a final unity that he called the Omega point. He attempted to show that what is of permanent value in traditional philosophical thought can be maintained and even integrated with a modern scientific outlook if one accepts that the tendencies of material things are directed, either wholly or in part, beyond the things themselves toward the production of higher, more complex, more perfectly unified beings.” Socialisation was another important breakthrough. “While some evolutionists regard man simply as a prolongation of the Pliocene fauna—an animal more successful than the rat or the elephant—Teilhard argued that the appearance of man brought an added dimension into the world. This he defines as the birth of reflection: animals know, but man knows that he knows; he has “knowledge to the square.” ” [Quotations from Encyclopedia Britannica] I see Teilhard’s work as the one worthwhile attampt to synthesise the ideas of science, philosophy and religion. Unfortunately like most insightful geniuses who attempt to synthesise across disparate disciplines, he was rejected by them for either being insufficiently scientific or insufficiently theological. A scientist with strong religious views could do worse than to be familiar with his work..","date":"2012-09-26","mins":"9:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/26/how-can-physics-and-chemistry-account-for-consciousness/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"How can physics and chemistry account for consciousness?"},{"id":"comment-100032","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks to Alvin, all excellent arguments for Rogers’ chromophore hypothesis, image is on starch layer, image dissolved by diimide, leaves unaffected linen fibril behind.

I consider that Yannick Clement makes a valid comment (chalk it up Yannick) when he says at #51: “we must assume that the cloth was not tightly wrapped around the body when the image formation process was active, because if that would have been the case, the resulting image would have been dramatically distorted laterally, especially in rounded zones like the face, the arms and the thighs. (Etc)” Cartographer that he is, this is the way that the projection would work. Any senior high school student in Technical Drawing would immediately know this without even touching his Tee square. Max Patrick Hamon does not know this, so he clearly does not have the competence of a Technical Drawing High School student when it comes to 3 dimensional geometry. The only way that a tightly wrapped shroud could produce the orthogonal image as seen is if the sides of the body had been packed (possibly with some of the 100 lb package brought by Nicodemus), hiding the sides, so that the shrouded corpse appears as an approximation to a distorted cuboid, with the frontal and dorsal surfaces of the sheet, following the lines of the body probably mis shapen in rigor mortis. Transverse sections of the sheet, would need to be almost linear, for an orthogonal image to have any possibility of forming, otherwise the distortion mentioned by YC occurs. However, this is not the configuration claimed by Max Patrick Hamon, and therefore his hypothesis will result in distortion, which is not what we see! I concede that that the various rituals which MPH persistently refers to may have a role in the image formation process, however there is very little experimental evidence he can present to demonstrate that they do so. Hence this is not formal research in the strict sense at all, but merely his hypothesis. If it were research, where is his published paper, and when was it peer reviewed? I do not intend to respond to his arrogant presumptions as to what competences I may or may not possess, as he is ill suited to judge them, and others can draw their own conclusions as to what little value his derogatory comments might have!.","date":"2013-06-07","mins":"8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-completely-inappropriate-experiment-nice-white-lab-coats-anyway/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A completely inappropriate experiment.

One point that Barrie made was that it would be a difficult topic to revisit following the 2002 restoration, which included vacuuming the various dust particles off the cloth, although.I have since heard that the particles removed were archived and catalogued.(hopefully). Barrie also suggested that there might be some information in one of the eight boxes left by Ray Rogers, as yet unopened and still to be investigated. Comments in the posting also included a number of UR Ls referencing the work of Kohlbeck & Nitowski. Nitowski (Dr. Eugenia Nitowski – Sister Damian of the Cross, OCD) had evidently satisfied herself that she had identified the cloth dust as travertine aragonite limestone, similar to that found at the Gate of Damascus at Jerusalem. Howver the point, as made by Gabriel, is that it seems that this was as far as it was taken, and her research was never submitted to any kind of peer review, so that her work has not been scientifically corroborated. Kohlbeck also mentions that both the Jerusalem and Shroud samples also included traces of strontium and iron but no lead. It has been mentioned that the percentages of strontium contamination would have been a useful specific signature indicator to provide conlusive evidence that the Shroud dust was in fact from Jerusalem and not limetone from some other location, but again only if corroborated. A scratch pad archive I’d compiled from searching the topic and recently sent to John following our discussions,mentions a number of other investigators and various other web references.

I’m inclined to take Gabriel’s point that he may well have been surfing this site picking up various stray blog comments. 1) He trots out the Bishop D’Arcis memo yet again, which I feel has now been adequately discredited. The common faulty understanding that this alleged memo was actually completed and delivered to the Avignon Pope now seems to have arisen from a liberal faction within the Church about 1905 partly as a reaction to Secondo Pio’s first negatives which many felt demonstrated the reality of the Resurrection. The faction preferred a more liberal or psychological interpretation of that reality, and I’ve previously mentioned Jack Markwardt’s claims that those involved set out to defraud by attributing the D’Arcis memo with more significance than it warranted. It’s doubtful that it ever went beyond the draft stage, and likely there were improper motives behind it, or else was based on incorrect information referring to an actual copy made to replace the orginal previously kept at Besancon. 2) Yes, thousands were crucified by the Romans and various other regimes in ancient times but, assuming the Shroud’s authenticity as a burial cloth for a crucifixion victim, there is I think too much evidence that this particular victim was indeed Jesus Christ. Even the arch sceptic Herbert Thurston had to agree that if it was not actually Jesus Christ, then it was clearly intended to represent no other. The long hair and beard point to a Jewish victim; the injuries – the scourging, the spear thrust etc are in broad accord with the NT accounts; the cap of thorns seems to have been an impulsive soldier’s action mocking the claim to being “King of the Jews” (the official fundamental charge) – it was never a standard crucifixion punishment. Most persuasive for me is that here we have a burial cloth showing the image of an uncorrupted body, and yet there is in fact no body to go with the cloth. 3) Concerning the forensics: As Pierre Barbet has convincingly demonstrated, all of the blood flows (including those on the arms) are in full accord with those of a crucifixion victim, well beyond the competence and understanding of any medieval forger. A “Ho hum” comment is an inadequate response to such evidence. 4) Too perfect an image: Not strictly correct! The wrist nailing is at variance with medieval understanding of how Christ was nailed to the cross, but is in fact more rational. There are slight deformities in the image from various causes such as wrinkling of the cloth, and although the image appears to be an orthogonal projection, there are slight variations from this, possibly because of how the cloth was draped or wrapped over/around the body, or perhaps arising from the actual imaging process..","date":"2013-05-04","mins":"6:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/04/a-mysterious-work-of-art/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A mysterious work of art?"},{"id":"comment-32987","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin: I can only agree with you that specific failures to apply the rigour of the scientific method in specific cases of assertions based on alleged scientific claims from whatever quarter are fit and proper and should be addressed.

Image is very superficial, maybe only 200nm, and perhaps is confined to the impurity layer on the linen fibres, rather than being on the fibres themselves. Most often cited naturalistic explanation is Maillard reaction, body vapours acting on the cloth surface, but no one appears to have been successful in producing a convincing image this way. It may be that very specific environmental factors are needed, such as humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure etc. The most successful experiments at producing a convincing image to date have been by Giovanna De Liso working for 12 years in the seismic Piedmont area. Earthquake events frequently release radon, a heavy radioactive inert gas contained within the earth.

The sciences in general have frequently been contentious. I can recommend any of Hal Hellman’s books in his series “Great Feuds in …” (Science / Mathematics / Technology / Medicine). The feuds were sometimes about priority, sometimes about validity, sometimes about concepts. Two matters come to mind in connection with this challenge and the debate about consensus. Around 1900, David Hilbert, president of a prestigious international mathematical association presented a programme of some 23 unsolved problems for the twentieth century. I think most of them have now all been resolved, a few in quite unexpected ways, e.g. Godel’s undecidability theorem, axiom of choice, and the contiuum hypothesis in transfinite numbers. Hilbert had not sought consensus for his programme, but his status as president had allowed him alone to formulate his programme of challenges. The second matter relates to the Paul Wolfskehl prize of 100,000 marks for the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem Fermat had formulated his notorious theorem around 1637, and claimed to have had a proof (he hadn’t – it was really a hypothesis). The problem challenged the best mathematicians for the next few hundred years. In 1908, Paul Wolfskehl, a Gernan industrialist bequeathed in his will a prize of 100,000 GM to whomever could solve it. The challenge attracted every amateur mathematician throughout the world, and the math dept in the university of Gottingen was inundated with attempted proofs. In response the dean developed a routine card response “The first error occurs in Line xxx”. The Theorem was finally proved by the English mathematician Andrew Wiles at Princeton U in 1995, who had dedicated much of his professional life to its solution. Peer review of his first presentation of the “proof” revealed.a serious problem which seemed intractable. However further work resolved his difficulty, and Wiles eventually collected the prize. You can find any amount of material on the web about Fermat’s Last Theorem, the Wolfskehl prize and Wiles’ proof of the theorem. Simon Singh has published an excellent paper back on the subject. The example serves to illustrate.how acceptance in the scientific community comes about, certainly in mathematics anyway. I doubt if the Shroud challenge will attract the same amount of attention as did the Wolfskehl prize.

The only positive results were seen for the presence of aldehydes and cellulosic carboxyl functional groups. These results argue against the body images being the result of painting with some type of applied stain or dye, but suggest instead that the image was produced by some type of chemical process yielding a dehydrative oxidation of the cellulosic structure of the linen itself. Note this is consistent with the corroded surface appearance as seen in phase contrast and the brittleness of the body image fibers as observed in the microscope studies. Thus the chromophore accounting for the body image fiber color would be a mixture of conjugated carbonyl structures generated within the cellulose polymer itself.9, 24 It should be noted that this type of chemistry accounts for the natural yellowing of linen as it ages. Therefore the body image chemistry can be thought of as some type of selective differential accelerated aging process. No one as yet has experimentally demonstrated a chemical mechanism that would yield this type of chromophore and at the same time be consistent with the observed physical properties of the image.33” Thus he dismisses the coating hypothesis of Rogers, and attributes the image thus “… body image fiber color would be a mixture of conjugated carbonyl structures generated within the cellulose polymer itself”.","date":"2015-07-19","mins":"5:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"id":"comment-206184","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Would it not be a mystery of chemistry of how the image was formed by some kind of body emissions combining with an elusive starch or saccharide layer, which seems to be no longer evident, except for the manifest image, of which Adler says: ” … is consistent with the corroded surface appearance as seen in phase contrast and the brittleness of the body image fibers as observed in the microscope studies.

As a food chemist, Colin would know that there are hundreds of varieties of flour (yes, hundreds). Presumably he was using a modern flour as available from his local supermarket. It has to be asked how can he be sure that the flour he used was a reasonably close match with what was generally available in medieval times. How can he know that his results were not affected by any one of the various additives commonly used to affect the properties of the flour? In the 1930s, some flour began to be enriched with iron, niacin, thiamine and riboflavin. In the 1940s, mills started to enrich flour and folic acid was added to the list in the 1990s. Might we presume that Colin’s flour was of this type? In stone ground flour, it is not uncommon for stone chips from the mill stones to find their way into the flour and they have to be removed. Did the medieval millers know about this? During the Industrial Revolution it was discovered that flour would become rancid and had a limited shelf life. The fatty acids from the germ begin to react with oxygen from the moment they are milled. In the 19th century, removing the germ was the effective solution. What was the solution in medieval times, or did the flour always have to be fresh, and was the germ left intact? Medieval flour in Europe commonly had a high rye content. Do the results still work with rye flour? Bleaching additives are now commonly used, but are prohibited in some regimes. Colin would know that what we may consider as a simple ingredient, is in fact quite a complex substance, which has varied over the course of history and is variable in different cultures. He needs to ensure that the flour he has been using conforms to what was available in medieval times, and is representative of presumably what was then European type flour.

As far as I’m aware, the Shroud is not renown as being associated with any notable miracles involving physical healings. I personally feel that its significance is somewhat more profound, in that it is a witness to the mortal life and death of Jesus Christ. The cloth’s survival to the present from ancient times, is I think a favourable argument towards its authenticity. The Image of Edessa, whether or not it was the same object as the Shroud, was credited with preserving the city from invasion only so long as it remained there, which may be its only talismanic reputation. Another supernatural property it has, is its witness and encouragement to Faith and belief, for the wavering doubting Thomases. Although I’m inclined to think that the image is very likely naturalistic, I still see it at least as a second class miracle, in that the particular environmental circumstances which produced the image must have been clearly an Act of Providence as all other deliberate attempts to reproduce it have been unsuccessful. I’m aware of only two other known cases where a dead human body has produced a comparable image. As to the question of radiation being a cause: I have frequently referred to the experimental work by Giovanna De Liso in the seismically active area of Piedmont over a period of some 12 years. She has produced the most persuasive images I have seen, those of a snake and also a metallic object both with 3 D properties. Earthquakes are known to produce the heavy inert radioactive gas ‘radon’, which emits radiation. Radiation from radon has been implicated as a significant cause of cancer in occupants of apartment buildings in the USA. The gospel accounts of the crucifixion relate that a swarm of earthquakes occurred, including one credited with moving the rock from the entrance to the tomb. A minor criticism of De Liso’s work is that she used relatively thin objects, compared to that of a human body. Others have experimented with producing images specifically involving radon gas. “Shroud like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010. Http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/De Liso Web.pdf Copies of the images she produced are clearly shown in the paper, and are I think persuasive.

This adequately demonstrates that the Shroud and its image influenced the Lamentation scenes that developed around 1200 AD. I personally believe that the stone was moved by earthquake, and was no literary licence. Matthew mentions two earthquakes, one upon the death of Jesus when the temple veil was rent; the second upon the visit of the holy women at the tomb. Mark and Luke only mention that the temple veil was rent, but an earthquake is a good naturalistic explanation for this occurrence; otherwise it is necessary to assert that all three synoptic sources attribute the veil tearing to direct divine intervention. I am personally acquainted with rocks being hurled some distance from their faces during earthquakes, and this can be confirmed by any other engineer or geophycist familiar with earthquakes. The sealing of the tomb would increase the likelihood of the ‘P’ wave accomplishing this. Matthew introduces an angel of the Lord at this point to signal divine intervention, but it is an earthquake nevertheless. The Resurrection was not an apparition or a ghost. The scriptural writers clearly saw it as a bodily resurrection; Jesus ate and drank; we have him walking with disciples on the road to Emmaus, but somehow disguised; Thomas was able to touch his wounds, We have Jesus preparing breakfast by Lake Galilee. Ghosts and apparitions don’t do those sorts of things.

He is also amenable to modifying his views when that is where his science takes him. I have a copy of his “Brief History of Time”, published in 1996, but which I expect even now is somewhat dated. It is a beautifully illustrated book, with excellent graphics and is worthwhile even for its historic sections on the various pioneers in cosmology, as well as for presenting the various concepts. He has quite a lot to say about the “anthropic principle”, and poses several leading questions. He deals with the discovery of the “background microwave radiation”, the clincher for the “Big Bang”. It was first identified in 1965 by Arno Penzias & Robert Wilson working with the Holmdel N.J. Horn antenna. The radiation persisted even after cleaning the pigeon droppings out of the horn and excluding other effects, and was omni directional. Meanwhile, at nearby Princeton U, Bob Dicke and Jim Peebles deduced from George Gamow’s model of the early universe, that there should be background microwave radiation. They were preparing to look for it when the work of Enzias & Wilson came to light. But it was Enzias & Wilson who received the 1978 Nobel prize, not Dicke & Peebles and not even Gamow. The initial expansion was extremely rapid. Initially beginning at the point of singularity quantum effects make the laws of physics unknown. At 10^( 47) seconds, temperature is 10^32 deg K and commences the “Grand Unification Theory (GUT) epoch”. At 10^( 34) seconds, temperature is 10^27 deg and commences the quark antiquark epoch. At 10^( 10) seconds, temperature is 10^15 deg and we have the formation of protons, neutrons and mesons, quarks are confined and anti quarks disappear. At 1 second, temperature is 10^10 deg, protons and neutrons bind together as nuclei of hydrogen, helium, lithium and deuterium. At 3 minutes, temp is 10^9 deg, matter and radiation couple together. At 300,000 years, temp has fallen to 3000 deg, matter and radiation decouple as electrons bind together with nuclei. The universe then becomes transparent to the cosmic background radiation. At 1 billion years, clusters of matter form quasars, stars and protogalaxies. Stars burning primordial hydrogen and helium synthesize heavier nuclei.

It is directed at what he calls “pseudo science” in the various attempts to understand the processes that may have been involved in forming the image on the Shroud of Turin. His own particular disciplinary bias is of course Chemistry, as is also that of Sir Paul Maxime Nurse, President of the Royal Society of London. Important as Chemistry is in coming to an understanding of the image, there is rather more to it than this single discipline is competent to pronounce on, and of course there have been a number of forensic studies to this end. Indeed being an historic object, it even transcends the limits of the conventional hard sciences, and the discipline of Historians also needs to be called into play. Furthermore the Shroud is also seen as an important religious object of devotion, displaying with good reason what is seen to be the image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion and death, whether or not it is indeed his true likeness. So whether a prestigious Society dedicated to the pursuit of Natural Knowledge only, can bring down a decision on the Shroud’s authenticity may be arguable, although it might be able to make a useful contribution. Such Societies are of course comprised of persons the product of their own particular culture of time and place. This is no better illustrated than the case of when Yves Delage, Sorbonne professor of comparative anatomy presented his forensic findings on the Shroud image to the Paris Acadamy of Sciences in 1905. Although Delage’s findings were well reasoned and scientific, and found a positive response in the medical journal The Lancet, the Academy was so dominated by “freethinkers” and “rationalists” that the dominance of this culture produced an opposition that outweighed the evidence. Delage had compromised his distinguished scientific career as a result and he turned his attention towards other matters. Colin’s letter makes much of the 1988 Carbon dating, perhaps itself a model of pseudo science, in that carefully designed protocols were ignored, and fundamental principles of representative sampling were set aside. Nevertheless the laboratories involved proceeded with their testing, asserting that their results had 95% confidence limits. The Royal Society may also like to address this issue as an attempt at pseudo science. The provenance of the Shroud itself can only be reliably proven to around the year of 1350. Sceptics make much of the D’Arcis memorandum, based on Chevalier’s 1900 study and its English translation by Thurston in 1903. Both men were hostile to the Shroud’s authenticity, and appear to have set out on a deliberate misrepresentation of the value of the memorandum, one writer asserting that Chevalier & Thurston deliberately set out to deceive. Nevertheless various attempts have been made in the quest for an earlier provenance, many of them however questioned by various scholars in Byzantine history, who appeared to have succumbed to the peril of paying too much attention of heeding “received wisdom” in their discipline, yet another example of a cultural bias and atagonism to authenticity of the relic. Whether an objective response might be expected from the Royal Society is moot. It is no doubt not less susceptible to the personal biases of its members than any other human institution, as was the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1905. The following extract on Sir Paul Nurse may be of interest. “Nurse criticized the potential Republican candidates for the US presidential nomination for opposing the teaching of natural selection, stem cell research on cell lines from human embryos, and anthropogenic climate change; he blamed scientists in part for not speaking up. He was alarmed that this could happen in the U.S., a world leader in science, “the home of Benjamin Franklin, Richard Feynman and Jim Watson.” “One problem, Nurse said, was “treating scientific discussion as if it were political debate,” using rhetorical tricks rather than logic. Another problem was science teaching in the schools, which does not teach citizens how to discuss science, and is compromised by religious schools, even in the United Kingdom.” “We need to emphasize why the scientific process is such a reliable generator of knowledge with its respect for evidence, for skepticism, for consistency of approach, for the constant testing of ideas,” wrote Nurse. “Finally, scientific leaders “have a responsibility to expose the bunkum,” said Nurse. They should take on politicians, and expose nonsense during elections”.","date":"2012-09-16","mins":"7:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/16/better-than-david-rolfes-dawkins-challenge/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Better than David Rolfe’s Dawkins Challenge?"},{"id":"comment-18635","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Anoxie, many thanks for the detailed summary of Roger’s corresp edited by Thibault.

In that case a convection model has obvious objections if the body was lying on its back, and a contact model would then seem more likely. We do not know that the body was laid on its back. The rigor mortis and body distortion resulting from crucifixion, such as legs being bent at the hips and knees, may have given laying out problems. The body may have been laid to rest on its side possibly fully wrapped. In that case, a convection model would then still give problems. But even with a contact process, there are then problems with explaining the orthogonality of the image. I’ve previously mentioned Giovanna de Liso’s 12 years of experiments with seismic imaging: “Shroud like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010. Other investigators have reported likewise more recently. De Liso obtained persuasive images from both metallic objects and a dead snake. The suggestion is that radon (radioactive inert gas released during seismic activity) played a significant role in producing these images. And of course an earthquake is reported in the gospel passion narratives. Another radiation experiment was carried out by Dr August Accetta, American radiologist, and founder of the Shroud Center of Southern California. Dr Accetta injected into his own veins a solution of methylene diphosphate, containing radioactive technetium 99m, a radioisotope with a short half life. The radiation from the technetium atoms produced gamma rays, which could be detected by the VP8 Image Analysing Computer. Dr Accetta produced an image on the VP8 computer similar, but with less definition, than the Shroud image. Any credible naturalistic image formation process needs to explain: relatively uniform intensity of both frontal and dorsal images; the relatively high resolution of the pixels making up the image; the 3 dimensional properties of the image; its orthogonal projection on to the cloth with minimal lateral distortion, and absence of lateral aspects, despite any wrapping of the body.

His writings are utterly devoid of any scrap of evidence that he might offer in support of his case. The theologians he claims to have consulted are not named, nor is his alleged artist, nor any quote from Bishop Henri. There is no paint on the Shroud, and there’s no good reason to suppose there ever was any.

By this time the Lirey church was in a state of disrepair, and unsuitable to house the Shroud. What is curious is that the canons should set so much store by what was alleged to be a forgery, that they themselves issued an excommunication, and it only required a cash settlement to appease them and to lift it. So who are the ones demonstrating cupidity in this matter? Margaret seems to be the one practising a religious duty to ensure the safety of this relic, by delivering it to the House of Savoy which kept it safe for 500 years! The chateau of Varambon with which she was compensated, had already been in the Palud family for several generations, the family of her nearest relation, her nephew the flamboyant Francis de Palud. As for Bishop D’Arcis declaring the shroud a “fake”, each and every occupant of the See of Rome since the time of Pope Pius XI has made it clear enough that they personally considered it to be the authentic burial cloth of Christ!

A predecessor of Pius XI, Pope Pius X, was noted for his encyclical attacking “Modernism”, a course that both Chevalier and Thurston seem to have been headed. Pius XI seems to have been persuaded of the Shroud’s authenticity, by Pia’s photography and the work of Barbet. On the date of bailli Jean de Venderesse unsuccessful visit to Lirey to seize the Shroud on 15 August 1389, his bailli colleague, Geoffrey II de Charnay was assisting King Charles VI in Paris with preparations for a five day nuptial celebration by a tourney marking the arrival of his soon to be queen, Isabel of Bavaria. Soon after, the king’s entire retinue set off on a royal tour first to Burgundy, and then to Avignon where they were entertained by Pope Clement VII. Clement was formerly known as Robert of Geneva, his father being a cousin of Aimon of Geneva, the step father of Geoffrey II. If anyone knew anything about the true origins of the Shroud, it seems quite likely that Clement might well have been privy to it, with the presence of both Charles VI and Geoffrey II in Avignon when D’Arcis was raising his objections. On 5 January 1390, Clement sent a letter to D’Arcis to keep silent about the Shroud under threat of excommunication. On the same date, Clement also sent a letter to Geoffrey II stating that he could continue to hold the Shroud expositions, but he should limit the lavishness of the ceremonial. There was then no mention that Geoffrey was required to describe the Shroud as a “figure or representation of Jesus’ shroud”. Conceivably if he had access to the papal archives, Clement may even known or heard about the Greek Patriarch’s complaint to an earlier Pope that Frankish crusaders had pillaged the sacred burial cloths from Constantinople. Clement was clearly not persuaded by D’Arcis’ objections, and his actions in the matter seem to be those of a shrewd pontiff responding to a tricky situation, the advice from his legate, and aware that if the Shroud was in fact authentic, it might possibly prompt an adverse reaction from Constantinople. For the next 500 years, the expositions were essentially a Savoy affair, and it was only with the results of the photography in 1898, that the Shroud attracted the interest raised during the 20th century..","date":"2015-05-11","mins":"3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/09/colin-berry-has-it-all-figured-out-sort-of-maybe/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Has It All Figured Out, Sort Of, Maybe"},{"id":"comment-198904","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"An example of how it is possible to confine oneself merely to citing documents and yet come to an incorrect conclusion!

Despite the royal signature, it is quite likely the king never saw nor noticed it, but it was merely in a sheaf of routine papers for his signature. The reference “… a certain cloth hand made and artificially depicted cloth (etc)” has no more status than the assertion that it is the substance of his complaint. After the death of Geoffrey II, ownership of the Shroud rightfully passed to his daughter Margaret de Charney, not the Lirey canons. It might be thought presumptive of her husband Humbert to sign a document agreeing to return it. After his demise, she clearly asserted what she considered her rights of ownership. Despite all the assertions that the cloth was painted, we now know that the cloth was never painted, was never touched by any paint brush, nor ever near any artist’s palette, notwithstanding recent specious hypotheses.

That is not exactly correct. The Fanti Malfi designed Cyclic Loads machine provides persuasive evidence that the TS dates to within 400 years of the first century. The dating is necessarily coarse, as age is not the only variable determining the physical properties measured. Other effective variables include environmental, such as humidity and temperature, as well as subsequent history such as folding, storage and exposure, as well as extreme events such as fire. Some of these variables can be partially but not completely obviated by careful examination and preselection of samples to ensure that they are indeed representative, and by normalisation of the measurements to standard conditions. Calibration was achieved in 350 loading unloading stress cycles of 85 different flax fibres from 12 different modern and ancient fabrics of known provenance dating back to more than 5000 years ago. Of the five parameters tested, none fell below a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.90, satisfying the test for significance. Some 8 fibres from the TS obtained in 1978 were selected for testing as being suitable candidates for testing and as not being affected by extremes of damage. The testing placed the age of the TS as 400 AD, +/ 400 years. A first century date would therefore be admissible by this method. Clearly a 14th century or other medieval date would not be admissible. By way of contrast, the 1988 C 14 radiocarbon testing was only carried out on a single sample of highly doubtful representative value in respect of the whole fabric. The pollen sampling carried out by various investigators, Frei, Danin and others has been subject to much critical evaluation, notably by Hugh Farey in his recent BSTS article. However even in the case of the Farey article it was apparent that there remained pollen residuals of exclusively Jerusalem origin. The flight distance Tel Aviv to Paris is some 2022 miles (3254 km) across the Anatolian mountains and Swiss Alps, which is a little too far for wind blown pollen to reach the village of Lirey in eastern France. The only paint flakes found by the STURP team were attributed to contamination by painted copies brought into contact with the TS in various kinds of “contagious sanctification” rituals, or from flakes falling on it from old frescoes in the rooms where it had been stored. No residuals of paint were found between the fibres as original material indicating that it had ever been painted. The calcium cabonate made much of in the Charles Freeman gesso hypothesis, is easily attributed to the retting process acquired during linen extraction along with the iron and strontium contamination. Such scientific evidence as there is, makes a better case for a 1st century Jerusalem provenance than it can for a 14th century Franco German provenance, for which latter no significant scientific evidence has been proffered at all, or is at least easily disposed of..","date":"2014-11-09","mins":"8:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/colin-berry-wants-feedback/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Wants Feedback"},{"id":"comment-200759","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Some three years ago when Colin first embarked on his kitchen experiments, in those far off days it was then a scorch of course, I recall that one correspondent commented that Colin would end up scientifically proving the resurrection.

In the ancient world, slaves were counted as little value and were often whipped to death. In the American south, slaves were considered more valuable, and punishments inflicted were less severe and more seldom fatal. Beginning in 1948, British courts were restricted in prescribing whipping for most offences, but it continued in Delaware until 1972 for which whipping was prescribed for some 25 different offences. The lash, or cat o’ nine tails was a particularly severe instrument. Possibly the nastiest one was the Russian knout, dried and hardened rawhide thongs interwoven with wires, hooked and sharpened so as to tear the flesh. The Roman instrument was of course the flagrum. Scourging was a usual preliminary to crucifixion, and in order to carry out the court’s sentence, the victim had to be left with sufficient strength to carry at least the cross beam to his place of execution, so presumably this would serve as some control on the severity of the beating. Vignon, Barbet and others since have analysed the traces on the Shroud. Barbet made the point that only those blows which penetrated the skin have left their mark, while those which resulted only in bruising did not. Correspondents may be familiar with the Faccini Fanti paper presented at the Frascati conference in 2010 on the subject. Some of their findings may be debatable and contested. However their experiments included a simulated scourging with instruments that would leave similar marks on a drum coated with both white paper and carbon paper. Their paper depicts the results of this experiment. They claim that similar marks to the TS image was obtained if both a flagrum and a “pear rod” was used in delivering the punishment. Most artistic depictions of the scourging of Christ, seem to lack a specific realism, and would seem to depend only on the diverse artists’ gruesome imaginations, although doubtless some of them would have witnessed actual whipping punishments whenever they were in vogue. A particular point is that, skin lacerations as would be produced say by the Russian knout, or the English cat, might not be the case with a controlled use of the flagrum. The Roman flagrum is known to have been used in gladiatorial contests, and presumably was not necessarily fatal, unless administered with considerable brutality..","date":"2015-05-17","mins":"5:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"id":"comment-199999","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The “simple solution” is not the solution.

This is clear from reading any authoritative text, such as “A History of Rome to AD 565” by Boak & Sinnigen, a classic on Roman history. Ordinarily the required service was sixteen campaigns in the infantry, and ten in the cavalry. This arrangement always ensured the presence of veterans in any contingent or levy. A record of at least ten campaigns was required of any candidate for public office, which assured that the army was well led and well organised. They were methodical, experienced and well conscious of military efficiency, as well as being highly mobile. A crucifixion or a flogging of some criminal was all in a day’s work and it would be done efficiently, methodically and with the end objective always in mind. The sentenced person had to be kept strong enough to carry at least the cross bar to the place of execution. Any pre punishment, such as scourging or whipping could not be inflicted so severely as to make the prisoner helpless and unable to complete this journey. He had to complete it on his own feet.

They break the skin, but it is not a severe singularly concentrated flaying of flesh and skin, despite the high number of lashes inflicted.

It may be presumed that the vast majority survived and walked to the place of crucifixion carrying at least the cross beam, not necessarily with any assistance. Scourging of Roman citizens was limited to 40 lashes. A Jewish executioner was limited to administering 40 lashes, but in practice the limit they adopted was 39 (presumably a religio safety margin on the prescribed 40). Roman scourging of non Romans could and did exceed 40. The 372 marks claimed in the Faccini Fanti paper have not been corroborated by anyone else, and all earlier investigators have said that there were between 90 and 120 marks occurring in pairs corresponding to about 60 lashes. The reference to Isaiah 1:6 was written by a Proto Isaiah, and much of his writings are more a proclamation than a prophecy reflecting the situation in 8th century Israel in the time of Hezekiah. Is 1:6: “From the sole of the foot to the head there is no sound spot in it; Just bruise and welt and oozing wound, not drained, or bandaged, or eased with salve.” It is an accusation against Israel’s wickedness, and need not be interpreted as an oracle. The Proto Isaiah has written most of chapters 1 39, with a few chapters attributed to his disciples, and are preoccupied with 8th century Israel. Deutero Isaiah include chapters 40 55, and are attributed to an anonymous poet writing towards the end of the Babylonian exile. These chapters include the servant songs, and have often been seen as oracles reflected in the New Testament understanding of the passion and glorification of Christ. Chapters 56 65, Trito Isaiah, are oracles by post exilic writers imbued with the spirit of Isaiah. The Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter illustration of the scourging of Christ is an early example of quite similar depictions of a fully scourged back as the 14th century works, but clearly does not depend on 14th century concepts of the scourging, It dates from 800 815 AD, there are close correspondences with the Shroud image, and it is known that there were close Carolingian affinities with the Byzantine court. It may suggest some familiarity with a Byzantine Shroud image which may have been known at this time. The pattern of scourge marks on the Shroud match what is known of the Roman flagrum. If the flagrum was indeed used to inflict them, then clearly they did not tear at the flesh, but in many cases they seem to have penetrated the skin. I would interpret them as a controlled preliminary punishment, and by spreading them over the whole body, there would be some assurance that the prisoner would survive, for the end sentence of crucifixion. There is no concentration of the punishment at localised areas, which might result in tearing of flesh. I should say they are what one might expect from a knowledgeable disciplined executioner, who is informed that his punishment must not result in the death of his prisoner. The distressing picture of the scourged victim provided by Max above, would indicate that it is indeed possible to inflict a severe scourging covering the entire back, and for the victim of it yet to survive, even in a seated posture..","date":"2015-05-19","mins":"4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"id":"comment-199465","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"” … a scourging covering both front and back of a body and here with 372 marks, … ” The figure of 372 is from the Fanti Faccini paper ” … 372 bloodstains can approximately be counted (159 – front, 213 – back) “. Barbet counted “more than 100, perhaps 120” in pairs, implying if there were two thongs there were 60 lashes, excluding those which left no marks. Wilson notes that the number of marks has been variously estimated from 90 to 120. Authors Fanti & Faccini do not address the discrepancy between their figure and those from the earlier investigators. “… note how these all over scourge marks show the integration of this verse (Isaiah 1:6) into fourteenth century iconography ,.e.g in the Holkham Bible illustrations and the Rottgen Pieta among many other similar examples. The 14th century iconography would also seem to match the first known showing of the Shroud at Lirey in 1355 ! The remarkable coincidence between the description of Isaiah’s “suffering servant” or “man of sorrows”, and the gospel accounts of the punishment inflicted on Jesus, was noted by biblical exegetes well before the Shroud ever came to light. It is difficult to escape a conclusion that the author of Isaiah was somehow privy to a special divine revelation, a true prophesy. The marks on the Shroud not only match Isaiah’s description, but these were the punishments actually inflicted on Jesus as described by the authors of the gospels, and made manifest on the Shroud. “An artist could do it – a scourger ?????” Agreed, an undisciplined out of control sadist scourger might not.

From the blood flows on the arms, Barbet calculates that the crucified arms were at about 65 degrees to the vertical. He counted 100 to 120 visible dumbell shaped scourge wounds inflicted by the two thonged Roman flagrum, implying about 60 visible lashes, and inflicted by two executioners, the taller one standing to the right and the shorter to the left. This may account for any symmetry of the wounds lower down on the buttocks. Only blows that pierced the skin and caused bleeding are visible. Blows that would cause bruising only would not be so visible. I don’t know about any blood pooling at the lower back, Barbet doesn’t mention it, and it’s not evident to me, but you may be correct, I’m not sure. Perhaps someone else can comment. Barbet claims the scourging was inflicted with the victim being bound to a post, facing it, and with his arms above his head, as there are no scourge marks on the arms. However one of the executioners had a trick of using the flagrum so that it whipped around and also inflicted wounds to the front of the legs. Barbet himself was a highly experienced pathologist, and had conducted several experiments with recent cadavers and amputated limbs, to check his findings.

Being a Highly Serendipitous Theory, it has several elements to it outlined as follows: 1. It is a matter of sound Christian Doctrine that Christ’s body after his death was transformed to a resurrected body. Now a body comprises various biological cells. However these cells are rejuvenated by the ingestion of food and other nourishment, not part of the body, and old cells are disposed of by the process of digestion and are ejected in the normal way. Clearly these old cells are also no longer part of the body, and therefore we cannot expect that they would have been part of the resurrection process, and their residues would have been left behind. 2. One of the products that are expelled include significant quantities of methane gas, a highly inflammable compound. The human and animal expulsion of methane is a major factor in global warming, and is addressed in those forums such as KYOTO protocols. It is a major consideration in NZ where there are some 40 million sheep for instance. In sewerage plants, the amount of methane is quite enough to be used as a fuel for the various pumps, lighting generators and other machinery to make the plant energy consumption self sufficient. 3. In the Catholic Epistle of I Peter 3:18 19, we are told that Christ, having been put to death, that “in the SPIRIT, He went to preach to the spirits in prison”, that is to those who had already died, or in other words some abode of Hell. This found expression in the Apostolicum – the Apostles’ Creed – of about 200 AD, “descendit ad inferna, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis”. 4. Now we know that Hell is a very hot place, with fiery elements, sufficient to act as an ignition aource to any methane that might be hanging about. Clearly as Christ returned from “inferna” to attend to the business of resurrection, this is what happened. 5. Dr Berry by his own experimental research has succeeded in convincing himself that the Shroud image is a scorch. He claims that scorching of linen can have the effect of imparting 3 dimensional information, as shown on the Shroud, that the scorching can be superficial, as shown by examination of the linen fibrils. And it is now apparent what the source of the scorching was. 6.The elements of serendipity are as follows: (a) It affirms the CB theory of scorching; (b) It affirms the canonicity of I Peter, and the Apostolicum; (c) It affirms the doctine of two natures – divine because he was resurrected – he was also human in that he expelled methane (in a word, he farted) (d) it provides a coherent explanation of image formation on the burial cloths (e) The incineration cleaned up the mess left by any residual sewage, not part of the resurrected body. 7. The significance of the acronym HSTTSSH is now plain. This is the euphonious assonance of the escaping gases. I knew all along that the idea of a metal template was crazy. The HSTTSSH is a far more credible explanation..","date":"2013-02-17","mins":"4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/16/colin-berrys-big-day-tomorrow/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry’s Big Day Tomorrow"},{"id":"comment-91658","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If David Onysko has been following this blog site any time at all over the last few years he might have noted that I am informed as well as anyone on what was and what was not achieved by STURP. I also happen to be aware of how the team came together, how it was funded, who the participants were, what equipment they used, and the particular difficulties they encountered. I regret that I have never had the opportunity to meet any of them personally. I am also apprised of what other studies have been carried out, from the time of Paul Vignon, Pierre Barbet, various other pioneers, the secret Turin Commission of Cardinal Pellegrino 1969 73, and have been an avid follower of many subsequent developments, researches and studies since. I have a computer file of about 1 GB on various research papers and other material, although perhaps a modest size compared to those of a few others. It has been said that the Shroud of Turin is the most intensely studied object in human history. Others have said it is also the most badly studied object in human history. The STURP team went in blind, not knowing what they would find, and some have said with too limited an agenda. But that was in 1978, some 36 years ago. The Science has moved on, and there are now techniques available which STURP could then only dream about. Nevertheless there remain other approaches, other experiments which do not require direct access to the relic itself. There has been too little experimentation and few attempts to discover how a dead body might leave an image on a particular type of linen cloth. Ray Rogers succeeded in colouring Edgerton bleached linen treated with dextrin and saponaria, by a 10 minute exposure to ammonia. Giovanna De Liso obtained some success during her 12 years of experiments in a seismic environment. These experiments have had insufficient follow up and further development. Instead, researchers are fiddling with excimer lasers, and scorching kitchen tea towels. A concerted programme of research is required, but it needs a source of funds, dedicated and multi disciplined research scientists, and carefully designed experiments. God given human rationality demands that naturalistic explanations be reasonably well exhausted before resorting to premature claims of the supernatural and miraculous.

The TS man shows no such signs of corruption, and it is a long stretch to see how this latest event can be relevant to the TS case. This latest image seems to been caused by leakage of putrescent body fluids, and it is hard to see how the two cases can be connected, as the cause of imaging would seem to be quite different in the two cases. Clearly the TS image has not been caused by any noticable corruption effect. I am firmly of the opinion that until sufficient experimentation has been carried out with recently dead bodies and which can successfully demonstrate imaging with similar properties as the TS image, then it will continue to remain an unresolved enigma. I suspect that the latest case of this unfortunate 71 year old man leaving a pattern of his bodily fluids on a carpet may add little to our understanding of TS image formation.

Only Mary Magdalen was able to say that ‘I know my Redeemer liveth’ with certain knowledge because she had seen him. The rest of us can only accept it as a matter of faith.

One good reason why we cannot explain the image, is not because that it is necessarily miraculous, but because there really has not been sufficient research carried out on this particular phenomenon. It is rational to explore naturalistic explanations before resorting to claims of miracles. This has yet to be done, despite the various attempts already made. One good reason why there has not been the research neccesary, is that the object is a rare and carefully guarded relic which is rightly taken to be precious, and very likely sacred, and so access to it is made difficult.

Much of the early church was Hellenist or Syriac and would not have had the same traditional aversion to cultic objects as Jewish Christians. Until about 380 AD in Rome, Christian burials were in the catacombs. These are decorated with early Christian art works from earlier centuries. The catacombs of Commodilla include the earliest known portrayal of a bearded Christ. The present compulsory liturgical practice of an altar stone containing holy relics, dates from the times of using the tombs of the martyrs as a type of altar to celebrate secretly the liturgy of the Eucharist there. Not long after 326 AD St Helena made her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and it is evident that early writers saw it as a recovery of the primitive relics of Christianity. They were put to the practical use of lending a type of “heavenly mandate” to the Byzantine imperial dynasty, Constantine putting one of the crucifixion nails into his helmet, and making a bridle for his horse out of another, clearly as talismans. The various tales concerning the Image of Edessa and the Image of Camuliana testify to an interest in cloths deemed to have had contact with Christ and leaving an image, some said to be made not by human hands, much of this interest dating from well before the sixth century. There are references to the burial cloths in various other early writings, including the Gospel to the Hebrews, apocryphal and pseud epigrapha, as well as other testimonies. There could have been no iconoclastic movement without at least an underlying folk interest in such holy objects.

The original of the Doctrine of Addai, and subsequent redactions with its alleged imprint of Jesus, dates from about 200 AD. Markwardt makes some interesting comments on the enigmatic Inscription of Abercius, which may be interpreted as a journey for the baptism of the court of Abgar VIII. From the inscription one might adduce that Abercius may have had temporary custody of the Shroud for this purpose. The contemporary Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl may also be significant and relevant.

In January 1959, Pope John XXIII announced his intention to summon a General Council, and this December 2015, will see the 50th anniversary of it being brought to fruition with its formal closure on December 7, 1965. It heralded a new era of openness for the People of God, but it still seems that a few of us yet need to catch up. Significant documents relating to the discussion above include: Lumen Gentium, Constitution of the Church, particularly the all inclusive chapter 2 as to who comprise the People of God; the Decree on Ecumenism, Unitatis Redintegratio; Relationship of the Church to Non Christian Religions, Nostra Aetate; and the Declaration on Religious Freedom, Dignitatis Humanae. It ought to be enlightening for the combatants in the above discussion to revisit and reread these important documents. Perhaps they may thus be able to refresh their perspectives on the place and need for dialogue with others of different persuasions. In the United Kingdom, Western Europe, the United States, and several countries enjoying a British heritage (Australia, New Zealand, Canada), Religious Freedom is now too easily taken for granted. However even in those places it is a comparatively recent innovation, not much older than the 20th century, and even so it remains vulnerable and is frequently threatened by hostile forces. In many other countries it is utterly unknown, and the concept is unfamiliar to their traditions. The world is rapidly evolving into societies of religious pluralism, and we need to learn how we may cope with this diversity of belief, and yet continue in our attempts to live peaceably with one another. The alternative is unthinkable. During his recent trip to Turin, Pope Francis with his visit to family in the Po Valley made a point of also visiting the Waldensian communities there. His efforts at reaching out to other religious communities gives an example that ought to be emulated at the grass roots. The recent conference at Hampshire would seem to have offered such an opportunity of dialogue with a particular non christian group, and it would seem that attendance by some Christians there was entirely appropriate and in accord with the principles of dialogue, ecumenism and expressions of religious freedom enjoined by the Council and by Pope Francis..","date":"2015-09-20","mins":"4:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"id":"comment-20187","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Radiation pulses were ~300nm and 193nm, comparable to the depth of penetration!.","date":"2012-12-11","mins":"3:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/10/enea-magazine-special-edition-new-paper-on-shroud-of-turin-conservation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"ENEA Magazine Special Edition: New Paper on Shroud of Turin Conservation"},{"id":"comment-20246","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick, this is a very clear posting, and it seems highly likely from what you quote from Rogers, that the image is on the impurity layer.

I am unaware of any papal approval of the doctrinal “contentions of the Waldensians”, a 12th century sect which later modeled its doctrines on a type of Swiss Protestantism. In June, Pope Francis became the first pontiff to visit a Waldensian evangelical church, not to commend their doctrines, but to seek their forgiveness of his church’s historic brutal persecutions of their members. Likewise, regardless of what beliefs the Ahmadiyah sect of Islam might hold, it is unlikely that any pontiff would subscribe to them, but he might well seek dialogue with those who in accordance with the teachings of Lumen Gentium, honestly seek God according to what they believe. Earlier this evening, a newscast noted that Pope Francis spent some 40 cordial minutes with a frail and elderly Fidel Castro, the revolutionary communist leader who persecuted religion, isolated Cuba from the rest of the western hemisphere, and almost brought global catastrophe with the threat of nuclear war during the Bay of Pigs incident. This coming Wednesday, Francis will visit the USA, no doubt with a message concerning that nation’s capitalist dominance, and I wonder if he will be received as cordially as he was in Cuba.

Viewing these stereos gave the effect of being suspended several hundred feet above the terrain, and could almost be vertigo inducing. The effect works by parallax, photographs of the same terrain viewed from different positions along the flight path. Each eye views a single photograph, and the brain does the rest giving a visual 3 D impression. Binoculars create s similar effect on real 3 D objects by a virtual stretching of the base line between the eyes. The 3 D imaging of the VP 8 analyser seems to work in a different way. There is only one original image, but as I understand it, the 3 D is encoded by variations in brightness. It would seem that the 3 D holograms of the VP8 Shroud image have been somehow backwards coded to give the two stereoscopic pairs necessary to create the effect when the two related images are viewed. One question might be how well the two stereoscopic pairs have been derived from the original hologram object. This might account for some of the peculiarities reported in the comments.

I knew him to be a determinist of the first order, but then he did not have the advantage of knowing about the quantum. There is an apocryphal story that when Napoleon asked him why God did not appear in his work on the system of the universe that Laplace had replied “Ah sir, I had no need of that hypothesis!” But apparently the hypothesis referred to was Isaac Newton’s assertion that God sometimes needed to intervene to restore the system’s stability as Newton had not analysed the system so well as had Laplace. At his approaching death, Laplace had demanded that the anecdote be removed from his biography, but the publishers decided otherwise, and so it passed into mythology. It seems that in real life Laplace had wavered between atheism and deism. In 1809 he had written to his son, “I pray that God watches over your days. Let Him be always present to your mind, as also your father and your mother.” There is an enduring view that he died an agnostic, albeit with the last rites of the church, but his actual views on religion remain too ambiguous to be certain. The Wikipedia article is most enlightening as it deals with the question of God’s intervention, and a celebrated scientist’s thoughts and views on the place of God in science. Check the sections on “Political Philosophy” and “Religious Opinions” at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre Simon Laplace When it comes to the debate as to whether the Shroud image is naturalistic or miraculous, I am open to either view. Nor do I agree with Hugh’s assertion that if it is miraculous, then we can forget physics. I do not think it is quite so easy. It too readily forgets the Christian doctrine that all Creation is necessarily of God. At the risk of an anthropomorphism, “Who can read the mind of God?” God may tailor a situation how He will. He may well tailor a natural situation to his own purposes, exploiting the properties of His creation to suit His own purposes.

You are clearly certain the image is a scorch. You therefore seem to have ruled out any other kind of natural process that might result in a human corpse generating the image, say by some kind of as yet unknown photo sensitive action. I think the problem that most of us have with that concept, is that we cannot conceive that anyone in medieval times, would be capable of constructing any kind of sculptural model, with all the accurate forensic evidence we now know the image contains. This leaves aside the unlikelihood that anyone would be sufficiently motivated to construct such a bizarre model. I think we know that a human corpse could not reach the temperatures required for a scorch without considerable evidence of heating damage to its features. There is none! If you are successful in demonstrating that the cloth image is caused by a scorch, and we know that this cannot have been any natural process, there is only one conclusion possible.

I suspect he might well be correct in saying that it couldn’t be radiation, as radiation would give a more pervasive result extending to other fibres, and beyond the crowns. However, Rogers was insistent that it wasn’t a scorch, as the blood could not have been heated. The apparent lack of chemical residues, I take to mean refers to the absence of any foreign material applied to the linen, and not byproducts from whatever happened to the linen (oxidation?). I feel that little headway will be made as long as the assumption of a fraudster at work is maintained. The forensic evidence argues too strongly against it. I have to reject the template hypothesis. I think we must look for some other contact process being involved, if it indeed it was some kind of natural process. I’ve made the observation elsewhere that pressed dried flora will leave an image on paper after a period of time. I wonder what that process is, I don’t think its mere absorption. I can’t help feeling that somehow there must be some kind of photon exchange between the object and the linen, but I’m starting to get out of my depth. Whatever it was, it didn’t leave a lateral image. Was the linen somehow photo sensitized during the wrapping process. 100 pounds of a myrrhic aleotic mixture sounds fairly potent?

I can take the point that the image is not that of a risen glorified Christ, but is of a very dead body at a particular moment of time. I see the only evidence of resurrection as being that: Here we have what appears to be a genuine burial cloth, withour a body, yet with an image of an uncorrupted body that had to be formed within 48 hours of death. The body could not have been removed by manual means, as otherwise there would be evidence of smearing and tearing because of the glutinous substances on the cloth (e.g. Myrrh). That is adequate enough evidence for me personally. We do not know if it is a normal process or not, as in other cases, any such image would probably disappear as a result of the chemistry of the corruption processes. The most successful attempts at forming an image by experimental processes to date are 12 years of experiments by Giovanna De Liso in connection with seismic events, probably associated with the concurrent release of mildly radioactive radon gas. “Shroud like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010.

It will add to our knowledge and understanding of the image, albeit in a negative way. Some other process must be sought if a naturalistic explanation is to be obtained. We may not conclude by such negative evidence that the image is necessarily a consequence of the Resurrection, There may be some other naturalistic explanation: a current candidate explanation, one that has yet to be thought of, or a process as yet unknown to science. I do not understand the Jos Verhulst comment: “there is no reason why this unique image should happen to be the image of Christ”. Certainly thousands of Jews were sent to their death by crucifixion during the Roman period, about 3000 following the death of Herod the Great, and several more around 70 AD, and doubtless countless others. However on the assumption that the Shroud is of authentic 1st C provenance, there is considerable evidence that the TSM is indeed Jesus Christ. All the wounds match the gospel accounts of his suffering and death. But the clincher is the scalp wounds caused by the crown (cap) of thorns, inflicted by the whim of a Roman soldier in response to the purported charge the “King of the Jews”. This was not a standard or even occasional punishment, and Jesus Christ is the only crucifixion victim known to have been so capped. Even the arch sceptic Thurston has said of the image, “Of the identity of the victim there can be no doubt. If it is not Christ then it was intended to be his likeness.” As far as proof of resurrection is concerned, this is provided by the fact of the image, rather than its unknown cause: the fact that it is of a crucifixion victim, showing no corruption, so that the image was formed within 36 hours after death, and then image formation ceased. If there had been no resurrection, then we might expect that the process would have continued, probably showing signs of corruption, and even blurring of the image, Deliberate removal of the body from its burial cloths at this stage is too incredible to contemplate. The references to the upper side of the body versus the lower side beg the question that the body was in fact lying on its back. We cannot know this, and the no flattening of the buttocks area may suggest that it was in fact lying on its side. I concur with Jos Verhulst, that any naturalistic explanation must account for the clarity of the image, its relatively high visual resolution, its evenness, and I must say the fact that it shows an orthogonal aspect on the cloth, with no lateral distortion nor images of the sides. I will also agree that these requirements make a naturalistic explanation extremely difficult to conceive, but that is not to say impossible..","date":"2012-09-19","mins":"4:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/18/latest-on-david-rolfes-site-on-maillard-reaction/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Latest on David Rolfe’s Site on Maillard Reaction"},{"id":"comment-16556","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I’m only open to the possibility.

It has also been suggested that the unusually heavily traumatised body of the TSM would actually have a higher temperature than its surroundings, more so than would be the case with only a moderately traumatised body. But as Helmut points out, the limbs would lose their temperature faster than the trunk, and the resulting intensity of the image would vary across the cloth, not what we see. The dorsal image is pretty well as distinct as the frontal image, and the buttocks are not flattened by the weight of the body. Max Patrick Hamon claims to explain this by asserting that the body was lying on its side. We then have a problem with the flow of the gases. Because of the fairly high resolution of the image and its orthogonality on the cloth, some envisage that the body is lying on its back and with the higher temperature of the body, the gases flow vertically upward. But this would not explain the clarity of the dorsal image. Inconsistency builds on inconsistency. We do not even know if Maillard is capable of producing a distinct image. The Jospice mattress image was said by Fr Francis O’Leary to have been formed on a nylon (not linen) mattress cloth through a sheet and a thin polyurethane cover, together with pillow and pillow slips, possibly a pyjama top. But possibly O’Leary may have been misinformed about this and perhaps Les (the corpse) had been left lying on a bare mattress by a busy and overworked hospice staff. Note that the Jospice image is a dorsal image, and Les had not been a traumatised victim as was TSM. But we have to start somewhere, and Dennis Mannix’ proposal is probably as good as can be done at this stage. But then there is a much longer road ahead to pursue varying all the parameters.

No one’s noticed any such residue signature so far. 4) Process will necessary take some finite time, so perhaps a heat process would affect subject and its appearance with consequent distorted image on cloth, but no such distortion appears on TSM (no “corruption” evident). 5) Maybe it’s not a scorch but something else, so that you could still be on to something. 6) It might not be quicklime, but it could still be alkali from body products or even Max’s red heifer ash. 7) You’re looking for lots of heat, but if only impurities layer is affected, maybe you don’t need the same heat as is necessary to scorch linen (image is said to be resident only on crowns of fibres).

As I’ve often mentioned previously on this blog, the most successful attempts to produce credible images that I know of are by Giovanna De Liso working for 12 years in the seismically active area of Piedmont. Earthquakes release a heavy, mildly radioactive, chemically inert gas, radon, and possibly the radioactivity of radon is needed for Maillard to produce an image. Recall that the gospel accounts relate that an earthquake occurred immediately after the crucifixion. I have yet to be persuaded that Maillard is indeed the answer, although Barrie claims he saw signs of similarity at the microscopic level. The only way that Maillard can be conclusively proven or disproven to my way of thinking, is to run an experiment with several traumatised lab rats or other small animals, with a full range of controlled environmental variables. The question of how the linen has been processed and treated also needs to conform with the ancient method.

Padre Pio’s image of his face on a handkerchief is unlikely to have much to do with the Shroud image unless both occurred as divinely directed miracles. Louis may believe that the Shroud image was such a miracle, and this may be correct. However others prefer to explore scientific explanations first, if only to exclude them before coming to such a conclusion. His comment that De Liso’s work can only apply if the Shroud is a forgery is in fact what makes no sense at all. Are we to expect that a medieval forger would be aware that seismic events had the potential to create such images, and then would wait several years before exactly the right conditions came along before he could produce such an image? It is preposterous. De Liso’s experimental work only followed on from a theoretical hypothesis by Lattarulo, and until then no one had even considered the possibility of a seismic origin of the image. Her work was directed at ascertaining the possibility of a naturalistic explanation of the origin of an image within a 1st century tomb, not at whether the idea might have occurred to a medieval forger. She makes the explicit point that such imagery was only ever obtained under certain very specific conditions and was not merely the usual expected product of every general seismic event during her 12 years of field experiments. It may just be conceivable that such imagery might have occurred with dozens of burial cloths in 1st century Jerusalem, but by the time anyone ever thought to unwrap a shroud to place the bones in an ossuary, any such imagery would have been long defaced by corruption. This could not happen with the Shroud of Jesus, because of the fact of his resurrection, and a decision to vacate his linen wrapping within days of his death. All four gospels mention an earthquake following the crucifixion, Matthew even attributing an after shock to the moving of the entrance stone. This suggests that it was a real event and not merely a literary device of the evangelists. A critic would see some shortcomings and unfortunate omissions in De Liso’s paper, and there is much more about her experiments that would be good to know. Unfortunately, there seems to have been little follow up or development of her work, and those who may have been associated with it seem to have gone off on tangents with their lasers, corona discharges, bodily emission of neutrons and other miraculist theories. As wise men have often observed, it is the most difficult thing in the world to get a new idea accepted, and the pedestrian preference is to cling to familiar paths even when well worn or else to venture into the speculative or outlandish. Such seems to be the case with the apparent lack of follow up to De Liso’s seismic investigations into Shroud like imagery.

Much as I might be tempted to respond in kind, no difficult task, I prefer to refrain from doing so.

That was when I had to tell him what he was doing.” Louis, Nov 16, 8:06 am above. I certainly had no cause to rehash any such of his comments, but the technical aspect is far more complex. Thus Encyclopedia Britannica for instance notes that in may ways, Matthew’s is the most Jewish of the gospels, but it identifies the target audience as Greek speaking gentile Christians. Thus on the gospel’s origin: “The Gospel grew out of a “school” led by a man with considerable knowledge of Jewish ways of teaching and interpretation. This is suggested by the many ways in which Matthew is related to Judaism. It is in some ways the most “Jewish” Gospel. Striking are 11 “formula quotations” (“This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet. . .”) claiming the fulfilment of Old Testament messianic prophecies.” (Etc) However on the Matthean church it comments: “Matthew is not only an original Greek document, but its addressees are Greek speaking Gentile Christians. By the time of the Gospel According to Matthew, there had been a relatively smooth and mild transition into a Gentile Christian milieu. The setting could be Syria, but hardly Antioch, where the Pauline mission had sharpened the theological issues far beyond what seems to be the case in Matthew.” … … “For Matthew, there had already been a separation of Christianity from its Jewish matrix. When he speaks about the “scribes and the Pharisees,” he thinks of the synagogue “across the street” from the now primarily Gentile church. Christianity is presented as superior to Judaism even in regard to the Law and its ethical demands.” “The Matthean church is conscious of its Jewish origins but also of a great difference in that it is permeated with an eschatological perspective, seeing itself not only as participating in the suffering of Christ (as in Mark) but also as functioning even in the face of persecution while patiently—but eagerly—awaiting the Parousia. ” Etc. This is clearly no rehash of Louis’ comments but is a particular view expressed in a highly reputable reference source. Clearly also, not all Biblical scholars might agree with this particular view. For them they may consider it is indeed addressed to a church of Jewish Christians, because of the Jewish flavour of the text. But that does not seem to be the view of the majority. Biblical scholarship is a hotly debated discipline, even among the best of its scholars. So clearly discerning unanimity is a difficult matter. It is certainly more complex than Louis might prefer to believe. His persistent obsessive carping against myself I shall let pass, considering it for the most part to be trivia, preferring instead to deal with issues rather than personalities.

I can readily understand the reason why the thumb will not be imaged in your contact experiment for the back of the hand. It so happens that this peculiarity of the wrist is well known to lawn bowlers, as they need to be aware of it to obtain accuracy in bowling to their chosen line. There is a natural limit to how far the hand can be twisted outwards, but inwardly no problem. In a good image of the Shroud (e.g. Shroud 2) there is a narrow band immediately around the hands which does not seem to be imaged. The narrowest part of my wrists (back of hand to palm) is 5 cm. If I cross them one over the other, that’s 10 cm and clearly beyond the approx 4 cm which others have asserted is the range within which imaging can occur. So the fact that there’s no image around the crossed hands is to be expected. However the non imaged band is itself quite a narrow one, and the belly is certainly visible. A number of reasons have been asserted as to why the thumbs are not visible. Barbet asserted that his experiments in driving a nail through the wrist of amputated hands resulted in severing the median nerve so that the thumb reflexed into the palm. Zugibe asserted that the thumb in the palm was in its natural position anyway. So a contact only theory is not necessary for the thumb. I have mentioned elsewhere that it is pretty well impossible to obtain perfect contact between a real fabric and any object which has 3 dimensional curvature. It can only succeed to the extent that there is sufficient give or stretch in the fabric, which even for real fabrics is quite limited unless it is rubber or lycra or some such, and certainly linen is quite limited. We could only expect contact at the high points of the object. But that is not the case with the Shroud image, where there certainly seems to be a small air gap across which imaging still succeeded in occurring..","date":"2014-07-19","mins":"8:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

A brief tribute to Fr Rinaldi’s work, together with a URL ref to the article can be found at: http://johnklotz.blogspot.co.nz/2012/12/rev peter rinaldi apostle of shroud.html His article was probably responsible for arousing the first interest in USA for the relic. The suggestion of a naturalistic explanation had the advantage of removing Shroud interest from the confines of the Woowoo brigade and arousing scientific interest, with the consequence that we now know a great deal more about it than before. O.K’s suggestion that it is necessary to suspend the Laws of Thermodynamics, and that the image is as likely as a swimming pool freezing over in the summer heat, is I believe unnecessary. This is demonstrated by the fact that one De Liso has been successful in showing that it is possible for images to be formed under certain specific conditions. This then raises the possibility that images may also be formed under certain other specific conditions. If say the image is the result of some kind of gaseous diffusion process, then it is possible to conjecture that conditions might be so controlled as to produce a distinct clear image of the object, together with its 3 D information: if the flow is laminar and not diffuse; if there is a collimating influence on the molecules, such as by mild radiation or some electro magnetic effect; if image forming molecules undergo a chemical change in proportion to the path length. For the scientifically minded, I can recommend checking out some flow net theory, experiments and diagrams in any engineering undergraduate Fluid Mechanics text. I was involved in some rather convincing flow net laboratory experiments during my early engineering training. In response to Andy Weiss: My comments are to refer him to my suggestion concerning a multi variate experiment with small laboratory animals.

Prometheanism places mankind in the place of God. Hesiod relates two versions of the Greek Titan Prometheus, the supreme artisan, who tricked Zeus and stole the secret of fire. For his impudence, Zeus had Prometheus chained to a rock where an eagle ate his immortal liver which constantly replenished itself. Behind the Genesis myth of the Fall of Adam lies the serpent’s voice “You will become like gods!” Zeus’s eagle continues to chew at the liver of modern scientists, dissatisfied, laboring to unravel the secrets of the universe, to become omniscient like the deity. It chewed at the liver of Albert Einstein until his death, as he hoped to discover the logic and rationality behind the mysteries of the quantum, expecting to derive a Great Unified Theory. But it was Schrodinger’s cat who had the last word. There was no logic behind the quantum, only probabilities and the mystery of entanglement! There may be a natural explanation for the image on the Shroud. But it will only come with a much greater concerted effort that hitherto. There are two major problems hindering solution of the puzzle: that of resources, and the problem of accessibility to this major relic, protected by its guardians. A major experimental project is required. I’ve previously suggested a multi variate experiment involving small laboratory animals, with linen cloths treated in various ways, and they can be loosely draped or tightly wrapped, with and without ancient burial herbs and spices. It is not sufficient to obtain one off small ambiguous stains, or to conduct one off amateurish porcine experiments for the sake of some media sensationalism. A clear and unambigious image of a real object must be obtained to claim any kind of success. The most successful results I’m so far aware of are those of Giovanna de Liso over a 12 year period, in relation to her seismic experiments near Piedmont. But they are subject to carping criticisms and much more is required. Would the effort be worthwhile? Clearly there are animal ethical issues involved. Is it so important that an answer be found?

Nobody, not even Yannick Clement (who apparently doesn’t believe in earthquakes) has ever been able to point me to any more persuasive or successful images on linen, than those obtained by De Liso! All anyone else seems to have ever achieved are a few ambiguous stains, never a coherent image of any specific object. A major criticism against the Resurrection causing the image, (often mentioned by Yannick) is that the image is that of a very dead corpse apparently in a type of rigor mortis, NOT that of a risen glorified Christ, and NOT even in transition towards Resurrection! You may believe the Resurrection caused it if you prefer that explanation, however, such belief does not make it a necessary truth, for the simple reason that all other reasonable avenues remain unexplored. The most rigorous forum for proof of a miracle is the Vatican Causes for Saints, and they are certainly silent in this particular case. I tend to the view that it may be what can be technically called a “secondary miracle”. In a “primary miracle”, Providence intervenes to suspend the usual Laws of Nature to bring about some wondrous event, such as the otherwise unexplainable complete cure from a disease usually considered fatal. In a “secondary miracle” the Laws of Nature are not suspended, but come together in such a remarkable way, that the result is seen as an Act of Providence. It is generally thought unusual for an image to form on a burial shroud, but then nobody ever looks at such shrouds before decomposition sets in to see whether it is usual for these images to form or not. More likely, if the Shroud image does have a natural cause, then it is probably as a result of some rare combination of environmental factors which may include: temperature, humidity, ambient light, the types of burial herbs and spices, variations in the geomagnetic and electric fields, perhaps accentuated by iron bearing rocks, and just possibly the release of radioactive gases during an earthquake. Whatever the rare combination of factors might have been, perhaps it could be seen as a Providential Act. Until a concerted effort has been made, such as the multi variate experiments I’ve suggested, then natural causes cannot be ruled out, even if they are the result or coming together of some rare serendipity, perhaps an Act of Providence..","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"7:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/30/of-inexplicable-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of inexplicable explanations"},{"id":"comment-27996","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Back to the topic and questions of the original posting – interaction of the supernatural and our universe.

A reasonably equipped lab ought to be able to set up a program of small scale experiments to test Rogers’ theory.

The absence of a lateral image has to be significant, Despite Max’s views on the matter, it looks to me that if Rogers was correct, then the burial work couldn’t have been fully completed according to the prescribed ritual, and the cloth would have to be left loose at the sides without tying. Perhaps they intended to finish the job on Sunday morning, but by then it was too late. If some of the 100 lb mixture that Nicodemus brought was laid over the top of the partly wrapped body, I wonder if that small pressure might just provide the right sort of close mixing of the body chemicals with the starch/saccharides.

Because of the disposition of the imaged object and the cloth, the Shroud has acted essentially as a mirror. It is certainly easier to realise this in a contact process analogy, but the same image reversal would occur even with action at a distance, as indeed occurs with a mirror. I was able to give a simple demonstration of this property to a small audience last March, using the simple props of a towel, some cut out patterns of red cloth emulating blood stains and some velcro spots attached to the towel. Positioning the “stains” in the appropriate places on my body and attaching them to the towel, it became clear that everything became reversed. Colin has made the further point that the strongest imaging is likely to occur for body areas closest to the cloth, while more distant areas will not be imaged so readily, hence we also obtain the light dark reversal as well. The notion that the image is caused by sweat is very ancient. It is contained or implied in various versions of the Abgar legend, and the Catholic Encyclopedia in commenting on the Veronica legend acknowledges that the Abgar story is likely the source of the Veronica story. It would seem that legends attached to the Image of Edessa were projected onto its various copies so it seems there was no shortage of images said to be “made not by human hands”. The notion that sweat caused the image is echoed in the record of the viewing of the Mandylion by Constantine Porphyrogennetos and the Lecapeni. It also seems to have been the impression of St Francis de Sales concerning the Shroud image as quoted above. The notion that sweat caused the TS image was even postulated by Paul Vignon in his earliest theories, although he later discarded it. We see some echo of it in Ray Rogers’ imaging experiments with ammonia and even in his Maillard hypothesis. After all this, what else might be said about the negativity of the image. Perhaps not a great deal. The imaging simulations by Jumper and Jackson persuaded them to assert that the imaging could occur up to a distance of perhaps 4 cm from the cloth, and they obtained some impressive 3 D impressions as a result. The light dark reversal would still occur, but would be graduated rather than either / or, that is a one or a zero. A contact process is not an essential process for the negativity property..","date":"2014-07-31","mins":"7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/31/okay-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-used-the-word-significant/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Okay, maybe I shouldn’t have used the word ‘Significant’"},{"id":"comment-10307","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Daniel Scavone has an interesting angle on the D’Arcis memorandum in a paper he presented to the Ohio conference in 2008: BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400. Rather than Ian Wilson’s Knights Templar theory, Scavone postulates that the Burgundian Othon de la Roche, who was Seigneur of Athens from 1204, sent the Shroud to his church St Stephens in Besancon.

I cannot be sure how reliable it may be, as one of the graphics showing the legs bent at the knees, also seems to indicate that dorsal part of the cloth is lying flat at some distance from the calves; but I could be mistaken. The other is a bronze statue by Luigi Mattei: Pontifical Institute of Notre Dame of Jerusalem Centre, Jerusalem: Bronze statue by Luigi Mattei: Exhibition of the Shroud of Turin. “The most outstanding elements of our exposition are the digitalized and life sized copy of the Holy Shroud, two holograms showing the three dimensional image of the Man of the Shroud, and a bronze life sized statue of the Man of the Shroud, created by the Italian sculptor Luigi Mattei, who based his work on extensive studies of the Shroud.” http://www.notredamecenter.org/articulos/articulo.phtml?se=330&ca=769&te=578&id=13650 Both show the knees well bent. A question in my mind is, that there always seems to be an underlying assumption that the corpse was laid on its back.

I’ve always thought it curious that in Anglophone countries anyway, those who had a first degree in medecine claimed the title ‘Doctor’, and are usually referred to as ‘doctors’, whereas those of them who had qualified in surgery were given the apparently more prestigious title of ‘Mister’. With any amount of luck, we might have no further ‘ad homs’ in this posting thread anyway. The apparent absence of flattening of the buttocks on the TS image, might be explained by the image being formed while on its side. Max evidently has a theory about it being corroborated by an ‘off elbow tipped bloodstain’. We might then expect that gravity might displace the hand position from off centre but that’s not what is seen. The lack of hand displacement could be explained by body being set in rigor mortis. But that also might conceivably explain why there is no buttocks flattening. Or there would be no such flattening if the image were formed with the body suspended in mid air conceivably during the Resurrection, or else supported at the extremities by two stones. Hypotheses, speculations, theories, but sadly we lack any kind of real knowledge about the image formation process. Back to the “anthropometric analysis” by Fanti, Marinelli, Cagnazzo at the head of this posting: I would call it a brave effort, but I personally do not find it too convincing, as demonstrating that the tibia/femur ratio, for example, demonstrates that the TSM was Jewish, possibly consistent with, perhaps – but not persuasive. The reported error margins are too broad, and the tolerance ratios in the ethnic tables are not shown, nor is the source for them even cited. One reservation I have is that an error in measurement can result from a limb’s angular displacement at right angles to the cloth. It only requires an angle of 18deg, for an apparent shortening of 5%, which would skew the results. Essentially there are too many underlying assumptions that have to be made in any such analysis, to attain conclusive results.

A Synoptic gospel merely says he “bought a Shroud”, but maybe that’s just shorthand. Passover that year was very special as it fell on the sabbath, and Preparation day may well have been a public holiday, and maybe the Jerusalem market had closed early. In the afternoon the paschal lambs were already being slaughtered at the temple. One explanation might be that it was originally intended as Joseph’s own personal Shroud, which would have befitted his station. Van der Hoeven made a speculative case for it being John Mark’s temple garment that he dropped in the garden at Gethsemane; then picked up by one of the guards, and given to Pilate. When Joseph sought permission to claim the body, he was then able to reclaim it for a burial cloth. As I said, “speculative”. Alternatively, it may have been Joseph’s own temple garment. There does seem to be a problem in how such an expensive cloth could have been acquired at such short notice on that day, and why such an expensive cloth was used for that purpose.

That’s a large amount of silver to be spread on a 4m x 1m surface, and also a large amount of phosphorescent paint.

In order for a proper test of the Fanti et al hypotheses, their tests should be repeated using Edgerton type linen, and then treat it with diimide to see if they can replicate Rogers’ results.

Seismic variations in the geo magnetic and electric fields, the release of radioactive radon gas, and the presence of iron bearing rocks all seemed to have had some bearing on the matter, whenever she succeeded in obtaining an image. I know of no other natural process that has come anywhere near obtaining the successful images that she achieved, minor as they may seem. The gospel accounts all refer to seismic activity at the time of the crucifixion, and prior to the resurrection. Whatever the evangelists made of the event, I don’t believe it was intended as a mere literary device. I think it unfortunate, that apart from De Liso’s work that there appears to have been very little follow through on this aspect of the image forming process, as it may well provide the key to the answer.

Steno’s theories found considerable antagonism from the scientific establishment of his time. The only support for his views were from Gottfried Leibnitz, and the Catholic Curch was also sympathetic. The best line in the book in my view is at the end: “”The summit of Mount Everest is marine limestone.” Disillusioned by the back biting and rivalries among scientists, Steno abandoned science and turned to religion and was appointed as the Pope’s envoy to Germany and Scandinavia. Pope John Paul II beatified him in 1992, somewhat ironically on October 23 the same date that Archbishop Ussher had set for the creation of the world..","date":"2014-08-17","mins":"5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/scorched-by-god-a-hymn-for-this-sunday/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorched by God?

That was not the case with Steno’s work. Opposition to his ideas came not from the religious establishment but from contemporary men of science. Steno was Danish with a Lutheran background. His early training was as an anatomist, and he contributed major discoveries in that field including the discovery of the parotid salivary duct. In 1665 he went to Florence, where he was appointed physician to the grand duke Ferdinand II. He travelled extensively in Italy and had his first opportunity to observe the layered geology of limestone there. His seminal work on geology “De Solido …” is a pioneering milestone in the literature of geology, and laid the foundations for crystallography. In addition he proposed the revolutionary idea that fossils are the remains of ancient living organisms and that many rocks are the result of sedimentation. Steno was the first to realize that the Earth’s crust contains a chronological history of geologic events and that the history may be deciphered by careful study of the strata and fossils. He rejected the idea that mountains grow like trees, proposing instead that they are formed by alterations of the Earth’s crust. Steno put forth still another idea—that layered rocks were likely to be deposited horizontally. Therefore, even though the strata of Tuscany were (and still are) displayed in anything but simple geometries, Steno’s elucidation of these fundamental principles relating to the formation of stratified rock made it possible to work out not only superpositional relationships within rock sequences but also the relative age of each layer. The prevalent idea among eminent men of science, was the view that these fossil shells grew in the rocks, or that they were relics from Noah’s flood, certainly well into the 18th century – and their insistence that the world was only 6000 years old. What Galileo did to Aristotle’s Physics, Steno did to Galen’s Anatomy, theories we find peculiar today. Coming from the featureless landscape of Denmark, he became fascinated with the petrified shells in the mountains of Florence and the Swiss Alps. His “De Solido” outlines his theories of stratigraphy; He had promised a more comprehensive work but this does not seemed to have happened. My point is that the case of Steno is a classic instance where men of science exposed to a revolutionary idea, can themselves obstruct the propagation of truth by adherence to old fixed dogma, that this appears to be a human failing, and is certainly not an exclusive failing of religious adherents. The back biting within science is what drove Steno away from it, and to adopt an almost eremetical lifestyle. What else might he have achieved, had he found the scientific environment rather more open minded and sympathetic to his ideas?.","date":"2014-08-17","mins":"8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/scorched-by-god-a-hymn-for-this-sunday/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorched by God?

Its first documented appearance is in his 1888 book “L’atmosphère: météorologie populaire” (“The Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology”). The engraving has often, but erroneously, been referred to as a woodcut. It has been used to represent a supposedly medieval cosmology, including a flat earth bounded by a solid and opaque sky, or firmament, and also as a metaphorical illustration of either the scientific or the mystical quests for knowledge. Not all the elements of the original are clearly shown here. In particular the “wheel within a wheel” is not clear, and which seems to be a reference to a passage in Ezekiel. The pilgrim pushing his staff through the edge of the firmament may be a reference to Simplicius’ commentary on Aristotle’s Physics. Copies of the picture quite commonly appear on the covers of certain books and magazines. (2) Wilson’s narrative of the D’Arcis memorandum is not the last word on this matter. The myth of this memorandum seems to be a concoction by a liberal wing within the Catholic Church around 1905, which sought to discredit the authenticity of the Shroud, following Secondo Pia’s photography which seemed to lend support to the conservative orthodox belief that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical person, rather than merely a mythical legend. It is unlikely that the memorandum proceeded past the draft stage, and Pope Clement is unlikely ever to have seen it. If there is any truth at all in the matter, it is quite likely that the cloth the subject of the D’Arcis complaint was in fact a painted copy commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original Shroud which she rescued from the church at Besancon and kept before the church’s destruction by fire, and orginally placed there by her ancestor Othon de la Roche after plundering it from Constantinople and taking it to Athens.

Kohlbeck & Eugenia L. Nitowski, “New Evidence May Explain Image on Shroud of Turin: Chemical Tests Link Shroud to Jerusalem” Biblical Archaeology Review, vol 12 no. 4, July/August 1986, pp.18 29. The paper is apparently available at the BAR web site, if you are prepared to register on the site with a pass word. I was not, but was content to summarise the findings available from the other summary sources from the BSTS newsletter and the holyshroudguild site: http://holyshroudguild.org/ceacutesar barta.html summary by César Barta & Giorgio Bracaglia, and other well known published sources. BAR publications are apparently not necessarily peer reviewed, and like many other papers on scientific studies on the Shroud, are sometimes criticised because they lack the corroboration of such reviews. They are therefore not perfect, but I consider them to be more than merely persuasive, considering the scientific status of those involved. I described the circumstances leading up to the discovery, at my comment above on Sept 26, 6:40am. The limestone crystals were found embedded as part of the dirt around the soles of the feet image during the 1978 spectroscopy examination by Roger & Marty Gilbert, as I’ve described. Apparently at some time, similar dirt was also found at the tip of the nose and on the knee cap, as if from a fall. I am unaware if this dirt was analysed in the same way as was the foot dirt by Kohlbeck & Levi Setti. But it would be surprising if it were any different. As also noted elsewhere, Eugenia Nitowski sent some nine or so limestone samples from around Jerusalem to Kohlbeck. A close match was obtained from the limestone tomb site, including similar concentrations of iron and strontium. The matching was not exact, partly because the Shroud samples were also contaminated by flax. The spectrographs are reproduced in the Barta & Bracaglia summary on the holyshroudguild site. You would be aware that aragonite form of Ca CO3 is quite distinct from the calcite form, is rarer, and is apparently precipitated from springs. The similarity of the Fe and Sr concentrations may be considered a persuasive marker for a geographic site match compared to other possible locations of aragonite..","date":"2014-09-27","mins":"3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"id":"comment-157304","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Dirt on kneecap and nose.

Their task in 1978 was a complete spectroscopic examination of the Shroud. Anomalous readings were found under the sole of the foot image. Sam Pellicori examining the area under his microscope identified it as dirt. Subsequently it was also found at the tip of the nose and the knee cap (not the elbow). Rogers took sticky tape samples and later referred them to Dr Joseph Kohlbeck, an optical crystallographer for Hercules Aerospace in Utah. Kohlbeck noticed the limestone particles among other material on the tapes. He persuaded archaeologist Eugenia Nitowski to send him samples of limestone from Jerusalem. Kohlbeck identified the limestone as travertine aragonite, deposited from springs and is formed under much rarer conditions than ordinary calcite. Kohlbeck selected a Shroud sample from the foot as it had the greatest concentration of limestone (This sounds like more than just a single crystal). Kohlbeck identified the sample as the same aragonite as sent from Jerusalem, with the same concentrations of strontium and iron. Kohlbeck took both samples to Dr Ricrdo Levi Setti of the University of Chicago’s Enrico Fermi Institute. Levi Setti’s equipment included a then state of the art scanning ion microprobe. There was an unusually close match. Some disparity was due to flax particles embedded in the Shroud’s limestone. Ian Wilson viewed the Shroud in 1973 and also in 2000 under much more favourable conditions in clear daylight. He reports that in 2000, even with the unaided eye, significantly more dirt was clearly visible at the sole of the foot than anywhere else on the cloth, and furthermore the dirt convincingly underlay the serum haloed bloodstains that otherwise coat the same soles. It would seem that this notional artist using a gesso base, not only had the remarkable insight to give his subject dirty feet, muddy his knee cap as if from a fall, and give him a dirty nose as well, he had the prescience to select travertine aragonite for the purpose, from somewhere in Europe of a similar variety that by happenstance coincided with that at Jerusalem.

The subsequent Besançon Shroud is clearly a painting and it shows only a ventral image. Daniel Scavone in a paper with the title “The Missing Years” covering the 13th & 14th centuries, notes that Besançon in Burgundy was then a target for the German Empire, with its pro Roman pontiff sympathies. The Vergy De Charnay families were French and preferred the claims of the anti pope in Avignon. He proposes that Jeanne de Vergy rescued the Shroud from Besançon to save it for France. When St Stephen’s church was restored after the fire, the Besançon clergy sought to retrieve their Shroud, but by then there had been a succession of bishops and no one there recalled the original. Jeanne de Vergy arranged to replace it with a copy, and this may have been the basis of the confusion of Bishop Pierre D’Arcis in his complaints that the Lirey Shroud had been painted and was not the true Shroud. The theory seems to be an attractive one but cannot be supported by hard documentation, as so many church records were deliberately destroyed during the French Revolution and its Reign of Terror. “BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400” by Daniel Scavone, University of Southern Indiana, Evansville; Ohio Conference 2008.

Faith is to be based on a belief that has some rational basis, otherwise it may be classed as fanatacism. The Shroud image can provide one such basis for a rational faith, in that here is a burial cloth but without a body, and with an image that corresponds to the gospel accounts of Christ’s crucfixion, and yet with no signs of corruption.

My record of notes taken: Veronica: Father Heinrich Pfeiffer, Jesuit and Professor of Iconology and History of Christian Art at the Gregorian University of Rome, thinks the veil of Manoppello is the Roman Veronica. According to the historic reconstruction, Veronica, called “acheiropoietos”, reached Constantinople in VI century (coming from Jerusalem and then from Camelia, in Cappadocia). It stayed there until 705, when it disappeared mysteriously, perhaps to save it from the iconoclastic movements of the time. It was in Rome under Pope Gregorio; after several vicissitudes, it was carried into St Peter’s Cathedral, becoming an important destination for thousands pilgrims. After the demolition of the chapel where Veronica was held, in 1608, no trace of the veil was found. The veil appeared in Manoppello is thought to be the historic and legendary Veronica. Italian chronicler Matteo Villani reported that the Veronica was exhibited in Rome in 1350, and from Christmas to Easter there were constantly around 1 million pilgrims. So clearly it was rediscovered after its being hidden from iconoclasts in 705, assuming it was indeed the same object. Colin’s comments about attracting pilgrim tourists would seem to be to the point. Manoppello Veil: According to the tradition based on a historic account written by Father Donato from Bomba in 1640, it arrived in Manoppello on an unknown day in the year 1506, when the physicist and astrologer Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, while was talking with some people, met a foreign man. He was invited to follow him into the Church. He received a mysterious wrapped veil. He should have taken care of the mysterious object. In return he would have got material and spiritual advantages. While Father Donato was unrolling the veil, thus discovering the image of Christ, the foreign man disappeared. It might seem a reasonable conjecture then that sometime before 1608, possibly as early as 1506, the Veronica veil was uplifted from its place in the chapel, and soon afterwards disposed of in Manoppello by a person unknown, for what reasons can only be surmised. One plausible reason that occurs to me, is that the perpetrator may well have thought he was doing a holy deed and saving the relic from a corrupt papal court. The saintly Savanorola had been executed (hanged and burnt) in 1498, and the Borgia Pope Alexander VI had died only in 1503. The year of the relic’s alleged arrival in Manoppello 1506 seems suggestive. Its subsequent history is hardly edifying. Fr Donato’s 1640 chronicle continues: From 1506, the veil stayed at the Leonelli family for almost one hundred years; but in 1608 the several heirs started to contend for it. Pancrazio Petrucci, a soldier, one of the heirs’ husband (Marzia Leonelli’s husband), carried the veil away with force. Since that day the Leonelli family started falling down. Pancrazio was arrested and imprisoned in Chieti; his wife was forced to sell the precious veil to Donantonio De Fabritiis in order to free her husband. As De Fabritiis was not well, he showed the veil to the Capuchin Friars to verify the real value of the veil. The Friars were happy with that relic and put it inside a frame (today you can still see it) in order to protect the veil. In 1683 De Fabritiis gave it to the Capuchin Friars who showed the relic for the public veneration in 1646, after the notarization..","date":"2014-11-19","mins":"4:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-172126","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"N Zers are well known for pulling beyond our weight, even though we’re not all named Rutherford.

Under that scenario, the film would then develop on the outermost fibrils of the yarn, so that following weaving of the cloth, this notional film would then be evident more or less uniformly on the surface of the cloth, regardless of the final location of particular threads. However it is evident that the image is confined only to the crowns of the thread and not elsewhere, such as the valleys and interstices. In medieval times, to obtain a more uniform colour, the practice grew, particularly in the Low Countries, of postponing bleaching to after weaving of the cloth, which was then spread out in the fields to dry. Under that scenario, the evaporation would then more likely concentrate the film to be confined to the crowns. If the image resides only on a film, as postulated by Rogers, then that would tend to suggest that the whole cloth would have been bleached, rather than the hanks of yarn. Adler et al, seemed unable to detect any such film layer, and therefore postulated that the image resided on the PCW. An alternative postulate would be that the reason for image concentration on the crowns would be the result of some kind of quasi contact process. Summarising, if the image resides in a film, as postulated by Rogers, then its concentration would tend to suggest a medieval provenance; If it is on the PCW, then a kind of contact process would seem to be involved.

The de Vergy family, descendants of de la Roche had French sympathies, and Scavone makes a good case for Jeanne de Vergy rescuing the Shroud before it was lost in the fire that destroyed the cathedral, and then took it to Lirey in France, where it became part of her dowry as second wife to Geoffray de Charnay. De Charnay himself never said how the Shroud came into his possession, and the Smyrna theory has little substance. Scavone also suggests that one explanation for the infamous D’Arcy memorandum, is that when the cathedral was rebuilt, Jeanne arranged for a copy of the Shroud to be sent to Besancon to replace the original she had rescued. The relic was after all her family’s property acquired by her ancestor. D’Arcy may have mistakenly believed that the true Shroud was in Besancon, may have heard about the copy being made, and was perhaps confused by all this business. It is a difficult matter getting all the facts correct in any TV documentary, but deadlines have to be met, and as Barrie apparently commented to Dan, producers have sometimes to fall back on “creative editing”.

I should be interested to learn if any Crusader leader provided a Pope with inventories of the several relics looted from Constantinople. “…there were yawning gaps that had not been filled …”: Scavone makes it clear that this is sadly inevitable, due to the destruction of records. We can only proceed by intelligent speculation based on what evidence still remains. St Stephen’s Cathedral in Besancon was destroyed by fire in 1349. See p.13: “… local scholar Chifflet in 1624 knew nothing of Othon” – clearly the records if still surviving would have mentioned him. Concerning the destruction by French Revolutionaries in Besancon, archivist Gauthier wrote in 1901: “And when. . . The delegates of the departmental directory of Doubs threw to the fire or shredded. . . All the administrative records of the diocese over four centuries. . . This destruction. . . Reduced by about nine tenths the sources of the Archbishopric. . . . [Now] all together they form only 534 articles. . .

It rests on few assertions: 1) An earlier namesake of Geoffray de Charnay was burnt at the stake with Jaques de Molay, the last principal of the Templars; the latter Geoffray, bearer of the oriflamme, seemed keen to restore French knighthood to the former chivalrous standards of the Templars; (2) The accusations that the Templars worshipped a “head”; this was only ever admitted by Templar menials under torture who would not have been privy to the “inner circle” secrets; the inquisitors had earlier made the same accusation in their persecution of the Cathars – the “head” accusation would seem to have been intruded into the enquiries by the inquisitors themselves; 3) Barbara Frale has claimed that there was evidence in Vatican archives supporting the Templar custody of the Shroud, but seems to have ignored Ian Wilson’s requests for information to substantiate her assertions – Wilson now seems to be of the view that Frale does not have such evidence. Othon de la Roche was Burgundian, probably wth French sympathies as were his descendants. He may have seen no reason to inform the Roman Pope of his questionable acquisition, even though the Patriarch of Constantinople had written the Pope complaining of the Frankish theft. The Avignon Papacy proper was 1309 77; There followed the Great Western Schism 1378 1417. The French of course supported the Avignon anti popes. The first of these was Clement VII who enjoined on Bishop D’Arcis perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication. Maybe Clement VII knew more about the matter than history records.

In this regard, please see recent posts and comments particularly alvin/daveb, “Good Chemistry Questions” of April 15 and “Remember the Valencia Conference …” of April 16. Alvin had made the point that Ray Rogers had succeeded in removing the image coloration on a TS fibre using diimide revealing an unaffected fibre underneath. The diimide had removed the image coloration but had not affected the fibre which remained intact. Rogers was therefore convinced that the chromophore lay in the starch coating, not on the PCW. He was also persuaded by this result that any kind of radiation hypothesis could not be sustained. The further point was made that various attempts at producing coloration, whether by excimer laser, corona discharge, or scorching should therefore be carried out or repeated using Edgerton type cloth manufactured according to the ancient methods which would leave such a residual coating. If coloration of the coaing succeeded by any of these methods, then they should be treated with diimide to see whether the coloration was in fact limited to the coating, and whether the fibrils underneath remain unaffected, as was the TS sample. Rogers had succeeded in coloring a sample of Edgerton cloth treated with dextrin and saponaria, and exposing it to ammonia for about 10 minutes. Coloration was produced within 24 hours. However it is not clear whether Rogers tested his Edgerton treated sample with diimide to see if similar results were obtained as with his TS sample. Thibault may wish to attempt a few scorches using Edgerton cloth and then treating the results with diimide. He may also wish to see how any of his samples to date react with diimide.

Any admissions that they did so were by relatively lowly ranked Templars and were extracted by threatened or actual torture. One enlightening comment I became reminded of, was that the hood over the head was very likely placed there after death, probably for the portage to the tomb, as the gospel accounts refer to Jesus looking down at his mother Mary and disciple John, which would not have been so recorded if he had been hooded.

Wilson had only two main arguments for this hypothesis: a) that the Master of Normandy was an earlier namesake of Geoffray de Charny, and b) the rumours (promoted by the inquisitors) that the Templars worshipped a head. Frale picked up Wilson’s hypothesis, claimed that she had discovered supporting evidence in her archival role at the Vatican, and made press statements to that effect. She appears to have badly misrepresented what she had claimed, and was quite unable to corroborate her claims when the matter was quite properly queried by Wilson who had first originated the idea. This is not the only time that Frale has demonstrated that she is unreliable in such matters, and I am a little perplexed that anyone can think she may have anything useful to say about any topic because of such unreliability. As it happens there are now other hypotheses, with more credible support, for the so called missing years 1204 1355, involving Othon de la Roche and Jeanne de Vergy. 2) The “Sudarium of Oviedo” is widely believed to have been the “cloth over the head rolled up in a separate place by itself” referred to in John 20:7 8. As the facial image on the Shroud is no less clear than the rest of the image, it would not seem to have been included in the burial. There has been discussion on this site as to what role it may have had. One idea had been that it served to conceal the face during the crucifixion to spare passers by from witnessing the facial grimaces of the agony of the execution. However in view of the verses in John 19:25 30, it would seem unlikely to have been in place before death. Immediately before his death, He speaks to his mother and to John, and is offered vinegar. A more likely explanation seemed to me that it served to conceal the death rictus from passers by during the portage to the tomb.

Further, if there is any such ill rancour which I may or may not harbour, he himself has given me ample cause to provoke, with his frequent put downs of me and anyone else who may differ from his favourite hypotheses. Perhaps I ought to have drawn on Christian grace, and merely turned the other cheek. I might have practised such heroic virtue if I had put my mind to it. I feel I have made it clear enough, that my reservations concerning chemical and other such similar processes, arise from considerations of projective geometry, as I endeavoured to elucidate in comments #23 to #28 above in dialogue with Gabriel. As I understand from hypothesis of MPH (and he may correct me if I have it wrong), he is claiming (1) the 3:1 twill was stretched when tightly wrapped and wet; (2) the amount of stretch was exactly sufficient to compensate in every respect for the distortion I have mentioned; (3) the base process of forming the image occurred at sometime when the linen was in this taut state; (4) when the linen was eventually freed from the corpse, it returned to its original unstretched state (possibly from drying?). Consequently this yielded an undistorted image which has the approximate form which we might expect from an ordinary orthogonal aspect such as a photograph. If this is his hypothesis, he is welcome to it. My personal views are that this is a very long shot indeed. The cloth would need to stretch by about 40%, very roughly something just less than (pi/2 – 1), although a better calculation could be made by considering a roughly elliptical body section. The cloth would then need to shrink back from this ~40% distension close to its original shape. Further, assuming a constant strain rate within the cloth, distortion would still be apparent because of the variable angle of incidence or contact. I can suggest a very simple pilot experiment MPH could try if he is so minded. It requires a deformable metal barrel of whatever size suits him, which he can form into the rough cross section of the model of a human torso. He can then paint different coloured stripes equally spaced around the barrel (He could use a mannequin if he wants). He can then wet his cloth however he may, then endeavour to stretch it to the required 40%, and wrap it around the barrel while the paint is still wet. Carefully remove the cloth, wait until it returns to its original shape, (assuming it’s not permanently stretched) and see what pattern gets imprinted on the cloth. If he is correct in his hypothesis, then an orthogonal projection of the pattern on the barrel (say a photograph) should conform closely to the imprinted pattern on the cloth! I rather hope for his sake that he might have some success with it if he does attempt it, but I rather fear that he may well be disappointed! I also fear that he may discover some obscure objections to this somewhat simple experiment..","date":"2012-08-15","mins":"7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"id":"comment-14960","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"More theoretical speculations from the Arch Arcanist!

B: The imprint of the stripes on the cloth however will I expect show a different picture. If by some freak of textile elasticity, it should happen to return to its original width, then it may be that the distance of the outermost stripes might match the lateral distance on the torso.

The obvious answer is that there never was any such paint! Any such small residues of calcium dust or other debris that might be present, can easily be explained as either from laying the cloth on a limestone slab, or from falling ceiling fragments while the cloth was exposed in a room, or from painted copies during their “sanctification” by contact with the original, of which Adler says some four dozen are known.

All the types of Shroud fibers gave positive tests for only two elements, calcium and iron. However, these elements do not derive from the presence of iron oxides or calcium carbonates on the fibers in a binder, as positive tests are obtained without the need for prior acidic digestion. Therefore these elements can be considered as being coordinately covalently bound to the linen’s cellulosic structure. Other samples of old linens (and even modern “craft” linens) show the same type of results. Therefore the presence of these elements can be ascribed to chemistry arising during the manufacture of linen from flax, e.g., the retting process being carried out in naturally occurring ‘hard’ waters. Since these tests are ubiquitous and uniform for both body image and non body image fibers, it demonstrates that the body image chromophore cannot be ascribed to the presence of a metallic element. It should be noted that none of the trace elements associated with iron of a mineral origin were detected.” Conclusive proof that the calcium present has nothing whatsoever to do with an applied gesso coating, but is directly associated with the retting process during extraction of the linen from the flax!

In nuclear power plants I understand that the rate of the reaction is controlled such as by inserting carbon rods into the reactor, and avoids the onset of the chain reaction which occurs in an uncontrolled nuclear explosion. So matter is only slowly converted into energy over the long life of the power plant. If we postulate that the mass of Christ’s human body was completly converted into energy over the brief interval of time during the Resurrection event, then a large amount of energy would have been released. The suggestion has been raised on this site before by another correspondent. I don’t recall how many Giga or Tera Joules were calculated exactly, but it seems it would have devastated the city of Jerusalem and a fair bit of Palestine. Such an event would not have gone unnoticed at the time, but no one seems to have recorded it, not even Josephus nor the evangelists. Now as it is a scientific doctrine that matter = energy can neither be created nor destroyed, we must look for another explanation. My personal preference, is that Resurrection comprises translocating the matter into a parallel universe, which might under special circumstances occasionally intersect our own. This would seem to be in accord with the theological doctrine that Christ’s resurrection included not only his spirit but also his body, in whatever form that body might have been. This also seems to be in accord with St Paul’s teaching on the general resurrection at the end of time. “We will be changed!” Professor Fanti has suggested from his trials with lasers, that the image may have been formed by some kind of corona discharge.

In his questioning comments on Quantum Mechanics, he refers to God as “The Old One”, and said that “God does not play dice!” which considering the probalistic nature of quantum mechaincs, is probably incorrect. Nevertheless it is suggestive of some kind of belief in a personal God. Spinoza was excommunicated from the Amsterdam synagogue in 1656, at about age 23, well before his philosophical ideas had fully developed. The reason for this dismissal seems to have been his generally unorthodox views. There was then in the 17th century a tendency and general mood for revolt against tradition and authority. Jewish leaders in Amsterdam were fearful that “heresies” might give offence in a country that did not yet regard the Jews as citizens. Spinoza had certainly not wanted a break from the synagogue. He was then much influenced by Descartes, had a number of close Christian acquaintances, and is said to have been influenced by neo scholasticism. It was not until the 1660s that he set to work on his “Ethics” and in 1670 he published his “Tractatus Theologico Politicus”.

A number of aspects struck me. 1) I felt the explanation was essentially speculative and theoretical but unsupported by any direct experimental evidence carried out by Rogers himself – he does not quote any experimental evidence to support his explanation. 2) Rogers clearly felt that there were many unknown aspects in the process he expounded, for example he seems to feel compromised by not knowing the density gradient of the amines between the skin and the cloth, although he believed the data was in possession of what he calls the “Body Farms”. 3) He comments that some of the amines are unstable, that image density was therefore dependent on path length, and so I get the impression that he probably thought that this was a factor in the 3 D encoding of the image, which seems reasonable. 4) He dismisses ammonia as being a factor in the imaging process, saying that he is unaware of any ammoniac content in analysis of sweat. Nevertheless the only experiment I’m aware of that he carried out to produce coloration was by using ammonia. 5) He makes a most interesting observation on the spectral analysis of the image, which I feel gives the only present but strong evidence to date for his Maillard hypothesis. 6) He gives a credible explanation of why the hair and beard are imaged, although these do not yield corruption amines. The greatest weakness in the whole hypothesis I feel is the absence of any other kind of experimental evidence. There are no experiments with any kind of dead body wrapped in any kind of treated linen, which has to be the crucible for the hypothesis. That is what is really needed, either to confirm it or reject it. I feel it is not enough for a scientist to hypothesise, he must provide the evidential proof, and that is what is lacking in Rogers’ various assertions, regardless of the theoretical soundness of his chemistry. Because of the success of De Liso’s experiments, I continue to be of the view that seismic effects very likely have something to do with image production. Whether it is the effect of seismic mechanical shock, variations in geo electro magnetism, release of radon, presence of iron, or whatever, remains unknown. If they are relevant, they may still work in combination with Rogers’ Maillard explanation. There may or may not have been miraculous elements to it. Whether these were merely the providential concomitant combination of essential environmental factors on a natural occurrence, or a more direct divine intervention, remains speculative. Whatever, despite the time lag from Delage’s and Vignon’s first scientific investigations, this is not sufficient to assert a miraculist explanation as the only one viable. Why?

Note that Rogers specifically excludes ammonia as the cause as it disperses too quickly. I would agree that the theory at present is short on experimental evidence. The theory is summarily set out on pp.1 2 of “ROGERS’ MAILLARD REACTION (etc)” by Thibault Heimburger in the side panel link above. To anyone unfamiliar with the workings of organic chemistry, even this summary can be heavy going. Rogers sees the Maillard reaction as a three phase process. Essential to the theory is the slow formation of amines (staining vapours) of various sorts evolved from the surface of the body due to sweat and the initial decomposition. The products are diverse and several. In the third phase of the reaction, the products undergo aldol condensation and polymerise into true melanoids. I think that one of the strongest arguments favoring Rogers’ theory is that he can claim: “The spectral evidence from the Shroud indicates that the image is a complex mixture of melanoids.” If correct, I would see this as strong supporting evidence but would agree that it is insufficient by itself. Rogers claims: “The evidence supports a low temperature image color formation process.” He suggests that ammonia may have been involved in the areas around the nose and mouth. I can only recommend a reading of the first few pages of Thibault’s paper to obtain some minimum understanding of what Rogers believed was the cause of the image.

For he says quite clearly (see previous quotes): “Much has been made of ammonia being produced from sweat by hydrolysis of urea (H2 NCONH2).” “CO2 (and some carbamates) is the other final product. I have not been able to find any sweat analyses that showed urea as a major component. In any case, the reaction would be over in a few hours. Ammonia would leave a fog of color on the cloth, because it diffuses quite rapidly. The image was not primarily formed by ammonia. The fog around the nose and mouth looks to me like some ammonia was involved (“I think I see”).” I consider that in the absence of any proven experimental evidence, the question remains unfortunately quite academic, until such time as essential experimental research is carried out to prove the matter one way or the other. The contradictions you have raised do little to build any kind of confidence in Rogers’ hypothesis regardless of any true merit that they might have.

I have gathered here most of them. My hope is that this could help to better understand the MRH and hopefully to discuss step by step all the aspects on a more sound basis.” Unfortunately no dates are given to trace any transition in the progress of his thought, but this paper seems entirely quite self consistent. I concede that Rogers allows that the images of hair and beard may have been driven by ammonia, but in more than one place he considers that the staining vapours are caused by heavy amines [compounds with NH2 groups] from the skin, and discounts ammonia as the principal imaging agent elsewhere. Although Rogers formed his hypothesis on interpreting some factual observation, together with his detailed chemical knowledge, I feel that the theory leans rather too heavily on a theoretical basis, and not sufficient on proven experiment. The most striking thing I consider supporting the hypothesis is that the image seems to be made up of melanoids (determined by spectral analysis), and this is the third phase of the process he outlines in the various amines reacting with the sugars (or starches?)..","date":"2014-05-12","mins":"6:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/05/to-yannick-on-science-and-philosophy/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Yannick on Science and Philosophy"},{"id":"comment-73402","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I am very glad I raised this matter, even though I may end up having to eat humble pie over it.

A few measurements on Shroudscope as others have pointed out, tends to confirm that the dorsal crown is roughly in line with the four burn holes. There is therefore a gap of about 15 to 17 cm between the two crowns, roughly corresponding to the distance over the top of the head. I would have to agree with Hugh, that this implies that the Shroud cloth has been wrapped tightly over the head from nose to occiput. Here the cloth would be near vertical. And the image is indistinct. This faintness may be due to some kind of head band as suggested, or it may be because the imaging process was vertically constrained and hence only showed faintly.

Nor do I accept Chris B’s assertion that the dorsal head image is actually a water stain. This issue might be resolved by a VP8 3 D image of the dorsal head image, but I don’t recall ever seieing one. However the blood stains from the cap of thorns are visible there, the outline of the hair pretty well matches that on the frontal image, and on the better negatives the pigtail is clearly visible. The closest I can get to describing what is seen is a quote from my post: “If two separate photographs were taken, say on large glass plates, at a scale of one to one, the first of the front of the body, and the second of the back of the body, then transferred onto a cloth so that they met at the crown, then the result would be very close to what we see on the Shroud, apart from minor distortions only.” How this can come about based only on a naturalistic explanation escapes me. If all the technology and a suitable model of the body were available to him, then an artist might be able to reproduce it with photographic glass plates in the way described. Otherwise I need to have recourse to a miraculous intervention. The fact that the two images abut each other at the crown cannot be explained, even with attempting a graphics explanation. It is as if there was a time warp at the moment of image formation. One half of the cloth (section 1) is suddenly flattened, with the cloth’s midpoint level with the crown and the frontal image transferred. The second half of the cloth (section 2) is flattened, again with the cloth’s mid point level with the crown, and the dorsal image transferred. That is as close as I can get to explaining how the two images can abut at the crown. Draping the cloth clear of the head might allow a naturalistic explanation only if there were a gap between the two images not less than about 30cm. But of course with the two images abutting, no gap is seen. Either a forger has been able to use something like the glass plate photography I’ve described, or the image has to be some kind of miraculous intervention. I cannot see how any kind of naturalistic explanation can ever provide a satisfactory explanation for the sharp discontinuity of the two images, no matter how the cloth may have been draped, nor whatever process may have created the two images..","date":"2014-01-15","mins":"3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Top of Head Puzzle"},{"id":"comment-83867","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Antero: I thught I noticed something similar which might be found somewhere among the 56 comments my original posting generated back in January, see Dan’s link to it above.

From scaling the distance from nose to occiput (bump on back of head), and comparing the same distance with our own heads, we reckoned that the Shroud cloth was placed quite firmly over the top of the head, so there was virtually no loose fold or gap there. The simplest explanation of why there’s no image of the top of the head is that there was some type of separate head cloth masking the Shroud cloth from the image process. The Soudarion of Oviedo apparently shows blood shed in life, so that it seems to have been a type of mask placed over the head before death, and probably kept in place during the portage to the tomb, possibly to mask the gruesome death rictus of the face. The cloth placed over the head during the burial was likely some kind of other ritual head covering. There were likely other cloths as well, such as any used for binding the jaw, and to keep the arms in place. I had made the same error that Bruce Robinson seems to have made, in assuming that the water stain was the start of the dorsal head image.

I think he has yet to answer the question put by Dan (I paraphrase), “Can he or anyone else deliver a scorch mark that only penetrates the fibres by 200nm?” I can’t see how anyone before the 14th c would have the operational control to produce such a thin image. We have never heard of a 14th c industry in generating scorched images. If anyone had discovered such a method, they would have become medieval millionares. But the Shroud is unique, and there’s nothing else like it, only painted copies! 2. Any metal model, to produce a scorched image, would have to be life size, and realistic, contrary to all other art forms of the time, and it would have to be of a crufixion victim in death, with all the features of the Shroud image. It would surely be a memorable object, but there’s no record of any such statue in all of art history. 3. Colin says the image would need to be by conduction and not radiation. If it was by scorching, this would probably be true. To scorch the image by radiating heat, it would need to be IR, but IR radiation has too long a wave length and would penetrate the fibres. So it would have to be UV for 200nm penetration as ENEA found. But Newton didn’t discover the light spectrum until the 17th c, and discovery of IR & UV came much later. 4. The model for the Shroud had to be human, a crucifixion victim and dead. Corruption around the body orifices commences within 40 hours of death. But there’s no sign of corruption apparent on the image. Therefore the image was formed not more than 2 days after death and the body then removed. 5. The identity of the crucifixion victim can only be Rabbi Yeshua (Jesus), as no other crucifixion victim was made to wear a crown of thorns, (mocking claims to be “King of the Jews”) apparent from the images of blood spots around the head, nor had his legs unbroken, scourged and pierced with a lance. 6. Contrariwise, there is a strong historical trail of at least one cloth with an image of Jesus dating no later than the 6th c. But not even the clever Byzantines were in the scorched image business. Surely that has to be “Checkmate!”.","date":"2012-02-08","mins":"11:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/08/why-do-we-think-the-resurrection-was-a-process-what-if-it-was-not/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process?

Dan, Colin’s lucid explanation of his low temperature (200 C) thermal printing process, its requirements and effects has to be one of his better blogs on this site. It’s a pity he had to add the ad hom rider describing ENEA as Mickey Mouse – it’s unnecessary and doesn’t help. Some things that we might think are better left unsaid, if we want to win a logical argument! 2. The next question has to be: “Does the thermal printing process he describes give the same RGB values as those on the Shroud?” That was one of the points that ENEA made, but it may require some fairly sophisticated spectroscopic analysis and equipment to measure this, probably beyond the resources outside of a physics laboratory. It might be possible with coloured filters. 3. Allowing that thermal printing would work with a metallic object, I doubt if I can be persuaded that the model for the Shroud was any kind of metallic statue. It lacks a metallic look. It beggars belief that anyone, even an enthusiastic relic forger, would ever commission such an object, which would be even more impressive than its mere image on a cloth, Despite the achievements of classic Greek statuary, there was not the knowledge available to reproduce the anatomical accuracy of the crucifixion victim on the Shroud. There’s no record of such an impressive object! 4. The third question therefore has to be: “Will low temperature thermal printing work with an organic object?” It would need to be a good deal less than 200 C, (which would sizzle a beef steak); 100 C would cause blisters! Can a thermal printing of an organic object be produced in under two days? Can it be carried out with a laboratory rat for example? Dried flora will produce an image under pressure eventually, but it takes a very long time. 5. And all of this is without even mentioning the accuracy of the blood flows, wrist nailing and its effects, contamination from dust, pollen and cotton, the historical record, and everything else that makes the Shroud so unique, for those of us who have had the open minded patience and dedication to be so informed..","date":"2012-02-09","mins":"7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/08/why-do-we-think-the-resurrection-was-a-process-what-if-it-was-not/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process?

Although his description is fascinating, I’m not sure that Max can be so certain as to the method of burial of Jesus. I’m guessing that his “late ancient Greek version” probably refers to the Constantinople “Textus Receptus”. Earliest full text is Codex Vaticanus with C Sinaiticus a close second, both 4th c. There are several earlier fragments, mainly Alexandrian or possibly Coptic. There are also Syriac versions. Early canons of scripture were being formulated by about 200 AD. 2. We need to remember that it was the day before a very special sabbath, as in that year Passover fell on this sabbath (April 28, 30 AD according to John P Meier’s reckoning – “A Marginal Jew”), The gospels say that Joseph of Arimathea went to Pilate to beg the body of Jesus in the evening, so that the sabbath had virtually begun already. The burial work had therefore to be done hastily, including purchase of a shroud. 3. The Synoptics all say that the Galillee women witnessed the burial. Earliest gospel Mark has Mary Magdalen and Mary mother of James purchasing spices on Sunday morning to annoint him, corroborated by Luke who has the women going off to prepare spices. If he was already tied up as Max asserts, why would the women do such a thing, unless they merely intended making up for some missed ritual. 4. Only the latest gospel John has Nicodemus coming with Joseph, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds (a fairly weighty concoction). John says they toook the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices, and adds the gloss “following the Jewish burial custom”. Maybe this gloss was added to satisfy his Jewish readers, and perhaps we should not read too much into it. 5. If in their haste, the 100 lb of spices were laid over the shrouded body, instead of being wrapped with the body, I wonder if this would create enough pressure to produce a thermal image described by Colin. It might explain why the women returned on the Sunday morning to complete the work. Alternatively if the body was wrapped tight in a water soaked sheet as proposed by Max, would this create enough pressure. 6. Maybe we should accept that it was some kind of miracle, after all. Some aspects we can definitely know, some we may know in time; others we can guess as probably true, or have an opinion on.

They could be tightly wrapped in water soaked linen cloths, along with a myrrhic aleotic mixture, and then checked after say two days. A range of control variables could be used say, binding / no binding, water soaked / dry, etc. Fur might be a problem. I offer this suggestion seriously and certainly intend no put down. Honestly, no tongue in cheek. It should have been looked at years ago. I note that there is no corruption around Shroud man’s orifices,so body was removed no later than two days after death.

You’d be ignoring the possible effects of body emanations, gases and fluids, which might well be involved if there’s anything in this theory.

Assuming it was all intended just for the one burial (which seems a very large amount) that would be about 40% of the body weight for modelling purposes. What about the two thieves who were also executed? To comply with the required rituals, maybe some of the concoction was also intended for them as well, In which case it might only be 13% of the body weight.

We can’t know that the prescription was precisely followed in all its strict detail in this case. Rabbi Yeshua himself, in his teachings, seemed disposed to dispense with the full rigor of the Law. E.g. He seemed to differentiate between that given by Moses (Leviticus), and those aspects which seem to be later add ons. He touched lepers, he cured on the sabbath, and allowed his disciples to garner corn on the sabbath, he associated with all sorts of doubtful persons, publicans, prostitutes and other sinners. BUT, supporting your principal assertion that creation of the image may not have been a Resurrection phenomenon, check out the following 1997 paper, if you’re not already aware of it: “The Image Formation Mechanism on the Shroud of Turin: A Solar Reflex Radiation Model (the Optical Aspect)” by Serge N. Mouraviev. You can find it at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/mouraviev.pdf I’m presently unaware of any reviews of the paper (perhaps you’ve come across it before), so can’t comment on its credibility. Mouraviev’s main thesis is that the myrrhic aleotic mixture made the linen photo sensitive, and that the wrapping was done in the open, in the full light of the afternoon sun. The sun’s parallel rays penetrated the translucent shroud, were reflected off the moist sweaty, bloodied body and absorbed by the photo sensitive interior layer. He carried out a few elementary experiments, obtaining some blurry images which he claims supports this thesis. There’s much more, including obtaining a 3 D aspect. He asserts that the body was laid on its back, which gave its frontal image, and then turned over to give the dorsal image. It accounts for why there is no lateral image, and why there are minor discrepancies between both images. In other words, two separate images were formed. The relative movement of the sun during these operations, would have little effect in blurring the image. It shoud be possible to simulate a small scale experiment in the lab using a suitable light source for the sun. If he’s correct, you don’t need a full scale model, but the model does need a reflective surface. One reservation is that M’s experiments gave blurry results, but the Shroud image is sharp.

On the one hand there seems to be more than what could be considered a reasonable reluctance to admit the possibility that the image of the Shroud might be miraculous, when in fact it may be so miraculous. Certainly it is not sufficient to say that because science cannot explain the image it must be miraculous. I think there would have to be a reasonable expectation that science would never be able to explain the happening, before an occurrence could qualify as a miracle. It needs to be shown that the imprinting of the image transcended the laws of naure, before it could be accepted as miraculous. The opposite view is perhaps illustrated by EGM’s comments who clearly has a quite proper sense of wonder at all the marvels of creation, which I can certainly empathise with. I personally believe that all the marvellous coincidences that occur in nature is sufficient evidence for me of the presence of God. However to be technically honest, this marvellous creation cannot be called miraculous, if we stick to the strict meaning of the word. For all that we ordinarily see is in accord with its own nature. A miracle can only be said to occur when something happens that transcends its nature, and it requires divine intervention to bring it about. To find out what miracles are all about, is only a click away. But be warned! You’ll need a spare weekend to get on top of it, and a damp towel around your head to master it. Go to the Catholic Encyclopedia site, where there’s more discussion there than most of us could ever manage to cope with.

Earthquakes release radon gas, which has a half life of 3.8 days, with very many daughter products. Most of the gamma radiation comes from the decay product 214 Bi. It would not be a great amount. Any X ray like properties of the image are only slight, and seem to be limited to the teeth and the phalanges, perhaps there are a few others. The cloth around the teeth and fingers would need to be examined and perhaps there may be clues of slight gamma ray damage there. But we do not know. 222 Radon has very many decay products, some of them other isotopes of Radon, but they are very short lived, most with half lifes of less than 1 hour. Whether there would be any terahertz radiation resulting from this process, and what its results might be, I do not know. I find it difficult to obtain detailed technical information on the process, most of the radon web pages only being focused on health issues. Alpha and beta particles are also generated by the decay, and perhaps had some role in the process.

While 222 Rn itself is an inert gas, some of its very many daughter decay products (other Rn isotypes) are solid, typically adhering to dust particles in the air, but have very short half lifes, most of them less than 1 hour. The dominant radiation from 222 Rn is alpha, helium nucleii, which travel only a short distance and are not penetrating. There is some beta (free electrons) which may travel a few feet. However there is also some gamma radiation, which could result in X ray like imagery. The low energy of the gamma, may explain why the TS X ray like imagery is limited to a few areas only, notably the teeth and finger phalanges. The gamma emission of 222 Rn is sufficient to have been used for treatment of cancer cells. Extract from Wiki article: “Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily used to treat cancers. The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and beta radiations, while allowing the gamma rays to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200 M Bq). The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short lived elements of its decay chain (218 Po, 214 Pb, 214 Bi, 214 Po).” Most radon seems to originate from within igneous and metamorphic rocks, but also to a lesser extent in sedimentary, including limestones and shales. It has also been associated with caves and springs. Note that aragonite limestone as occurs in Jerusalem, is commonly associated with caves and springs. If radon has been a factor in forming the TS image, is it conceivable that the heavier, short distance alpha particles might have had some kind of collimating effect in whatever particulates produced the TS image, and might even account for the orthogonality of the image? I am wondering if there may be much more in the significance of Matthew’s reporting of an earthquake (which releases radon) at the time of the crucifixion, than others have seem prepared to acknowledge. It does not require a catastrophic earthquake, but only a moderate one of about R.5.0. We have a few of these every year in New Zealand, a little disturbing at the time, but we get used to it..","date":"2015-05-20","mins":"5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"id":"comment-199786","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Piero, Thank you for your posting on natural body radiation, particularly from 40 K. You write: ” … the dose rate from these gamma rays outside of the individual’s body will represent a very small fraction of the normal background dose rate from all natural sources outside the body.” I have read that most of the background radiation is due to radon. An earthquake will release radon from within the earth. I think it may be this radon from an earthquake that might account for some of the X ray attributes of the Shroud image. You will be familiar with work of Giovanna de Liso, who investigated seismic effects in Piedmont and produced a few images on cloth. She only obtained images under very specific circumstances, and this included only when radon was released. You also write: “There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. …” I also note that in posting above Giles Carter says: “My hypothesis for that is that higher energy x rays which are more penetrating emanated from the bones of this individual and passed through the skin and at the surface of the skin interacted with elements such as sodium and chlorine from salts and chloride on the surface or from sulfur or phosphorous in the skin. And these elements then, like sodium and chlorine, gave off secondary x rays which are very low in energy and not penetrating at all. And it’s these x rays that actually caused most of the image, or all of the image, of the Shroud.” I do not believe it is necessary for high energy X rays to emanate from the bones of the person, which requires a miracle. But I wonder if it is possible that the radon emissions from within the earth might have reacted with the body salts to produce the same effect..","date":"2015-05-21","mins":"2:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"id":"comment-199804","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Addendum to above: De Liso’s images came from external radon, as a result of seismic action..","date":"2015-05-21","mins":"6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"id":"comment-199803","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I disagree.

Ed., Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 2003, pp.106 113. “Observations of weave density and lignin content of the shroud fibres (Rogers, 2001) indicate a very mild bleaching technique in agreement with the methods described by Pliny the Elder (77). The same technology was in use, with some minor differences, until after the last crusade in 1291 (Hochberg, 1980). Linen was spun by hand on a spindle whorl. When the spindle was full, the spinner made a hank of thread. Each hank of thread was bleached separately, and each was a little different. Different parts of the same thread in the shroud’s weave show slightly different colours, like a variegated yarn. The warp thread was protected with starch during the weaving process, making the cloth stiff. The final cloth was washed in a solution made from Saponaria officinalis. Saponaria produces four glycosidic saponins, and all hydrolyse to produce sugar chains. (Ya Chirva et al., 1969) The following carbohydrates were identified in those chains: galactose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, fucose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid.” “The presence of starch, in particular amilose, on the shroud was confirmed by the fact that during testing for sulfoproteins in blood areas with an iodine azide reagent (which bubbles vigorously when sulfur is present), a reddish background was formed. Image colour does not appear under the bloodstains when they are removed with a proteolytic enzyme. Whatever process produced the image, colour must have occurred after the blood flowed onto (or was painted onto) the cloth, and the image producing process did not destroy the blood (Heller and Adler, 1981).” Note that the authors are asserting that several carbohydrates, including some sugars, were identified, and also amilose, which I take to be a starch.

As a then young engineer in 1974 I picked up a copy of “The Ancient Engineers” by L Sprague De Camp – it was first published in 1960. It covers Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Greeks, Romans, Orientals and the European medevals and has a section on the cathedrals. I still have it. It is now a little dated by more recent archaeology, but is nevertheless still an entertaining and informative read. I googled and was delighted to see it’s still in print. It shows somethng of an agnostic streak. I remember he mentions one Heron, a near contemporary of Jesus, who had invented a vessel that gave an illusion of turning water into wine. Whether this invention was behind Luke’s gospel story about Cana, who can say? It has a good section on the great Library of Alexandria and tells the story of its origins and its progressive decline during 100 – 400 AD, apparently partly due to fanatical desert monks under St Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria.. It was then that the centre of learning shifted to Baghdad, and the Arab surge in mathematics, and also ensured that at least some of the ancient classics survived, although much was lost. The medieval engineers still had very little theoretical knowledge of structural mechanics. Their building work was essentially trial and error, even the flying buttresses. Cathedrals typically took a hundred years or so to complete, and there were many structural failures during construction with significant loss of workmen’s lives. Nevertheless the ancients were also highly inventive. Pick up a copy if you can, as it’s both informative and entertaining. As for the Shroud,, it would be beyond their technology and I’d have to agree with Chris’s comment, that it would be well and truly overkill for its time if it were either Byzantine or Medieval. Significant advances in Medieval technology had to await Fibonacci’s adoption of the Hindu Arab numerical system around 1200 AD, and the subsequent Italian Renaissance..","date":"2013-01-31","mins":"3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/31/how-could-a-medieval-mind-create-an-image-such-as-the-one-on-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"How could a medieval mind create an image such as the one on the shroud?"},{"id":"comment-170565","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Lensing from the herring bone weave?

Why bother to comment or even notice it? Like Hugh, I do not understand what is meant by a resolution of 4.9mm and its alleged tolerance of 0.5mm. It is more scientific to express resolution as a ratio or an angle. Thus the normal human eye has a limiting resolution of about 2 minutes of arc. Yet distance units are given. Does this mean that no image on the cloth is more distinct than half a centimetre across – I doubt it – the eyes for example clearly have better definition than 5mm. Some have claimed to discern lettering on coins say 1mm. Yet other parts of the body are quite indistinct. Clearly the question of resolution is not a constant across the cloth, but it varies, and its pointless to ascertain a single value as applying to the whole cloth. The fact that the image tends to disappear on observation closer than about a metre or so, is a matter of human perception, rather than being an objective property.

This implies that there are fewer image forming molecules when the gases arrive at the cloth, with the further distances. That is, only if the image can indeed be shown to have been formed by some chemical process as postulated by Rogers. I don’t follow Hugh’s line of reasoning at all. His comment suggests that he is open to the possibility of the image not being formed by a real body, but by some other fraudulent means, not specified.

It is quite possible that the proto Exodus version of the second commandment was more simple and direct, as are the other commandments there, but was since edited by deuteronomic redaction. The decalogue section seems a little disjointed from the flow of the main Exodus narrative here. “You shall not make yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything in heaven or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God (etc)” Exod 20:4 5 [JB] However images were frequently made, either in apostasy, or as part of legitimate liturgy and worship, e.g. Refer Solomon’s temple. Israel was surrounded by pagan cultures, reliant on agriculture, and fertility cults were important. They included idolatry, infant sacrifice and temple prostitution to sustain life. They go some way towards explaining the intent of the commandment in banning such practices. Within Israel and later Judaism there were occasional bouts of iconoclasm, seen as a cleansing and a return to the essential prescriptions of Moses, notably by such as Hezekiah and Nehemiah, but they seldom lasted. Imagery persisted until the time of the Maccabees, which rejected any kind of images in worship, and crass idolatry. Essentially the ban is only a token of what ought to be in the peoples’ hearts, lip service only. Jesus makes it plainer. “You cannot serve God and Mammon” In other words, it is what is in the heart that matters, and nothing in the heart should displace the rightful position of God as the object of worship. Jesus made it clear that making possessions central to life, was also idolatry. Paul considered that idolatry was not as may be thought, a first step towards an evolutionary progress to monotheism, but he saw it as an apostasy from a natural religion which ought to marvel at the wonderful works of Creation – Romans 1:18 25.
