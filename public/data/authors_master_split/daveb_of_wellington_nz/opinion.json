[{"id":"comment-52906","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I get a strong impression that it was John Jackson who provided the initial impetus and leadership that eventually led to the development of the STURP team. Jackson had first been made aware of the Shroud at age 14, and later while studying for his masters in physics had proposed to his puzzled faculty advisor that his thesis be based on the Shroud. He was intrigued by the alleged 3 D properties which had first been mentioned by Paul Vignon. The contacts with Eric Jumper and Bill Mottern then naturally followed with the discovery of the remarkable properties yielded by the VP8 analyser. The results of Frei’s pollen sampling were also coming to light at this time. It would be natural to expect that the two discoveries, the VP8 images and the pollens, linked with the earlier pioneer forensic studies, might have had a profound effect on the attitude of Jackson and his early cohorts on how they might then perceive the authenticity of the Shroud. However the final STURP team expanded to some 30+ scientists of various backgrounds and specialties. Not all of them were particularly religious. The interest the topic generated in most of them seems to have come from the enigmatic properties of the object of their study, and its largely unknown aspects, rather than from any particular religious viewpoint. A few were known to be agnostic, there were dissenters, but for the most part they seemed to have pursued their investigations in as professional a manner as could be achieved under the constraints they had to work within. The initial attitude of many seems to have been downright skepticism, and it was only through the application of their various scientific inputs, that they came to a greater respect towards the object of their enquiry. The one bad apple in the whole bunch seems to have been the close minded Walter Mc Crone, who seems to have betrayed the trust placed in him, as the main recipient of the blood stained tapes. It is perhaps also unfortunate that the STURP team lacked some desirable expertise in a knowledge of textiles, and in artistic iconography. However, it did its job as well as it could under the circumstances, and its conclusions can hardly be said to be tainted by any kind of religious bias..","date":"2013-11-27","mins":"4:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/27/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-solid-as-a-brick-wall/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Solid as a Brick Wall"},{"id":"comment-78401","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"2 Tim 3:16: “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,” Elsewhere scripture says “My ways are not your ways, it is the Lord who speaks!” These suggest to me that there are higher truths than what the biblical literalists would have us believe.

Barbet implies his own reasons for this stain [Doctor at Calvary, Ch 8 – Descent from Cross, Journey to Tomb …, p.149] “It is certain that the body of Christ was borne horizontally, but as it was on the cross, from this to the neighbourhood of the toomb, it was not till then that it was placed on the Shroud.” He asserts that if otherwise, the cloth would have been drenched with blood because of the flow from the inferior vena cava; the journey was long enough for the inferior vena cava to empty itself through the wound in the heart. He also happens to mention discussing the matter with some abattoir officials who were familiar with this emptying of the vena cava during the killing of oxen. The blood was therefore either lost or collected. Only that remained which coagulated on the skin, to a limited extent while it was flowing. Only after the journey, and the body then laid on the cloth, it received only the impression of the clots of blood formed on the skin of the back during the journey. Only these clots have imprinted on the Shroud, “what we call the dorsal transversal flow, because these clots are its mark.” Whether Barbet is correct or not, and I have no reason to think not, I suggest that comment on them be reserved to those who are adequately qualified in forensic pathology as was Barbet..","date":"2014-04-05","mins":"6:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/am-i-the-only-one/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Am I the only one?"},{"id":"comment-96853","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Antero for your most timely and apposite comment..","date":"2014-04-05","mins":"3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/am-i-the-only-one/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Am I the only one?"},{"id":"comment-96910","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is time wasting, unpleasant, self serving, arrogant and unacceptable!.","date":"2014-04-05","mins":"7:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/am-i-the-only-one/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Am I the only one?"},{"id":"comment-96968","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I fail to see the need to express any kind of opinion on individual researchers’ personal qualities or abilities at all.

Consequently he was condemned for corrupting the youth of Athens with such novel ideas, was sentenced to death and was required to swallow hemlock. Even in this he imagined that as this was the sentence of the State following due process, this was the proper thing for him to do. The preference for argumentation and debate for its own sake in preference to the truth survives to the present time on the web sites of so called “open minded sceptics” who are in reality “close minded cynics”! The Sermon on the Mount includes these words: “give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you” Likewise in the parable of the sower we must ask ourselves, “Why would a sower want to sow his precious seed on barren ground?” It is one matter to engage in honest and open debate about those affairs which are precious to us. However, it is a pointless exercise when it is only too apparent that the good will of an honest response is unlikely to be forthcoming, and one should not give one’s valuable time to such futility.

I would be cautious in allowing that these alleged images say anything about how the image of the TSM was formed, as they could quite easily be two different processes.

Mark’s is the basic original narrative, and the other evangelists have built on it either adding material known to them, or else omitting material by way of refinement. The basic events are that Joseph took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and placed him in the tomb. Individual additions are: ‘laid in a tomb hewn out of the rock’; ‘rolled a stone against the entrance’; ‘no one had yet been buried there’; ‘it was Joseph’s tomb and he had hewn it’; ‘Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes’; ‘bound the body with burial cloths along with the spices’; ‘there was a garden and the tomb was close by’. Concerning transport, Barbet notes that the Shroud image blood stains indicate a minimum of handling, that the tomb was close by, and the body would have been completely stiff in a state of rigor mortis. He creates the scenario whereby the nail is removed from the feet, the cross piece is lifted off the upright, two men carry the cross piece, two men support the mid section using something like a twisted sheet, and one man supports the feet. He notes that this explains the dorsal blood stain at the waist, and that there is a small smudge mark on the foot. Very likely the head wrap placed during crucifixion still covered the face, and is only removed during the laying out. Under this scenario, no cloth is required to protect the carriers from gore, and the lack of smudging even suggests that not even a modesty cloth was used. It would not be possible to place the body in a transport stretcher without removing the nails from the hands and the cross piece, breaking the rigor at the shoulders, and then forcing the arms down to the sides. As the tomb was close by, there was no need for this. Even transporting the body on a stretcher a very short distance would have resulted in smudging; there is none. We can forget the stretcher scenario. Several forensic pathologists who have examined either the Shroud or its photographs or both, have been convinced that the image was that of a real corpse, not merely a picture of one, that the man was a victim of scourging and crucifixion, and they have given their various forensic analyses. Various explanations have been offered for the colour of the blood stains. Whatever the shortcomings of Max Frei’s work, he had been trained in botany, was a noted criminologist , head of the Zurich Police Scientific Laboratory 1948 72, had analysed several important crimes and accidents including the air crash of UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold, and even in retirement was still consulted by the police forces of many nations. His work on Shroud pollens has been supplemented by Israeli botanists Danin and Baruch and also by palynologist Thomas Litt. Hugh Farey to my knowledge has not been trained in palynology, His objection to the identification of insect borne pollens is irrelevant. The gospels make the point of a garden at the burial site, it was spring and the flowers would have been in full bloom. Whether the pollens arrived on the cloth by insects or by mourners placing flowers there, is beside the point. Palynology is a difficult science and there are ambiguities, but there remains sufficient indication of a Middle East provenance. The image shows travertine arogonite limestone, consistent with Jerusalem limestone, not only on the soles of the feet (road dust) but also on the nose and the knee. The arch fraudulists might have us believe that their model coated with flour paste or whatever else, suffered a fall on his way to the artist’s studio, and accumulated this debris from the caves of Troyes. We know that Geoffrey I de Charnay was a virtuous knight of distinction, a devout Christian, and unlikely to be party to any kind of fraud. Further there is sufficient evidence that the Byzantine imperial relic collection boasted of having a tradition of image imprinted burial cloths of the Saviour, and gave them various names, and that following the Frankish Crusader spoliation of Constantinople in 1204, they were never seen there again. There is absolutely no record of any medieval artisan creating the Shroud image, his imagined success remains inexplicable, and he only ever did it once, not even leaving a relic of his attempts to do so. As an Easter liturgical prop for the faithful, the Shroud lacks the artistry expected of such a rubric.

We do not need to shrink from the scientific path. It is evident in the “Goldilocks zones” phenomenon, the inexplicability of consciousness, the mystery of quantum entanglement, and paradoxically even in the potential for evolution and adaptation of the natural order. As an engineer I could wait forever to see a man made structure evolve into something more complex, but it only ever degrades following the law of entropy. That is not the case with the natural order which is capable of adaptation to its environment, which to me speaks more loudly of “design” than not!

But that seldom prevented me praying for enlightenment that I might achieve a solution for the more intractable problems. The case of Laplace is curious. He was an avowed determinist, in much the same way as Omar Khayyam’s “And the first Morning of Creation wrote / What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.” His major scientific contribution was in demonstrating the stability of the solar system, notwithstanding its apparent perturbations, Newton previously having concluded that divine intervention was occasionally necessary to restore equilibrium. Laplace was able to announce the invariability of planetary mean motion (average angular velocity). He is noted for his first use of the “potential function” in his gravitational work, and which subsequently found applications in such diverse fields as magnetism, electricity, heat flow, and fluid mechanics (specifically in the equation of continuity). The Laplace partial differential equation is pervasive throughout physics. Surprisingly, despite his philosophic determinism, Laplace also made major contributions to the theory of probability, proving the Central Limit Theorem and that the distribution of errors in large data samples approximates to the normal distribution. I am unaware of how Laplace reconciled his determinism with his achievements in probability. I believe Laplace’s determinism was dealt the death blow, by the later discoveries in quantum mechanics, where everything seemed to be entirely probabilistic. No underlying variables determining which specific atom would decay into another were found, only that a definite quantity ever did, leading to Einstein’s expression of frustration “The old one does not play dice with his creation”. I think it may have been Schrodinger who scolded Einstein “Stop telling God what to do with his dice”. The problem of evil in a God given world is perennial, and many great minds have attempted to address this problem, the most ancient being the Book of Job, albeit with a conclusion I consider unsatisfactory, as Job ends up by overcoming all his adversities, hardly the common experience of more general personal suffering. It does attempt an answer to “Why do bad things happen to good people, while sinners may seem to prosper.” Augustine and the ancient Jewish writers thought they found an answer in man’s first act of disobedience to God given commands and a doctrine of original sin, together with some personified demonology. To some extent it depends on how evil is defined. Is it part of God’s plan, for example, that it is the “Selfish gene” that should predominate, and determine the course of evolution by ensuring endurance and hence survival of the fittest? Is this what made Christ’s redemptive act necessary, but yet pointed to a better way in the command to “Love one another” rather than compulsively following the fallacy of exclusive self interest? Apart from the adversities arising from Nature in its act of giving birth and final fulfillment, whatever that might come to, true evil always seems to be a product of man’s freedom to act in a way contrary to what his true nature ought to be. Thus the Nazi holocaust was the product of men free to act in a way contrary to decent human values. The excuse of “acting under orders” was never able to exonerate them. Nor could it be said to be a product of Laplacian determinism, but despicable acts of men acting freely, and certainly under no compulsion from God. I appreciate that what I have written may convince no confirmed atheist, who sees the presence of evil as his principle argument against the divine. However, if there is evil, there is also good, and we might well ask whence does good come from. It is significant I think that we are able to discern the distinction between the two, and we should ask “how does that come about?”.","date":"2015-01-02","mins":"5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"id":"comment-180980","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I recall having read Rudolf Otto’s “Idea of the Holy” as part of a university course some thirty years ago, was much taken by it notwithstanding he was a Protestant author, seem to recall having to write a Stage III essay on it, I still have the book, and I think my opinion of it would still be one of praise. I think Otto seemed to have a good understanding that God’s ways are not man’s ways, and made it very clear that God is not to be judged in terms of human standards – He is the ineffable! If you do not understand the statement “mystery of a God sometimes awful”, I suggest you do not understand Otto. The point is that God has given man the freedom to act how he will, and with it goes the responsibility of man to use that freedom for good, not evil. If man uses his freedom to do evil, then it is man who has to be held accountable, not God! That is the true meaning of sin! It is man who has acted in an evil way. For whatever reason, God does not choose to correct every evil act perpetrated by man. Indeed, to do so, would be to abrogate man’s responsibility in the matter. Otherwise, one might construct a scenario whereby man could do whatever he willed, secure in the knowledge that God would correct any consequent evil arising from such an act, and could then abdicate from the responsibility of his actions. But that is not how our world works. When it comes to the consequences of natural disasters, the earth will do what the earth does, whether it is earthquake, flood, storms or tsunami. God has given man the intelligence to deal with such disasters, which are not to be seen as punishments from God as the old superstitions believed. An illustration: I read in the news of some moderate earthquake occurring where there are poor construction standards and which has had devastating effects with great loss of life. However if the same earthquake occurred in New Zealand, California or Japan, then it would only have moderate effects with much less trauma, as engineers there have set construction standards to withstand such forces. There was great loss of life in Japan following a tsunami there a few years ago. The effect has been to create an awareness of the danger, and not have people rushing to the coast to ogle at the wonder of a tsunami. To take an extreme case: If you build your house on a volcano, you are not entitled to be surprised at the consequences..","date":"2015-01-03","mins":"5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"id":"comment-181083","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Bottom line: Man cannot abdicate responsibility for the consequences of his actions by laying the blame elsewhere, whether it is the God given freedom to act, or “the devil made me do it”, or else a stunted upbringing!

In the original posting, Colin had asserted that, based on the synoptic gospels, the fine linen brought by Joseph of Arimathaea was not the same as the burial cloth used to wrap the body, but in fact was merely used for transport. I believe I successfully refuted that, Colin seemed to have no answer to it, and all he could do in reply was to make the comment posted above, essentially reverting to his argument that the Shroud was the result of a medieval thought experiment. And accusing me of a pro authenticity argument. That is not the case as he very well should know, as my comments were specifically directed at his faulty interpretation of the synoptic accounts. I had made no comment whatsoever concerning miraculous flashes of radiation, a scenario I do not subscribe to, and it is egregious of him to include it in his argument. It is reasonable to claim that the image of a corpse on a cloth of fine linen may very well have been a burial shroud of a kind, and his pleading that this is no more than a pro authenticity argument, is in fact no more than an anti authenticity argument. Touche! His continuing insistence that authenticists ought to see it as no more than being used for transport, when there is no scriptural evidence that any cloth, let alone one of fine linen, was ever used as such, itself begs the question, a complaint he makes of others. Essentially the synoptics say that Joseph brought a Shroud, took the body down, wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in the tomb, no mention of using it for transport at all. Now if he wants to concentrate on a medieval thought experiment, he should talk about that, and not introduce faulty extraneous material diverting discussion away from the subject. There are adequate reasons to call the cloth a burial Shroud, as that what it seems to be, many who have examined it in detail were so convinced, and have offered their evidence in support of their contention. However there is no record whatsoever of anyone having come up with any kind of medieval thought experiment to create it, nor of repeating his endeavours, nor do we yet know how he might have gone about it, nor can we guess who it might have been. It is purely a speculative induction based on a reluctance to acknowledge that it might in fact actually be Christ’s burial cloth. But I congratulate Colin for his industry in venturing into his experimental approach. Either one way or another, we might learn from his efforts how the image was formed or not, as the case may prove to be..","date":"2015-07-13","mins":"5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"id":"comment-181338","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"This posting began with the need for a dialogue between Science and Religion on the basis of there seeming to be a strong case for intelligent design, which in the history of philosophy and religion has always been generalised as God. Fundamentally the case is made on the existence of observed order in the universe which seems to demand an intelligent origin. I had indicated that some of those indications might be found in what have come to be known as “Goldilocks Zones”, of which there are many, the existence of consciousness which seems otherwise inexplicable, and the enigma of quantum entanglement. The existence of evil does not negate any of these arguments, is a separate issue and cannot be used to disprove the existence of intelligent design in any rational way, however repugnant the evil. ‘Evil’ cannot exist as a concept without the concept of ‘Good’, but it is evident that both ‘Good’ and ‘Evil’ also exist as practical realities. What is ‘good’ and what is ‘evil’ has always been a moot point among philosophers and religionists who have considered these matters. A utilitarian for instance would only see as good that which serves self interest. A Darwinist might only see as good that which enhances natural selection and survival of a species. A Christian theologian would only see as good that which brings a person closer to his concept of God, and that is evil which alienates the person from God. An agnostic humanist might depend on more emotive arguments involving the repugnance or appeal of specific acts. It is evident that the existence of God has been an attractive concept for very many philosophers throughout the ages, from the time of the Greek and Jewish philosophers, the Christian scholastics, notably Aquinas, more latterly Immanuel Kant and various others. However there is not unanimity on the matter, so clearly the question of God’s existence cannot be said to be a matter of certain knowledge. It is necessarily a matter of a faith belief based on a personal assessment of evidence, but in view of the intellectual support for it, it may clearly be held as a rational belief. I choose to belief in the existence of God because I think it more likely than not, and I believe that Jesus Christ is the human face of that God. I also consider that modern civilisation owes a debt of gratitude to Christianity with its heritage in such fields as music, art, literacy and literature, mainly though monasticism and the founding of the first universities, the doctrinal motivation it provided in a wide assortment of charitable activities and beneficent altruism, together with its missionary activities making civilisation accessible to pagan societies previously held in the thrall of superstition. It was Aquinas who pointed to the order in the universe, unifying philosophy and theology, so that no longer were deities to be considered as capricious beings, but that order was to be expected, thus making the underpinning of the scientific revolution possible. I also believe that God endowed man with the freedom to choose, a freedom which is not enjoyed by the lower orders which are only subject to natural instinct. Moral choices are unavailable to lower animal life. A sentient being capable of choosing between good and evil, but not capable of choosing evil, is a contradiction, in fact a “Nothing”, and I could respond to David Mo by saying that “Nothing is impossible to God!” With that freedom goes the responsibility of choosing for good, and being held accountable for one’s actions. Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” was subtitled ‘A Modern Prometheus’, so that the besetting sin of her mad scientist protagonist was that of ‘Prometheanism’, putting man in the place of God! Thus her Doctor Frankenstein was indeed at fault. I had resolved to contribute no longer to the web site, as I have too often found it an exercise in fruitless frustration, but had relented in the case of this particular off topic. However I do not see it as my personal vocation to justify my preciously held beliefs to any committed atheist impervious to any rational argument to the contrary. I do have more fruitful avenues I can pursue, without indulging in idle word play. Consequently, I propose no further comment on the subject..","date":"2015-01-04","mins":"4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"id":"comment-182256","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"One purpose of my earlier engineering analogy was to demonstrate what a perilous and thankless task it is for anyone going around creating a Universe, more so for all we know, if one is inclined to make a habit of it, say creating multiple universes. One fundamentally starts with nothing, endows it with some dimensions, creates a singularity so that it all flies apart into matter and anti matter, dissipate the antimatter, and give your matter some four or so fundamental forces, so that you get the quarks developing into the right kind of atomic particles which will form useful elements that can combine with one another after they’ve congregated into star systems. After a few of the stars have gone through their life cycle in about 5 billion years, you can get a few super novae started so that you can get some elements heavier than iron, as these will also be useful. You look around for some benign locations that seem fairly stable, and you’ve fixed things so that some of the lighter elements will form organic molecules which will eventually turn into double helixes for DNA and become life forms. You know how useful competition is for ensuring survival and development of the better parts of this mix, so that these life forms will struggle against each other and a few will become dominant. After a few star cycles in about 14 billion years, and throwing some rocks around to extinguish the worst of the aggressive animals you begin to see signs of rudimentary intelligence in your mammalian life, particularly the primates. They still compete with each other, but they’ve got to the point where they see advantages in social organisation and mutual cooperation and you’ve got the beginnings of some kind of moral order. The competition and selfish gene are eventually successful in producing something called homo sapiens, a sentient being capable of sustaining himself, having a moral conscience, and who is beginning to understand what this is all about, even becoming aware that all of this didn’t get going all by itself. However, the quest for dominance and exploitation and primitive rudiments are still there, so that you know you’re going to have to send your divine Son along to sort out the worst of it, and to tell your Creation what it’s all about. You give them due warning of this, by raising up a few prophets, enlightening them so as to prepare the way. You know that some will listen, and that this will be enough for an enduring sense of right for at least a few thousand years. However you also know that the worst of the lot will turn against him, he’ll get himself crucified and he’ll have to come home, but that’s OK. Notwithstanding all of the trouble you’ve taken to get this lot on the road to eventual salvation, you also know that like the engineer in the earlier story, you’ll still have idle sidewalk oglers, who’ll be asking “Why didn’t you do it differently?” Some are never satisfied!

In 1828, Thomas Telford, the first President of the British Institution secured a Royal Charter which defined civil engineering as: “… being the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, …”. Possibly the besetting sin of the engineer is that of Prometheanism, placing himself in the place of God, of which he is sometimes accused by lesser mortals. Nevertheless, few of my professional colleagues cannot have had the experience of being subject to idle sidewalk oglers all unqualified to a man beholding their efforts, each one of them utterly convinced that any fool could do a far better job of whatever enterprise was being undertaken at the time. In local government work for instance it seemed a common habit of elected members of the employing authority wanting to make an otherwise undeserved name for themselves to make the engineer the whipping boy for the council’s own failures, as it seemed evident to them that every engineer was an incompetent idiot. Such comments inevitably stemmed from an inability to grasp the inherent problems that the engineer was struggling to master at the time. However the engineer is in good company. It is evident from the above thread, that mere mortals consider that they could do a far better job of creation than the Almighty, given the same starting materials and skills.

I know a great deal more about Genesis than you give credit for, and I dare say more so than even yourself! The problem of God’s omnipotence, perfection, innate goodness and foreknowledge, versus the problem of man’s free will and the pervasiveness of evil has exercised the greatest of minds since time immemorial. Solutions to it were attempted in the two creation stories of Genesis, in the writing of the book of Job, in Socrates who mistakenly thought it sufficient merely “to know the good”, in Plato’s unrealistic idealism, Plotinus’ neo Platonism which had a major impact on early Christian theology, in Augustine’s doctrine of original sin, and in Aquinas’ recovery of Aristotle’s philosophy from Averoes. However, the problem only occurs because of the importance they all give to anthropocentrism, I have said that “Nothing is impossible to God” and noted the inference this gives to what is in fact possible and impossible in creating a sentient being with free will capable of both good and evil. My rewriting of the Genesis story owes little to such mythologies of imagination, and the mental gymnastics of arm chair philosophers, and a great deal more to the scientific facts of the case. I am impressed with how life forms adapted remarkably quickly in their migration from South America to the hostile Galapagos in such a relatively short time as a few million years. This could only be possible if the innate property of adaptability was implanted in them. It required a struggle between competing individuals for dominance, and the dissolution of those unable to adapt, in fact a “selfish gene”. This pervades all of Creation, is the product of a wise God, but has consequences for the problem of evil. Man has now reached the stage in his development, where he can now seek solutions to many of these problems. Christianity provides a frame work, motivation and world view for so dealing with it. The way the world and the entire universe was created is evidently the best solution that is possible to be created. I would liken David Mo and other such commentators to the comforters in Job, or as in my story, to idle uninformed sidewalk oglers who ask “Why didn’t you do it differently?”.","date":"2015-01-10","mins":"2:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"id":"comment-182484","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"OK: The mythical story of the Garden of Eden in Gen II is extremely ancient, works at the metaphysical level and is the earlier of the two Creation stories, Gen I postdating the Babylonian captivity. Within the last year I have heard one of the best homilies ever, from a local scholarly priest on the subject of the Eden story, and he gave an excellent and humanly relevant interpretation of it for his congregation. However, I see it as essentially a primitive attempt to explain the human situation, which works primarily at the symbolic and psychological levels, and as an attempt to explain the origin of evil. I do not regard it in any way as an historic account of the rise of humankind from the primordial slime. In some ways it looks back nostalgically to a primitive time of the hunter gatherer foraging phase from within a more settled agricultural herding community. Rather than relying on such mythology, I have offered an entirely different approach based on what Science can tell us about Creation, from its very beginnings, endeavoured to explain the origin of perceived evils in an entirely different way, in some respects almost a necessary stage in an evolutionary account.

People may either accept them or reject them and I don’t mind either way. If they speak to anyone with a more scientific bent than mythological, that’s good! If they don’t, that’s also fine. I have already indicated that Creation in Gen II is an extremely ancient story, it was probably based on some kind of oral tradition. In Gen II, God is anthropomorphic, He makes a woman from out of Adam’s rib indicating that they are of the same kind, He “walks in the garden”, He can’t find Adam there and tries to search for him, He asks questions, “Where are you, Adam?”, there is a talking snake, and so on. Nevertheless, like all primal mythologies, it has its own particular truth which mainly operates at the symbolic and psychological levels, and which spoke to the people then and can speak to us now. During the 6th century BC, the Jewish people by their exile were exposed to the influence of Babylonian science, and one result of this was their writing down of the more cosmic Creation story of Gen I. Nevertheless they did not abandon the older story, but placed it second in their setting down of the book of Genesis. The setting down of Genesis I more accurately records the sequential order of the actual Creation process. The “days of Creation” are of course not actual days of 24 hours, as reportedly explained by Pope John XXIII to Nikita Krushchev when they first met. Or as another biblical text has it, a day in God’s eyes can be a thousand years, and a thousand years can be but a day. The perception of evils experienced by mankind, and promoted as an argument against God’s existence by David Mo and others, is based on the false premise that man is the supreme good. There is a higher good, which may be found in necessity. Man has been endowed with reason and intelligence, which enables him to progressively deal with the evils which trouble his species.

My comments: 1) Jason – Jesus & long hair. Check out any image collection of Jewish Rabbis. For example: http://www.fotosearch.com/photos images/rabbi.html Except for modern liberals/radicals, and lady rabbis, they all usually wear long hair and untrimmed beards. There are any number of other examples. Just Google ‘jewish rabbis images’, there are vast quantities of images of Jewish rabbis. When archaeologists start digging in Jerusalem, they are soon confronted by long haired bearded ultra orthodox ready to stone them. Check out the recent video of Barrie Schwortz. Sparse and all as it may be (still more than what I have), Barrie wears what hair he has, long and there’s also a tuft of beard! The earliest icons of Jesus tended to follow the Greek & Roman models of short hair and were beardless. There was a major change in the 6th century to a long haired bearded Jesus, and there are strong correspondences with the Shroud image suggesting it may have been the template for the facial image. St Augustine claimed that no one knew what Jesus looked like. But he lived in the West and wouldn’t have understood the reasons for these icon representations. The evangelicals’ argument for a short haired beardless Jesus, seems to be little more than a recent reaction to traditional Catholic portayals of Jesus. Possibly they may be influenced by their own westernised image of what constitutes proper Christian appearance. In other words they seek to make God in their own image and likeness instead of the other way around. Thankfully they haven’t yet got him in a white shirt and tie with matching dark jacket and pin striped trousers! 2) Did Jesus exist? The idea that Jesus never existed as a real person is far more prevalent than is generally realised. There is a considerable body of scholarly opinion ready to argue that Jesus is little more than a fanciful re creation from classical myths and legends. These assertions are addressed in an excellent work “Did Jesus Exist” by Bart Ehrman, an agnostic professor of New Testament studies, currently head of Religious Studies at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Ehrman makes a strong case for the existence of Jesus as a real historical person, providing several independent sources, and responding to the denyers. Check out his blog site at: http://ehrmanblog.org/did jesus exist as part one/ His book is available through Amazon. I read a copy from my local public library. The Shroud gives testimony that a person suffered the extreme punishment of crucifixion in a manner described by the gospels, and provides supplementary corroboration of the real existence of the man Jesus. 3) Question of the reality of the Resurrection: Some 15 years or so ago, I presented a seminar paper on the works of Catholic radical theologian Hans Kung. It seemed to me as I recall that Kung was prepared to interpret the Resurrection as a mystical or symbolic event, but which had no necessarily historical reality. At the time, I thought that here was an interpretation that many would be Christians would be able to accept, and so remove a hurdle to their belief. It is a fact of our times that many would be Christians are of a similar view, that the Resurrection as a real historical event is a hurdle that denies their full acceptance of Christianity. The liberal radicals, such as those in the ‘Jesus Seminar’ cannot accept it, seeing it as illogical and unthinkable. In my previous posting #8 above, I posed a set of questions concerning the Shroud: “Why is the image that of an uncorrupted body, why are there no smears or tears in the cloth from removal of the body from its sticky surroundings, and where is the body that goes with this burial cloth??” There is only one reasonable answer!.","date":"2013-05-06","mins":"11:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33116","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"More on long hair: The evangelicals main scriptural argument for a short haired Jesus, comes from I Corinthians 11:14. The USCCB version reads: “Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears his hair long it is a disgrace to him.” The Jerusalem Bible has the milder translation: “… and whether nature itself does not tell you that long hair on a man is nothing to be admired,…” Now Paul was addressing this to the brethren in Corinth, a long way from Jerusalem. He himself was from Tarsus in Cilicia, (now southern Turkey) which in 67 BC, became a province of Rome under Mark Anthony. Tarsus also had a famous school of Stoic philophers, and Paul enjoyed Roman citizenship as a privilege granted the previous century to his military forbears. So we are talking fashionable Greek and Roman hair styles here, and not how a proper Jew in Jerusalem might groom himself. As Saul, he had joined the Pharisee sect, avid for the literal compliance with the Law of Moses, but upon his conversion he seems to have turned his back on this and now castigated this Law which could not save. His mission was concerned with gentiles, Greeks and Romans, and the Jews had rejected him. He himself had only ever seen Jesus as if in a vision, not in ordinary mortal life. He closes off the discussion at verse 16: “But if anyone is inclined to be argumentative, we do not have such a custom, nor do the churches of God.” The whole section vv 4 16, is directed at appropriate dress in a Corinthian Christian church, no room for any long haired hippies hair nor weirdie beardies. Nevertheless, long hair and beards continue to be the normal style in Jewsish congregations to this very day. Jesus had long hair and a beard! I wonder if Paul would have banned him from attending church? Interesting Shroud foot note on Tarsus. During the Roman and early Byzantine periods, Tarsus was one of the leading cities of the Eastern Empire, with an economy based on agriculture and AN IMPORTANT LINEN INDUSTRY. Modern Tarsus continues to be a prosperous agricultural and cotton milling centre..","date":"2013-05-07","mins":"1:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33147","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"1) Long hair again: Firstly I am not being dismissive of 1 Cor 11:4 16. But I see it in the context of what was to be considered the proper conformity of dress and appearance of a Corinthian Christian in the 1st century, as addressed by a missionary well familiar with Greek and Roman culture. It might be seen as unnecessarily socially provocative not to conform in this way. To then argue that therefore Christ was necessarily short haired and beardless is grasping a straw and to read a message into scripture that is not there. Ian Wilson in his 2010 book “The Shroud” gives several pictorial or iconic images of Christ. Until the 5th century, there were occasional portrayals of Christ as short haired and beardless. From the 6th century, concurrent with the discovery of the Image of Edessa, whatever that might have been, the icons become standardised with long hair and forked beard. You may look in vain for images of 1st century Jews to discover their hair style, as you would be aware that they were averse to any kind of images. However in his 1978 “The Turin Shroud”, Wilson cites two authorities quite independently of the Shroud, H Gressman and Daniel Rops. Gressman’s work is in German; Daniel Rops work is “Daily Life in Palestine at the Time of Christ” (Londom Weidenfeld 1962). Wilson points out that Aaron, Moses’ brother is specifically stated as having a beard, and beards were only shaved off as a sign of deepest mourning. Gressman has apparently shown that an unbound pigtail was a common fashion for Jewish men in antiquity in the simple form of long hair caught at the back of the neck. Daniel Rops claims that except on public holidays Jewish men wore this pigtail plaited and rolled up under their head gear. 2) Matthias – Bart Ehrman: Ehrman as I recall claims to have been brought up as a conservative evangelical. He now claims to be an agnostic, not necessarily an atheist. Nevertheless he seems to be an excellent New Testament scholar, and his work on “Did Jesus Exist” I found quite intriguing. I found I was not able to agree with him on some minor technical details. For example he denies the the idea of the resurrection cycle of ancient fertility gods. I was only too well aware of the Phoenician Baal cycle epic having presented a seminar paper on that topic, which would contradict Ehrman’s viewpoint. There also seemed to me to be a few other minor errors. As he claims to be an agnostic, I would be cautious in accepting what he might have to say about Christ’s divinity, not having read the work. However he might have a useful perspective on how this viewpoint developed in the early church if based on cited sources, as I expect he would. 3) Importance of Resurrection – Marcus Borg: I rather suspect that Borg’s viewpoint might not be too far removed from Kung’s which I mentioned previously. I mentioned that it had some appeal for me at the time I read it, as I saw it as removing a barrier to Resurrection skepticism. I no longer hold this view, partly because the Shroud persuades me that it was a real historical event. As for what Resurrection is or was, we only have the NT accounts, supplemented by various orthodox Christian writers, to be read with proper judgment, and an authoritative teaching church. I cite Paul from memory: “If Christ be not risen from the dead, then our faith is in vain!”.","date":"2013-05-07","mins":"8:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33310","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is certain that Jesus was not an Essene. The sect observed a form of ritual purity even more extreme than the Pharisees which is completely at odds with the teachings of Jesus in the gospels. However, it is possible that the group of Jesus and his followers may have observed the Essene calendar which was more ancient than then commonly observed. We might speculate whether the Essene calendar still prevailed in Galilee. Scholars have attempted various explanations for the disconnect between the Synoptics and Johannine gospels on this point. The Paschal lamb sacrifice was associated only with the first night of the Exodus and after that only upon the entry into the Promised Land and while both Solomon’s Temple and the Second Temple still functioned. It would not have been observed during the Babylonian Exile. It was discontinued with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. It is now only practised by Samaritans on Mount Gerizim. The Jewish Seder meal now only includes a lamb’s shank bone in memory of those times. A Jewish group in recent times sought to resume the sacrifice on Temple Mount but the authorities rejected the proposal as being too provocative. As the requirement for a paschal lamb involved temple sacrifice, a conventional paschal lamb would not have been available at the Last Supper if John’s account that the crucifixion occurred on Preparation Day is accepted. We may conjecture that the early Christians, including the evangelists may have read back into the Last Supper (a farewell meal) the meaning of a Passover meal with Jesus as the symbolic Paschal Lamb, and with the Passover observance so imminent. In many respects, such as the timing of the crucifixion when the lambs were to be sacrificed, this symbolism is singularly appropriate. John P Meier addresses the issue in his “Marginal Jew”. The following is an extract from my notes: “Although all evangelists agree that the crucifixion occurred on a Friday, John’s gospel asserts that this was also Preparation Day (Jn 19:31) making the Sabbath (Saturday) the day of Passover, a Sabbath of special solemnity therefore, and the reason why the bodies could not remain on their crosses.” “The synoptics on the other hand seem to envisage that the Last Supper was intended as the meal for Jesus and his disciples to observe their Passover. Scholars have attempted assorted solutions to resolve this problem. These have included assertions that there were various practices within Jewry, including one claiming that the meal actually occurred on a Tuesday thus allowing more time for the subsequent events to unfold, or that the synoptic verses connecting the meal to Passover were late stage insertions. Meier opts for John’s statement that Friday was in fact Preparation Day, making the year either 30 or 33 AD. Possibly the first Christians saw the Last Supper, with its institution of the Eucharist, as supplanting the Passover rites, and therefore ascribed it a comparable status in the synoptics.” (Meier finanally adopts Thursday, April 6, 30 AD for the evening of the Last Supper).","date":"2013-05-09","mins":"5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33372","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A quick check of Michael Molnar’s eclipse web site and the summary book reviews suggest he seems to have done a thorough job of research, on the astronomy events, and the then cultural perceptions of astrology. However I would certainly hesitate to place any significance on astrological interpretations or predictions. There have been various suggestions for an explanation of the Star of Bethlehem as there were a number of planetary conjunctions around this time. For eight months in 7 BC, Jupiter and Saturn were within 3 degrees of each other; There was a triple conjunction of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter in early 6 BC. Chinese annals record novae in 5 BC and 4 BC. As to Jesus’ age, you need to relook your math. If born in 6 BC, he would be aged 36 in 30 AD and aged 39 in 33 AD, the two favoured dates for the crucifixion when Preparation Day fell on a Friday. Herod the Great died in 4 BC, so 6 BC is a credible date for Jesus’ birth. From Luke 3:1, John the Baptizer began his preaching between the Augusts of 28 AD and 29 AD. This would support the synoptic inference of 18 months for Jesus’ mission if he died in 30 AD but is a problem for the 3 year mission inferred from John’s gospel. It cannot be known if Matthew’s story of the “magi” and the star is recording a real event or is a literary device. For example no other source records Matthew’s story of Herod’s slaughter of the infants, although there were several riots in Jerusalem around this time resulting in mass crucifixions and Herod’s arteriosclerosis had advanced, making him mentally unstable. There are three reasons why Matthew would use such a literary device. The first is that astrological signs were an accepted way of underlining and emphasising the importance of major events, such as the birth of a messiah, king or great leader. The second reason is that Matthew is speaking to a gentile church, so he brings in gentile wise men (Luke has Jewish shepherds). Matthew includes gentiles in Jesus’ genealogy and Jesus cures a Roman centurion’s servant and a Canaanite’s daughter. A third reason is that Matthew wants to proclaim Jesus as the new Moses and so wants to bring him out of Egypt, but he has to get him down there first. So whether the story is actual or a way of stressing the significance of Jesus’ birth can be optional. You pays your money, and you makes your choice!

I think he was merely drawing attention to the Christian view that Jesus was the true Paschal lamb. Whereas the synoptics set out to establish the meal as an observance of Passover, John 13:1 deliberately states that it was before the festival of Passover, and then at Jn 13:2 introduces the farewell meal merely by saying “They were at supper …” with no indication that this is intended as a Passover meal. Not even the institution of the eucharist is mentioned, but is only foretold by the discourse on the “Bread of Life” back in chapter 6. The long discourses in John’s account of the Last Supper cover new and other material entirely, quite distinct from that in the synoptics. I think it is a fair bet, that the symbolism of Jesus as the Paschal Lamb was read back into the compilation of the proto synoptics, so that the farewell meal was then given the status of the disciples’ Passover meal. However, the Dead Sea scrolls reveal that a community following a solar calendar observed the Passover on a Tuesday, and it is credible that the disciples may also have done this. In that case the synoptics have compressed a juridical process that may have taken a few days into a few hours.

Much of early religious beliefs which still survive originated in Iran, which were in turn influenced by Hinduism. Whereas much or our early science originated in Iraq – the Babylonians for instance developed an extremely sophisticated numbering system with a base 60 and it included a zero place holder, and this survived well into the 13th century and was even used by early European mathematicians. When we come to Saint Paul, his home city of Tarsus was a renown centre of Stoicism, so we can expect that Paul had been exposed to some Greco Roman philosophy. Extract from Encyc Brit:. “Once the basis of Paul’s thought in the context of Jewish concepts of his time is understood in the light of modern scholarship, uncompromising predestinarian views of some of Calvin’s followers can be seen to be an overly rigid interpretation of Paul’s meaning. Attempts to derive Paul’s ideas from Greek or Gnostic influences have been largely abandoned. Paul stands out more clearly as a Christian Jew, whose conversion experience convinced him that Christ was the universal Lord under God, the agent and leader of God’s kingdom. Paul thus maintained that through Christ every barrier is broken down: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:28)” However Paul had been trained as a Pharisee, and as the word indicates, this in turn had developed from the Persian Parsees, The pagan Iranian god Mithra, derives from the Hindu Mitra. He was seen as the god of contract and agreement, was associated with the creation through the sacrifice of a bull, and this ritual survived even into the later Roman version of Mithraism. With the development of Zorastrianism,in Persia (6th C BC), the Mithraic cult slowly went into decline, but with some residues surviving. Zoroastrianism was essentially dualistic, and might be creditied with such development as angels, devils, ideas on the soul, and other aspects we can see in the later Wisdom literature. The Greeks never accepted Mithraism because it was associated with their old Persian enemies. However about 100 AD, it took some hold in Roman military circles, and became associated with emperor worship. The Jewish exiles in Babylon from the 6th C BC, were exposed to much of their thought, and it influenced redactions of the scriptures. For example Ch 1 of Genesis was written as a consequence of exposure to Babylonian science, and supplemented the anthromorphic Jawhisitic account which was relegated to chapter 2, and they also took the Babylonian flood stories and gave them a divine meaning through adding to their earlier stories of Noah. From about 200 BC, many of the released exiles settled in Alexandria, a major centre of scholarship with their massive library, whence we have the Septuagint additions. Jews here were no doubt influenced by Egyptian funerary rites, and also by Greek Platonism, The origins of a resurrection theology, and the concepts of the soul were likely influenced by these. What can we make of this syncretic approach to religion? My own personal view of such matters is that not only did man pursue God in the distant past, but God also pursues man according to his divine plan. I am much minded of Francis Thompson’s epic poem “The Hound of Heaven” in this pursuit. Much more could be written than what I have briefly sketched above, and a good text on Man’s Religions might elucidate more, but there is also much out there that is quite erroneous. One needs to search out the more reputable accounts..","date":"2012-10-04","mins":"7:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/29/blogger-please-dont-get-upset-if-your-catholic/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Blogger: Please don’t get upset if you are Catholic"},{"id":"comment-17062","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Iceangel71 makes the same error as those carbon dating the Shroud.

There is a quaint irony in the Caiaphas family ossuary, in that Caiaphas was a Saducee who did not believe in the general resurrection of the body. The ossuary custom arose in late Judaism because of the development of a resurrection doctrine among the Pharasaic sect from about 200 BC. Did Caiaphas come to believe that there might be something in the doctrine after all? There are apocryphal writings suggesting that he may have done. Or was his family merely following the current social custom? The ossuaries of Simon of Cyrene and his two sons have also been found.

What I had written now appears under its own posting (I agree [x 3] Mostly!], but I don’t see Fr Dunk’s response there. It was certainly not intended to set off a debate on Argumentum ad Ignorantium, but as a brief summary of a few enigmatic properties, particularly the orthogonality of the image, which suggests to me some kind of vertically directed action. That some observe minor distortions, suggests to me minor random fluctuations in a type of naturalistic process, whereas we might expect a degree of absolute perfection if it were the result of a kind of divine intervention. I make little secret of my pro authenticity preference, but cheerfully admit that I am no wiser about whatever process was involved than any other as well informed correspondent. While I might admire Hugh Farey’s attempts at scientific rigour, I tend to the view that such rigour has yet to demonstrate that it can enlighten, I suspect because his science seems to prefer a deductive approach, whereas there is an insuffient factual basis for a deductive approach to bear useful fruit. An inductive approach, making what appear to be reasonable inferences seems to me to offer better chances of a degree of success. Furthermore, in the deductive approach, I believe salient observations and inferences can be missed. For example, Hugh seems reluctant to accept that there is adequate evidence that the image is that of Jesus Christ. He does not seem ready to accept this as a reasonable conclusion, notwithstanding the evidence of a “cap of thorns” for example. And yet there is only one reason why Jesus was so capped, it was modelled on the crown of Eastern kings, and lampooned the charge of claiming to be “King of the Jews”. A reasonable inference surely, but it is apparently not good enough for Hugh! It is the reluctance to accept what to reasonable people seems to be a reasonable inference, that is tending me to the conclusion to wonder just what useful conclusions, such a rigorous approach can in fact yield, and I fear that the answer might be in fact “very little”!

Assuming that the body was lying on its back, this tends to confirm the effect of a vertical imaging action, rather than a body normal action. Can Hugh or anyone else think of a cause for this? The top of the head is in fact “represented”, as a vertical projection. If we are to insist on a “strictly scientific” approach, then accuracy in expressing ideas is essential. It is quite clear from the blood flows around the head, that the cap at least pretty well covered most of the head, if not indeed all of it. From the various ancient authors who give some details about particular crucifixions, none mention that any were so capped, but it is specifically mentioned in the case of Jesus, and the reason for it easily inferred. None of the others so capped, if indeed there were any, left behind any evidence of it. Nevertheless I can find a point of agreement with Hugh, that there is little room for dogmatism if there are credible alternative different views about conclusions, but not so much if they rely entirely on idle speculations or fantasy. However one can be dogmatic about the very existence of the TS, and on whatever agreement there might be about what it shows. The question “Do we need more?”: Maybe not, if you’re only a dabbler.

A concise summary of the paper as slides, also with the relevant figures, can be found at: http://www.sindonology.org/papers/latendresse2005a Slides.pdf The slides also give some important key measurements. Nevertheless, I feel that the sheet has been draped over the model in a somewhat idealised way, in that the sheet has been placed symmetrically over the body. It is not too difficult to imagine that when laying out a real body, that the shroud could easily become wrinkled, off centre, and skewed; if the shroud was wrapped in any way around the body, then parts of the cloth would also no longer be symmetrical about the centre. These effects may account for any apparent loss of symmetry in the image. Off topic: Mario shows the top of the sheet loosely draped at the top of the head. Previous discussion has tended to conclude that the shroud was drawn firmly over the top of the head, because of head measurements between the facial and occiput images, even though there is no top of head image which requires another explanation (e.g. A head cloth). My fundamental point is that it is not necessary to look for distortions in the body to account for any loss of symmetry.

Yet they are not all equal, some of them being particularly outstanding in qualities of steadfastness and patience under trial. Abraham, Noah, Moses, and Jesus were such great prophets.

For many, specific relics, tokens and cultural practices are their way of coming to know God, and of worshiping the One who is ineffable. The “Vatican” does not need to give its imprimatur to this relic or that. It is generally sufficient for an alleged relic to have a reasonable record of provenance. Certain icons have been hallowed by centuries, or even millenia, of veneration by a countless number of faithful worshippers. Others more recent can uplift by presenting a fresh insight. Doubtless some alleged Passion relics may be of dubious authenticity. Their value is in what is called to mind by their particular form rather than by their substance.

In my comments above, perhaps I also ought to have mentioned the accuracy of the blood flows first reported by agnostic Sorbonne professor of comparative anatomy, Yves Delage to the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1902. British Medical journal ‘The Lancet’ and the London Times reviewed the findings as well reasoned and scientific, and ‘Paris Figaro’ also voiced its support. However the Paris Acadamy was so dominated by ‘rationalists’ and ‘free thinkers’ that the Academy refused to publish the full text of the lecture. In his “final” letter to ‘Revue Scientifique’, Delage stated: “… I recognize Christ as a historical personage, and I see no reason why anyone should be scandalized that there still exist material traces of his earthly life.” It is evident that scientific bodies and individual scientists are not immune from their own kind of rationalistic fanaticism, every bit as much as any evangelical Biblical literalist or jihadist. Nicolaus Steno (1638 86), founder of modern geology, encountered similar hostility from the scientific establishment of his time. They all believed that sea shell fossils either grew in the parent rock or were residues from Noah’s flood. Steno’s only support was from Gottfried Leibnitz and the Catholic Church who had apparently learnt their lesson from the Galileo saga. It is not just one piece of supporting evidence that is decisive in favour of the Shroud cloth, such as the “photographic negative” aspect, but as in any modern and enlightened Court of Law, it is the total weight of all the evidence that matters.

He was born in 1918 and is now 95, and as far as I know aspires to be as reasonably active as any person can be at that age. He is widely regarded in NZ as the Grand Old Man of extremely radical Religious Studies. Just Google on “Lloyd Geering” – the Wiki article is reasonably accurate, and you can see there that he enjoys several civil honours, including the Order of New Zealand and a knighthood. He has been a remarkably prolific writer, the ‘Fishpond’ site listing several of his works. His radicalism outdistances the likes of Cupitt, Spong, Crossan et al by several miles. He has been a leading participant in the Jesus Seminar movement. Up until quite recently he was the principal pastor of ‘St Matthew’s on the Terrace’ in the central city, Wellington, a church formerly Presbyterian, but now given over to a ‘catch all’ congregation. He first came to public prominence in 1967, when as a Presbyterian minister, a conservative group in New Plymouth city charged him with heresy for denying the reality of the Resurrection, accusations of heresy being a not infrequent occurence in NZ Presbyterianism. The proceedings were extensively reported in the daily newspapers throughout NZ at the time, rather surprising in the officially secular state that NZ claims to be. He was eventually acquitted, but the extensive publicity had served him and his purposes well. It gave some impetus to the study of Religions in NZ universities. Unfortunately, part of his legacy will be to take NZ further down the road towards a national atheism, and a somewhat anti religious bias, denying the founding missionary culture that has in fact formed much of our ethos. I have attended a few of Lloyd Geering’s lectures, and spoken with him, as he has been in much demand as a speaker and ‘authority’ on religious matters generally. The dichotomy in his professed atheism but continuing participation in religious affairs I find difficult to comprehend. A now deceased acquaintance close to the heresy trial had commented to me that he seemed to cut a somewhat pathetic figure. However such a personal view belies the extensive albeit negative influence he has had on the perception of religious matters in this country.

I surmise that the only reason why Crossan postulates that Jesus was scavenged by wild dogs, is that it was the common fate of many crucifixion victims. However, I recall that Barbet was able to cite sources that families could request the bodies, and that permission would be granted as a matter of routine, except for the worst offences such as piracy, rebellion and treason. The taking of bribes to allow the release of bodies was considered a severe moral offence. The four gospel accounts are more or less corroborative, so that Crossan’s grounds for dismissing them seem somewhat flimsy. I had not encountered Barbara Thiering previously, but she seems to out Pagels Pagels. Jesus scholar Geza Vermes commented on her work: “Professor Barbara Thiering’s reinterpretation of the New Testament, in which the married, divorced, and remarried Jesus, father of four, becomes the “Wicked Priest” of the Dead Sea Scrolls, has made no impact on learned opinion. Scroll scholars and New Testament experts alike have found the basis of the new theory, Thiering’s use of the so called “pesher technique”, without substance.” N T Wright has written: “It is safe to say that no serious scholar has given this elaborate and fantastic theory any credence whatsoever. It is nearly ten years since it was published; the scholarly world has been able to take a good look at it: and the results are totally negative.” The author of Revelations of course allows that Satan will be allowed to roam but will ultimately be defeated Rev 20:10. I have often thought that the Book of Job was the closest that anyone ever came to resolving the problem of evil, why bad things happen to good people.

No authenticist can accept the C14 results as representing the true age of the Shroud, and there are several reasons for coming to the conclusion that it is indeed the burial cost of Christ and dates from that time. History attests that such an object did indeed exist, even well into Byzantine times, but it disappeared from Constantinople following Venetian and Frankish crusaders sacking the city of its gold and relics, Several forensic pathologists have studied the present relic and have come to the conclusion that the image is that of a real crucified man who in addition suffered the gratuitous mockery punishment of a crown of thorns. The stains on it are anthropoid blood and likely that of the victim. There is only one known person who was capable of vacating his burial apparel leaving it intact. There is much additional corroborative evidence. So that the belief that the Shroud is authentic is not at all irrational. David Goulet makes the point “The fact we are even having this conversation is proof that the sampling was flawed” and that is a valid point. As Sampath states, the sampling was not composite and breached the original sampling protocols designed by Chagas, himself a skeptic as to authenticity, but which would satisfy correct scientific sampling criteria. In the face of this breach, it is not incumbent upon authenticists to demonstrate heterogeneity of the Shroud to make their case, but it is incumbent upon the C 14 protagonists to demonstrate their case that it is homogeneous. This can only done by composite sampling, and to date that assertion rests only on unaided visual inspection, while many questions persist casting doubt on the sample taken, notwithstanding Hugh Farey’s uncritical and unscientific protests of the validity of these highly dubious results.

Zugbibe disputed the finer details of Barbet’s analysis, but despite this he displayed no illusions that the cloth was that of a real crucified male, nor did he debate whether or not the evidence of the crown of thorns was faulty. Other forensic pathologists took a similar line. Even though he is not a professional palinologist, Hugh himself vigorously attacked the question of pollens, despite the fact that professional palinologists had asserted that there were pollen residues exclusive to Palestine, and even so, Hugh himself was unable to exclude them completely. Daniel Scavone has provided not merely one historical reference for evidence that the burial cloth was in Constantinople, but several references. It is true that some authenticist historians dispute whether all such references refer to the Shroud, but some at least seem to be clearly specific, particularly if those that might refer to the Mandylion are excluded. The cumulative effect of the record makes a strong case that it was indeed there. Hugh’s response does not deal adequately with the question concerning homogeneity, which at present can only be based on unaided visual inspection, and he continues to imply fallaciously that it is the authenticists’ responsibility to demonstrate heterogeneity despite the opportunity for composite sampling to prove his case being abandoned, because of an unproven inference. Furthermore, no one yet can explain how the image of a real crucified male that persuades pathologists of its organic origin, came to be expressed on the cloth. I cannot recall a single case of where any pathologist was ever fooled into imagining that any painting of a person or an image of a metallic template was the impression of a real human being, whether in life or in death.

And although a grounding in statistics and probability theory had been part of the course I was still not satisfied. I obtained my first formal qualification in Statistics and Probability the following year in 1963, the two set text books being by A H Mood of the RAND Corporation, and P G Hoel of the University of California, both classics of their type. That a great uncle had founded the Statistics department at the University of Melbourne and authored text books on the subject some decades earlier is purely incidental. In the ensuing years I built on this foundation, developing skills in quality control, inspection systems, queuing theory, accident analysis, flood predictions, earthquake engineering, hazards analysis, projects evaluation, along with many others. In all of them, statistics and probability theory were often a significant part of the analysis. I learnt about Operations Research, Game Theory, Monte Carlo Simulation, Reliability Theory, Markov Chains, Probability Generating Functions, and various other arcane techniques. Towards the end of my career, I had been designing sampling systems for various Audit groups, and providing the needed assurances on various capital projects with inherently uncertain outcomes. I had meantime added to my statistics library including advanced works by William Feller of Princeton, and Sheldon M Ross of Berkeley, among various others. It is now nearly 15 years since I retired from all that, and with advancing years, I have probably now forgotten some of the more esoteric techniques. I can still manage a Monte Carlo simulation, but a Markov Chain might be more of a challenge. It remains a rapidly advancing discipline and doubtless new techniques have also since come to light. I can however still remember the fundamental principles. A quote from my first text book by P G Hoel, in his Chapter 12 on Statistical Design in Experiments seems apposite: “It is a common experience for experimenters who are unacquainted with statistical principles to seek statistical assistance when their experiments fail to produce the results anticipated by them. In some experiments the data were obtained in such a manner as to exclude any valid conclusions of the type desired; in others there is little that can be done to extract further information from the data because the experiment was not designed with a statistical analysis in mind. Only rarely are the experiments that give valid conclusions as sensitive as they would have been if a standard statistical design had been employed. Too many experimenters do not seem to appreciate the obvious injunction that the time to design an experiment is before the experiment is begun.” Hoel goes on to give a few simple elementary illustrations including the design of a simple agricultural experiment. Mood makes much the same observations in his Chapter 7 on Sampling, only in different words. It is evident that homogeneity cannot be assumed in any experiment, but that heterogeneity is to be expected, and is indeed the normal situation. Nothing statistically significant can be said about the results from a single sample. Certainly the record shows that contrary to Hoel’s injunction, the participants in the 1988 radiocarbon C14 sampling of the Shroud had not appreciated that the time to design an experiment was before it had begun. The foreplay had been acrimonious, the debates as to the sampling site prolonged, and the concern for conservation overplayed. It is ironic that even when this single sample had been divided among the three laboratories, there were variations such that a statistical trend across the sample became evident, suggesting the likelihood of heterogeneity. It remains a blight on the history of science that such eminent laboratories agreed to such an approach. Why did they do it? Answer, Because they had so much to gain in reputation by demonstrating their new technique, and contrariwise so much to lose if they had abdicated. The 1988 C14 result is statistically meaningless..","date":"2014-11-16","mins":"4:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"id":"comment-171475","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Emmett you can very quickly bring up the biblical text you want to check, if you have some idea of whereabouts the text is.

I dare say some of them were as familiar with the work of Hoel and Mc Farlane Mood as daveb.” I should doubt very much that any of them were so familiar, for it is a common enough omission in the training of young scientists as their first priority is always to concentrate on their particular specialty until they attain their doctorate level. Their statistical training is typically only ever superficial. It is manifest in the laboratories claiming of a 95% confidence limit in their test results which is clearly incorrect and could only apply to the individual sample piece. The claim that it applies to the entire cloth rests on an unsupported supposition that the sample was representative. I regret to say that it is also apparent enough in the responses given here by a trained scientist. It was also apparent in the uncomprehending responses of scientist Professor Luigi Gonella to the searching queries raised by archaeologist William Meacham who exceptionally seems to have been fully aware of the need for properly representative sampling. I make few additional claims to my own competence in these matters that are not also shared by any other professional properly trained in the disciplines of statistical mathematics and probability theory. I became passionate about the subject and made the effort to attain that competence. There may be other engineers or scientists who have made similar efforts. I may even have met one or two but not many. The paper “Chronological History of the Evidence for the Anomalous Nature of the C 14 Sample Area of the Shroud of Turin” by Joseph G. Marino and Edwin J.

However, not all will agree with that opinion and for the present we may set those aside. In an Appendix they provide a further 32 points of evidence. These were to address important points of the C 14 process, specifically: “a) the need to exercise caution in giving too much importance to it as an individual test; b) the method’s limitations; and c) the need to place the test in a multi disciplinary context. The C 14 aspects also give important historical background information leading up to the 1988 testing.” In an editorial footnote, they refer to a subsequent Addendum to the paper, which lists yet a further 26 points of evidence. Much of the Addendum is taken up with Meacham’s objections from his book passionately entitled, “The Rape of the Turin Shroud: How Christianity’s most precious relic was wrongly condemned and violated.” The Marino – Prior paper and its Addendum can be read at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/chronology.pdf http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/addendum.pdf If correspondents read nothing else about this matter, then they should at least read the Addendum, so they may be adequately informed about these issues..","date":"2014-11-16","mins":"10:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"id":"comment-171596","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It doesn’t matter a great deal if the experiment is the performance of a fertiliser on a plot of land, the evaluation of a new drug, the frequency history of flood flows in a rainfall catchment, the geographic distribution of earthquake intensities, the derailment frequency of railway wagons, or the radiocarbon dating of a 4 metre long linen Shroud.

Much of the above discussion is of the Either – Or variety. I suggest that it may be so complex, that we do not really know what can be excluded, and that it requires some combination of causes. They may include chemical, physical, internal, external, particulate or radiation or various combinations. If amines are involved, there may be a clue in the imaging cut off distance of about 4 cm. Hugh has made the point that cadaverine and putrescine will rapidly permeate over a large area even beyond his laboratory doors. If they were directly involved in the process, we would expect there to be a much larger cut off distance in the imaging process, so perhaps as Max says, they are a red herring. Perhaps it is in a short lived precursor, such as lysine, or some other amine like chemical. Bodily chemicals which may become available at time of death are several, complex, and they interact. Until an effort of concentrated study is made by those competent in this field of chemistry, to set out what the credible options might be, I feel so much of any discussion on the topic will remain as useless speculation. If Colin Berry had had a less agenda driven experimental programme, than attempting to demonstrate how an entirely fictitious artisan could forge the image, than in discovering how such an image might have occurred by a naturalistic means, then all his work might have had results rather more intriguing than otherwise.

His hypothetical explanation of a wetted cloth that stretches and then shrinks back to its original shape won’t do the job without distortion occurring, Even if the particulates that formed the image were somehow constrained to act solely in the vertical direction, there would still be distortion, and the sides of the body would also be imaged, but they are not. The Latendresse model is the cloth disposition that would allow orthogonality of the image. I am sympathetic to Yannick’s hypothesis that the image may have formed by some unknown natural means, because of some exceptional circumstances concerning the burial, such as its environment in the tomb, and the use of myrrh, aloes and other herbs and flora. David Hines experiments in this field seem intriguing, and possibly promising. The occurrence of an earthquake with its after shocks, release of radon gas, and the concurrent variations in the geo electro magnetic fields might also have been a necessary factor, for all we know. As other correspondents have mentioned, the integrity of the blood clots seem to exclude the deliberate removal of the body by persons unknown. Although very few other cases of imaging of corpses are known, it would be unusual to inspect shroud wrappings of a corpse after three days to see if any imaging had in fact occurred. Any subsequent unwrapping after three days, then any imaging may have been blotted by putrefaction effects. I suggest it would be pointless to examine the modern wrappings of corpses, as the circumstances of Jesus’ burial would not be fully replicated.

You do not indicate whether the option you favour is a miraculous occurrence, or that by the hand of an artisan. The orthogonal presentation of the image is I believe a particular problem for some assumptions for the arrangements of the cloth. I have difficulty with a tightly wrapped body, which I would expect to show images of the sides, as well as a distorted widening of the image. For orthogonality to occur with no images of the sides, I think we would have to expect that at the time of image formation, both the ventral and dorsal aspects of the cloth would need to be fairly close to being planar, such as might occur with a photographic plate. I see at least two possible ways that this might occur. John’s gospel asserts that Nicodemus brought some 100 pounds (Roman) of myrrh and aloes (a lot). In addition the burial occurred in a garden during the spring, when there would be ample foliage and flora at hand. If the sides of the body were packed with the myrrh, aloes, foliage etc before being tightly wrapped, then both the front and back of the cloth might be just sufficiently planar to present an orthogonal image, and also conceal the sides of the body. Such packing of the body might also allow later family visits to be relatively free from the stench of putrefaction. Alternatively, as the time was getting close to evening when a Great Sabbath would commence at about 6:00 pm, then the work of burial may have been cursory only, with the intention to complete it after the Sabbath. In that case the cloth may have been loosely draped under and over the body, which may have allowed orthogonality. Clearly also, the burial party would have disposed in some way of Nicodemus’ package, it is interesting that it is deliberately mentioned by John. Finally I suggest you refer to Mario Latendresse’s paper where he endeavours to demonstrate how the image might be satisfactorily explained using a live model: “The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened Before the Images Formed and no Major Image Distortions Necessarily Occur from a Real Body” Mario Latendresse, Ph.D The full paper can be read at: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.160.656 You may prefer merely to check his slide show, which is self explanatory: http://www.sindonology.org/papers/latendresse2005a Slides.pdf I am not entirely happy with a miraculous explanation, as in that case I would expect a greater degree of perfection and total absence of any distortion, and even greater clarity.

There are obvious errors in that argument. Way back on Oct 5, 11:05 am, O.K. Provided a reputable source saying that it was an Orthodox practice, and gave an explanation for it, whether or not the source is accepted, or perhaps rejected because it did not suit David Mo’s point of view. Max has provided a number of Jewish examples where coins have been found in skulls, or in ossuaries, or in sarcophagi, and this is at least suggestive that the practice was at least sporadic if not more frequent. The fact that not all cases were found on the eye sockets is easily disposed of because afterwards the bones were placed in ossuaries and there was then no point in replacing the coins on the eye sockets. Furthermore, members of Jesus’ burial party may have been influenced by Hellenist customs. I agree that the Domenico counterexample of there being very few shrouds found in Jewish burials is not relevant, for the simple reason that it was more common at that time for the bones to be placed in ossuaries, and it would seem that any remnants of burial shrouds or other burial garments would have then been normally disposed of, possibly burnt. The TS survived only because its occupant vacated it, presumably due to his resurrection, and it remained intact. Therefore the question of images of coins on eyes remains a viable hypothesis. Max and some others claim that they have discerned such images, while others do not. Note that Giovanna De Liso in her seismic experiments obtained an image of a metallic object (a key), so that apparently an image causing object does not need to be organic. I think that’s about as far as the debate may take us. The images of coins on eyes remains as a possibility and can only be denied if it can be conclusively shown that the images do not in fact exist.

Conversely, authenticists who claim the images are present also have an interest as it would strongly support the argument for authenticity. The argument is therefore more than merely academic, but its resolution in favour of the images being present would be decisive in resolving this issue. 2) The question of the coins bearing an image and therefore not appropriate for Jewish burials or other use, will not hold water. The census tax of one denarius, clearly has an image of Caesar (Mt 22, Mk 12, Lk 20), the Pharisees can readily procure one when asked to be shown it, so that the coins were clearly in common use.

Have to say on this matter. I do not believe it is possible to be dogmatic about aspects of the Shroud which are disputed. Also I do not think it reasonable to argue that general principles will necessarily apply to every particular case. An underlying unstated assumption is the text of John 20:39 41: “39 Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds. 40 They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. 41 Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.” First: “according to the Jewish burial custom”. We do not know how literally this was followed, or if it is a gloss. Were the customs followed to the letter, or just in a general way, or at all? We do not really know. Second: Spices of 100 Roman pounds is a large sack of potatoes, about 40 kg. Obviously something was done with it. My personal view is that it was likely packed along the side of the body, which may account for masking of the sides on the image, but that is only an opinion. Some experts have asserted they have detected signs of myrrh and aloes on the cloth. They may be right, or they may be wrong. Third: The tomb was in a garden and it was springtime and flowers were abundant and at hand. They are useful for discouraging flies and other insects from laying their maggots. Flowers may have been placed on the body or not. I am no great believer in images of flowers on the cloth, nor of coins or potsherds over the eyes. Some notable experts do so believe in such. My personal views are that they may well be pareidolia. On the other hand they may well be present.

This work is a major classic in anthropology and is often cited; I came across it during my course in Religious Studies. Although the evolutionary sequence of magical, religious, and scientific thought is no longer accepted and Frazer’s broad general psychological theory has proved unsatisfactory, his work enabled him to synthesize and compare a wider range of information about religious and magical practices than has been achieved subsequently by any other single anthropologist. In making a vast range of primitive custom appear intelligible to European thinkers of his time, Frazer had a wide influence among men of letters; and, though he traveled little himself, he was in close contact with missionaries and administrators who provided information for him and valued his interpretation of it. His other works include Totemism and Exogamy (1910) and Folk Lore in the Old Testament (1918). He was knighted in 1914. If Frazer claimed that the practice of placing coins or potsherds over the eyes of deceased Jews. Then it is almost certainly correct. Note that the ref provided by O.K. Gives an explanation of the practice unconnected with Charon and the Styx: “… the intention being to keep deceased from seeing the way by which he was carried to his last home …” Whatever, the practice may very well derive from a more ancient custom which may have had other connotations. Coins found in the mouths of some skulls, may very well have dropped through from the eye sockets. Images of coins on eyes of the TSM may well be back on the agenda..","date":"2014-10-05","mins":"3:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-159901","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"On Oct 5, 3:19 pm, I clearly stated: “In making a vast range of primitive custom appear intelligible to European thinkers of his time, Frazer had a wide influence among men of letters; and, though he traveled little himself, he was in close contact with missionaries and administrators who provided information for him and valued his interpretation of it.” The words are those of the Encyclopedia Britannica, and your quarrel is with them..","date":"2014-10-06","mins":"3:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-85787","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Tongue in cheek irony, no doubt.

However the confusion giving rise to my perhaps uncharitable derision is I think evident in several of the comments which you yourself felt obliged to rebut, and very well too. The main problem I see with a certain type of too prevalent Protestant fundamentalism, is not so much because of its claims to be based on scripture alone, so much, as to how the same scripture is read and interpreted, and how it is perceived. It seems to me that rationality and critical thinking are relegated to a distant second or even third place, while personal perspectives mask the Truth of the text with claims of being guided or inspired by the Holy Spirit. There is a word for this and it is called “fanatacism”. Of such was the Tower of Babel built! I doubt if your readers could comprehend the concept that the Shroud might well be the “love letter” from Jesus written to be fully understood only in the modern era with our technology and science, as it is not referred to directly in the New Testament. But the early Christians had to be discreet in the face of persecution, they did not cast “pearls before swine”, they knew how to keep their most precious secrets, and only oblique references will be found. For example, what reading might one make of Revelations 19:12 14 with its reference to the rider called Faithful and True on a white charger with a cloak soaked in blood and an army of heaven dressed in linen of dazzling white? Is this an oblique reference to the Shroud? Who knows?

Check the dorsal image of the head, there is a pigtail which appears to have some kind of oily dressing on it. The TSM has long hair. It is only the biblical literalists such as those in the “Church of God” who want to insist that Jesus had short hair. They misread scripture. Paul (brought up in Tarsus in Cilicia, and who never met Jesus in mortal life) tells the Greek Corinithians (not the Jewish Christians) to ask themselves whether nature itself does not tell them that long hair on a man is nothing to be admired (I Cor 11:14). Clearly the fashion in 1st century Corinth, and indeed throughout much of the Roman Empire was for short hair. Paul would not want his Greek converts to make themselves targets of mockery on the specious gounds of not complying with such trivial local customs. A blogger claimed there was a verse in Peter, I couldn’t find it; I think he confused Paul with Peter. A more interesting claim concerned the Arch of Titus erected in 81 AD in the Sacra Via in Rome celebrating Titus’ pillage of the Temple in Jerusalem. A frieze shows the victorious army carrying off the menorah and other temple spoils. It is claimed that the figures have short hair. Artistic licence and ignorance aside, it is not at all clear to me whether any short haired figures depicted are Jewish captives or Roman soldiery. It seemed to me that some of the figures were certainly bearded and had hair of a reasonable length that could be called long. Someone more knowledgable may be able to comment with better authority than I can. Search on “Arch of Titus images”. Claims that Jesus had short hair seem to be based on no more than an anti Catholic bias against classical depictions of Christ, and tenuous arguments are found to support such spurious claims. The standard depiction of a bearded Christ seems to have commenced with the icons of the 6th century, and it seems very likely that the Image of Edessa (whatever that might have been – some speculate that it may have been the facial image of the Shroud) was the template for those icons. There may even be an earlier depiction, as an early mosaic found at Urfa also shows the same image with long hair and beard. A search on “Jewish rabbi images” will all show them with long hair and beards, particularly the ultra orthodox, who clearly seek to follow what they believe to be the proper biblical traditions. It is known that Moses’ brother Aaron had a beard so that it became included in a blessing, the nazirite under a vow was obliged not to cut his hair, the One on the throne is described as with hair like wool.

We know a great deal about how the pyramids were likely made. At present everything about the forming of the Shroud image is sheer speculation. Very likely the pyramids were built with the assistance of earth ramps, and you might be aware that Egypt has no shortage of sand, a particularly tractable material. We know a great deal about Egyptian mathematics, particularly from the Rhind papyrus, 17th century BC copy of a text 2 centuries older still, and also from the Golenishchev Papyrus (in the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts), dating from the 19th century BC. The blocks would be easily sledded up the ramps on timber rails using milk and fat for lubrication. That such ramps were built is evident from a satirical problem set out in the Rhind papyrus. A satirical letter in which one scribe, Hori, taunts his rival, Amen em opet, for his incompetence as an adviser and manager. “You are the clever scribe at the head of the troops,” Hori chides at one point; “a ramp is to be built, 730 cubits long, 55 cubits wide, with 120 compartments–it is 60 cubits high, 30 cubits in the middle. . . And the generals and the scribes turn to you and say, ‘You are a clever scribe, your name is famous. Is there anything you don’t know? Answer us, how many bricks are needed?’ Let each compartment be 30 cubits by 7 cubits.” There are three other problems like it in the same letter. Further information is needed, but the point of the humour is clear enough as Hori sets these difficult but typical tasks. The Egyptians did not seem to know Pythagorean triples (the Babylonians did), but were able to set out exact right angles, and it is evident that they originated surveying with resetting of land boundaries following the annual N Ilitic floods. They had an adequate numbering system, were familiar with binary fractions, and were capable of calculating areas and volumes, even of pyramids.

BCE were a surprise to me. A quick reference with an illustration can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian carpet Article quote: “The exceptional Pazyryk carpet was discovered in 1949 in an archaeological excavation in the Pazyryk Valley, in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. The carpet was found in the grave of a Scythian prince. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC. This carpet is 283 by 200 cm (approximately 9.3 by 6.5 ft) and has 36 symmetrical knots per cm² (232 per inch²). The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving. It is considered the oldest known carpet in the world. Its central field is a deep red color and it has two wide borders, one depicting deer and the other horsemen.” Of particular significance is “… The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving”.

I did not see any examples where only the PC Ws were coloured, but the medullas of such fibres were uncoloured. It is my understanding that a common claim made for Shroud fibres is that the superficiality of the colouring is such that it is confined to the outer surface of the fibres only, specifically the crowns; alternatively it is confined to an impurity layer of starches on the fibre surface. The figure of 200 nm, sometimes up to perhaps 500 nm, is sometimes quoted as the upper limit of the thickness of the colouring. Raymond Rogers claimed to have removed the colouring from a fibre which left the underlying fibre intact and otherwise unaffected, which seemed to persuade him that the colouring resided on the impurity layer. Surely this is what is meant when superficiality is claimed for the colouring. I can applaud Colin’s attempts and industrious efforts at his experimentations. But I do not see that he can yet claim that the colouring has a comparable superficiality to that of the Shroud fibres. Surely for his claims that the scorching model is valid, he has to demonstrate that the colouring is confined to no more than the primary cell wall of the fibres, leaving the medullas unaffected.

And why does it contradict a number of artistic and historical traditions?” There is only one man who had the capability, imagination and resources to create it. He is unique. Roger Bacon b. ~1220 England, d. 1292 guess where, Oxford!! His career is worth the effort of researching by anyone interested in investigating a possible medieval provenance of the Shroud. The only problem is that Bacon was an extremely busy chappie, very likely he would have left some record of his efforts, and he was probably engaged on so many other projects, he would not have had the time to dedicate to it. Ordered by his Franciscan superiors to desist from his researches, and counter commanded by Pope Clement IV to send him his researches under secrecy, he prepared and dispatched three massive volumes. Unfortunately the death of Clement in 1268 extinguished Bacon’s dreams of gaining for the sciences their rightful place in the curriculum of university studies. He was Aristotelian in his outlook rather than Platonist. He extolled experimentation so ardently that he has often been viewed as a harbinger of modern science more than 300 years before it came to bloom. Bacon had a sort of laboratory for alchemical experiments and carried out some systematic observations with lenses and mirrors. His studies on the nature of light and on the rainbow are especially noteworthy, and he seems to have planned and interpreted these experiments carefully. But his most notable “experiments” seem never to have been actually performed; they were merely described. He suggested, for example, that a balloon of thin copper sheet be made and filled with “liquid fire”; he felt that it would float in the air as many light objects do in water. He seriously studied the problem of flying in a machine with flapping wings. He was the first person in the West to give exact directions for making gunpowder (1242); and, though he knew that, if confined, it would have great power and might be useful in war, he failed to speculate further. (Its use in guns arose early in the following century.) Bacon described spectacles (which also soon came into use); elucidated the principles of reflection, refraction, and spherical aberration; and proposed mechanically propelled ships and carriages. He used a camera obscura to observe eclipses of the Sun.

There are divisions of opinion concerning the precise timing of construction. One source I used for an intended presentation some years ago was Martin Palmer’s “Sacred History of Britain”. He paints the following scenario. Overuse of farmland resulted in crop failures and the previous Barrow Culture was abandoned about 3200 BC. It was succeeded by a stone circle culture spreading right across Europe from about 3000 BC, commencing with “wood henges”, then stone from about 2700 BC, with joints and dressings imitative of wood work. Purpose not strictly known but includes: Elite burial sites, Community & Trade centres, Religious activities, Military purposes. Cosmology significance include astronomical alignments, and important “ley lines”. Bones of some 50 or so cremated bodies were discovered. Palmer asserts that about 2100 BC some 80 bluestone pillars, each weighing 4 TONS (NOT 40 TONS) originating in the Preseli Hills, were used to build two incomplete concentric circles. The method of transport although presently unknown for certain cannot be classified as a “mystery” in the same sense as is the enigmatic Shroud image. There are two fundamental theories. One is that they had already been transported there by a glacial ice sheet. The alternative that they were transported by sea, and then manhandled overland to the site would be well within neolithic human endeavour (Note they were 4 tons each not 40 tons). About 2000 BC, the lintel circle and horseshoe of sarsen stones were constructed, originally some 30 uprights (only 17 survive) each of about 50 TONS, brought from some 30 KM away. This remodelling reduced the importance of other stone circles within about 240 km. Other works at Stonehenge followed including the unfinished avenue to the Avon River. In 1150 BC, the ash from an Icelandic volcano eruption blocked out the sun from N. Europe, killing vegetation, trees and crops, and the Stone Circle was then abandoned. Their gods had failed them! In Britain there were no known monuments nor ceremonial burials 1100 – 600 BC. From 500 BC, Celtic ideas surfaced, religion focused on springs and wells, emanating from the Mesopotamian Ainu cult. The construction of the Egyptian pyramids remained a mystery until their solution was discovered. Earth (sand?) ramps were built to the placement locations and the stones hauled into place by sled using manpower. Whether timber rollers on timber rails were used has been discussed, or whether milk was used as a lubricant. In any case the problem of hauling the 50 ton sarsen stones for Stonehenge some 30 km away is a credible neolithic human achievement. Although ancient Britons terminated their Stone Circle cult by about 1100 BC, the spectacle of the site clearly attracted Roman garrisons posted there and also the Druids, but they had no input into its construction..","date":"2014-10-14","mins":"6:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"},{"id":"comment-162382","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If you want to know more about Stonehenge I suggest you consult Colin Berry who I understand has some interest in the matter, or perhaps Hugh Farey, both of whom live a damn sight closer to Salisbury Plain than myself in the Antipodes, although thousands of Kiwis and Ozzies spent several months there at Boot Camp during both World Wars in training for battle in engagements that hardly concerned their interests..","date":"2014-10-14","mins":"2:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"},{"id":"comment-161501","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The apostles might have known, and Mary Magdalen might have known.

Both are applied sciences reliant on the research of specialists in the pure sciences. Both involve human risk and safety, medicine in a direct personal way, the engineer in a more vicarious way involving the general public. The physician may bury his mistakes; the engineer is more likely to leave monuments to his. The physician depends on advances and pure research in organic chemistry and in the subtleties of human biology. However ultimately the acceptance of new drugs will still depend on the empirical results of blind testing, along with its margins of error, confidence limits, and singular exceptions. Except perhaps in such cases as electronics, manufactured materials, simple structural analysis and the direct application of mathematics, the engineer is very much more dependent on empiricism, having to deal with the uncertainties in the forces and materials of mother nature. Yet he must find workable solutions. The hydraulics engineer for example would love to have a solution of the Navier Stokes equation of fluid flow, one of 23 problems nominated by David Hilbert in 1900 for 20th century mathematicians to solve. Along with the Riemann hypothesis, it remains as yet intractable. Hilbert’s #1 problem, Cantor’s cardinality of the continuum, appears to be in a class of Godel’s undecidable problems. Clearly there are limits to the pure science approach that not even mathematics can resolve. During my career, I was frequently involved in the resolution of contractual disputes, frequently attending seminars on formal arbitration and the role of the expert witness, to assist me in this. It was evident that equally competent experts were quite capable of arguing contrary cases supporting either side. They had their roles to play, but it left me with few illusions that any expert should have the last word on any matter of moment. For that, I shall put my trust in what appears to me to be the more reasonable conclusion. It is an error of human judgment to place one’s absolute faith in scientism. It has its practical value, but it also has its limitations. Yesterday’s scientific dogma is tomorrow’s scientific heresy. One need only mention the controversies of the dual nature of light, particulate or wave like, Newton’s laws of motion superseded by Einstein’s theory of relativity, the successive and contradictory theories in quantum mechanics. And as yet, there is still no Grand Unified Theory. We are Lilliputians only capable of simple small scale stuff. In the grander scheme of things, we may need to have recourse to empiricism, what in fact appears to us to be reasonable, hopefully illuminated by any divine spark resident within the human psyche. We may seek the truth, and occasionally we may even attain it. But to err, is still to remain human..","date":"2013-12-01","mins":"6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/30/it-may-not-suit-the-scientific-mind-set/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"It may not suit the scientific mind-set"},{"id":"comment-55158","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A favourite ploy by some Catholic conservatives is to accuse Teilhard of pantheism.

The detailed close up match with the Oviedo cloth was also well done. The theory that the linen had bound CO molecules into it over the course of time was left inconclusive, although Dr Ramsey of Oxford appeared prepared to consider the possibility. What did disappoint me was that there was no mention whatsoever of the inept sampling for the original C14 tests, and as shown by tests on the Raes sample with its isolated contamination of cotton. That it may well have been taken from a medieval invisble mend. We could speculate whether the presence of Flury Lemburg in the video may have compromised such a discussion. Thiebault Heimburger has been insistent that there is no other cotton contamination of the cloth, only in the Raes sample virtually from the same location from where the C14 sample was taken. This aspect screams out for attention, and possibly at one fell swoop might well resolve the problem of the errant results. On the other hand, there are those scientifically qualified who also suspect that C14 tests even on the parent linen may still be inconclusive.

None of it would have been possible without raising the funds, from memory, some $US 2 million (1978), and it would be much more than this now. It requires dedication, determination, vision and a special kind of leadership, of the kind as then provided by John Jackson. They were extremely lucky with the personal contacts provided by Fr Peter Rinaldi, who was able to smooth out many of the difficulties they encountered. It took some two years of planning, and there was no assurance of any kind of access or success until right up to the last. Barrie Schwortz’s photographic record on shroud.com shows a few of the difficulties that had to be overcome.

The question of what might be our eternal destiny, I prefer to leave in God’s hands. The parable Louis recites above demonstrates Jesus’ concern for the poor and marginalised and our misuse of wealth, and echoed in this last Sunday’s Gospel of the rich young man unable to accept the invitation to “Sell all he had, give to the poor and come, follow me.” It is more specifically set out in Matthew 25:31 46, placing a direct obligation on us to practice the corporal works of mercy, the essence of true religion according to the epistle attributed to James, also read out in recent weeks. This is the message of true evangelisation and the message that needs to be preached, a care for the poor and marginalised. Surely an authentication of the Shroud would create a most powerful weapon in the armory of this evangelisation. What Jesus had to say must then be seen by many to have been a lot more important than perhaps we had appreciated, notwithstanding any alleged indifference to Moses and the prophets. If the Shroud should prove not to be his authentic burial cloth, then little is lost thereby and it reverts to a mysterious icon, an object for meditation that echoes the gospel narrative of the crucifixion, and the sufferings he bore. Those who have relied on it as a prop for their faith will be disappointed, and they will have to find some other basis to support the rationality of their faith, which I would hope might not be too difficult for them. However I believe the Shroud was created for a holy purpose, and its authentication would underline that purpose.

The question would then have to be if sufficient fibres were exposed to make such a definitive assertion. We might ask if any of the blood flowed from the body after the image had been formed.

I respectfully suggest he may like to refresh his youthful memory, by reference to Ch 4. “The Preliminary Sufferings”, p.92 of the 1963 Image edition. The Roman coin I mentioned at #58 above had four lashes to its flagrum, Ian Wilson’s reconstruction has three lashes; William Smith apparently has other versions, so that clearly flagra were constructed as personal weapons, their design being merely limited according to the morbid imagination of their owners. HF claims that Wilson’s flagrum was designed merely to fit the case of the TS, but this is in fact not so, if he would reread Barbet. Barbet asserts that all these wounds have the SAME shape (difficult with only a blood soaked sponge), he likens them to a halter some 3cm long, the two circles representing balls of lead, the line joining them being the mark of the thong. They occur in PAIRS of TWO (not three) parallel wounds, and he deduces that each flagrum had TWO thongs, laid out in the form of a fan, the centre being the executioner’s hand. On the thorax they are oblique, horizontal on the loins, and oblique once more on the legs. He comments that on the FRONTAL image, there are long oblique furrows which must have been produced by the ends of the thongs. Having struck the calves of the legs with their leaden balls, they have turned around the outer edge of the leg and lashed the front with their points (a skill easily acquired by a sadistic executioner). Barbet has previously commented from his knowledge of the classics, that scourging commonly occurred with the prisoner facing the pillar to which he was bound, with his arms being bound above his head. There are no scourge marks on the arms! Barbet deduces that there must have been two executioners, likely of different heights, for the obliqueness differs on each side. He finally notes that painters have been content at most, with vague formless excoriations, and none have ever attempted such minute details. However if we are to follow the logic of Hugh Farey’s argument, then not only does the TS also have all its other highly unlikely properties devised by his entirely notional forger, but this genius also had the perspicacity to paint the image with identical scourge marks, apparently radiating from the hands of two executioners of different heights, either side of the prisoner, but with no marks on the arms. I wonder if Hugh has ever heard of Occam’s razor, for there is a simpler solution than the one he has to devise, and that is that the TS is in fact what it appears to be! Barbet was of course an experienced forensic pathologist, who experimented with cadavers and amputee’s limbs, and was also extremely knowledgeable in the Greek and Roman classics.

Although all the names appearing there were common in 1st century Palestine, I consider that the fact that all the names may be associated with one specific family are highly significant, despite arguments to the contrary and denials by the I.A.A. Pellegrino is on record as claiming that the Jesus ossuary contained little in the way of human remains, merely a carpal bone, and some shreds of linen. We might easily guess as to the reason for the carpal bone. The linen fragments might have come from the TS, or else from some other cloth used as part of the burial. As to other outrageous claims made particularly by Jacobovici, they may be dismissed as absurd, and of a Dan Brown character. It will never be known if Talpiot was the Jesus family tomb or not, because all the material found in the ossuaries were buried in a common grave, and the ossuaries cleaned, in accordance with the lack of any scientific interest in possibly early Christian sites, typical of the I.A.A. Mme Claude cites J P Meier’s “Marginal Jew” in discussing the paternity of Jesus, but Meier clearly dismisses the allegation of bastardy as a 2nd century myth invented by those hostile to Christianity.

If you’re not familiar with “Doctor at Calvary” by Pierre Barbet MD, you must get yourself a copy. It’s the classic work on Shroud forensics, has become something of a touchstone, a starting point for all Shroud forensic debates, is well argued and is most authoritative as by an experienced forensic pathologist who also happens to know enough of the classics to be well read in matters pertaining to crucifixion, and punishment and other contemporary practices. I see it still features prominently on the web, copies are available from Amazon, and you can probably find a copy in a good second hand book shop or a public library. There can be no doubt that the Shroud man fell while carrying his load, attested by injuries to the knees and nose on which there is the same dirt as on the soles of his feet, travertine aragonite, a rare form of limestone but which is commonly found in Jerusalem. The impact of his load impacting on his shoulders as a result of falling are also evident. All three synoptic gospels recount that Simon of Cyrene was pressed into service to assist with carrying the cross, and it may therefore be inferred that the scourged man had some difficulty in carrying it. Barbet goes into considerable detail in describing all these injuries as a result of falling, too long to replicate here, which is why I suggest you obtain a copy of his book. A colleague, one Judica, had asserted that Jesus carried the whole cross, the lower half of the cross beam hanging down in front, with the upper half over his right shoulder. Judica had apparently asserted that the injuries to the left shoulder resulted from the upper half of the cross beam falling across the man’s upper back and impacting on the left shoulder. Barbet disagreed with this scenario, and considered that only the cross beam was carried. There seem to be two possible ways the cross beam might have been carried: Either a) as shown in the drawing above with the cross beam across the nape of the neck, with the man’s arms bound to it; Or b) as a workman might carry a beam on his shoulder, with the point of balance slightly behind, and held in place by the hands in front on the top surface. Barbet was familiar with the second practice through workmen carrying railway sleepers (US = cross ties) and the injuries incurred as a result of occasional falls. He seems to envisage the trailing half of the cross beam as crossing to the left when carried for purposes of balance, so that a fall would result in both shoulders being impacted. His detailed description is so specific that you need to read it. If you are able to obtain a copy of his work, your comments could be very enlightening in any further debates on the subject on this site..","date":"2015-03-15","mins":"1:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth"},{"id":"comment-18174","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Well this just goes to show how timely Thiebault Heimburger’s paper is, despite one silly adverse comment.

Nor can carrying the patibulum only be called a myth. The assertion was probably first made by Barbet who devotes two separate sections to the question, a) Instruments of execution b) Carrying of the cross. Barbet went to some pains to refute the assertions of a colleague, Judica, who had assumed that the whole cross was carried. Nor was it necessary that the cross beam be carried across the nape of the neck as shown in the illustration. Barbet referred to a time as a railway sapper in his youth when it was common for the workmen to carry a railway sleeper on the right shoulder, something which this correspondent is very familiar. He even described the results of some of their falls and likened the evidence of their excoriations, including both on the right and left shoulder as a result, matching both the Shroud and Tunic evidences. To raise the whole cross requires ropes, some tricky logistics in hoisting, and backfilling with tamping to anchor the upright in its hole, to ensure that it stays securely vertical. The only evidence for it is the partly damaged stone ring.at Holy Sepulchre, and whose use as such is conjectural. Have any other stone rings be discovered, A ring would seem to require some tiresome and skillful work to construct from stone, but I suppose it might be done, they don’t occur naturally. It would be a much simpler exercise merely to raise the patibulum with the crucified body on to an already fixed upright, and such ruthless efficiency is worth serious consideration, particularly if there are a number of prisoners to be executed. Fixed uprights were a common enough feature throughout the empire, and having discovered an efficient way of carrying out executions, why would they vary it from a normal practice which had become standard?. Barbet’s explanation is worth reading in some detail, as he would seem to cover all the bases, including accounting for the apparent evidence on the Shroud and Tunic, classical references to the practices of crucifixion, its origin, and so on..","date":"2015-03-14","mins":"4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth"},{"id":"comment-194504","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Some interesting comments, Jim. It was Barbet who gave weight to the fixed stipes, prisoner carrying only the patibulum idea, and he cites a few classic authorities and Roman military efficiency in support of it. In your para (1) you seem to support this notion, and then in your para (2) & (4) you revert to the prisoner being nailed to the full cross on the ground and then raising it using ropes. Are you speculating that the stipes were kept upright at the site as a deterrent, and on the arrival of the execution party, the stipes were removed from their holes, the full cross then assembled, and then prisoner nailed on to the full cross? If the stipes were only loosely kept in their holes, what would prevent thieves making off with the stipes for use as timber? Not all agree that Zugibe successfully rebutted Barbet’s scenario. As I recall from Zugibe’s published papers, his volunteer mounted a fixed in place cross, his hands being placed in gauntlets fitted with strain gauges, and his ankles bound by a strap to the upright. The arm tensions measured were much less than those claimed by Barbet, as some of he weight was taken by the feet. He then claimed that this data refuted the need for wrist nailing. If we use Barbet’s scenario of nailing the prisoner to the cross bar only, then the full weight needs to be taken by the arms at the time of raising, and for that case wrist nailing would be required. Alternatively, Zugibe’s volunteer, with his ankles comfortably strapped, hardly simulates the excruciating pain of putting his whole body weight on a nail through his feet. The prisoner would seek to relieve this pain by transferring his weight to his arms, when again the need for wrist nailing arises. When the pan in his wrists and arms became unbearable, he would again transfer his weight back to his feet. Thus giving rise to Barbet’s notion of a see saw action. So I don’t know that Zugibe’s account can be taken as the last word. If the cross bar only was carried, then it may not need to have been carried as you describe in para (2), with it lying across his back against the nape of the neck, with his arms bound to it. It could be carried on one shoulder lying parallel to the direction of travel. The prisoner’s wrists could still be bound to the leading end of the cross bar to prevent him dumping it. The excoriation below the left shoulder is consistent with a fall when the trailing end of the cross bar impacts on his shoulder. Barbet claimed to have observed similar wounds by railway workers when they occasionally stumbled when carrying railroad cross ties. As crucifixion has not been regularly practised since about 325 AD, we can’t know the full details, and doubtless there were some variations in local practices anyway. So that any reconstruction inevitably involves a degree of speculation.

The result was that both Crassus and Pompeii were successful in their bids for the consulship in 70 BC, overturning the Sulla constitution which would have denied their right.

Some basic knowledge of anatomy was achieved by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, but further investigations came to a halt after Galen in the second century. Galen’s studies in 22 volumes became the last word on anatomy until the sixteenth century. Some dissections were carried out by Mondino de Luzzi (1275 1326) in Bologna. In 1489 Leonardo da Vinci began a series of dissections on 30 cadavers until he was ordered to stop by Pope Leo X. In the sixteenth century, the printing press enabled Galen’s work to be widely disseminated, and was criticised, drawing by drawing by Vesalius, who had permission to dissect the corpses from gallows. But it took another hundred years for Galen’s influence to fade. The inadequate understanding of the anatomical consequences of crucifixion, and indeed of the details of flagellation, are apparent in the various depictions in the many art works showing the crucifixion and burial of Christ, until well after the sixteenth century. In particular the human circulatory system was not understood until the 16th – 17th centuries. In contrast, the anatomical effects of crucifixion are depicted accurately on the Shroud image, in a way which was completely unavailable to any purveyor of religious artifacts preceding 1350, when the image first became known in Europe..","date":"2014-09-22","mins":"4:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/22/samuel-johnson-meets-his-match/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Samuel Johnson Meets His Match"},{"id":"comment-7951","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Pope Benedict in his recent visit to the UK, made the point that “Faith without reason is fanaticism; Reason without faith is fascism!” I recall that Albert Einstein made a somewhat similar observation.

For instance, how reliable might the 1525 document be, posted in the Lirey church some 183 years after 1355, and only 134 years after D’Arcis drafted his memorandum denouncing it. It seems that Chevalier accepted the 1525 document as valid, so what motivated Chevalier to make so much of the D’Arcis memorandum, in a deceptive way according to Markwardt? The family connection between D’Arcis and Geoffroy I, via Alix de Joinville is intriguing, and so it would be surprising if D’Arcis did not know of King Philip’s donation of the Shroud to Geoffroy, so why did he denounce it, claiming it was painted by an artist? Was it jealousy, or did he consider that it would be more appropriately housed in his own cathedral in Troyes, rather than an insignificant collegiate church in a small village? The text of the bailli’s requisition of the Shroud from the De Charnay family, seemingly authored by D’Arcis, suggests that this would seem quite likely. Jones’ 1343 dating of the king’s intention to endow Geoffroy with the Shroud certainly seems plausible, and he gives reason for this bequest, the (possible?) saving of the king’s son John II at Angiers. The suggested involvement of the two Avignon popes Clement VI and Innocent IV, who Jones seems to imply knew of the plan to house the Shroud there, may explain the later Clement VII’s (another family connection) command of silence to D’Arcis. Hugh’s comments concerning the alleged effigy of Geoffroy II in Froidment is apt, and it may be that this effigy is not Geoffroy II at all, but conceivably another knight of the same name, I think I can now count up to four separate Geoffroy’s de Charnay, including the templar burnt at the stake in 1314.

There seems to be no good cause for asserting that he was closely related to Jesus, other than both being Galileans and possibly living in the same town. Luke records that Jesus and John the Baptist were cousins through their mothers, Mary & Elizabeth. Luke also claims that John the Baptist’s father was the priest Zechariah. Both John Mark and Mary his mother are recorded in Acts 12 as living in Jerusalem. Adrie vd Hoeven has asserted that John Mark had a temple function as secretary to the High Priest, and has made a case for the Shroud being his temple garment. John Mark has been credited with writing the second gospel based on his close association with Peter in Rome.

Young people no longer seem to be able to think logically, and it all seemed to go downhill when Euclid was dropped from the school syllabus. Some social commentators, and even scientists seem to blame two French clowns, Jacques Derrida and Michael Foucault with their post modernist philosophy, which can be summed up succinctly as “There’s no such thing as a truth statement”, essentially a nihilistic approach.

But: (1) It’s not necessary to appeal to the supernatural to claim that the TS is authentic. (2) Your response does not deal with the question as to why any forger would want to produce a negative image. Are there any other icons represented in the negative? I don’t think so! (3) Again it is not necessary to appeal to the supernatural for the TS to be authentic. (4) Powdered paint is a novel speculation. There are no paint chemicals present, except by minor contamination from contact by other copies (emulating contagious magic). (5) Emulating of 3 D from front lighting. I’m unaware of any corroboration of this assertion. (6) Pollen & limestone traces. You assign an insight to your medieval forger centuries ahead of his time. (7) The original blog appears to fail to identify the true reason for the faulty C14 results – a medieval patch and failure to take representative samples. (8) I disagree that there are several examples of painted wrist nails. The only ones I’m aware of can generally be attributed to being modelled on the Shroud (possibly Pray manuscript). On the examples you claim, can you say if the thumb is visible or not? Jerome translated the Greek word chiras as manus (hand), resulting in centuries of artists showing palm nailing. A foot rest or seat prolongs the dying trauma. Gospels recount that Jesus died in 3 hours, which surprised Pilate. A seat or foot rest was therefore unlikely in Jesus’ case. (9) Scourging: The scourge wounds have clearly been inflicted by the flagrum unique to the Romans, of which various examples have been found. Scourge whips of other cultures seldom have dumb bell pellets at the ends of a double thong. (10) Long hair, pig tail: Check Google for “Images Jewish rabbis”.

Distance from this proto central fold to selvage is 58.6 cm without crossing a seam, and asserts that this was original half width of cloth.

On opposite side there is a seam running along the entire length. Author claims that a long strip has been removed and the main cloth sewn to the original selvage along this seam deliberately to centralise the image.

HF – Sep 10, 8:56 am: “The ‘Bartaveng’ paper is interesting too. If the original centre line crease really exists, and if it does define the original width of the shroud as 117cm, and if the width of the shroud really is 114cm (and do note the if..if..if..) then it would be almost impossible to cut a strip out of it, and resew the edges together. The idea that the seam is no more than a tuck would be much more sensible.” No investigator has yet reported a tuck, which if it corresponds to original width of 117.2 cm would be plainly visible, having a width of half of the 6.2 cm reported in the ‘Barta’ paper, if a Z type single fold, or else a thick strip of material if folded more. The longitudinal seam attaching the strip is visible and has been reported. Clearly there must have been a longitudinal cut, otherwise a selvage would be visible at the seam. It has been sewed according to Mme F L by a Masada like cross stitch. There appear to be a number of possible options. A) The M L hypothesis that the cloth was from a larger bolt of cloth, and cut into suitable widths to give a commercial product, perhaps of two cubits width; b) The original cloth was perhaps 117.2 cm wide, which was wider than the standard commercial width and was therefore deliberately reduced in width to make it standard, corresponding to two cubits. C) The strip was made at some time after the image was formed, so that it would be more centrally placed for display purposes, and so appear symmetrical when mounted. In that case the two cubits width would seem coincidental, but then we would have to accept that the 4:1 ratio is also coincidental, which makes two concurrent coincidences! It would seem that the strip came from the original bolt of cloth, regardless of how wide that bolt may have been.

Have you been at the sauce again? It’s either a cut or a tuck, and there’s one person who would definitely know one way or another.

The margin of error must inevitably be quite large as age is not the only dependent variable. The specific history of the parent cloth, such as frequency of folding and the various storage environments are also significant in affecting the parameters measured. Thus the authors claimed a margin of error of 400 years, and found it was compatible within the time that Jesus lived. The paper is highly technical and it is helpful to know something of the theory of Strength of Materials, a standard discipline in Engineering. Parameters measured include Young’s Modulus, tensile strength, loss factor. Other methods have also been used including Raman spectroscopy. #5) Cause of the image: This remains unknown; Possibilities include a) some as yet unknown naturalistic process; b) an artisan’s deliberate attempt by a process which still remains a secret; c) a miraculous divine intervention. Despite various attempts to replicate the image, none have been really successful, and few if any attempts display all the known properties of the Shroud image. If it was the result of an artisan, his identity is unknown and he left no record of either his attempts, or of his failures. The forensic evidence displays a knowledge of anatomy not known in medieval times. #6) Unsmeared blood marks: This is also part of the forensic evidence. If say an artisan used even a crucified corpse to produce his image, then removal of the corpse would surely have resulted in smearing. There are good indications that the blood marks occurred before the image. However a miraculous resurrection could be expected not to smear the blood marks. It is important I think to weigh the totality of the available evidence, not necessarily any single one.

However, the question ought to be “Can I accept that they are indeed there or not?” The problem I have with this is that neurosurgeon specialists will tell us that the brain is wired to see patterns. So that what we may at first interpret as a visual pattern may have no substantive reality. As an impressionable child, I still vividly recall being frightened in the dark by the patterns of light I perceived as various threatening faces or animals, which even entered my nightmares. My mother was an expert teller of imaginative stories, particularly of the ghostly kind, and perhaps these helped me to lay my childish fears to rest, and I came to rationalise my spectres as no more than tricks of the light, which indeed they were. I am minded of the lines in Shakespeare’s play, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” having often taken part in several group readings. At its conclusion, King Theseus has the lines: “Or in the night, imagining some fear, / How easy is a bush supposed a bear!” In fact the whole play deals with questions of reality and perception in a way that only Shakespeare is capable of doing. This whole question of reality and perception in AMND is dealt with in an intriguing essay, “A Bush or a Bear?” by Cory Akin and can be found at: http://www.nwc.cc.wy.us/waw/essays/Essay54.pdf I have no objection to Vincenzo and Max continuing to have their party, atributing a reality to the resemblances they see, where the rest of us cannot. I am also familiar with the fact that primal peoples, Pacifica, Maori and African, will also attribute a reality to visual patterns which a modern rational mind may scorn. However if a substantive reality is to be attributed to patterns which some claim to see on the Shroud cloth, then I think it requires at least a level of reasonable consensus that such patterns are in fact perceived by more than a few. Otherwise it becomes too difficult to take these claims more seriously than perhaps we might. Even so, the question must remain as to whether they are merely tricks of the light, a trick in the weave, a pattern which are no more than a perception of our neurologically wired brains..","date":"2013-05-22","mins":"7:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/20/the-worldwide-conspiracy-to-ignore-vincenzo-giovanni-ruello/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello"},{"id":"comment-59936","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The human psyche will always go its own way, and generate ideas that at first appear Beavis and Butthead outlandish.

Meanwhile each must come to their own conclusion. Those who assert that the Shroud is authentic, need to show why. Those who assert that it is not, need to show why not! Assuming authenticity, one thing that the Shroud does demonstrate, is that the image was fixed before there was any sign of corruption, and this image once formed did not deteriorate as a result of any subsequent corruption. What then happened to the body? Once fixed, we still do not know soon the image first appeared – was it within the 40 hours or so Jesus was in the tomb, or was it much longer, even a hundred or so years. I’m inclined to think it likely it was in the tomb, as otherwise why would a ritually unclean cloth be so carefully preserved? Despite what Augustine has to say about what John came to believe when he entered the tomb (i.e. Augustine asserts he believed what the women had said), Augustine did not know about the Shroud image. Claiming no one knew the physical appearance of Jesus. However if the image had already appeared, this gives a new slant on the particular text. The image may still have had its own part to play in helping to form the disciples’ conviction that Jesus had indeed risen. We can speculate, but we cannot assert either way. But de Wesselow may not be the only one who can be mistaken about the role the image may have played. They were plain folk, and it probably required several pieces of evidence for them to be eventually convinced: the empty tomb, the appearances in the upper room, at Emmaus, at the lake edge preparing a meal, even his Ascension, and just possibly the image on his burial cloth!

Indeed if a sedile was used, the victim might survive even for one or two days, or if the victim was tied to the cross instead of being nailed. However on p.84 in his “Doctor at Calvary” Pierre Barbet mentions the crucifragium as a Roman custom in passing. He cites Seneca, Ammienis Marcellinus, Origen and Plautus who all refer to it. It was a certain way of bringing about death. The reason being a natural instinct was for the victim to relieve oncoming asphyxia by using his legs to relieve the arm tension, and this resulted in a kind of see saw motion, as the victim attempted to maintain breathing. In order for the crucifragium to be effective therefore, it would seem fairly likely that the femur was broken, as breaking the tibia would probably require a much greater leverage, being more resistant, and would probably result in only breaking the fibula first. The victim would then be no longer able to breathe and would quickly expire. The reason why it was carried out on the two thieves was that the Jews asked Pilate for it so that the bodies would not remain on their crosses during the sabbath which that year also happened to be Pesach [John 19:31]. Barbet also comments on the reasons for the more rapid death of Jesus as being the various pre crucifixion trauma including scourging, buffeting, his Agony in Gethsemane etc. The piercing with a lance was carried out as a legal requirement to ensure death had occurred whenever relatives asked for the body. As a physician interested in these matters, Jesterof really needs to study Barbet’s text closely if he has not already done so, as he may be able to comment usefully upon it. Another useful briefer reference is a paper “Crucifixion in Antiquity, the Anthropological Evidence”, By Joe Zias found at: http://www.joezias.com/Crucifixion Antiquity.html. There is some variation from Barbet in the Zias’ reference, specifically the actual “cause of death” from crucifixion.

From this time on, several churches notably in Georgia begin to display icons depicting Christ, with facial features that bear striking resemblances to the Shroud image. They usually claimed to be based on the Mandylion image of Edessa. Edessa at this time had become a major centre of Syriac Christian scholarship. If the Mandylion was not in fact the Shroud, it would seem to have at least been based on it. However it was also claimed to have been “not made by human hands”, a description which readily fits the Shroud image. As for there being no references to such images before the 6th century, it is just that Byzantine scholars are not adequately equipped to read pre Constantine Christian code. We have for example the inscription of Avercius Marcellus, bishop of Hieropolis ~180 200: He describes his return journey from Rome having seen all the cities of Syria, in the company of one Palut, the name of one of the first bishops of Edessa, thus: “Faith everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands from a fountain and this it ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread.” The “fish of exceeding great size” is clearly not meant to be the eucharist, separately referred to at the end of the paragraph, but represents something else. It is during Avercius’ time as bishop that Abgar VIII becomes Christian, probably being baptized by Avercius, with the “fish of exceeding great size” as a visual aid, and hinted at in the pseudonymous allegory commissioned by Abgar VIII to mark the occasion, which became known as the doctrine of Addai. Avercius very likely returned the “fish of exceeding great size” to its place in Antioch, but it was subsequently brought back to Edessa, upon the impending destruction of that apostolic city..","date":"2014-01-19","mins":"3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"id":"comment-14292","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Screwtape the Father of Lies is at it again.

Your earlier comment on John Curcuas’ besieging of Edessa and the concessions he made merely for the sake of an icon also remains as a powerful argument. The Shroud Arcaulf saw in Jerusalem was said to have been given to Charlemagne in 797 AD, and may have been the “Shroud of Compiegne” in the south near Toulouse, and destroyed during the French Revolution. It eludes me why any Passion relics should be taken direct from Jerusalem to ancient Gaul. Later, Mahomet and Saladin’s domination of the East would likely have destroyed any remaining Christian relics, and any in France would more likely have come from Constantinople. Likely, any such would also have been destroyed in the Revolution along with the records, and the trail would now be hopelessly cold. That may be the reason why the matter has not been seen as a fruitful area for research.

The path to maleness or femaleness originates at the moment of “meiosis” when a cell divides to produce sex cells or gametes having half the normal number of chromosomes. A male XY cell divides to produce sperm, half of which is X and half of which is Y. A female XX cell divides each producing an egg, all with one X cell. If a Y sperm fertilises an egg, it produces a male XY; if an X sperm fertilises an egg it produces a female XX. So the mystery is, “If Jesus was truly a man, where did he get his Y chromosomes from?” Now aberrations do occur, and in fact the whole history of life forms has depended on them, successful aberrations surviving and being passed onto new generations to become new life forms, less successful aberrations dying out. For examples several disorders are associated with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, but conceivably other more benign aberrations might also occur. A related theological question is, “In what way way is Jesus both God and man?” The stock answer is that he did not have a human father, and the evangelist’s account only relates in the angel’s message to Mary “That the power of the Most High will overshadow thee.” This probably suffices for the state of contemporary medical knowledge of the time, but is somewhat lacking in modern biological detail. We might speculate that it was God’s plan that Mary should have some chromosome cell aberration, enabling her to pass on a Y chromosome, possibly inherited from her father, or it may have involved some other unusual variation, or it might just have been some kind of miracle. Some things I guess, we are just not entitled to know, and it need not affect one’s faith, unless one adopts a particularly and possibly unjustifiably dogmatic view of biology.

If Jesus is truly man, then God has placed a deliberate temporary limit on Himself as to how He might manifest the second person of His trinitarian self. I should think He can go only so far without abandoning this agenda of adopting a truly human nature. If He went beyond that limit, it might be said that in fact the worldly manifestation of Jesus was not in fact truly human at all, but actually something else, and that might be a problem in asserting the truth of his human nature. The AB blood type and XY chromosome questions do I think raise teasing problems. Perhaps the answer might lie in the quantum! Or more likely the answer is in our limited human understanding and in the limited way we can use language to express supernatural truths..","date":"2015-04-13","mins":"3:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/13/with-anyone-interested-in-listening/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"With Anyone Interested in Listening"},{"id":"comment-196344","author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Jim, Any study of the first 500 years of Christian literature will demonstrate that the problem of the duality of Christ exercised very many great minds of the period, many heresies arose in various attempts to get human minds around the problem. It was even a popular public topic in the Greek market places. “Arianism, which denied Christ’s essential divinity, aroused an all pervasive reaction in the 4th century; the task of the first two ecumenical councils, at Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), was to affirm the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. In the 5th century the Christological question moved to the fore, and the Council of Chalcedon (451), completing that of Ephesus (431), defined Christ as one person in two natures. The Christological controversies of the 5th century were extremely complex, involving not only theological issues but also issues of national concerns—especially in the Syrian influenced East, where the national churches were called non Chalcedonian because they rejected the doctrinal formulas of the Council of Chalcedon.” [Encyc Brit] The ‘one person in two natures’ is a convenient formula within the human limitations of language to express a supernatural truth, and it is evident that it did not find universal acceptance outside of the establishment orthodoxy. It continued to exercise many great minds even well after Chalcedon. Perhaps to some extent it is merely semantics and a playing with words, in terms limited by mere human experience. And of course all of this occurred outside of our modern understanding of detailed human biology. It might be argued that ‘to share all human traits’ is not necessarily to be fully human. How, for instance, is it to be fully human without having a human father? The scientific questions concerning AB blood type and the necessity of Y chromosomes to be male, perhaps raise modern issues to be addressed. I don’t pretend to have the answers to these questions, and perhaps the mystics might have a better answer than the theologians. We are taught by a church, which although divinely inspired and led by the Spirit, still comprises only human teachers using human language. There is a greater Truth. A scriptural verse keeps coming to my mind, ‘ “My ways are not your ways” saith the Lord. ‘ Perhaps we can do no better than that and accept it..","date":"2015-04-14","mins":"4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/13/with-anyone-interested-in-listening/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"With Anyone Interested in Listening"}]
