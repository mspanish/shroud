I’ve looked into a lot weird religiously based claims that don’t get a lot of skeptical treatment or scrutiny. The Shroud is one of them. When I first heard about the Shroud a few years ago I was surprised at the lack of skeptical sources on the internet or in books, responding to the obvious pseudoscientific “findings” and methods of that crowd.

I think your explanation is brilliant. As regards to the proshroudies. They’ve been caught with there pants down (figuratively) too many times. STURP reminds me of the pseudoscience done by creation “scientists”. I think the reason it hasn’t been explained is because no one wants to explain it because it serves a religious purpose and mystery gets publicity. My question is when I read Dan Porter, he says he believes it’s authentic but then says he doesn’t believe it’s a miracle and can be explained naturally.What do you make of that because at times it seems like he’s talking out both sides of his mouth. Like it seems many times that people in that camp will try to play both sides of the table like that..","date":"2017-03-18","mins":"6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/testing-my-flour-imprint-hypothesis-might-those-be-solid-gluten-flecks-one-sees-on-the-shroud-scope-body-image/","cat":"medieval_hoax","title":"Might those be flecks of congealed wheat gluten one sees on the Turin Shroud?

It’s hard for me to believe a lot of the pro shroudies given the spurious nature of a lot of their claims. I saw your comment on Dan Porters site about the graphite background and the picture of the red painting on linen. Could this be a light phenomena? assuming the images are as superficial as they say. In any case, I’m convinced that the shroud is a fake. I think the image of the hair may come from the outlines of the painted blood and perhaps some oil substance staining through which adds to the paredolia. In the big picture I think this is the last thing Christianity has seeing that they’ve lost when it comes to creationism, geocentrism and Adam and Eve. Seeing that all these things have been debunked. I think the shroud will follow.

Then he comes up with some ridiculous theories and thoughts that destroy any credibility he might have claimed. His latest nonsense concerns the 1516 Lire copy. He presents an argument along the following lines. The Lire copy shows minimal blood stains, only discrete ones on the palms of both hands and the side wound. He presents an argument that essentially the blood stains were added to the shroud over time, and the Lire copy showing discrete wounds consistent with the Bible was an early stage in the progressive re interpretation of the shroud to incrementally show more blood wounds. He even throws up his bizarre Lirey Badge theory again, arguing because we can’t see blood wounds on what amounts to a tiny metal crafted badge that there was no blood on the shroud in the 1300s. This is nonsense, because the scale is too small to reasonably show bloods wound, although it does show the blood across the bottom of the back of Jesus, which Berry inventively (I’ll always give him points for creating novel theories, even if they are nonsense) calls a chain. Mr Berry needs to get himself to a decent university library and educate himself in art history. There are at least two examples of epitaphios from 1200, and the 1300s respectively, that show Jesus with body wide wounds and flagrum marks (I might add very consistent with the positioning of marks on the Shroud, one of these even shows a wound on the wrist on the top hand, and none on the other), being laid out on a herringbone weave shroud. These provide very compelling evidence that the Shroud was in existence AT LEAST as early as 1200 (personally I believe the shroud goes back to the time of Christ, but for now let’s just deal with the middle ages) In my opinion, an explanation for the differences in the Lirey copy from the shroud that is FAR more likely is that the Lirey copy’s differences are due to the artist wanting to show the hand wounds in accordance with conventional artistic depiction. Similarly representations of Jesus through the 1500s / 1600s were typically non gory, hence the very limited and discrete depictions of key (in the sense of the Gospel accounts) bloody wounds. As I have stated here before, there is a limited period in German art from about the late 1300s to the late 1400s that shows Christ’s body heavily wounded, and one or two other curious examples, such as the epitaphios I mention above. Otherwise minimal and discrete wounds are the norm.","date":"2012-07-29","mins":"4:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/is-the-non-fluorescent-body-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-a-valid-indicator/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Is the non-fluorescent body image on the Shroud of Turin a valid indicator?"},{"id":"comment-14291","author":"matt","post":"Indeed other copies demonstrate “reinterpretation” of the shroud to suit their audience.

If these “blood” stains were painted first it wouldn’t take that much effort to align the bas relief. As for Adler and Heller, I’m skeptical of the results any STURP member given some of their pseudoscientific methods and claims. Shroudies are just saying that the blood first is slam dunk evidence that it is the real thing. As for the fluorescence your post “Most definitely no”, was very good.
