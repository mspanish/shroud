He was in fact lined up to be Emperor, but this was changed when the Emperor finally had a son. Bela III fostered relations with Constantinople and \"invited religous orders and scholars from abroad to settle in the country\" (From \"The Church and Bela III of Hungary (1172 1196): the Role of Archbishop Likacs of Esztergom\")This provides further backing for the claim that the images in the Pray Manuscript were influenced by a viewing of the Shroud in Constantinople. In fact, could the images have been drawn by one of the foreign scholars, perhaps from Constantinople? The fact that the Pray Manuscript is the first written Hungarian document supports the notion of a foreign creator or protagonist.

But it could also be a play on the poker holes of the Shroud.From what I've observed of Byzantine art, circles are often used, but when they surround Jesus's head they are usually 4 circles in the pattern of a cross. I haven't seen this 3 circles on one side, and 4 circles on the other side, pattern before.So I am just theorising but maybe in Byzantine times people interpreted the 7 poker holes on the frontal image in light of the numerological significance of the number \"7\".","date":"2012-07-14","mins":"1:34 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/according-to-john-chapter-20-jesus-was.html","title":"\n`according to John chapter 20, Jesus was wrapped in linen cloths (plural) ...

Before his death, after the descent from the cross, he is also usually shown with minimal wounds. Certainly most art will usually show him – at worst – with wounds in the palms, and feet, the side wound, and sometimes blood on the head. It is very rare for more widespread body wounds, including flagrum marks, to be shown. Actually, I disagree with Yannick’s comment that Christ’s body wide wounds began to be shown in the early 1200s after the crusades. Actually, the only time in history where Jesus’s widespread body wounds were depicted clearly in graphic detail was a period in the mid to late 1400s in German art. The fact that earlier art eg. Byzantine art – didn’t show wounds on Jesus’s body does not prove that the Shroud did not exist in this earlier period. Simply, in theological terms, Christ was God, and his humanity including physical suffering was minimised. Remember, the Bible mentions the flogging Jesus received, his body wide scourging. Anyone who read the Bible from ancient times knew that Jesus’s body would have been severely wounded. Yet he was not represented this way in art. The FACT that Jesus’s comprehensive body wide wounds have not usually been shown in the history of art – apart from a period around the mid to late 1400s in German art – is a very strong point supporting the Shroud’s authenticity. Indeed, from an art history perspective if any time in history made sense for the Shroud’s creation it would be in the mid to late 1400s. But we know that the latest that the Shroud could have been created by a GENIUS would have been the mid 1300s. The fact that depictions of the Mandylion show Jesus with open eyes is almost irrelevant. These depictions were not copies, they were art. In addition, an alternative explanation is that actually the image on the Shroud is very faint when viewed in the flesh ie. Without our modern day photographic enhancements. It wouldn’t necessarily have been clear that Jesus’s eyes were closed to people viewing the Shroud in ancient times.","date":"2012-07-07","mins":"5:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13564","author":"matt","post":"Re: the German art in the mid to late 1400s showing Jesus’s body wide wounds, refer this information that I posted on Stephen Jones’s website: Examples from the late 1400’s of art that shows body wide cuts, marks and blood can be found at these websites: http://www.bridgemanart.com/asset/229986/German School 15th century/Ms 351455 fol.148v The Entombment from %27 The Life?lang=en US http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias Gr%C3%B Cnewald http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andachtsbilder All are German art, so there must have been a movement in Germany around the late 1400s to early 1500s to show Jesus’s body in a much more tortured and injured manner.

Whilst not conclusive, I consider this is the Mandylion / shroud: http://www.courseportfolio.org/peer/potfolio Files/anon F/shopkow l 2003 1/alexis.htm Refer to paragraph 18 which mentions that the saint went to Edessa “to see an icon that he had heard tell of”, and later on the icon calls for the Saint’s servant to call for St Alexius “Linda Cooper `The Old French Life of Saint Alexis and the Shroud of Turin’, Modern Philology [a journal devoted to research in medieval and modern literature], University of Chicago Press, August 1966, pp.1 17. The eleventh century Old French Life of Saint Alexis, generally recognized as the first masterpiece of French literature, contains the passage: Then he [Alexis] went off to the city of Edessa Because of an image he had heard tell of, Which the angels made at God’s commandment… As Linda Cooper shows in this highly scholarly paper, the `image’ referred to is none other than the Image of Edessa, and when the various versions of St. Alexis’s life are studied, it makes a great deal of sense that this was one and the same as the Shroud. She cites, for instance, the Bollandist Vita Alexius which calls it `sine humano opere imago Domini nostri Jesu Christi in sindone’ , i.e. `an image of our Lord Jesus Christ made without human work on a sindone’; also the Latin Cod. Monac. Aug. S.Ulr. 111 … `[he came] to the city of Edessa, in which there was preserved a blood stained image of the Lord not made by hands’. Both passages clearly refute arguments that the Image of Edessa was incompatible with the cloth we know today as the Turin Shroud.” (BSTS Newsletter, No. 16, May 1987, p.14). St. Alexius (or Alexis) lived in Edessa between 412 and 435: “Saint Alexius or Alexis of Rome or Alexis von Edessa was an Eastern saint whose veneration was later transplanted to Rome, a process facilitated by the fact that, according to the earlier Syriac legend that a “Man of God” of Edessa, Mesopotamia who during the episcopate of Bishop Rabbula (412 435) lived by begging and shared the alms he received with other poor people was, after his death there, found to be a native of Rome.” (“Alexius of Rome,” Wikipedia, n 24 March 2012)..","date":"2012-07-07","mins":"5:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13570","author":"matt","post":"I don’t have time to reply in detail to Yannick’s piece, but thank you Yannick for an excellent piece, it’s a great resource.","date":"2012-07-07","mins":"5:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-17738","author":"matt","post":"This is a good posting.

Another interpretation could be that the author of the Acts of Thaddeus, having seen the Image of Edessa which was actually the Shroud folded to only display the face of Jesus, wrote this legend to explain the faint image of Jesus’ face one sees on the Shroud (and one saw on the Image of Edessa). Given the faint image of the face, a legendary explanation that it was created by a wet or sweaty face makes a good deal of sense. “So the context has nothing to do with a burial cloth of more than 4 meters long.” Well it does if the “burial cloth” being the shroud had been hidden away / disguised by it being folded to only reveal the image of Jesus’s face, in order to get around the fact that theologically speaking it would have been offensive at the time to show Jesus’s naked and heavily tortured body.

Please put your prejudices aside, and assume for the moment that the Image of Edessa WAS in fact the Shroud, folded in a manner that only displays the image of the face. Assuming that, then it makes perfect sense that the legend would seek to explain the creation of that image in the way that it does.And furthermore, if we continue with the assumption that the Image of Edessa WAS the Shroud folded, we should also note that the balance of the shroud image beyond the face was hidden for a reason/s, which may have included the inappropriateness of showing Jesus’s naked, tortured body. Then, if the public / vast majority was not aware of the shroud that lay folded beneath the facial image, then in terms of conventional wisdom the Image of Edessa was not the shroud, and was not the burial clothes of Jesus – therefore we logically conclude that there is no logical tension in the legend from the perspective of a hypothesis suggesting the Image of Edessa WAS the Shroud..","date":"2012-09-19","mins":"4:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"id":"comment-16547","author":"matt","post":"Thanks Yannick.

Your piece from July 2012 refers to a record that demonstrates that a Mandylion and burial shroud existed in Constantinople amongst a number of relics in the 11th century. Your piece clearly states that the records show that the mandylion was a painting. Although there is some ambiguity, the historical records suggest that the Image of Edessa was a faint, ghostly image, hence the legend that explained the formation of the image as being generated by Jesus pressing his wet face into the cloth.
