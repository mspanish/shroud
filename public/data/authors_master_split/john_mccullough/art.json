[{"id":"comment-14062","author":"john_mccullough","post":"Back in the summer of 1961 I was a 10 year old boy with an adventurous spirit, exploring a deep glen with a fast – flowing river in the north of Ireland. I was with a group of friends but I was the first to jump in. The others didn’t really notice what I was doing as they were building a camp fire. Soon I found myself in trouble. My right foot was jammed tight between two rocks. The force of the water knocked me off balance and I found myself trapped under the water, unable to reach the surface. Panic set in. I struggled with all my might to reach the surface but it was no good. Then I thought of the hurt it would cause my family if I died. I felt sad for them and not for myself. Suddenly an image of Jesus appeared in my minds eye or the in the water. I can’t be sure after so many years. Suddenly I found myself free from the underwater trap and standing in shallow water near the bank. It happened in a flash. To this day I believe that the Lord Jesus intervened to save my life. I often wondered why my life was saved. I became a teacher for 38 years and hopefully influenced many young lives for the good..","date":"2012-07-21","mins":"4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
