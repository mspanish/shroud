Hello Dan, and everyone, I really enjoy your blog too… thank you for all that you have done. The missing piece that I see among all of these Shroud Experts – is that the key to the Resurrection of Jesus – is ACCEPTING that God has Risen! – just as our Holy Father Pope Benedict says! Letting Our Risen Saviour TRANSFORM US! – ON HIS TERMS! – BECAUSE HE KNOWS BEST! Our Holy Father speaks about the Resurrection throwing OPEN the dark door of the future, of time, of death – but in my life the RESURRECTION – has thrown open the DARK DOOR – of my own wretched existence – and is creating a SINGULAR NEW LIFE – within! You are welcome to join me in the Singular Encounter that is Resurrection NOW! Charity, Joy, and Peace in Our Risen Saviour!.","date":"2012-09-07","mins":"7:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/04/while-you-were-sleeping-a-million-page-views/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"While you were sleeping: A million page views"}]
