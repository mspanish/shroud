I pointed this out when Colin had the linen draped over a hot medal figure idea. He couldn’t answer that problem then and I repeated the question with this new idea and he want to reread his 1400 post on this subject to find an answer. Now let’s assume that in the coming years he’s able to produce a full body image, he only have shown that this would be one of the possible ways the image came about. It in no way proves that this was the way the only it could have been produced, nor that the Shroud is not the real deal. The only way I see in resolving the issues that Hugh and others have pointed out is to retest the shroud. I value the work of both Colin and Hugh and I consider it very important, but it looks like without retesting we are spinning our wheel refighting the same battles over and over again..","date":"2015-08-31","mins":"8:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/31/colin-berrys-and-my-3d-plotting-problems/","cat":"3d","title":"Colin Berry’s and My 3D Plotting Problems"},{"id":"comment-175709","author":"john_green","post":"How much calcium carbonate?

It’s one thing to do an imprint of a hand, but yet another to try and do a whole body, both sides. Do you use a live model, or kill someone first and put marks on the body? Do you coat the subject first and then lay the body down on the linen? I don’t think that would give you a clear outline, but I’m not going to try it. Do you somehow hold the subject up and drake the linen over them and press the linen down with your hands? That would give you a very uneven image I think. And now the biggest problem, WHY? Why would anyone go to all that trouble? Why would they have not just painted an image on the linen? I mean they would have no way of knowing the tools we have in hand to detect paint or other thing on the linen? Most likely it would take years and years of trial and error to come up with this, if they could do it. It makes no sense. Why not just use some type of paint or something to paint an image on the linen? I don’t think it was painted, but that would be the easy way to do it. If it’s real than I think it’s some type of natural event, but that brings a whole new set of questions.
