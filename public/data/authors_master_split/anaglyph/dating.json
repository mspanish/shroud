[{"id":"comment-16","author":"anaglyph","post":"Dan: You’ve kind of missed my point, either willfully or accidentally. I don’t really care if the Turin Shroud is ‘the burial cloth of late Second Temple era crucifixion victim’ or a forgery or a tea towel. What I’m saying is that the concept of the Turin Shroud being the burial cloth of Jesus Christ of Nazareth is hooey. As I’m sure you are aware, the evidence that has been offered up over the years in favour of this idea has been voluminous and contradictory. The discovery of pollen grains that were testament to the shroud’s pedigree was quickly thrown into question. Impressions of ‘flowers’ on the shroud are plainly nothing more than paradolia. A plausible method for the formation of the human figure (other than painting with pigments) has never been advanced. The carbon dating, which was sought for decades as the ultimate decider, was rejected by Shroudies when it didn’t return the desired result: there was something wrong with the dating (the data set was wrong/the sample was tainted by atmospheric carbon/the piece of cloth was taken from an anachronistic repair). As I pointed out, even the Bible itself contradicts the science that has come from the shroud – the amount of aloes and spice that was brought to the tomb by Nicodemus and used on the body was ‘a hundred pounds in weight’. That’s an awful lot of spices for absolutely no trace to survive in the cloth, especially if pollen allegedly did. This pattern of ‘moving the goalposts’ and cherry picking the data is well known to any observer of pseudo scientific belief: If the results don’t fit the preconception, then there is something wrong with the method, not the conclusion. Let’s first address the question about seeking proof that Jesus Christ was resurrected… But it isn’t so. I seldom hear it from any shroud researcher. What? Of of course it’s about acquiring proof, and of course no one’s going to admit that’s what it’s about (especially to themselves) for the reason I gave: seeking evidence indicates lack of faith. And not just lack of faith in the resurrection, but lack of faith that Jesus even existed as the character he is concocted to be. (Quite obviously, establishing proof that the shroud is Jesus’ burial cloth implies proof of the story of the resurrection – if it didn’t, and it was just about Jesus being a normal mortal man, then the whole ideology of the Christian church surely collapses like a deck of cards). If it’s not about all that, then what is it about? Some abstract historical pursuit of a quasi religious artifact? There are many of those and none of them attract the kind of zealots that swarm around the Shroud of Turin. Quite the opposite, people who did talk about their faith (and that wasn’t a big topic) expressed the view that the shroud has nothing to do with their faith. I really can’t believe that you are quite that naive. So, um, these people are just history students who happen to be obsessed to the point of fanaticism with this one religious relic? Oh, don’t get me wrong – I’m sure that if the shroud turned out to be a fake (or some other mis identified personage) the discovery wouldn’t alter anyone’s faith, but I bet you’re all kinda hoping that it is Jesus. Because, deep down, that would sort of ‘help the faith along’, wouldn’t it? Your guess that there was ‘one atheist’ in a crowd of believers at the Ohio conference is telling – I don’t think any other truly scientific enterprise would throw that statistic. But the evidence does not support the argument that it is fake. Perhaps not, but there is a truckload of evidence to suggest to the sensible observer that the shroud is not the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. That it is a fake is plenty more plausible than that particular piece of wishful thinking. We know for certain that religious fakery has been rife through the ages, and when it comes to the Christian ouevre, particularly around the time that carbon dating and the historical records of the Catholic church place this particular piece of cloth. Let me make you a prediction Dan: when the carbon dating data is re examined, the evidence will still be unequivocal. In fact, if the Jacksons, or anyone else, manage to get a different segment of the cloth tested, I predict that the data will, once more, indicate something contradictory to the idea that the Turin Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, and when that happens, a whole new reason will be advanced as to why the method is faulty. Please feel free to revisit Tetherd Cow at that time and tell me if my conjecture is wrong..","date":"2008-08-27","mins":"1:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/08/26/more-tetherd-cow-ahead-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"More Tetherd Cow Ahead on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-17","author":"anaglyph","post":"That should have read: “when the carbon dating data is re examined, the evidence will still be equivocal“.

What do you mean by: >>Whether the shroud is the work of a human hand (forgery, hoax, as pseudo sceptics would say), or whether it was accidental/incidental involving a corpse under unobserved circumstances is beside the point. Also, the carbon dating problem pales into significance as far as believers or pseudo sceptics are concerned, because the real matter at hand is the image itself.? That makes absolutely no sense. Of course the genesis of the image is not ‘beside the point’. That’s the whole point, surely? >>and of course, imagining the entire image while executing the painting, back, front and inside out to all match perfectly while taking into account perspective distortion and blood flow into relevant parts, and one last thing – the whole image would be done in negative! All of this would have to have been done by a painter WITHOUT A SINGLE MISTAKE. The microscope has shown that quite clearly. Contrary to what you say about ‘nobody has been able to explain how the image could have been made’, and as I have already pointed out, this would have been a trivial undertaking – merely paint a body with some kind of pigment and wrap it in a cloth. Why do you keep repeating the stupid notion that critics insist it was ‘painted’? I never said that, and as far as I know, NO ONE who is critical of the shroud says that. (And there’s no evidence of blood flow, as I’m sure you are totally aware – that’s pareidolia and conjecture at best) Your elaborate demonstration that a even a painter of genius couldn’t have made the image is meaningless. ANYONE could have painted a body and wrapped it in a cloth. Even unintentionally, unguents or oils could have made a life like impression of a body. Aging does the rest. As I’ve said before, the fact that it’s a negative is completely UNSURPRISING, even though you seem to have trouble with that – it’s a natural consequence of the higher contours of the form being in heavier contact with the cloth. And, just to be clear here, I’m not a ‘pseudo sceptic’, whatever that is. I’m a dyed in the wool total skeptic.

So now you’ve won me over Dan. That doesn’t happen very often. Thanks for a very reasoned and rational response. I will take only a couple of your points to task (although I do also have a few other issues with what you say, not least with the concept that the image on the shroud is formed with something other than a paint or pigment) and it is these: Actually, not all biblical exegetes agree that the spices were used. Remember, the funeral preparations were not finished and that the intent seems to be that Jesus’ followers would return following the Jewish Sabbath to complete funeral preparations. Regardless, biblical narratives, like world view, is not valid input into scientific observation. Two things here: contradictions within the Bible are, as you know, quite common. This provides a real problem for a rational person such as myself, and it is this: how do you choose which bits to believe? In my opinion one contradiction in the Bible opens it up to question, but so very many makes it entirely questionable. You may choose to ignore the passage in John in favour of other more ‘shroud friendly’ bits, but as the Michael Drosnin, the shyster who wrote The Bible Code, demonstrated, you can make the Good Book say anything you want with enough selective interpretation. Secondly, I agree that the Bible can’t be used as valid scientific input, but unfortunately a great many people who are obsessed by the shroud don’t make any differentiation between scientific method and what they consider an infallible historical document; the Gospel Truth, as it were. That charge [cherry picking/moving the goalposts] is fair. But it goes both ways. We see it, not just in the arena of shroud research but in many areas (and by the way not just in the realm of pseudo scientific belief as you characterize it but in science itself). I concur, but cherry picking is WAY more common in unscientific reasoning. Scientists do it, but as you obviously know, the scientific method is designed to weed out that kind of problem, and largely it works. Uninformed people don’t know it’s at work though, and pseudoscience loves to assemble a big pile of ‘facts’ accumulated in this manner. ‘Moving the goal posts’ is not common in science, but very prevalent in pseudoscience – if the evidence isn’t fitting your hypothesis, then, rather than examine the strength of the hypothesis, make new conditions for the evidence. Dan, it is obvious that your interest in the shroud transcends a mere need to have your religious beliefs validated, and for making that assumption, and for my terse tone in tangling with you, please accept my apologies. I’m not accustomed to anyone being able to hold their end of a rational debate in these matters (and as I am often heard to proclaim, I am entirely prepared to listen to rational arguments for anything at all – as long as they are truly rational arguments). To close, let me just say this: if there is a mystery of the Shroud of Turin, it is, in my opinion, that the figure represented is artistically quite out of keeping with anything else of the medieval period. The kind of relatively ‘realistic’ portrayal of a human body is, as far as I know, unique in the relic making industry. Equivalent relic portraiture (such as the many ‘Veils of Veronica’) are unconvincing and contrived, where the shroud retains a level of ‘plausibility’ (which, in my opinion, is the reason for its continued interest – if it was as obviously fake as the Cottingly Fairies, say, or any one of the existing Veronica’s Veils. It would have faded into obscurity long ago). I hasten to add that I don’t believe that the execution of such an item would have been at all beyond the skills of an artist of the 13th/14th C, but it is contextually unusual. I’m surprised that this argument for the veracity of the shroud is not used more frequently. So. Now I now where to come when I need informed comment on the shroud. Salut!
