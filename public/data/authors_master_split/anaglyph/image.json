[{"id":"comment-382","author":"anaglyph","post":"SJ Miller: Your reasoning is foggy and unfocussed. What do you mean by: >>Whether the shroud is the work of a human hand (forgery, hoax, as pseudo sceptics would say), or whether it was accidental/incidental involving a corpse under unobserved circumstances is beside the point. Also, the carbon dating problem pales into significance as far as believers or pseudo sceptics are concerned, because the real matter at hand is the image itself.? That makes absolutely no sense. Of course the genesis of the image is not ‘beside the point’. That’s the whole point, surely? >>and of course, imagining the entire image while executing the painting, back, front and inside out to all match perfectly while taking into account perspective distortion and blood flow into relevant parts, and one last thing – the whole image would be done in negative! All of this would have to have been done by a painter WITHOUT A SINGLE MISTAKE. The microscope has shown that quite clearly. Contrary to what you say about ‘nobody has been able to explain how the image could have been made’, and as I have already pointed out, this would have been a trivial undertaking – merely paint a body with some kind of pigment and wrap it in a cloth. Why do you keep repeating the stupid notion that critics insist it was ‘painted’? I never said that, and as far as I know, NO ONE who is critical of the shroud says that. (And there’s no evidence of blood flow, as I’m sure you are totally aware – that’s pareidolia and conjecture at best) Your elaborate demonstration that a even a painter of genius couldn’t have made the image is meaningless. ANYONE could have painted a body and wrapped it in a cloth. Even unintentionally, unguents or oils could have made a life like impression of a body. Aging does the rest. As I’ve said before, the fact that it’s a negative is completely UNSURPRISING, even though you seem to have trouble with that – it’s a natural consequence of the higher contours of the form being in heavier contact with the cloth. And, just to be clear here, I’m not a ‘pseudo sceptic’, whatever that is. I’m a dyed in the wool total skeptic. I don’t equivocate..","date":"2009-04-19","mins":"7:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/03/08/a-new-comment-promoted-on-tetherd-cow-ahead-discussion-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A New Comment Promoted on Tetherd Cow Ahead Discussion on the Shroud of Turin"}]
