[{"id":"comment-5024","author":"rhonda_kale","post":"On October 11 of this year, I lost my youngest son. He was 33. I begged God to please let him live, to take me instead. Please Lord just let him come home like he always did. When we got home, I was told to go and lay down and rest. I went to Haven’s room and sat where he always sat on his bed. I cried and I begged God not to take him. Please Lord let him come home. I heard a voice that said “He is home.” I heard the song “Peace in The Valley.” Haven had longed for peace in his life. I saw Jesus on the left side of Haven with his arm around him. They were walking into a bright light. They face each other as they walked. Talking like old friends.Haven patted his right back pocket, a habit of his to make sure he had his wallet. I saw a big smile, a smile of happiness, a smile of peace on his face. I still miss him so much and I love him. I am at peace knowing that he is with our lord..","date":"2011-11-25","mins":"11:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
