So here’s another thought I had from the thread: another way of thinking about “the theoretical or even practical possibility of a repair patch having been inadvertently selected for testing” is that it wasn’t inadvertent at all. They ostensibly picked that corner for the sample because material from that corner had previously been taken and thus they wouldn’t have to cut from a pristine area. And since that corner had previously had samples removed (and was a corner always handled during exhibitions), it was an area that warranted repairs..","date":"2013-11-09","mins":"4:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cementing Over Central Park"},{"id":"comment-192030","author":"jmarino240","post":"Here is a transcription of the letter from Prof. Raes to Fr. Dreisbach in the link posted by Giorgio on 27 Feb at 10:22 p.m.: Dear Fr. Dreisbach, Conc. The Turin Shroud A few days ago Mr. Remi Van Haelst transmitted to me a copy of your letter of October 30 containing a copy of your letter to Mr. Riggi. Mr Van Haelst asked me to answer directly to you. I will try to clarify as good as possible the situation after (?) the Symposium of Paris. It is true that in my report of the 1973 I mentioned that I found traces of cotton fibres only in the main body of the Shroud. I must however add that even for the main body I did not find traces of cotton in all microscopical preparations. On the other hand, I had only a very small part of the strip added to the main body and I could only make a few microscopical preparations of the fibres of the strip. We must therefore be very careful with our conclusions. In his contribution of Paris, Prof. Vial suggested that the cotton fibres mentioned in my report could be superficial fibres present on the surface of the Shroud and not belonging to the yarns of the Shroud. After the Paris meeting I was writing to Prof. Vial telling him that I could not agree with him and that in my opinion the cotton fibres were not superficial fibres. I proposed to Prof Vial a test allowing to be absolutely sure about the location of the cotton fibres. I wonder however if it should be possible in practice to perform such a test. Till [sic] now I did not have any reply of Prof. Vial. The presence of traces of cotton were confirmed by the sample tested by Oxford for the C 14 datation test. Prof. Hall found some foreign fibres in his sample identified by a laboratory of Darbyshire as being cotton fibres. As told in my contribution in Paris we may regret that this laboratory was not able to identify the variety of the cotton fibres by testing the number of reversals as told in my research of 1973. I have tried to answer as good as possible the different questions put to Mr. Van Haelst and Riggi. If there are any other points that you should like to clarify don’t hesitate to call upon me. Sincerely yours, [signed] G. Raes.","date":"2015-02-28","mins":"11:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"id":"comment-184626","author":"jmarino240","post":"Sue Benford had 10 peer reviewed scientific articles published between 1999 and 2001.

In discussions like these, I like to bring up the quote by the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788 1860): “All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self evident.” Pseudo science is a matter of perspective. Some Shroud skeptics label the STURP scientists, many of whom worked in the U.S.’ space and nuclear programs, as pseudo scientists ostensibly because they wouldn’t declare the Shroud to be a fake and/or entertained the idea that it might have wrapped the historical Jesus. Here are a few more of my favorite quotes regarding thought and reality in science: “Old ideas are not right simply because they are old and new ideas are not wrong simply because the are new.” Astrophysicist Tommy Gold “My own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.” J.B.S. Haldane. “I shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud.” C.G. Jung “Nature never deceives us; It is always us who deceive ourselves. Jean Jacque Rousseau “All progress resulted from people who took unpopular positions.” Adlai Stevenson “All great truths begin as blasphemies.” George Bernard Shaw “…after a few more flashes in the pan, we shall hear very little more of Edison or his electric lamp. Every claim he makes has been tested and proved impracticable. New York Times, January 16, 1880 “X rays will prove to be a hoax” Lord Kelvin (1824 1907), English physicist and mathematician, who performed mathematical analysis of electricity and magnetism and invented the absolute temperature scale. “Heavier than air flying machines are impossible.” Lord Kelvin, President, Royal Society, 1895 “Anyone who looks for a source of power in the transformation of the atom is talking moonshine.” Lord Rutherford (1871 1937), physicist who developed the theory of atomic structure “There is no likelihood that man can ever tap the power of the atom” Robert Millikan, Nobel Prize physicist, 1923 “It is entirely possible that behind the perception of our senses, worlds are hidden of which we are unaware.” Albert Einstein When asked in a Discover Channel documentary about the possibility of the validity of the phenomenon called “remote viewing,” a scientist responded, “I wouldn’t believe it even if it was true.” (Now there’s an open minded scientist!).","date":"2015-01-20","mins":"6:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/19/jeffrey-skurka-on-buffalo-catholic-radio-station/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jeffrey Skurka on Buffalo Catholic Radio Station"},{"id":"comment-184657","author":"jmarino240","post":"Sue was a co author with Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell on a paper pertaining to Quantum Mechanics at the Fifth International Conference on Computing Anticipatory Systems(CASYS’01), Liège, Belgium, August 13 18, 2001.
