[{"id":"comment-49263","author":"jmarino240","post":"It is true that most Shroud conferences have papers or presentations by those who believe in the Shroud’s authenticity and that most papers are simply read out. There was a conference in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania in 1986 that had 5 speakers that were pro authenticity and 2 that were skeptics (Walter Mc Crone & Joe Nickell). At the Columbus, Ohio conference in 2008, organized by myself and my late wife, a paper was presented by a Spanish doctor who believed the Shroud image shows that the man in the Shroud was not dead. No other skeptic submitted a paper. When I produced a print Shroud newsletter and then later a Shroud email bulletin, I used to get a lot of grief from people for publishing views of various skeptics as well as theories outside the mainstream. I personally welcome and I welcome as spokesman for the committee putting together the St. Louis conference any submissions for papers with opposing views of authenticity. You have my word that those papers would not be discriminated against because it opposes authenticity. We would also welcome a debate and/or roundtable. In 2008, we had an open discussion about the C 14 that included all of the attendees, not just those who had presented papers. We also had question and answer sessions that did not require, like a certain conference in 2005, that the questions be written down beforehand so that they could be screened. Charles and Colin, we would very much like to see you in St. Louis..","date":"2013-10-30","mins":"5:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","title":"Ideas for conferences"},{"id":"comment-50938","author":"jmarino240","post":"As I recall, the point at which Msgr.

I understand your concern but putting on a conference is not a perfect democratic process. If the organizers waited until everyone was satisfied with all the aspects, a conference would never happen. Some people like the one you mention already have their minds made up and nothing, even approval of the reviewers, is likely to change their mind. The organizers simply can’t let opinions like the person you cite affect the running of the conference. We know there will be criticisms and we just accept that. It’s also important to remember that one of the purposes of a conference is to stimulate new ideas, not necessarily just to make conclusions..","date":"2014-06-01","mins":"1:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/01/program-and-presenters-for-the-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference/","cat":"event","title":"Program and Presenters for the St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference"},{"id":"comment-48796","author":"jmarino240","post":"Since 2 of the committee members had websites and since a conference needs sponsorship, it only seemed natural to have them co sponsor. Internally, we haven’t put a lot of focus on that. We’re just people who are interested in the Shroud and interested in spreading information about it. Ours is a U.S. Style conference and not similar to the higher end professionally sponsored conference that many European conferences are. Who attended the 1991 St. Louis conference and the 2008 Columbus conference seemed to enjoy those and I’m confident that the 2014 St. Louis conference will also be a great experience. Several STURP members, including Barrie Schwortz and John Jackson are planning to attend. We’re also hoping that Ken Stevenson, Tom D’Muhala, and John “Dee” German will come. Bob Villarreal of the Los Alamos National Laboratories will likely present. Various other scientists have expressed preliminary interest in coming. There’s already too much politics in sindonology. I wish it wasn’t being added to a conference barely off the ground. We’re hoping to add some new blood to sindonology. We would like to just share Shroud information, see old friends, meet new ones and feel that this conference is a good way to do that. The sponsorship is an important issue, but it should not be overblown..","date":"2013-10-26","mins":"11:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/26/some-thoughts-on-the-st-louis-conference-announcement/","cat":"event","title":"Some thoughts on the St. Louis conference announcement"},{"id":"comment-48789","author":"jmarino240","post":"The St. Louis conference is actually after the Bari conference, not before and it’s almost 5 weeks difference, not 3. Although it’s unfortunate that they’re close together, I think most Americans at least would prefer to attend a conference in the USA instead of Italy. I’m not sure why there’s an impression that there is a focus on the co sponsors. We simply announced who the co sponsors are and links were listed as part of the basic information. I’m also not sure why it’s felt there may be an agenda. Although the title points to the science/faith intersection of the Shroud, that’s always a given, and it was announced that topics for papers are open to any major aspect of sindonology. I was involved in planning both the 1991 St. Louis conference and the 2008 Columbus conference. One of the reasons the Columbus conference was held was that I was upset at the way the 2005 Dallas conference was held and also because of some restrictions that were going to be in place for another conference that was never actually held. The Columbus conference had a paper by a Spanish doctor who held that the Shroud image shows that the man in the Shroud was not dead. Although I am only one of 6 committee members for the 2014 St. Louis conference, I intend to push for complete openness and fairness in terms of papers that will be presented. I can tell you that in our many conference calls, other committee members expressed their willingness to have papers by Shroud critics to be presented. It’s unfortunate that this sort of cloud is being cast over the St. Louis conference..","date":"2013-10-26","mins":"10:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/26/some-thoughts-on-the-st-louis-conference-announcement/","cat":"event","title":"Some thoughts on the St. Louis conference announcement"},{"id":"comment-48806","author":"jmarino240","post":"Paulette wrote: “Who wouldn’t click on those UR Ls if interested in the conference and not be horrified.

Mark is actually working on a Press Release right now to propose new testing, which includes a short video. There is no video planned in the scenario you painted. More information will be added to the conference site as we get off the ground. Going back to Paulette’s comment about who wouldn’t be horrified regarding the links, there are other factors to consider besides who the official sponsors of the conference are.
