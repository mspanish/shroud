Had mentioned a passage on pg. 191 concerning the blood. Here it is: Numerous red blood cells were discovered on the cloth, attached to the fabric’s fibers. Besides this, traces of urea–a constituent element of perspiration–were found among the many groups of red blood cells. According to Lucotte, this points to a rare condition, known as hematidrosis, in which one sweats blood. The source of this condition is an extreme level of stress, which causes the organism to go into histaminic shock. The American anatomic pathologist Dr. Frederick Zugibe, who is familiar with this phenomenon, claims that it is brought on most often in the face of unavoidable death. This is another indicator that the tunic’s owner could have been Christ.

And seriously, do you understand the amount of extraneous fibre need to have skewed the dating. Are you claiming Fleury Lemburg wouldn’t notice there was over 50% cotton in that area? Or is she part of the conspiracy? Flury Lemburg may be a textile expert and although she says an invisible reweave is impossible, 6 independent sources as cited in posting #37 show there was cotton in the C 14 sample area. Let’s not forget that Professor Piero Savarino, co authored a booklet on the Shroud before he was appointed advisor to Cardinal Poletto of Turin. In the 1998 booklet, he stated that the 1988 C 14 testing might have been erroneous due to “extraneous thread left over from ‘invisible mending’ routinely carried out in the past on parts of the cloth in poor repair.” Savarino went on to emphasize: “…if the sample taken had been the subject of ‘invisible mending’ the carbon dating results would not be reliable. What is more, the site from which the samples actually were taken does not preclude this hypothesis” David Mo wrote, “Who is M. Bourcier de Carbon?” All I know is that he was a French statistician who presented a paper at a 1993 Shroud conference in Rome. Do any other readers have any details to contribute?

David wrote: <<Mr. Marino’s position about alleged complot in radiocarbon dating, specifically rejected by more serious sindonoligsts as Ian Wilson, Raymond Rogers or John Jackson, don’t surprise me, for I have read fom Mr. Marino some paragraphs as this one: “The age of the Shroud given by the labs was 663 +/ 25 years, which includes 666.” I had forgotten I had written that. The theme of the paper was parallels between biblical history and Shroud history. If I were writing that article today, I would definitely leave that out. David wrote: <<Mr. Tite was keeper of the British Museum Research Laboratory. He was perfectly qualified to hold any academic position. His task in Radiocarbon dating of Turin Shroud was just supervision. He did not take any disposition without Holy See’s approval (Card. Ballestrero and advisors). The letter he sends to Card. Ballestrero about the true meaning of the dating (no proof or fake) is an exquisite sample of neutrality. His alleged lack of objectivity is just a presumption without any solid basis. To blame someone without any proof is a very nasty thing. From: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf Hall wants to ensure the survival of his chair after his retirement and hopes a Sunday newspaper will pay a large sum for the rights to the story of the Shroud dating. He receives one hundred thousand pounds from ITV, the independent television, BBC’s rival, and a million pounds from 45 businessmen and “rich friends”. The chair is to be filled by Tite. Gonella emphasizes: “Since the beginning, this story of dating the Shroud has been vitiated by publicistic aspects, to which 14 C laboratories showed to be even too much sensitive”. The Cardinal’s consultant, exasperated, expresses a heavy judgment: “The custodians of the cathedral of Turin behaved more seriously, kept silent about the sampling of seven centimeters of the sheet, than a group of scientists, who took the liberty of violating the secret and of announcing to scandal seeking tabloids that the Shroud is a medieval fake. In my opinion there is an anti Catholic conspiracy of specific milieus”. Which milieus? In a later interview, Cardinal Ballestrero will be asked this question: “In this whole affair could the Freemasonry have had a hand? And external pressures?” Cardinal Ballestrero answered: “I think it’s indisputable!” Addendum: In my original email I stated, \"In the June 1989 issue of Catholic Counter Reformation in the X Xth century, No. 220, pg. 25, it states, “Quoting the Daily Telegraph for Holy Saturday, 25 March, Brother Bruno revealed that forty five business men and 'rich friends' (sic) gave Professor Hall, who will reach retiring age next year, 1 million (pounds) for his services and notably for having ‘determined last year that the shroud of Turin was a medieval fake.’ The money was handed over on Good Friday, 24 March.” After I posted that someone sent me an original copy of the Daily Telegraph article. It turns out the writer and/or editor of the quote from Catholic Counter Reformation in the X Xth century twisted some quotes from the Daily Telegraph to be able to come up with the statement they did. Here is the pertinent passage from the Telegraph article: \"The Oxford archaeological detective who determined last year that the Shroud of Turin was a medieval fake, has raised 1 million pounds to ensure his department remains in existence when he retires next year. The money had been donated by 45 businessmen and 'rich friends' to create a new Chair of Archaeological Sciences at Oxford, said Prof Edward Hall, 64.\" Clearly CCR connects the 2 parts in a way not conveyed by the original article. That's a good lesson to check the original source instead of relying on a secondary citation. I will remember that in the future. But I still maintain that the timing and circumstances of the donation and the taking over of Hall's position by Tite is extremely suspicious. Now on to David's most recent post: David wrote: <<I think you must revise the entire article you wrote in 1996 because it is full of similar things to that I quoted. I have no plans at the moment to rewrite a 17 year old article. If Shroud authors rewrote old articles that others thought should be redone, nothing new would ever get written. David wrote: <<You don’t provide us any proof or relevant indication of any conspiracy. I'm not trying to prove anything. I expressed some questions/suspicions in a blog posting. I didn't expect everyone to agree with me. It's not an article for publication or a conference presentation. David wrote: <<A leak of information is not a conspiracy to fake. Agreed, but if the labs are untrustworthy in not keeping the pledge not to divulge, they open themselves up to other suspicions. David wrote: << Fray Bonnet Eymard is the basis for Marinelli’s speculations. He is the leader of Counter Catholic Reformation, a religious political fundamentalist movement. That's simply not true and Marinelli's statements are more than speculations. In the passage from the Marinelli article that I had quoted, here are footnotes, and not one of is from Bro. Bruno's group: 114 N. SCHOON, Analysing the strands of time, in The Independent, April 25, 1988, p. 17. 115 G. SERVADIO, La Sindone ammalia gli inglesi, in La Stampa, August 8, 1988, p. 15. 116 A. BERRY, Turin Shroud professor raises £1m for Oxford post, in The Daily Telegraph, March 25, 1989, p. 7. 117 L. GONELLA, E ora il mistero si infittisce, in Avvenire, October 14, 1988, p. 6. 118 R.

Bambino Gesù di Praga 7 (1997), pp. 18 23, on p. 20. Marinelli's article was 30 pages, had 256 footnotes and 50 sources in her references. She did her homework. Someone else posted today asking why the learned late Fr. Werner Bulst, S.J. Was not mentioned. He believed there was a conspiracy related to the C 14 dating. And let's not forget the Italian documentary \"Night of the Shroud,\" which addresses the behind the scenes intrigue related to the Shroud. The documentary even recently won Best Documentary, Best Director, and Best Visual Effects at the Los Angeles Movie Awards. Clearly there is evidence that various people believe and have believed that the 1988 C 14 dating was an extremely questionable affair.","date":"2013-09-27","mins":"9:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/23/shreds-of-evidence-a-guest-posting-by-joe-marino/","cat":"books","title":"Shreds of Evidence: A Guest Posting by Joe Marino"},{"id":"comment-45725","author":"jmarino240","post":"I sent my posting from last night in a Word Doc to Dan last night and it appears he has now made some corrections.
