[{"id":"comment-19047","author":"gabriel","post":"Charles, please note that a whole people self sustaining genetic group (the Pazyryks) has been identified as having genes from both European and Asian lineages. The most important difficulty regarding the AB blood being old, is not based on an extensive record of blood groups covering human history in which a new group (AB) distinctively appears in the 9th Century. Unfortunately, that database does not exist and so far, we only have a few unconnected studies here and there corresponding to different moments of history. In the absence of such an extensive database, the most important difficulty about AB being old is that until now, the oldest evidences of mixtures between European and Asian population dated back to 9th 10th century in Hungary. The relevance of this paper is that this indirect argument and the most important difficulty I have come through so far can now be ruled out and at least, we have here an important example dating back to the Iron Age. So now, we cannot say how old is the AB blood group, but certainly other arguments not put forward so far should be used because, certainly there were mixtures of lineages before 900 AD in Hungary and after this paper, nothing is against dating back AB blood type (or any group like O) to at least 1st century or before..","date":"2012-11-14","mins":"1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/early-evidence-of-ab-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Early Evidence of AB Blood"},{"id":"comment-213931","author":"gabriel","post":"There is a forth fact that this model could explain: the intensity distance relationship we observe in the image is compatible with the attenuation pattern in air expected.","date":"2015-10-30","mins":"12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/30/bob-rucker-a-burst-of-radiation-did-three-things/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Bob Rucker:  A Burst of Radiation Did Three Things"},{"id":"comment-21285","author":"gabriel","post":"Crowdfunding would definitively work if a comprehensive and scientifically serious roadmap is previously defined..","date":"2012-12-28","mins":"6:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/28/colin-berry-hardly-copper-bottomed-evidence-for-so-crucial-a-question/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Colin Berry: Hardly copper-bottomed evidence for so crucial a question"},{"id":"comment-19056","author":"gabriel","post":"Which are the foundations for this presumption?

It represents an interesting approach and after some further improvements, could well be accepted in a truly peer reviewed journal. One of the most obvious consequences of his work is that although the author does not elaborate in this line the trend detected by statistical analysis and recently published on a JCR journal, really exists. A simple glance at the figures clearly indicates that it is there. The author provides the figures obtained with the scores corresponding to the first PC. However in my view, a PC analysis to be really meaningful should be carried out with the whole Shroud, just like Marion did in his JCR paper. One of the purposes of PC analysis is to identify underlying effects and such a general approach could allow identification of what each PC represents. Perhaps, in this work using only a small area this is not possible. Finally, instead of using K means I would recommend the author to confirm his clustering with a more reliable technique like Partition Around Medoids. The value of the silohuette could help identify how many clusters should be used and again, results could be more meaningful. Nevertheless, perhaps a whole image is not available and it is not possible to go any further…...","date":"2012-08-05","mins":"6:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/05/giulio-fanti-responds-are-you-listening-yannick-and-colin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds.

He has analyzed some mineral particles from the face of the Turin Shroud. Seemengly, the sample was provided to the author by Giovanni Riggi di Numana, a STURP member. The analysis of the particles yields a very low amount of aragonite, and most of the calcium carbonate particles are of very modern origin (washing power). The author provides several SEM photographies for the different types of particles he has analyzed in his sample. It would really represent a step forward if the author could also provide a SEM photography for the few particles of aragonite he has found. The reason is that in the paper of Kohlbeck and Nikowsky of 1986 in Biblical A Rcheological Review, they give a spectrum comparing the composition of the aragonite sample they analyzed (provided by Rogers) and that from Jerusalem. It would be great if a comparison of the three aragonite SEM’s (Kohlbeck’s 2 and this new one), could be done. If the same signature were found now independently 25 years later, it would represent an important confirmation of a Jerusalem origin for the Shroud..","date":"2012-08-06","mins":"4:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/05/giulio-fanti-responds-are-you-listening-yannick-and-colin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds.

I wanted to comment on #15: Anoxie says: It is debatable. Image density could be correlated to the shortest path between body and shroud. In my opinion, at this point two different aspects must be analyzed separatedly: 1. Even though the main direction is not vertical, but following the shortest path to the cloth from the body at every point, there is still the issue of the unique correspondence between each point on the body and on the image. On the cloth we can see that each point on the body corresponds to a point on the Shroud and not to a probabilistic density function (pdf) on the cloth,as could be expected from a difussion process based on Fick’s law. 2. In this case, a new major challenge arises: what mechanism could it be that makes that the shortest distance to the cloth at each point the main driving vector connecting the body and the Shroud?.","date":"2012-08-07","mins":"4:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/05/giulio-fanti-responds-are-you-listening-yannick-and-colin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds.

The Spanish brought them along with Catholicism to the Philippines in the XV Ith century. Thousands of men have gone through these Easter celebrations in which special emphasis is put in replicating as close as possible all the details we read in the Gospels. I guess that the more we move back in time, the more realistic and painful these representations must have been. And most likely, in many occasions someone would die due to the realism of the representation. The objective was (and still is) to replicate as faithfully as possible, the details gathered in the Gospels and this includes crucifixion, scourging, and wrapping the body in a linen cloth. Perhaps, at some time in the past also a spear wound. After all, if the image formation mechanism was 100% natural, as many support in this blog with solid arguments, (Maillard or other) it would have also worked in the Middle Ages with someone tortured in the frame of an Easter celebration.

Sorry to say but science does not work this way. Any result in this or other field can be refuted and in the future, perhaps this may be the case why not? but currently, in science there are thousands of facts that are accepted because someone once provided solid evidences and no additional studies have been carried out in decades or even centuries. If Charles criteria were applied to these thousands of facts and their validity rejected only because nobody has come back to it again, planes would not fly, cars would not run and fridges should be revisited in search of confirming evidences. We see these things with the supporters of inteligent design or those who deny the existance of a climate change, partially because they are based on results published perhaps years ago, no matter how solid and fully valid today they may be.
