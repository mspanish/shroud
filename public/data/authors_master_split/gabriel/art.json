[{"id":"comment-17007","author":"gabriel","post":"The Dioceses of Malaga (Spain) is hosting an exhibition on the Shroud in which the Bishop and the Catholic Church, perhaps as never before so clearly, supports the authenticity of the cloth. At the entry of the exhibition there is a sentence by John Paul II written in huge letters: “The truth is to be proposed and not imposed”. I think this exhibition is very interesting because due to the important support given by the Catholic Church at all levels, one can conclude that what you see in the exhibition represents at this moment something like a sort of “official position”. That was at least, my personal impression when I visited it in July. In the exhibition, the hypothesis of the templars having the Shroud is clearly supported and the image of this post in England is used to that purpose. In this video of the Malaga exhibition, it can be seen from minute 4:30 onwards. Another argument they provide is that Geoffroi de Charny , the first known owner of the Shroud of Turin, might be a relative of Geoffroi de Charney, burned at the stake along with Jacques de Molay in 1314 after the trial against the Templars..","date":"2012-09-28","mins":"5:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/28/templecombe-it-is-almost-too-exciting-to-think-about/","cat":"art","title":"Templecombe:  It is almost too exciting to think about."},{"id":"comment-7865","author":"gabriel","post":"Maria, just to make clear my point, when I say that “we are far from having scientific evidences”, I refer exclusively to the coins/flowers/writings issue and not the Shroud itself. In this matter coins/flowers/writings , to the best of my knowledege, all the claims are far from being widely accepted and remain controversial. In this aspect, apart from Danin, one of the few papers which have undergone a peer review process and been published in a JCR journal is the one by Marion which I commented in this blog. Even so, his conclusions on the letters he found on the Shroud, are widely dismissed and/or remain highly controversial..","date":"2012-02-02","mins":"1:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory"},{"id":"comment-7851","author":"gabriel","post":"There are a lot of people who claim they see coins, letters, flowers,…now hidden writings. When they explain it to you, it gives the impression that the coin/flower/writing is truly there………. Honestly, I don’t know what to think either in this case or in the others because we are far from having enough scientific evidences, but, as I have written in previous comments in this blog, in my opinion, this general issue could be one of the easiest to deal with. Perhaps, someone has already done it, ruled it out, and it is simply that I am not fully aware of all the scientific literature about the Shroud. However, using high resolution images, pixel values can feed rather simple mathematical tests of randomness and using Montecarlo/bootstrap techniques, 95% confidence levels decision intervals could be quite easily assessed. 95% confidence levels are widely accepted in scientific literature as enough to reach conclusions and could help in determining if what some claim they see is just noise or there really exists a discernible pattern..","date":"2012-02-02","mins":"7:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory"}]
