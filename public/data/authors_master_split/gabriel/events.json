I wouldn’t be surprised at all if the Vatican had carried out a whole set of experiments at not made results public. With all we know now C14 would be the least relevant of all candidate tests. But for the Catholic church, her most important error in 1988 was that she lost control of the tests and the way they were made public. Now they have the chance of conducting tests without the pressure of public opinion and release little by little all the information, at their own rythm and for their own religious purposes (not for example to promote C14 labs). The design of the (unexpected) 2010 exhibition in Turin and the current exhibition in Malaga are clearly pro authenticity and use this not as a stand alone scientific fact, but in the frame of the Church’s evangelization purposes. That is exactly the management I would expect, if the Church had carried out additional tests on her own devices. Additionally, they must have noticed the never ending stream of books, ENEA reports and long etc and in my view, this is more than enough for them not allowing any additional test..","date":"2012-10-10","mins":"5:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/bsts-meeting-reminder/","cat":"event","title":"BSTS Meeting Reminder"},{"id":"comment-17969","author":"gabriel","post":"…..and still anybody is surprised at why the Church does not allow new experiments?.","date":"2012-10-21","mins":"7:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/18/denis-mannixs-maillard-experiment-proposals/","cat":"event","title":"Denis Mannix’s Maillard experiment proposals"},{"id":"comment-22672","author":"gabriel","post":"Does anybody know if Dr. Eric Jumper is the only STURP member who thinks that the “Shroud cannot have a first century origin”?

I would add that convection currents could be triggered by a very small and declining with time temperature gradient. This implies very low velocities for amines/sweat/oinments/whatever from the body, and such a motion is compatible with low Reynolds numbers, that is with a laminar flow. In this case, a vertical motion of very narrow flow lines of amines emerging from the body and impacting/ reacting on the cloth, could explain i) the resolution of the image (related to the size of the flow lines) ii)the vertical anisotropy of the image.","date":"2012-10-26","mins":"2:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/23/fly-on-the-wall-summary-of-the-bsts-meeting/","cat":"event","title":"Fly on the wall summary of the BSTS Meeting"},{"id":"comment-23136","author":"gabriel","post":"Jmarino240: “HIS ONLY CONCESSION WAS THE CHANGE IN HIS THINKING AFTER READING RAY’S PAPER [and the book Wrapped Up in the Shroud: Chronicle of a Passion]. ” Does this mean that he now thinks that the Shroud is authentic?Or simply that supports the chemical mechanism (Maillard) proposed by Rogers to explain the image?
