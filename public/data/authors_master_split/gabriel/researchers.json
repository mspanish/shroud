Lots of claims have been around lately on the Turin Shroud and none of them underwent the evalution (sic) of scholars in a journal.” The journal he mentions is Studi Medievali which is a journal that due to its very low credibility and impact factor is not even included in the standard and widely acepted JCR ranking system. Therefore, publishing in this journal means exactly nothing for the academia and advance of science. If we have a look at his own website http://www.antoniolombatti.it/B/Home.html all his publications in his career have been in this kind of journals. We have seen this in the Shroud before : someone whose poor work has been rejected in truly scientific journals moves to the media and taking advantage of the attraction that the Shroud generates by itself, gets the attention from the public that the scientific community will never give him. In other words, becomes a new Shroud star. We will see this guy in a lot of interviews, talk shows on TV etc in the next months…..

If any available material is not freely available for research to anyone, with a clear protocol of use, sorry to tell, but we will never progress. In this sense, the research on the Shroud is stuck for so many years because in the absence of a central body coordinating available evidences AND designing a comprehensive research program with state of the art techniques and knowledge, we are still discussing on material published in the 90’s and techniques like C14 belonging to the same period. Please remember what has happened with other recent examples in which truly scientific challenges that additionally may have serious social/religious/political implications.Take for example, the long period in which Qumram manuscripts or climate data were not available to the scientific community.

The only two original papers that everyone mentions and gives for granted are only two: 1. The one by Kohlbeck in Biblical Archaoelogy Review largely quoted everywhere as supporting the issue of the aragonite. Biblical A Rcheological review is not a scientific journal and does not belong to the JCR either. I would not expect either that BAR’s aragonite spectra had gone through peer review. 2. LEVI SETTI R.,CROW C., WANG Y. L.: Progress in high resolution scanning ion microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging microanalysis. (PMID:3931206) ”, Scanning Electron Microscopy 2, 1985; 535 552 As I mentioned in a previous comment, this journal does not belong to the JCR system but, surprisingly enough, at least in its abstract, the authors do not even get any close to the aragonite or Shroud issue. Their work seems to focus on the skull bone of neonatal mice!! http://www.atgcchecker.com/pubmed/3931206 The spectrum we see in BAR is supposed to come from this second paper.I have tried to get the original of this second paper from my institution’s library and they have not obtained a result in three months. They are still on it but the true fact is that the original study on the match is far from being confirmed. If someone has access to the original paper it would be great if he/she could share a comment in this blog. As I mentioned when commenting Lucotte’s paper of Fanti’s journal, it would also be interesting if the author could provide a spectrum of the aragonite he has found and check it with the spectra of BAR.

It also seems to be so for Collin Berry. I usually act as a reviewer for a couple of JCR journals and it seems to me very unlikely the hypothesis of a conspiration in 1988 around the Nature paper to falsify results for non scientific reasons. Publishing a paper in Nature is a very diffciult task and only very solid works get published (OK, I know about the case of the corean guy!). Perhaps some methodological mistakes were made at the sampling stage, but as a whole, I tend to think that according to the knowledge that was available (crucial remark!) in 1988 the results were correct. HOWEVER At that time it was believed that the C14 test was appliable to almost anything. Now we know that the C14 test has got its limitations, and more specifically, when applied to ancient linens, relevant and serious studies (1) published a decade later indicated that the C14 test is not appropiate to datate ancient linens like the Shroud. This is how science moves forward. My position is that the C14 test was carried out correctly but NOW (and not in 1988) we know that the C14 methodology is not appliable to the Shroud. For that reason, I think that the issue of the age of the Shroud still remains open. In my opinion, this is why the Church who always gets very good scientific advice, will never repeat a C14 test and will move to more promising and breaking edge technologies and methodologies to elucidate the origin of the Shroud.

In the light of that, out of all his publications he has freely decided to publish in this blog, only the 5 papers in J. Imaging Sci. Technol.

Let’s forget about excuses and conspirations. 2.The only positive thing is that after the bias introduced in the 80’s regarding the C14 as the only valid test, the press release on the book by Fanti has made some people reconsider other options like studies on provenance and the general request “for a new C14 test” seems to have weaken a little bit. Good news after all. 3.Once again, the Catholic Church in this case the Archbishop is one of the few to put some common sense in all this.

I mean, what happens with the distance factor, is it correlated with the color intensity? Generally speaking, one can expect from radiation and energy fields that intensity is related to distance (Bragg’s law for example) but more experiments are needed to reproduce the intensity/distance specific slope that the Shroud shows. In this list of pros and cons I think that chemical reaction hypothesis (Millard or any other) has a major difficulty in explaining why the intensity of that chemical reaction and associated colouring effect, should be related to the distance between body and linen. I am not saying that there is not an explanation: I am just saying that such an explanation is not obvious at the present moment. We could call this the 3 D difficulty for the chemical hypothesis.

At this point, the main difficulty is that it penetrates the material so deeply that this mechanism can be ruled out for the Shroud.

A chemical mechanism or a radiation/energy field both can account for only outer part colouring, I should add that only after Di Lazzaro’s work a radiation mechanism has been proven to fulfill this condition. Previous works by Fazio and Rogers foresaw for any radiation/energy field mechanism a complete penetration and therefore colouring of the fibers cores. This was the main point for ruling out any energy or radiation based explanation. Despite this, both chemical and radiative explanations, still lack of scientifically sound explanations for the 3 D information, e.g. Why and how the intensity of these mechanisms depend on the distance to the body. Generally speaking, a radiative/energy field mechanism can be expected to vary with distance but I agree with you in this specific and systematic experiments at different distances should be carried out and then evaluate if they can reproduce the intensity/distance ratio observed in the Shroud.

What I am missing here is the interpretation and validation of these spectra by truly experiences eyes in the field of limestone comparation before publication. That’s what we call peer review.

In this case, the authors obtain “results of very clear and distinct clusters with no overlap”. I think that this sounds promising.
