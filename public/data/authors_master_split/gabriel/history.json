However, in the case of the Shroud, at some point in mid 80’s it was decided to analyze the Shroud using EXCLUSIVELY C14 while ruling out a combined approach with other techniques aiming at elucidating its geographical origin. Some solid and rigorous scientific proposals in this line were completely ruled out and forgotten. Furthermore, since late 80’s the scientific developments in this field have clearly shown the shortcomes and limitations of the radiocarbone methodology when applied to a cloth like the Shroud. On the other hand, since the 80’s research on other isotopes and trace elements or more generally, geographical origin, has experimented very important developments. After the years, we can only speculate where we could be if in parallel, both research lines had been adopted and research on the Shroud could have benefited of all the advances about geographical origin.

I myself have only come across it recently and just received the whole paper from my institution’s library. In his list of papers in page 100, Barrie doesn’t mention it either. However, authors published it in a scientific peer review journal As early as 1988!! authors proposed an isotope analysis to determine the geographical origin of linen in the Shroud, BUT instead of focusing on C14 the authors suggest hidrogen and oxigen isotopes. Their results were truly promising and a simple analysis of threads could have determined the geographical origin of the Shroud. I cannot stop thinking how different research on the Shroud could have been along these years, if the first isotopic approach and subsequent methodological developments had focused on oxygen and hydrogen instead of or simultaneously with carbone. This first decision in favour of C14 test put the focus on a methodology that now we know is not appropiate and has determined the evolution of the research not only for the Shroud, but also for example, the Oviedo sudarium. It also meant ruling out further research and tests on geographical origin and oxygen and hydrogen. If all we know now on the C14 were also available for what authors propose, I am pretty sure that in 2012, we would be in a completely different situation regarding the research on the Shroud.
