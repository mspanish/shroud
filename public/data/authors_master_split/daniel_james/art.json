[{"id":"comment-4228","author":"daniel_james","post":"As a Christian and artist myself, I can relate to Akiane’s passion and determination to capture what God has given her to share with and help others. That is what gifts are for. It’s what gives them meaning. Her paintings are inspiring and beautiful. They touch the heart profoundly. I see a story in each one.
