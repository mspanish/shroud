I am a professional film maker. It is my living. I will not make any money unless I get the film developed and taken up by a major studio and that is what this crowd funding is for. I did make money from my first film The Silent Witness in 1978 but the two I have made since then have lost (a lot) of money. I have returned to this subject at the end of my career because of what I know about it and as I have said in the campaign, the sense of injustice I feel. Let me come to the point about the blood. It is pure speculation on my part. But something has to explain why, when it came to the crunch, the Vatican did what it did to the test. I may well have been the “crunch”. I went to meet Professor Gonella to sign the contract I had been negotiating with him for several months on behalf of the BBC. We were going to film the test and broadcast the film about it along with the result as an exclusive. It depended on the tests being done blind, of course, and the labs signing up to the strict protocols that had been agreed in principle. When I arrived in Turin and met again with Gonella he was as white as a sheet. That morning he had just been informed “from above” that the protocols were being abandoned. If I had signed that contract as planned that day the Vatican – as well as Turin – would have been bound by it. Without the protocols I could not sign it. Jean Paul II was about to leave for a trip to South America. Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict) was his right hand man. After years of procrastination and politicking over the test with Gove and the rest of the C14 community there was now no room for delay. If the C14 had found in favor or the Shroud the clamor to follow up with every conceivable test would have been deafening and probably irresistible. The blood would have been high on the list. Who could say what that might (and still might) yield in terms of genetic information? We could be looking at the genome of God or of a humble and delusional carpenter. I think it very significant that Pope Benedict made an impromptu Easter exposition of the Shroud his last act as Pope. The cloth was on his conscience..","date":"2013-08-09","mins":"2:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"id":"comment-43424","author":"david_rolfe","post":"The zig zag/herringbone pattern on the Lirey medal indicates that this was a defining feature of the Shroud. Why, if it were only visible close up and relatively immaterial when compared with other features, might this be so? When the C14 test was proposed it was assumed the test was to be done blind and it was taken as a matter of course that a suitable piece of medieval linen herring bone weave would be found to make this possible and the British Museum, without hesitation, agreed to supply some. When the time came, somewhat to their embarrassment, the BM found that not only did they have no such material in their collection but when they scoured the world’s other museums for a piece for the purpose of the test – and we know how small an amount was required – they found that there was none available anywhere! As a result one of the protocols of the test was duly and quietly abandoned without official comment at the time or since and this remarkable fact only slipped out many months after. It is conspicuous by its absence in the interview with Michael Tite in the 6th video clip down on the page: http://tinyurl.com/o2w2z64 I think it might be safe to assume, therefore, that medieval viewers of the Shroud recognized this “unique” cloth was part of the story. When combined with the L shaped hole pattern and other Shroud like features on the Pray Manuscript I think it requires a particularly obstinate view to suggest that it does not point to a direct connection to the Shroud..","date":"2013-09-09","mins":"5:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"}]
