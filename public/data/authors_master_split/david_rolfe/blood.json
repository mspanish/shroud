[{"id":"comment-29853","author":"david_rolfe","post":"I would like to make a point and ask a question. The visible blood marks are quite possibly the result of multiple causes. An initial one, whatever it was, and then, over the centuries, well meaning attempts by its various custodians to “touch them up” for the benefit of pilgrims travelling great distances to see the shroud and possibly – even when they arrived – having to view it from some distance. Certainly scores of metres. The holy blood being a major attraction the custodians might have felt justified to use anything from vermillion to other mammalian blood direct or via a leech. It would have been done with great care and dexterity so that these later applications remain undetectable. What interests me are the invisible (to the naked eye) stains. I believe that the “halo” is only readily observed when fluoresced. Whether bilirubin or not, can this be nailed to a blood related phenomenon?.","date":"2013-04-08","mins":"6:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"id":"comment-24827","author":"david_rolfe","post":"Hugh, have you taken this kind of practical experimentation into account: http://shroudofjesus.com/page6.html.","date":"2013-02-19","mins":"7:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/19/on-the-topic-of-bloodstains-picking-up-threads-of-useful-discussion/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"On the Topic of Bloodstains: Picking up Threads of Useful Discussion"}]
