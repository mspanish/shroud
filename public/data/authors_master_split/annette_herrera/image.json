Q: has any DNA (of human composition) been lifted from the areas on the Shroud of Turin that seemed to be blood? And… if so, could it be used to identify the DNA of the lineage of the House of David? just thinking …Maybe the coming Anit Christ will use it to prove his Lineage, as many are trying to figure out how he will be able to prove himself. I also have my own theroy as to the 3 D image & how it is present. Thanks for ur post!
