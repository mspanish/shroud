I don’t buy it. If anything the man on the Shroud had a magnificent energy form which imparted long lasting information. The type of information that goes beyond the common beer drinking crowd of today; the type of information that makes us wonder did he walk on water, did he heal the sick, and raise the dead, did he rise to new and everlasting life? Wonder of Wonders… with the possibility of bringing us all to say one day: I and the Father are One!.","date":"2014-03-18","mins":"7:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/18/an-image-to-hold-onto-until-eternity/","cat":"history","title":"An image to hold onto until eternity."},{"id":"comment-166794","author":"clublu22014","post":"The scraping by a knife description by CF really made me laugh!

O.K., you can lose the thrill of not being able to face the unique Image of the Man on the Shroud, cause and effect– AFTER HIS DEATH (the only evidence of LIFE AFTER DEATH, i.e. The obvious miracle of the Shroud) and admit that the human mind can neither play with nor fathom its depths. Or, you can pretend to “scientifically” ATTEMPT to understand the nuts and bolts of it. The Shroud is the only piece of evidence of LIFE AFTER DEATH—the only analytic viewpoint observable… cause and effect came NOT BEFORE DEATH but cause and effect came AFTER DEATH..","date":"2014-05-10","mins":"12:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/08/might-the-av-ivory-have-been-the-inspiration-for-the-pray-manuscript/","cat":"history","title":"Might the A&V Ivory have been the inspiration for the Pray Manuscript"},{"id":"comment-116224","author":"clublu22014","post":"I’m sorry for you, too, Hugh..","date":"2014-05-10","mins":"2:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/08/might-the-av-ivory-have-been-the-inspiration-for-the-pray-manuscript/","cat":"history","title":"Might the A&V Ivory have been the inspiration for the Pray Manuscript"},{"id":"comment-116240","author":"clublu22014","post":"To the effect that God is an “object” or an objective, Louis, there is always a resistance or an “edging out”.

Nowhere did a Valentinian codex such as the Apocryphon of John ever mention Jesus’ wife or beloved and surely none made direct reference to Mary Magdalene. The Gospel of Philip was not Valentinian. Louis, Paul, as I’m sure you know, wasn’t concerned about the earthly life of Jesus. Paul was only concerned about Jesus’ mystical life–his Paschal Mystery: Passion, Death, Resurrection. So you and I agree that Jacobovici and all of the Dan Brown camp are far a field from the Truth and Core of the NT..","date":"2014-05-08","mins":"9:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-latest-news-on-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/","cat":"history","title":"The Latest News on the Gospel of Jesus’ Wife"},{"id":"comment-115074","author":"clublu22014","post":"Wished you lived in the States Louis, We’d find a way of storming the hallowed halls of Harvard Divinity!.","date":"2014-05-08","mins":"10:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-latest-news-on-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/","cat":"history","title":"The Latest News on the Gospel of Jesus’ Wife"},{"id":"comment-114226","author":"clublu22014","post":"King Conned!.","date":"2014-05-07","mins":"10:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/07/the-latest-news-on-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/","cat":"history","title":"The Latest News on the Gospel of Jesus’ Wife"},{"id":"comment-115033","author":"clublu22014","post":"Professor George Windsor Mac Rae, S.J., would have left it up to Prof. Frank Cross… George Mac Rae would have been disappointed in Karen King, and have advised her not to have not accepted the faux papyrus.
