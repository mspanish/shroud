Can’t believe Dr. Andrew Silverman is coming from England! Dr. Petrus Soons, from Peru! Plus, it ought to be fun watching the Italians Bruno Barberis and Giulio Fanti argue it out… better brush up on my Italian! All the other many very credible and highly published notables, without repeating the list above just some of the many: Barrie Schwortz (STURP), Russ Breault, Dan Scavone, Jack Markwardt, Mark Antonacci, Arthur Lind (STURP), Robert Villareal (STURP)! Just wish that Dr. John Jackson (STURP) would have presented a paper! Perhaps, though, he and his wife Rebecca have bought a ticket? I’ve bought my ticket!.","date":"2014-06-01","mins":"6:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/01/program-and-presenters-for-the-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference/","cat":"event","title":"Program and Presenters for the St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference"},{"id":"comment-126260","author":"clublu22014","post":"Right, Dave.

I admire Pauline theology, but I think we could be asking more probing questions scientifically and theologically about this cause and effect after death. I think the love behind it is truly unknown and obfuscated by the abuse of that concurrent culture..","date":"2014-05-24","mins":"1:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/24/shroud-presentations-in-silver-city-new-mexico/","cat":"event","title":"Shroud Presentations in Silver City, New Mexico"},{"id":"comment-165375","author":"clublu22014","post":"Leave it to Barrie & Joe and Dan to collaborate so nicely to serve all of us needy Shroudies! Thanks guys, this move will be so much appreciated. Will Russ Breault have the videos posted on Shroud.com as well or will they be sold individually on the WWW?
