However, in a French reweave/invisible mending the skill is such not only to fool the naked eye but to incorporate the main body of the garment. So the areas patch with a French reweave would have been more than a simple patchwork area. Also, you mention that the dark greenish area chosen (incidentally chosen for the C14 testing) were not a designation of an contaminated and inconsistent chemical area of the Shroud but rather of a light effect: “The colour is fairly obviously much more to do with the light source than it has to do with the material of the Shroud.” Wow!
