[{"id":"comment-2700","author":"william","post":"The image on the shroud show a man who is CENTERED IN SATURN. That is is BODY TYPE. Whereas the Akiane painting is CLEARLY a Mercury Saturn body type. There are 7 BASIC body types, six of which merge into the one following in a never altering pattern. The seventh type can merge with ANY of the others. The idea of seven basic body types was one of the plot devices of a well known fairy tale, collected centuries ago by the Brothers Grimm. That story is Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Additionally, the names of these types, which correspond to the planets and heavenly bodies that name the days of the week are words that are already IN OUR LINGO. For example, there are Martial arts, a Mercurial disposition, a Jovial fellow, a Saturnine countenance, etc. Etc. Billy Crudup, Timothy Dalton, John Cusack are Mercury Saturn types. Whereas Clint Eastwood, Sam Elliot and Brett Cullen are pure Saturn types. Interestingly, Leonardo Da Vinci, based on his self portrait cartoon is clearly a Mars Jovial type. How those two cuckoo clocks could have thought a Mars Jovial looked like a Saturn is one for the ages..","date":"2011-03-19","mins":"1:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
