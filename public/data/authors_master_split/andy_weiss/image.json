The effect was much more different than that produced by scorching a cloth with a hot statue – Raymond N. Rogers and Anna Arnoldi, Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin – A Review, 2002 (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers2.pdf) Microscopy proves that image fibers and scorch fibers are quite different in structure and composition. The distribution of color is different, even at the level of single fibers. The image was not formed by scorching the linen fibers. When viewed in parallel light under a microscope, a scorched fiber is colored through its entire diameter, and the medulla (a tubular void down the middle of the fiber) usually appears to be darker than the mass of the fiber as a result of reactions at its surface and its shorter radius of curvature. The medullas of image fibers do not show any coloration or charring. The medullas are usually clean and colorless. Fibers that were scorched in a fire in AD 1532 show some scorching in the medullas. – Raymond N.
