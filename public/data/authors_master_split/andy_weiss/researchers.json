R I don’t think a valid or good point has been made here, Ron. I find it childish. Here’s my answer to you and anyone else… If you want to do research and would like Barrie’s pictures to do that research, visit Shroud.com and e mail him and request whatever pictures you would like to use to do your research. That is precisely what I did and he has been most generous. Perhaps you ought to read Barrie’s response posted in Dan’s blog elsewhere. The real problem is that not everyone will honor these legal and rightful copyrights. Barrie has extensive experience with this area since he was a professional photographer for about 40 years and also taught copyright law in a school in California. In this area he is an expert. This is like telling John Jackson how to do physics or Ray Rogers, God rest his soul, how to do chemistry..","date":"2012-07-25","mins":"10:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/22/absurdity-for-today-colin-berry-castigates-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Absurdity for Today:  Colin Berry Castigates Barrie Schwortz"},{"id":"comment-14105","author":"andy_weiss","post":"For copyrights, Barrie Schwortz is an expert and could address this if he chose to do so.

Barrie is a first class human being whom I consider to be a close personal friend. He is very warm and generous with everyone he meets and his reply shows his class as he did not attack, but rather gave a unique perspective to the issue explaining the reasons why they do what they do. Obviously, those who have no idea of the copyrights applicable to the Schwortz photos erred. Perhaps we ought to try to be charitable towards one another, or simply give each other the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise. I was cautioned when I got involved with the Shroud through creating the website that there are those who are not civil in the Shroud ‘world’. Presuming this is Jesus, the Prince of Peace, this is a terrible irony (I believe from the evidence I have seen and the tremendous affect it has had on my life personally, but hold no ill will toward those who do not believe similarly, rather I only wish them the best). Each person should be permitted to hold their own beliefs about this and many other subjects. The world is a big place and there is room enough for diversity of personal opinion on this and many other subjects. After all, we are human. Imagine how boring it would be if we all thought the same and believed exactly the same? That doesn’t sound like a race of human beings, but of robots. Larry and Yannick, nice to see you in here.
