To Russ ~ Icon is am image of something, whereas relic is something of the person or something the person wore or touched. The Popes calling it an icon versus a relic means they are not pronouncing it as Jesus’ Shroud, but as an icon is is an image of Jesus’ Shroud, it still has great meaning even if one day one was able to scientifically prove it was not the burial Shroud of Jesus of Nazareth who was the Christ. This is an important distinction. But as Pope John Paul II said determining if this Shroud is the one that wrapped Jesus’ body is outside the competence of the Church, per say, but is rather left to the realm of science and the scientific study of this item because the Church’s realm, strictly speaking, is in regard to faith and morals, not science..","date":"2013-04-01","mins":"7:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/stories-are-rolling-out-now-on-the-exhibition-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Stories are rolling out now on the Exhibition of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-23130","author":"andy_weiss","post":"Thanks Joe.

That goes far beyond the scientific study of the Shroud and always will. Christians of faith are not looking for any help from any expert whatever in that regard. Scientific study of the Shroud is important, not for the believer, but for those who doubt and for other experts. So there are two issues here: faith and science. Neither one is exclusive of the other nor do these two, faith and science, contradict one another. They rather support one another and work together to give us a union of the Divine and the human..","date":"2013-12-01","mins":"10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/23/the-evidence-of-things-not-seen/","cat":"event","title":"The evidence of things not seen"},{"id":"comment-57095","author":"andy_weiss","post":"I would respectfully disagree with Fr.
