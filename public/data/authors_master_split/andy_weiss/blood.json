A sane person when considering the blood evidence on the Shroud cannot possibly conclude this is not an actual burial cloth unless they can contradict the mounds of evidence to the contrary.

How is this explained? 2) Adler noted all the blood on the cloth came from exudates. A washing of the body explains this, otherwise we ought to at least see from blood marks from a living body on the Shroud.
