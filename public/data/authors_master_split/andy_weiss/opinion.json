There are many other potential answers including the combinations of “not atheist or religious”. Further, the study is flawed due to the wording “convinced atheist.” Why is there a need for a modifier to atheist? Perhaps these are two different categories that need differentiation. The wording would seem to imply that the hoped result is to increase the answers to atheism rather than providing a wide array of combinations which would give a much more nuanced result.

What is the point? There has to be much more behind this than the writer has admitted. To write it with a small ‘c’ means ‘universal’ as in Christian, so this would be directed at all Christians, not just Catholics with a capital ‘C’ as in Roman (Latin) or Eastern Catholic, for example. While this might be a technical distinction, it is not without meaning. Catholic in this sense means a Christian who is in communion with the Bishop of Rome as the earthy head of the Church Jesus invested in Peter. So with great respect for you, my friend and brother, Dan, I would have to disagree with your application of the capital ‘C’ to yourself if you are not in communion with the the earthly head established by Christ. You are no doubt catholic. As to the dating to which he refers, this dating was proven to be falsely attributed to the Shroud itself, but only to a small repair area proven through textile expert studies by Sue Benford and her husband Joe Marino and chemically by Ray Rogers and others.

Comments: I don’t think this statement, that it is the work of human ingenuity because of the detail, can stand under rational scrutiny. No one in our advanced technological age can even come close to recreating most, much less all of the features of the Shroud. On image 13 the following appears: 3 D – This is a computer recreation of the face image. The computer assumed that the image was determined by the distance between the body and a parallel plane. Comments: This is not a computer recreation. Rather, it is the VP8 Image Analyzer processing the image and producing a brightness map of the face which is an accurate 3 D representation despite the fact that the VP8 does not make 3 D images. In a brightness map, everything that’s lighter appears higher in elevation, dark appears lower and middle range appears in between in depth based on the gradation of brightness. This is the only image in the world that, when processed with the VP8, creates this effect. All other image processing results in a distorted image, not a 3 D image. This means the image has corresponding height and depth based on brightness..","date":"2012-11-28","mins":"10:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/28/david-roemer-will-maybe-present-the-shroud-of-turin-at-the-princeton-club-in-new-york/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Roemer will maybe present the Shroud of Turin at the Princeton Club in New York"},{"id":"comment-15481","author":"andy_weiss","post":"Just a thought…This doesn’t sound like free thought, but rather rigid thought..","date":"2012-08-26","mins":"9:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/freethought-or-cafeteria-thinking/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Freethought or Cafeteria Thinking?"},{"id":"comment-35415","author":"andy_weiss","post":"The premise of his argument is presumptive and incorrect..","date":"2013-05-30","mins":"10:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/30/how-can-you-argue-with-this/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"How can you argue with this?"},{"id":"comment-13559","author":"andy_weiss","post":"There’s absolutely no doubt the area tested in 1988 was a repair.

Since the earliest letter is most likely from St. Paul in about 49 AD (1 Thessalonians) and Jesus was crucified about 29 33 AD, I would say it’s quite obvious the Shroud came first. Of course the gospel message is not contingent upon the Shroud, rather the Shroud is a supplement and perhaps evidence for the events themselves which are borne witness by many eye witnesses. As to Stephen’s first posting as revealed by Dan here, the evidence on the Shroud would be consistent with the information in the New Testament if the Shroud were to be considered authentic. I am unaware of any inconsistency between the eye witness accounts and the information on the Shroud. This kind of statement does not necessarily imply any biblical literalism not does it endanger Christian belief is the Shroud were to be proven a hoax..","date":"2013-06-16","mins":"10:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/16/which-came-first-the-gospels-or-the-shroud/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Which Came First, the Gospels or the Shroud?"},{"id":"comment-14296","author":"andy_weiss","post":"I suppose if you cannot trust anything in a blog, you might want to consider closing down and doing something different. What interests me most about this is to know the background of the one(s) who wrote it. But let me think about what is written and what it might indicate. Claiming it is a 33 year old man gives away the traditional belief that Jesus was about 33 when crucified. If that is the writer’s belief, then most likely this is a Christian or one who accepts this idea. Since the Vatican has never made the claim, obviously this is not written by a Catholic, or at least not a Catholic who knows anything about the Catholic Church. It could be a misunderstanding what what the Church has said. I am unsure the weave of the cloth proves or indicates anything of the sort. Unless I am mistaken, herringbone weave was not used exclusively in the first century AD. The signs of blood does offer proof that this man was crucified. This is a certainty of which Yannick has shown to be irrefutable. I really like the final question. If this isn’t the burial cloth of Christ, what happened to it? I think there is much wisdom in this question for if Jesus was the Messiah, then wouldn’t the burial cloth be kept with reverence and not just discarded?
