[{"id":"comment-187262","author":"stan_walker_md","post":"Antero, Your analysis – on blood spots – is spot on. These musings by Colin – and Freeman – are fascinating. Intriguing? Not so much. Their analyses are sophisticated – and implore the rest of us to be most focused. Without them – this would be rather droll. I greatly appreciate their contributions. The risk of the overstated presumptions – scorch theories/historical paint falling off notions – or asserting that questioning the validity of Carbon dating is fatuous (Colin saying it would require a huge stretch of the imagination to believe the C12 dating was false) is tantamount to curtailing the liberty of judgement. This is subtle – but very real intellectual tyranny. Thanks again for your insights. As a physician – it is always mind boggling to me that others – turn a blind eye to forensics on the Shroud – and foist entertaining theories upon us. I enjoy all the theories nonetheless..","date":"2015-01-29","mins":"12:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?"}]
