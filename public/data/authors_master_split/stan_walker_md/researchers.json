I learned this in a lecture at my alma mater – Notre Dame. There are other kinds of contractures – such as a trigger finger or Dupuytren’s contracture. This has been debated at length and we had this discussion in gross anatomy lab in medical school. It is well understood that injury to a nerve can cause contractures. Every joint has flexors and extenders. If the extensor muscles are weakened by an injury to the nerve – the contracting muscles will have no resistance – causing continuous contraction. The other curious issue to me is that it has almost always been the custom to place the deceased person’s hands/arms crossed over one’s chest or one’s abdomen. Look at King Tut’s sarcophagus. Or for that matter – any of the people with crypts in any cathedral in Europe. Hands are folded – over the chest – never the pubic area. So here comes the Shroud with hands covering the pubic area. This would not be what a forger would try to do – if he was indeed trying to replicate the standard burial customs. It is also fortunate that the hands are indeed covering the private parts of the Crucified One. We would not – nor would God the Father, Son or Holy Spirit want us to be talking about Jesus” private parts. So too, if the thumbs were not contracted – but folded – over the pubic area – it could easily be misconstrued that the thumb sticking up was actually not the thumb. Rather something else. Not good for discourse. The obvious reasons for a physician to see the Shroud as authentic is because of all the other forensic detail on the Shroud. Very fine detail that is easily overlooked. As an eye surgeon I have also a strong interest in the neuro cognitive sciences – particularly in regards to reading. It is rather obvious that from this stand point – the shroud was produced outside the normal precepts or visual perception. First and foremost is that fact that the Shroud is indeed a negative image. Perhaps not a perfect photographical negative – but a negative nonetheless. Secondly, the size/scale of the image is such that the artist would need to have produced the image – standing at least 6 feet from the cloth – this according to Barry S. And his background in photography. This would be nearly impossible. Thirdly, the image does have 3 D qualities. Perhaps not totally understood yet. But beyond the 3 D nature of the Shroud is the fact that there is the quality of “linear perspective” in the image of the Shroud. You can perceive how the legs are bent. You can see the hollow of the back. It is obvious to see how gravity affected blood flow. This is different than 3 D. Yet we also know the linear perspective was not introduced accurately until Giotto with his frescoes during the Renaissance. Professor Freeman may want to talk about this. It is his area of expertise I expect. Even the carbon dating predates the introduction of linear perspective. The Shroud is not the construct of an artist. As for how the brain reconstructs the image in the brain – that is a long and drawn out discussion. Suffice it to say – the brain can best perceive the image of the Shroud from a distance. The actual image – up close – does comply with normal neuro processing. I suspect something is in play regarding contrast sensitivity..","date":"2015-07-29","mins":"3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-206911","author":"stan_walker_md","post":"Daveb, I cannot disagree with Barbet. His analysis is the best I have read. No one can know if this finding is due to trauma to the muscles or the nerve. Another possibility is that the nails put the flexor muscle/tendon on stretch causing this contracture. We know from the scripture that the guard lanced the side of Jesus after he was already dead. How long had he been dead – minutes, hours? And by the time Joseph of Arimathea got permission to take the body of Christ down it was likely hours – that is plural – after his death. Rigor mortis sets in about two to six hours after death. Earlier in the heat. When I did my training at the Mayo Clinic the ophthalmology residents were responsible for harvesting the eyes for transplantation. I believe it is only the eyes and the marrow that are taken after death. The other organs are harvested before the heart stops beating. We were called to the morgue to enucleate the eyes anywhere from 2 6 hours post mortem. It was apparent to me that rigor mortis had clearly set in in almost every case. The small muscles are affected first – eyelids, jaws, facial muscles, fingers, toes. Large muscles last. It is certainly consistent that the thumbs on the Shroud would still be contracted at the time of burial. There is no reason they would become un contracted. The rigor mortis may have abated by the time the image was created but there would be no reason for the thumbs to straighten. On a side note, the Shroud has a serene quality to it. Very serene. This is a subjective observation. Nonetheless, I have read other opinions sharing this impression. Having enucleated many eyes and dissected a number of cadaver heads – I am still struck with the details on the Shroud. I believe only someone like Da Vinci had an appreciation of anatomical details revealed in the Shroud. The study of anatomy – the dissection of cadavers – came about during the Renaissance..","date":"2015-07-29","mins":"9:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-191202","author":"stan_walker_md","post":"So Mc Crone who claims to be a scientist claims the Shroud is a piece of art. This. This in spite of the fact that there is no scientific evidence evincing the Shroud’s origins. The danger of the Shroud debate – is that of so called scientists – being too anxious to claim infallibility in their analysis. Even the popes have been careful not to weigh in with their judgements on the Shroud. It is a mystery for the time being. A mystery that speaks to our own mystery. I suspect the widsom of the Catholic Church – if it is wisdom – and I suspect it is – is that there will likely always be a debate about the authenticity of the shroud – regardless of evidences. It is too confounding. The debate itself is quite edifying and clarifying even if there are no conclusions..","date":"2015-02-16","mins":"10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In"}]
