[{"author":"schweizer","post":"Sunday, March 23, 2008 Shroud of Turin Current controversy about the shroud of Turin In relation to the current debate regarding the accuracy of the carbon dating, following which the Vatican announced the shroud to be a 14 century forgery, it is important to know that the carbon dating was correct but carried out on samples which were not from the original cloth. The church had absolutely no interest in providing a genuine sample of the shroud because it would show that the person, (presumably Jesus) who had been wrapped in it, was not dead but had survived the crucifixion. The amount of blood shown on the cloth could not have been from a person who had been dead for three hours, particularely taking into account that it was customary that the upper part of the body was elevated when entombed. Hence it would appear that the cloth provided by the church for carbon dating was an almost identically looking cloth dating from the 14th century.Earlier pollen tests carried out on the shroud had shown it to have originated from the area of Jerusalem from the first century.Erwin.","date":"2008-03-24","mins":"6:07 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2008/02/shroud-dating-may-have-been-inaccurate.html","title":"\nShroud Dating May Have Been Inaccurate - Radiocarbon Expert\n"}]
