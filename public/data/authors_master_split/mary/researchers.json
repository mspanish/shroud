[{"id":"comment-14261","author":"mary","post":"Barrie is one of the kindest and most decent people I have met. His unwavering commitment to the authenticity of the Shroud, and the research that has been done thus far will continue to have a far reaching impact on the scientific as well as the religious world. The integrity he puts forth in the work is evident when you speak with him. Simply put, he has given his life his career to the Shroud of Turin. In the end, he and all of us must anwser to our God, and having said that, it seems to me his obligation to the sacred preservation of it (in all its forms) is not taken lightly.
