They read it and if they agree, they sell you the image. The only allowed source, are the photos of Gian Durante. They ask you how many pictures, the size, the nature of your publication, the diffusion, etc. My editor asked an image for my next book. For an image of the shroud to be printed in a page of a book, not in very high definition, they asked 300$ (american dollars). Gian Durante asked 155$ to send the image. Total: 455 $. My editor was very surprised. For the other pictures of the book, he payed between 60 and 90$. For this, I told my editor to refuse and print the book without the image of the shroud. But he considererd it impossible. After some insistences, the commettee kindly sold the image for 235 instead of 300 $. (300+155 = 405$) Before this experience, I imagined that the pictures of the shroud are free. P.S.

A deep analiysis of the “Othon forgery” will be published soon, in French: http://www.franche bourgogne.fr/pages/les publications.html I understand that if people knows only English, most of the literature about the shroud remains unknown to them (and the best things are published in Italian and French). But I am not sure that the language is the very problem….. I have written an entire book in English about the Mandylion and the Shroud, that is the most deep and complete ever written on the subject… and remains ignored among sindonologists.The best they did was to publish on the BSTN a distorted review written by a sindonologist without any competence on the matter …. —— As for Besançon. I do not understand how can you say that what I think “is not backed up by clear documents”. Is the contrary. Is what some say (i.e. The shroud was taken by Othon on 1204, arrived in Besançon, remained there until 1350, was copied ans stolen by Geoffro de Charny or his wife) that is not backed up by clear documents. In reality, is not backed by ANY document. It was invented, the first part on 18th century (by someone that believed that the Besançon shroud was authentic, and the Turin shroud… also!), the second part on 1902. I cannot make out, really, how it is so difficult to understand this. Paul Vignon, the father of sindonologists, a century ago explained why the “Othon theory” is based on a UNIQUE source, late, incoherent and manipulated. Zaccone, director of the museum of the Shroud in Turin, did the same 30 years ago. Even without my book – that will explain HOW the forger invented the history on the beginning of 18th century, and WHO is the forger – it is obvious that the “Othon history” is false. But… as Piana and Scavone still continue to believe in this, people continue to follow them. I am sure that Scavone and Piana never read and studied the “sources” they follow. What we are talking about? It seems that here all is considered true, all legends, forgeries, inventions, conjectures, fantasies, fires, disappaerances, substitutions (only when they support authenticity, obviously).

As the manuscript is in French, and the Shroud is French, it seemed to me useless to do an Italian book. So, I have transcripted the manuscript, and I have written an introduction and commentary in Italian (or in “my” French) that was translated in French or corrected to make the book. “I will read it, although it appears quite time consuming to do so” You can do it, but maybe is better if you wait for my transcripion, that is complete and easy to read. Only a very little part contains what concerns Othon and the Shroud. All the rest is…. Very boring. “Your English book of the Mandylion: the problem is the price. I can’t see why it is priced so high”. Because is published by Brill. And Brill is expensive, I know. But they asked me to translate my book, and I said yes. I am not happy of the high price. “As you wrote, some documents say that Othon de la Roche sent the Shroud to Besançon” Not SOME documents, but ONE document: this manuscript 826, of the 18th century. You are right, is not so easy to explain all, and here, and in English. But the question, as I said, was just explained many years ago: the author of this treatise, in 18th century, said for the first time that Othon had a shroud (500 years later the 1204), when until that moment ALL historians in Besançon said that the Shroud arrived in Besançon some centuries before and by another way (all ignorant?). He quoted some sources, declaring that these sources attribute to Othon the translation of the Shroud. But it is not true, they did not. He manipulated them in a evident and also shameful. He is very ignorant, and for example says that a certain historian was at Constantinople on 1204, when the historian was born AFTER 1204. And so on. For that, Vignon and Zaccone (they are not “Skeptics”) understood that the manuscript 826 was written by someone who INVENTED the link between Othon and the Shroud, to defend his shroud (a normal painting). Now I have identified the author and the sources he manuipulated and falsificated, but, I repeat, it was enough what Vignon and Zaccone wrote to have a correct idea about the problem. My questions remain not answered: 1) documents before 16th century saying that in Besançon there was a shroud with an image of Christ; THEY DO NOT EXIST 2) documents before 16th century saying that in Besançon there was a shroud; THEY DO NOT EXIST 3) documents before 18th century (i.e. Before the forgery of the 826 manuscript of Besançon) saying that Othon de la Roche had a shroud. THEY DO NOT EXIST I add: documents between 1204 and 18th century describing the liturgy in Besançon, the relics in Besançon, the decisions of the chapter in Besançon: YES, THERE ARE MANY, but without any shroud. Because the shroud in Besançon was painted on 1520 circa. This is not question of subtle interpretation and analysis, is only normal exegesis of the sources..","date":"2014-12-01","mins":"5:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-174350","author":"andrea_nicolotti","post":"Mario, when you will come in Turin let me know.

If there are several other similar examples asserting much the same, is because people love copy from other and repeat, without studying. And it is troubling that ALWAYS people who study is asked to demonstrate, whereas people who copy and invent not. However, only FEW things: 1) Othon de la Roche was not “a prince of Morea”. 2) he did not “sent some type of shroud in 1208 to his father”, because his father on 1208 was dead. 3) “history first records a shroud (most think it was a painted copy) on display at Besançon before 1349”. But is not said that it was not a “shroud”, but a white neckerchief without image. 4) “Then it was out of public view for about 3 years, because the former Cathedral at Besançon was struck by lightning”. False. 5) “When the fabric returned to public view, the shroud shown at Besançon was clearly a painted copy”. We have no ONE reliable source saying that after the fire a painted shroud was shown. 6) “Jeanne de Vergy, a direct descendent of Otto”. No, Jeanne de Vergy was not a direct descendent of Otto. 7) “[…] was the first to publicly display the Shroud of Turin in the 14th Century”. No sources saying that. 8) “In 1389, the Shroud went to another family member (Margaret)”. False. 9) “Interestingly, the burn marks on the original Saint Suaire come from a cathedral fire”. Invented. 10) “It is thought, but not proved, that”…., funny. 11) “a shroud of some type was on display at the Chapel of the Holy Shroud in Saint Etienne”. Yes, but after 1523 (in reality, there was not any “Chapel of the Holy Shroud” in Besançon before 1748). 12) “It is then thrown into a fire, from which it did not escape”. Invented. 13) “One may find a representation of it on a window in the chapel of Pérolles in Fribourg”. The chapelle of Perolles has a painting of the Chambéry Shroud, and shows both sides of Christ.

Answers: 0. If you believe that, without this, you can INVENT…. I do not know what I can do. You are wrong. The game is over. But is over with this “conclusion”: “Sindonologist believe that it is correct and possible to invent a medieval history of the Shroud of Besançon without proofs, because they want this”. It is enough for me. Clear. Yves Delage and Frederik Zugibe (the first one was not a medical forensic pathologists) have nothing to do with this. You want to believe that the 1349 fire (1350, indeed) at St Stephen’s destroyed documents? If it is true, if the fire destroyed them, and if you have not seen them, you cannot INVENT them. But, I inform you, fires are the customary pretext for forgers. And I am not so exigent with you: I ask not only medieval documents before the fire, but also documents AFTER the fire. We have a lot of historical and liturgical documents in Besançon AFTER the fire (and also BEFORE). We have liturgical books with the fests celebrated in Besançon. We have the books with the deliberations of the chapitre. We have many books and documents. Where they mention a shroud? Your argument “what little might have remained in the region was dispatched by the French Revolution” is weak, because all historians in Besançon that tried to write the history of their Shroud BEFORE the French Revolution did not find documents (obviously, they did not exixt) and choosed to INVENT like you do. But they invented other things: that Shroud was brought there by Aelia Eudocia or Licinia Eudoxia or Galla Placidia. No crusades, no Othon. Who invented better? Scavone and Chamard in XX century or D’orival and Gollut in XVII century? Why Scavone is right and D’Orival not? Because the last one is right? So, if I invent something about this I’ll become right? I inform you that on XVI century the history invented by D’Orival was considered “opposite to the truth and history” by Chifflet, but “consistent to the tradition” by the chapter of the cathedral of Besançon. Who is right? And why we do not see here any De la Roche or Vergy? You think that Scavone is better informed than Chifflet? Now I want to know why your invention is better than other inventions, in the past or the future, about the shroud of Lirey. We have a lot of possibilities.
