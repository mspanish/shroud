The UTET’s book was sold for 3790 euros (=4270 US dollars), so a normal person will not buy it. It is one of those books that are a piece of art rather books. The texts inside have nothing new or special. The images, very nice, are not useful for research and are printed. So that book with those images cannot be used for scientifical purposes..","date":"2015-01-26","mins":"11:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/25/the-hidden-away-hd-images-an-indispensable-tool-for-researchers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Hidden Away HD Images:  An Indispensable Tool for Researchers"},{"id":"comment-172538","author":"andrea_nicolotti","post":"Excuse me, John, but… I asked for pictures of Hugh in his laboratory! : ).","date":"2014-11-22","mins":"10:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/a-scorch-is-a-scorch-of-course-of-course/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A scorch is a scorch, of course, of course,"},{"id":"comment-186426","author":"andrea_nicolotti","post":"“”I say Dr. Nicolotti is just the man to set about liberating Halta’s 72 GB of HD image data from the grasping hands of its over possessive custodians””””.

The Turin’s diocese (in agreement with the Holy See, perhaps) does not want to allow the circulation of high definition images of the Shroud. And Haltadefinizione (who made the images freely) cannot share nor sell his images without the authorization of the the Turin’s diocese. The diocese does not allow researches to be conducted on the shroud without their authorization, and to see the images is considered research. So, practically, the original images of Haltadefinizione are useless because they remain closed in their computers, and will remain so. This is not my speculation..","date":"2015-01-25","mins":"5:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/25/the-hidden-away-hd-images-an-indispensable-tool-for-researchers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Hidden Away HD Images:  An Indispensable Tool for Researchers"},{"id":"comment-186421","author":"andrea_nicolotti","post":"Colin, I know someone at the Lincei Academy, but… if they do not want to give the images, so… they will not give them. They give not the images to sindonologists, and do you think that will do this with an indipendent academy? The problem is only one: on 1946, end of the Italian kingdom, the State forgot (or avoided) to confiscate the Shroud. So,if the pope is his owner, the scientifical academy has not possibilities to be heard. As the Shroud is owned by the Church, the scientifical problems are a detail of secondary importance..","date":"2015-01-26","mins":"12:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/25/the-hidden-away-hd-images-an-indispensable-tool-for-researchers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Hidden Away HD Images:  An Indispensable Tool for Researchers"},{"id":"comment-186128","author":"andrea_nicolotti","post":"For the resolution, see the camera they used.
