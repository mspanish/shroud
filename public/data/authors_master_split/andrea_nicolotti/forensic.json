It is strange that in Vatican museums did not explain to Flavia that what they store (closed in a wardrobe) are not flagra, and also probably they are modern “pastiches”: when I was there on 2012, they knew it..","date":"2015-01-18","mins":"6:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/a-number-of-marks-falling-all-over-the-surface-of-the-body/","cat":"history","title":"A number of marks falling all over the surface of the body"},{"id":"comment-184254","author":"andrea_nicolotti","post":"What does it mans “independent confirmation”?.","date":"2015-01-18","mins":"6:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/a-number-of-marks-falling-all-over-the-surface-of-the-body/","cat":"history","title":"A number of marks falling all over the surface of the body"},{"id":"comment-184268","author":"andrea_nicolotti","post":"No, because the acts were not published.
