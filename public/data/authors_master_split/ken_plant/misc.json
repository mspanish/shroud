[{"id":"comment-17801","author":"ken_plant","post":"I read goldsworthy’s blog regarding the turin shroud and if he is right about the bodies on the Island, then why not about the Shroud. No one has come up with a reasonable explanation for the caramel varnish found on the threads exterior. Why not consider the image was formed in a liquid over an extended period and the residue encrustation is from cedar or other oils. Goldsworthy does over extend his thesis into the irrelevant but I find his explanation of the melkin prophecy very convincing. All previous attempts to explain certain details seem perplexing. The prophecy contains directions and each detail is too accurate to ignore. The few instructions act as an indicator that locates an island upon which the uncle of Jesus may have previously visited. The shroud is never very far from Joseph of Arimathea in any account. If Joseph is on the Island and Goldsworthy’s theory of a coffin containing cedar oil is correct, then it is possible that the shroud image was formed in this way and is until disproved a hypothetically good explanation. I personally always thought it a coincidence that the shroud surfaced straight after the demise of the Templars. A test should be conducted to see if the Cedar oil theory is correct because as you have stated the carbon dating of the Shroud was suspect. I think the shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus, I just need to understand how the figure was made. If the solution was easy someone would have an answer..","date":"2012-10-18","mins":"9:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/18/burgh-island-in-devon-key-to-world-piece-and-the-mystery-of-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Burgh Island in Devon: Key to World Peace and the Mystery of the Shroud"}]
