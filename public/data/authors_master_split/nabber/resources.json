The lack of such objects that have survived to the present day testifies to their casual construction (in most cases), as well as to their disgusting nature after much use (objects to be thrown away). What’s really the point of the non authenticists, anyway — the scourge marks have been shown to be non paint and in some examinations, blood.

This is absolutely, positively WRONG. Your statement only refers to the Pope speaking “ex cathedra” on matters of Church dogma, which are rare. “The Church’s magisterium is exercised in cases not having the solemnity of “ex cathedra” statements by Popes, in written documents such as Papal catechisms, encyclicals and pastoral letters, or orally, as in homilies. These statements are part of the ordinary magisterium of the Church.” “the response called for from Catholics, to this ordinary magisterium, is that of the Religious Submission of Will and Intellect. This kind of response cannot be simply exterior or disciplinary, but must be understood within the logic of faith and under the impulse of obedience to the faith.” HF: “[the Popes’ words that] …the Shroud to be a very important artefact with significant relevance to the revelations of Christ, but that is not the same thing as pronouncing on its authenticity.” If the Popes’ words were “carefully worded” and “not the same thing” then how do you square the words of the last 3 Popes with that? Pope John Paul II: “The Holy Shroud is the Most Splendid Relic of the Passion and Resurrection.” Pope Benedict XVI: “…should be seen as a Photographic Document of the Darkest Mystery of Faith — that of Christ’s Crucifixion and Resurrection.” Pope Francis I: “By means of the Holy Shroud, the Unique and Supreme Word of God comes to us.” Very, very definitive except to the most blind and deaf of skeptics…...","date":"2015-06-20","mins":"9:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/bbc-news-magazine-the-perplexing-image/","cat":"article","title":"BBC News Magazine:  The Perplexing Image"},{"id":"comment-202925","author":"nabber","post":"You are quite wrong.
