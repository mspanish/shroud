That is, picking a pattern out of random information. Examples include clouds that look like elephants, or the island of Great Britain (my favorite to pick out on a spring day).

As the main article mentioned, what Donald thinks of as swords and armor are simply creases, burn marks, water damage, natural graining and the light areas that show the separation of the legs. Also, the width and mass of the body seems to be the same. Wouldn’t armor significantly expand the size of the image? Unless it was skin tight (like modern athletic “armor”), We should not fault Donald, but he should not be so affended when after making bold assertions to the world, the world makes them right back. And to poor Martin, you are a long time blogger. You know the world is full of the impulsive and half informed. Humans are savages and internet discourse proves it.
