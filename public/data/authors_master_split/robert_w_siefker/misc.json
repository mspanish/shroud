In fact Fanti and Maggiolo’s paper does provide collaboration for Jackson’s prediction. There does appear to be double superficiality of aspects of the Shroud body image.

One minor correction is that it is not an axiom of Jackson’s hypothesis that a body can become instantaneously mechanically transparent. Jackson nor does anybody else have any explanation for how that might be the case. Jackson has stated the following: “My concern as early as 1976, fourteen years before the 1990 paper, was one of physics – how to reconcile the 3 d characteristic of the Shroud image with its high resolution. I described this concern mathematically in a paper for the Proceedings of the 1977 United States Conference of Research on the Shroud of Turin entitled, ‘A problem of resolution posed by the existence of a three dimensional image on the Shroud.” This problem, in fact, persists to this day as can be seen from the Image Characteristics versus Image Formation Hypothesis Table of the Critical Summary; compare rows B2.0 (High Resolution) and B3.0 (3 Dimensional) for which no hypothesis, except the Radiation Fall Through hypothesis, is indicated as simultaneously satisfying both image criteria. Moreover, a careful reading of the 1990 paper will show that the logic of the Radiation Fall Through hypothesis does not, in any way, depend upon or require an assumption arising from Christian theology; rather, the logic arises strictly from what is observed on the Shroud of Turin image.” Jackson’s hypothesis proves nothing. It is one image formation hypothesis among many. It is fair to attack it with good solid arguments. We don’t think there are any yet. You be the judge..","date":"2015-11-18","mins":"1:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-214789","author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"It is a very good recommendation to read this interview. TSC is very familiar with this fine discussion. Thank you Louis for pointing out this resource. Dr. Di Lazzaro is deeply respected for his fine work by John Jackson and the TSC organization. In many respects he represents the best of the emerging next generation of outstanding scientists who are contributing to the scientific examination of the Shroud. We think Paolo would not say his research on double superficiality makes Jackson’s hypothesis “no longer viable.” At most, if Paolo is right in his interpretation, he would be able to say that the double superficiality prediction of Jackson’s hypothesis must be rethought. If he is right then the rating of the double superficiality “image characteristic” (Item C3.0 as listed in the Critical Summary) must be changed. That is to be determined. Even doing this however leaves Jackson’s hypothesis being very viable indeed, relative to other hypotheses. You will note in the Critical Summary references that we have included Paolo and Ghiberti’s objections to double superficiality. There is honest debate. TSC’s judgment is that Fanti and Maggiolo are correct about double superficiality. Regardless Jackson’s hypothesis remains viable..","date":"2015-11-18","mins":"6:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-214792","author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Louis, your comments are appreciated..","date":"2015-11-18","mins":"7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-214795","author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Well said Louis..","date":"2015-11-18","mins":"8:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-216631","author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Dear Dan, your blog has always challenged us ‘authenticists” to work harder to provide better arguments and better research. That has been a very important contribution. Someone in a comment above stated that we have kind of reached a stalemate. That is true of course. If the Shroud is authentic then one might ask why has it remained such an enigma? Why wouldn’t providence simply make it absolutely clear? It didn’t and it probably won’t. Maybe the Shroud is just a knock at the door. Is it a sign? The answer appears to be “you decide.” For our generation you have done as well as any to promote the discussion. You are to be saluted. Thank you. God bless you.
