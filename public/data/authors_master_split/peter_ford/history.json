He also has been rediculed by this group of so called Shroudies. His discovery is of immense importance as he has given evidence to both cloths coming from the same man and the St Peters Veronica has far greater time history recorded. He has solved the mystery without carbon dating by his discovery and several of these Shroud groups who have vested interests in conitueing the circus are terrified of his discovery. He even revealed three toes ripped off the mysterious left foot which scientists have said was crossing over but was not visible , his name is Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello.","date":"2012-08-12","mins":"1:44 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/a-reply-to-dan-porter-and-his-shroud-of-turin-associates-re-the-significance-of-the-lirey-pilgrims-badge/","cat":"badge_lirey","title":"A reply to Dan Porter and his Shroud of Turin associates re the significance of the Lirey Pilgrim’s Badge"},{"id":"comment-10156","author":"peter_ford","post":"Check this out Dan.","date":"2012-04-08","mins":"10:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/08/the-lord-is-risen-he-is-risen-indeed/","cat":"history","title":"The Lord Is Risen!
