[{"id":"comment-15721","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"Charles Freeman has offered the only thing that anyone writing on this subject can do: yet another autopsy of a joke that had already been done to death. In comparison to your autopsy, dear Andrea, Freeman’s is incomparably less exhaustive. In comparison to mine, it is much more general. In comparison to Yannick’s, much more anodyne. In comparison to those of Professors Gramaglia, Brock, or Cameron, Robin Cormack or Hans Belting, it is substantiated by far less of an academic career. So why is Stephen E Jones dissecting this particular one in so many parts, while others have not been granted such dignity? Is it not primarily because Freeman’s article was published on a website ‘Dedicated to Free Inquiry, Naturalistic Humanism, Freethought, and the Philosophies of Naturalism, Empiricism, Rationalism, and Skepticism: The Heritage of the Enlightenment that Produced Science and the Modern World?’.","date":"2012-09-02","mins":"10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/01/hat-trick-to-freeman-jones-unhorsed-too-bad/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Hat trick to Freeman! Jones Unhorsed! Too Bad!"},{"id":"comment-15722","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"In other words, is it not because Jones believes that ‘there is a deeper and darker dimension to these attacks on the Shroud and on Shroud pro authenticists?’ Just read these few lines: ‘Freeman and his anti Christian ilk don’t realise that in so doing they are acting out their part in Christs’ Play. In “The Parable of the Weeds” (Mt 13:24 30) He whose image is on the Shroud told us that He allows these weeds to “grow … until the harvest” at which time (if they don’t repent) He “will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds … and bind them in bundles to be burned.’ Now, Jones doesn’t know whether you are a Christian or not, because your book wasn’t published by a publisher that openly peddles anti Christian pamphlets and eulogies to human reason that produced the horrors of the French Revolution. Hence, your silly book is not of much interest to him. But he positively knows that Freeman (the following is a quote from part one of Jones’ six part bravura) ‘is evidently an atheist/agnostic having published papers critical of Christianity in the New Humanist online magazine, the subtitle of which is “Ideas for godless people”, and is “produced by the Rationalist Association … dedicated to reason, science, secularism and humanism.” Freeman in his review of philosopher James Hannam’s book, “God’s Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern Science” (2009), describes Hannam as “a Catholic convert,” in contrast to himself, “(I have passed the other way),” so presumably Freeman is now an ex Catholic and an anti Christian.’ And he knows that ‘Therefore, according to Freeman’s presumed personal atheist/agnostic philosophy, Christianity must be false, supernatural miracles are impossible, and the Shroud of Turin must be a fake!’ And he positievly knows that Freeman was mentioned both in the Gospel according to Matthew and in the Apocalypse of John. And he knows that his duty as a Christian is to speak up against this beast. Yannick and I, who claim to be Catholic, although we don’t agree with Wilson (?!?!) are a different thing. There may be some little hope for us. But Freeman is the anti Christ. And Jones will put on his shiny armour and battle this dragon in however many parts it may take to quote the entire ‘Catechism According to Wilson’ and the Wikipedia’s entire entry on logical fallacies. So, no, Andrea, the problem isn’t that your book is in Italian. You are simply not the devil..","date":"2012-09-02","mins":"11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/01/hat-trick-to-freeman-jones-unhorsed-too-bad/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Hat trick to Freeman!
