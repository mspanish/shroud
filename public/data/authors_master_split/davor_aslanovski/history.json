So can we please stick to the subject? Byzantine Greek is full of peculiar neologisms, and the word tetradyplon is not a particularly interesting one. And I HAVE dealt with it, you just haven’t read my posts very carefully. I said: ‘What remains to be examined now is the impression that some authors have believed that the image of Edessa was preserved on a large cloth and/or that the cloth bore the imprint of Jesus’ entire body and not just his face. And the essential thing to notice here is that these two notions cannot be divorced from one another. In other words, it cannot add any credence to Wilson’s theory that John Damascene used the word himation, which does indeed denote a large cloth, if this fact is contrasted with the saint’s beliefs about the image’s appearance and formation. For how can a clear statement that the image was formed when Jesus washed his face with water, and an attendant absence of any mention of either blood or full body image, be completely disregarded on the strength of a single word that does not normally denote a face towel? If a text is to have any bearing on our conception of what the image of Edessa was, three elements need to be speaking in unison: (i) the narrative of the image’s formation, (ii) the words or phrases describing the cloth’s size, and (iii) the account of what the image really portrays. And if this filter is applied to the extant sources, it quickly becomes obvious that the only account which comes even close to corroborating Wilson’s theory is that of Gervase of Tilbury.’ As this is obviously not clear enough, I will briefly explain. The ‘Acts of Thaddaeus’ mention the ‘sindon tertradiplon’, but the image is said to be formed when Jesus asked to wash Himself, upon which a towel was handed over to Him and He wiped His face with it. So that’s why this text cannot pass through my ‘filter’. The Menologion entry for Aug 16 likewise says ‘tetradiplon’, but the account of the image formation is the same (Jesus wiping His face after washing it with water). Neither the full body image nor the presence of blood is mentioned in any account, and both expressly state that the image was formed while Jesus was alive. Gregory Referendarius is, just like Nicholas Mesarites, one of the few authors who have actually had first hand, up close familiarity with whatever the image of Edessa was. And they were both men of considerable learning. And their testimonies do not mention anything like the double imprint of a dead man on a 14 foot cloth. (Nicholas Mesarites in fact expressly distinguishes the burial shroud (‘sindones Christou’) from the towel (cheiromakterion) with the prototypal image.) As for the bishop Arculf, let me quote what Wilson himself says: ‘he had seen in Jerusalem “the sudarium of Our Lord which was palced over His head in the tomb”. (…) It was apparently about 8 feet long, so its measurements do not appear to match our Shroud (…) But Arculf mentioned no imprint.’ How Arculf’s testimony is then relevant to this discussion – you tell me. Just as in the case of tetradyplon, I HAVE addressed the Vignon markings – once again the problem is that you have not read my posts very carefully. I said: ‘As is immediately obvious upon close inspection of both the “icon evangelizing” and the “Vignon markings” claim, Wilson and his supporters do not understand that certain copies in Byzantium were precisely not to be identical. Far from being a case of meticulous examination, exact replication, and zealous dissemination of a venerated archetype, the story of the Mandylion in Byzantine art is one of virtually inexhaustible variation.” And then I corroborated that claim with close inspection of precisely those images that Wilson (and other ‘sindonologsist’) offered as proofs of their theses. I have also pointed out that the two images that predate all the other Mandylion reproductions by several centuries do not show any of these markings. And I have stressed that a fresco of Abraham in the Karanlik Kilise ‘bears at least the following “markings”: quiffs of hair falling on the forehead; heavily accentuated owlish eyes; accentuated cheeks; asymmetrical nostrils; forked beard’. So I don’t see how ‘the topic is not addressed at all’. Yes, the report commissioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitos, if not in fact written by himself, says that the Lekapenoi usurpers were unable to see the image. And anyone who knows the story of Constantine’s struggle to regain the throne knows that this is most likely only his imperial propaganda. But, in any case, the account once again does not say that this was an image of a full body. As for this part: ‘One further aspect is that the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople was marked by a general rejoicing, the institution of a major feast day observed annually throughout Orthodox Christianity, but no corresponding feast day for the arrival of the Shroud, a much more notable relic, which only seems to have become slowly manifest in Constantinople over a period of time, very likely when the Mandylion was removed from its framework. However the Byzantines were not about to give up on their precious Abgar legends, the stories which had become woven into their liturgies, and so the myth of the Mandylion as a separate object persisted.’ I have nothing to say other than that such an account depends entirely on your personal beliefs and not on any evidence. You may be right. Or, to be more precise, Daniel Scavone may be right, because, if I’m not mistaken, it is his theory. In any case, this may be right. Or it may be wrong. But there is no evidence for it. And I could just as well, off the top of my head, come up with another theory: there was no feats day for the arrival of the burial shroud because the burial shroud was a relic forged in Constantinople itself. I have no evidence for such a claim, of course, but that doesn’t seem to matter here. Or, to be more serious, I could say ask you this: was there a feast day for the arrival of EVERY relic in Constantinople? Or this: was every relic transferred to Constantinople on the 100th anniversary of the Triumph of Orthodoxy, and was every relic so prominently mentioned by the iconodules during the iconoclastic controversy? Or was every relic used as a piece of imperial propaganda by an emperor who has been deprived of his birthright for a quarter of a century? If you have any further questions, please first read my two posts and see if they haven’t already been dealt with there..","date":"2012-06-23","mins":"8:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-12981","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"And I do hope that when you guys say ‘I have not changed my mind’ you know that that says nothing about the cogency of my arguments..","date":"2012-06-23","mins":"8:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-12963","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"Thank you, Dan! I will gladly enter any serious discussion, based on arguments and direct references to the sources. I will, of course, ignore insulting comments on my writing style and facial features, generalising remarks about the shortcomings of academics, and appeals to cryptography, steganography, and/or to misconstructions such as this Markwardt’s take on the Disciplina Arcani. (For the simple reason that these things are entirely fanciful and have no direct connection to Christian relics and art.) What I wrote is this: the Hymn of the Pearl, the Mozarabic rite Inlatio, the homily of Gregory Referendarius, and the Otia Imperalia, often cherished as major proofs that the Image of Edessa and the Turin Shroud CAN be identified, have been grossly misinterpreted in the so called sindonological circles. And Wilson’s interpretation of Early Christian and Byzantine art is equally mistaken. I have put a lot of time in explaining why I think that, and have built my arguments solely on the close reading of the actual documents. And if I can get the same level of seriousness and argumentation from my critics, I will gladly debate them. If not, I will, naturally, ignore them. And one more point. I think it is quite obvious from my two papers that I am not interested in the debate over the authenticity of the Shroud. What I wanted to say was simply this: there is no evidence, textual or visual, that the Shroud and the Image of Edessa are really one and the same. The Shroud, for all that we know, might be authentic. And it might even be the Image of Edessa. But, for the time being, there is no EVIDENCE for either. And the discussion of EVIDENCE, on the Image of Edessa, is what my two papers are about. Personal beliefs, ‘spy clues’, and cryptographical protocols of the ‘Da Vinci Code’ type are not what I call evidence..","date":"2012-06-23","mins":"10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-12973","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"I agree and disagree with you. I share your opinion that some people involved in this debate have misinterpreted, misused, and/or misrepresented the evidence. But I don’t think there is any reason to think of anything like deliberate deception. After all, these documents and images are (in one way or another) widely accessible today and there is nothing stopping anyone from examining them and forming their own opinion. And there is certainly nothing to be gained from such a ‘deception’ or ‘fraud’. My image of an average sindonologist is, therefore, more like this: he has come to the (accurate) conclusion that the image in the Shroud is like no other in the history of human art, and that it, at least for the time being, escapes scientific explanation; he has, through various experiences in his life, become fed up (and rightly so) with the skepticism, rationalism, agnosticism, and the general disbelief that permeate the academic world today; he has done some research and has found a number of things in various scientific disciplines (in at least some of which he has no expertise of his own) that could conceivably be used to prove that the relic is authentic; he has most probably always had a healthy passion for mysteries; and he is, more often than not, passionate about his religion as well. Through a combination of these factors, he continues to been drawn to this enigmatic object. And, far from resorting to deception or fraud, he genuinely believes his own claims. He is often aware that experts have refuted some of his claims, but refuses to change his mind – because these experts are generally not very inspiring to him. Their skepticism, rationalism, and agnosticism, mentioned above, is in fact repulsive to him, and, to a great degree in deliberate opposition to them, he chooses to believe. He chooses a wonderfully mysterious fantasy over the dreary, cheerless reality. And who can possibly blame him? I certainly don’t – in the eyes of many, I am guilty of the same for my being a Christian. The one thing that I don’t understand about him, and cannot relate to, is that he somehow thinks that his study of this relic is directly connected to his Christianity. An ‘average sindonologist’ spends hours and hours on blogs and websites like this rather than to read his Bible, say his prayers, love and help his neighbors, and grow in the discipleship of Christ. One does not exclude the other, no, but we are only afforded so much time in this world and spending it on endless debates such as by what stretches of imagination the ‘Hymn of the Pearl’ can be seen to have anything to do with the Turin Shroud cannot be the best way of spending that portion that should be dedicated to religion. The Shroud is a fascinating object, but the study of the textual and visual records pertaining to it must be like any other – scientific. Belief should be left for other areas of human existence. Venerating the crucified Jesus, whether in the Shroud or in any other way needs no evidence. Studying the Shroud needs nothing but evidence. And if the Shroud is authentic, my guess (based on ‘spy clues’ and ‘cyptographic examinations’ of how God seems to like to conduct His business) is that evidence for that will never be found. All the best!.","date":"2012-06-23","mins":"2:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-13090","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"@ Menedemus and David Mo: I have read and I appreciate your comments.

As for the question of prosecutions and ‘anything to do with the faith (…) being destroyed by the pagen rulers who would endlessly conquer throughout the early centuries!’ – I’m not even going to go into the fact that persecutions did not happen *throughout* the early centuries. In a word, I am not going to give you a historian’s answer.

I believe you are intelligent and cool headed enough to see that the only topic I have addressed is the plausibility of the link between the Image of Edessa and the Turin Shroud. Eminent scholars such as Averil Cameron, Sebastian Brock, Hans Belting, Robin Cormack, and Ewa Kuryluk; as well as some others who are not as advanced in their careers as to be called ’eminent’, but are certainly trained in relevant disciplines and have based their opinions on diligent research and much reflection – such as Andrea Nicolotti or my own humble self; have expressed their expert opinions on the topic and have rejected the idea as entirely fanciful. But our opinion is not valued within the ‘sindonological’ circles, and is rejected with intelligent and well argued explanations such as: ‘Rather turgid prose, straining at gnats, swallowing camels, he doesn’t see the woods, too focused on the trees, twigs and leaves. I can see why academic specialists are unsuitable candidates for jury trials. There’s rather a lot more to it than he’s considered, I should say yet another victim of over specialisation.’ ‘I trust that DA has had “the last part he has to say on the matter”, as despite his extensive verbiage he has contributed nothing to our understanding of the Shroud. He may return to his ivory tower where no doubt a trail of sycophants may admire his further efforts on Byzantine scholarship, and other such related topics.’ You yourself have read my two papers, admitted that they were products of serious study, and then granted them with no other comment but ‘I have not changed my mind’. And you go out and ask yourself: ‘What could he possibly mean by this ‘disrespect and distrust for the orthodox academia?’ I have been thinking about refuting the idea that the Pray ms illustrations are somehow depictions of the Turin Shroud, or that the Disciplina Arcani is what Markwardt thinks it is – but, frankly, I don’t even know where to begin. So many things have been misunderstood here that I would have to start with questions like ‘So what is art?’. And even if I found a way of debunking these syndonological myths – what would the reactions be? ‘You haven’t changed my mind, you iconologically blind, over specialized, archskeptical sycopanth. Go back to your ivory tower.’ For the hundredth millionth time: I don’t know what the Shroud of Turin is. I don’t know what the worth of chemical, physical, botanical, or any other research on it is. I don’t even know much about C 14 dating. Because I am not a specialist in any of those fields, and have not had any first hand information on the subject. So I have no opinion on these issues. But I am trained as an art historian, at a university that prides itself with being one of the first in the world to have introduced the subject of art history, and where it takes you at least 6 years to complete your undergraduate degree – so extensive are the reading lists. And I am currently sponsored by the University of Oxford’s most prestigious scholarship and am reading Late Antique and Byzantine Studies under the supervision of the world famous Jaś Elsner. And, after having dedicated many, many hours to examining both the textual and the visual sources, I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in them to support Wilson’s hypothesis. And I am not saying that Wilson isn’t right. I am only saying that, at the present moment, there is no evidence to support his thesis. So, rather than pretending not to know why I would say that there is disrespect and distrust for the orthodox academia here, you either start accepting my views as informed judgments made by a sincere and serious person, or let me back go to my ivory tower to mingle with my fellow sycophants whose testimony would be valueless in New Zealand courts of law and whose over specialized camel swallowing will never convince you..","date":"2012-07-01","mins":"7:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/01/sindonology-oh-what-an-awful-word/","cat":"history","title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?"},{"id":"comment-13265","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"And, yes, it is irritation that all these typing mistakes show.

If anything has backfired on me, it was rather my decision to discuss this outside the academic world..","date":"2012-07-01","mins":"9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/01/sindonology-oh-what-an-awful-word/","cat":"history","title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?"},{"id":"comment-13283","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"Yes, David, you are right. But these believers believe that they are scientists. And that’s why I brought up Velikovskianism and exoheresy. I wouldn’t walk into a village where simple peasants worship an icon that they believe was painted by St Luke and lecture to them on the improbability of such a thing. But this is something else. This is: ‘St Luke was a painter and all the Christian art drew on what he painted and we can prove it scientifically. We have found a crack in the paint on an old icon in the shape of the philtrum – the philtrum was not painted, it is a crack in the paint, but it was misinterpreted by the artists and copied as a philtrum, which you will find on a number of old icons of Our Lady – both on the Virgin AND ON CHRIST! And this proves that every icon stems from this one source, which was painted by St Luke. And we have analyzed the wormholes in the wood on which the original icon was painted. And if you connect the wormholes (consistently with the paleographic and steganographic data made widely known to us by a retired dental surgeon who made several trips to Mount Athos in his life, both alone and in the company of his plumber who is an expert on the Disciplina Arcani), you will get the letters MP ΘY – which you will find on almost EVERY old icon of Our Lady!!! ‘M’, as was conclusively shown at our 1999 international conference in Las Vegas, stands for the Latin ‘mecum’ – we are still working on the rest of the letters in this arcane message.’ I don’t know about you, but I am a weak man and find such temptations very hard to resist..","date":"2012-07-01","mins":"12:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/01/sindonology-oh-what-an-awful-word/","cat":"history","title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?"},{"id":"comment-17596","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"And do you have any other advice?

And so if there’s anything from your rich life experience that comes to mind… and could help me… if you’d be so kind.

For me, this interview speaks more profundly on the honest motives of Ian (…) It provides a moving insight into the motives of the man. Indeed! It says some things very clearly: ‘He studied Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford, a degree he hoped would lead to a career in journalism, but it was not to be.’ (…) ‘I had absolutely no inclination to become an academic: a history degree was simply a passport to a better job. (…) ‘However, because the job of a junior reporter was poorly paid I opted first to go into advertising, then in 1969 joined the Bristol Evening Post newspaper group as head of its publicity and promotions department. So although for a decade I worked closely with journalists, I never became one.’ So, by his own admission, he studied history with no real interest in it – he just hoped he could get a job in journalism. And when that didn’t come through, he had to find something else. That’s when he met Maurus Green (who needs no introduction here), David Willis (‘a family doctor who had converted to Catholicism largely as a result of his medical studies of the Shroud’ (???!!!)), and Vera Barclay (a popular Scout Mistress). And he embarked on ‘a three month historical research project in the old Reading Room of the British Museum’. (Other people spend years and years grappling with Byzantine sources, which are notoriously difficult to use, as they are largely couched in a theologically or hagiographically inflected language of apology and polemic that is not only very distant from modern habits of mind but also nearly impossible to pin down in factual terms. But this young man, to whom a history degree was only a passport to a better job, did all the research in 3 months.) And ‘…this led in 1978 to the publication of the book which launched me as a full time author.’ And ‘The Turin Shroud was an international bestseller.’ And that was it. The journalism career that he was hoping for never came through, but his family GP and a Scout Mistress helped him find his way..","date":"2012-07-09","mins":"5:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/07/the-shroud-of-turin-a-modern-relic-cult/","cat":"history","title":"The Shroud of Turin: A Modern Relic Cult?"},{"id":"comment-13640","author":"davor_aslanovski","post":"Daveb of wellington nz : His assertions denigrating Ian Wilson’s motives come close to being libellous, and do him no credit.
