I stumbled upon it because I was a little miffed at this article by Reuters: http://ca.reuters.com/article/top News/id CATRE63 A11 W20100411?page Number=2&virtual Brand Channel=0 Where the include the now debunked C14 dating as evidence for the sceptics, yet do not go further to explain that it is indeed debunked at this point. I had heard about that earlier but was searching for the details. Keep up the great work, bookmarked for sure now. Just a quick reply to Ellen, you are ashamed of our church because of what the media is reporting? Perhaps you should be more discerning about how the media views our church and dig a little deeper into their stories and motivations to find the truth, there are many articles from decent reporters also in the media that have highlighted the pattent falsehood and picking and choosing of facts used in many of the leading attack stories such as those from the NYT. Here is one to get you started, to see what the NYT is up to exactly: “Fairness for the Pope: Pontiff not at fault in Wisconsin pedophile priest case” http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/03/31/2010 03 31 fairness for the pope.html#ixzz0ko QENS Qg.","date":"2010-04-11","mins":"1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/04/03/what-is-bigger-the-shroud-showing-in-turin-or-the-history-channel-in-the-us/","cat":"2010","title":"What is bigger: The Shroud showing in Turin or the History Channel in the US?"},{"id":"comment-1248","author":"great_blog","post":"Ellen, please do not fall pray to the agenda of those against the Church and christianity in general, have a read and see how the ‘scandal’ is being manufactured and sustained: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100033774/journalists abandon standards to attack the pope you can say that again/ The major players in this attack continue to fabricate and twist facts in order to create the picture they want you to see.
