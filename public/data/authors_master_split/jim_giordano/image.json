I visited your site when you were still working with a bas relief and wet towel – and while they didn’t look anything like the Shroud – I was looking forward to further tests. And then you started that obnoxious tirade in trying to get scientists drummed out of some British science academy for having the gall to suggest God might be involved with the image of the Shroud – such a witch hunt against people you don’t agree with is inexcusable – and you have the gall to accuse me of trying to suppress you! Ha! If you’d listen to me, and make your posts more like an adult would write, you would increase your readship exponentially, instead of driving them away with that constant crap that hides your hard work. Just Stick To The Science! Anyways, God Bless you in your retirement. Oh, but maybe you could squeeze in one more thing, see if you can get your action figure print to give a similar 3d effect like Dr. Soons was able too with the image from the Shroud. Maybe you could do another test with a much bigger subject, with bended legs – as the Shroud shows an lighter, foreshortened image under the “shroud man’s” legs. Oh, and put blood on the cloth first, and then image it, as the Shroud bloodly areas blocked image formation. Or put something else there and then blood later. Maybe you could pickup a manikin/mannequin on ebay. But then you’d have to figure out how the forger got linen cloth that looks like a 1st century Syrian textile, while there is only one example of similar linen from the middle ages known to science. And how he could pay for such a cloth as it would be worth a fortune – and cost more than what he might get for selling the shroud. You know what, nevermind, just enjoy your retirement from the Shroud. It was tiring just thinking of these few angles to a shroud production..","date":"2015-09-08","mins":"10:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/03/colin-berrys-latest-and-greatest-is-it-enough/","cat":"3d","title":"Colin Berry’s Latest and Greatest.

Ok, you think it’s a fake, we get that. A lot of others do too but their research is readable and clear. I have yet to make it through one of your posts, because the tone is so annoying. It’s like you’re some over intelligent teenage girl trapped in what was once a scientist’s body. You’ve made some valid contributions, like where talked about light scorches do not have to fluoresce, Good Work (and to Farey of course)! If you had left out all the back biting and tone you would have been a valuable member of the team trying to figure out this Shroud thing. Enjoy your retirement from ‘Shroudology’ and please be careful around those big stones!.","date":"2015-09-07","mins":"8:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/03/colin-berrys-latest-and-greatest-is-it-enough/","cat":"3d","title":"Colin Berry’s Latest and Greatest.
