Ray Rogers showed quite well that he could achieved a good coloring result with ammonia (as good as ENEA and even more when you consider that he, and not ENEA, have done his experiment on a proper linen sample prepared the old fashion way). So, we just cannot ruled out that the Shroud images could have been formed by a natural process. In the present state of our knowledge, we just can’t. Pretending the contrary would demonstrate a very closed mind. Here’s another scenario : In order to produced a relic, some medieval guy could have taken a human being that look like the Jesus of the Icons, beat him, scourged him and crucified him. Then he could have put him into a burial linen shroud and after some time, remove his body and an imprint could have been left on his Shroud in some natural way that we cannot fully explain today. I know this scenario is very unlikely. I know that if this is true, we’re not even able to explain the high quality of the blood stains on the cloth (that give the impression that the body has simply disappeared). I know that full well ! And personally, I don’t believe this scenario is the best we have. In fact, I think this scenario have something like 0.1% of chances to be true. BUT WE JUST CANNOT DISCARD IT COMPLETELY FOR THE MOMENT. That’s the proper scientific way to see this question. I think Ron once said that we deal here with probabilities. Exactly right. So, in the law of probability, what is more likely ? The scenario I just describe or the or the Hollywood scenario that shows that the body of Jesus has emited a UV light (and nothing else) at the time of the resurrection ? If we stay honest, I really don’t think one or the other reach very high on a probability scale… And I think there’s place for some middle ground here. But what I tried here to state is that the ENEA study cannot PROVED that the Shroud images were not made naturally during the Middle Ages. In the present state of our knowledge, it just can’t. Not until ALL the natural hypothesis of image formation will be completely ruled out.

When I read his comment that his experiment will open a new theological and philosophical debate, I could saw the bias right there and the main purpose of his experiment jumped in my face !

There are some pro Shroud researchers that we can’t, under any circumstances, criticize for the way they perform their science. I don’t need to mention any names. Let’s call them « Sacred cows of sindonology ». We all know who they are. This kind of sham really leaves a very bad taste in my mouth and I really believe this is doing a great damage for the credibility of sindonology. 2 The researchers who step out of their fields of expertise. This is maybe the biggest problem right now. All I see is people doing researches in a field for which they have no expertise, while often pretending being able to do « good science » in that field. The case of Thibault Heimburger is a perfect example of this. He’s a doctor and, very strangely, the only field of research relate to sindonology I never saw him perform any work is precisely all the things related to the biological aspect of the Shroud, including the whole question of the blood and serum stains… This is just an example among a ton of other cases and, to me, this real problem of people stepping out of their field of expertise is the worst when it comes to the credibility of sindonology. One last thing : On another completely different subject, I would like to share with you a great quote from from a great philosopher from here in Québec named Placide Gaboury, who died in 2012, and who was a Jesuit (he drop out of this Order in the 80s because he, like me, wanted to follow is consciousness through spirituality more than man made dogmas and rituals) : “Because emotional and irrational impulses are hidden behind beliefs, they easily escape criticism, thus constituting a fertile ground for credulity, and from there, to intolerance versus everything that is different and threatening.” I agree 100% with him about that and the history of religions (including Catholicism with examples such as inquisition, excommunication, crusades, etc.) is there to prove it. And I think you can agree easily with me that it is also very often the same thing in the Shroud world (and particularly on your blog), with all the wars that rages on, mainly because emotionalism linked with certain beliefs (a belief in the authenticity or not of the relic and also a belief in the idea that the image is a proof of the resurrection or not) is too high.

That’s my feeling….","date":"2011-07-25","mins":"1:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/more-on-crazy-talk-are-atheists-biased-or-just-uninformed/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on Crazy Talk: Are Atheists biased or just uninformed?"},{"id":"comment-3382","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Hello Nick ! First of all, I want to say that your comments are really interesting and I love to exchange my ideas with you ! You said “the best possible explanation”. I prefer that than the word “proof” ! And you know why ? Because that leave the door open for others explanations !!! Let’s stay scientific for a minute, would you ? I don’t think science will EVER be able to prove that the Shroud is really Jesus burial cloth and also, science will NEVER say that there is an absolute proof of the resurrection on this cloth. The only thing science can do his to prove or refute that this Shroud is a real gravecloth of someone who’ve been tortured and died pretty much like the Gospels says about Christ. These days, we have a lot of scientific facts and circumstantial proofs that this cloth is a real Shroud of someone who looked like Jesus. But, mainly because of the 1988 carbon dating and the refutation made by Ray Rogers in 2005, science today can’t say for sure when exactly this cloth was woven. There are some elements, like the very particular sewing found by Machtild Flury Lemberg in 2002 and the aragonite dust from the feet, who tend to say it is from the first century and/or it came from Palestine. But, scientifically, those elements are just some clues and they’re not absolute proofs. Of course, if another C14 dating (with many samples taken from various parts of the cloth) gave us a first century date with a strong confidence, then at this moment, science will be free to state that this is a real shroud from the first century and it is possible (or probable), after all, that it is the authentic shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. But science is not there yet. And that would be as far as science could go… On the question of the Shroud being the real shroud of Jesus, one day, science could say “it is possible” or “it is probable” but nothing more than that. Science will NEVER be able to say clearly “it is proven”. As for the supposed proof of the resurrection on the Shroud, this goes over what science can claim. By essence, resurrection was a SPIRITUAL event and this is not the kind of event that science can study and reproduce in laboratories. Keeping that in mind, science could never go beyond saying “we can’t fully explain the image yet.” And don’t forget that it is not because science today can’t explain something that this thing was caused by a miracle event ! Regarding the Shroud, people often tend to forget this important fact… As I say, with faith, we can see a SIGN of the resurrection on the Shroud because there was a crucified man under this cloth who was tortured and died like Jesus and the body left the cloth without any visible and tangible signs of this disappearance (specially regarding the state of the blood stains). Till this day, science isn’t able to fully explain why the blood stains are in so good condition for a gravecloth who once envelop a corpse (we are pretty sure of this now) for a short time and after this time (less than 48 hours), this corpse left the cloth and didn’t corrupt there (another pretty sure fact : there’s no signs of putrefaction on the cloth). But the unusual state of the blood stains on this gravecloth will never be an absolute proof of the resurrection… We need FAITH to see this sign ! I see it… And you ? And if we’re tempted to use the mysterious body image as a proof of the resurrection, it’s a premature thing in my mind because science didn’t fully test and analyze all the possible natural explanations (even if some of them were cast out long ago). Here, I think mainly about the Maillard reaction that wasn’t tested completely by Ray Rogers (in my opinion, more testing should be done with real dead bodies) and also the Volckringer pattern who wasn’t analyzed that much over the years and who can account, theoretically, for some of the weirdest properties of the image, like the 3 D properties. Alan Mills, a scientist from England, wrote an interesting paper about this hypothesis but he wasn’t able to test it in a laboratory and nobody did it since. John De Salvo wrote also about this hypothesis and, like Mills, he never manage to test it. So, again, if we want to stay scientifically credible, we have to wait until ALL the possible natural explanations will be rejected by science and then (only then) we can start to think about a supernatural event as an explanation for this image. IT IS NOT THE CASE YET !!! In fact, we’re still far from this moment… So, let’s stay prudent regarding the possible cause for the body imprint… And please, never forget this : NATURE CAN BE REALLY SURPRISING SOMETIMES ! One of the best proof of this his the paper written by Frederick Zugibe about the Jospine Matress cover image of a man who died in England ! You can read it here : http://shroud.com/pdfs/mattress.pdf This case was not a fraud and it proves that nature is sometime really surprising ! Ok, I admit the body imprint is not of the same exact nature than what is seen on the Shroud but, nevertheless, it proves one thing : We never know what nature can produce ! Since science don’t know fully all the material world, we have to be really prudent regarding the body image on the Shroud… Another important and too often ignored aspect of the Shroud his this : There’s a lot of VARIABLES regarding it that science is not sure yet, like : 1 What was the exact position of the body versus the exact position of the cloth who draped it ? 2 Did the cloth was tied around the body with linen strips or not ? 3 Was there some presence of Myhre, Aloes, spices and/or other products near the body in the tomb and, if there was, in which quantities ? 4 What was the exact temperature, the exact air pressure and the exact humidity level inside the tomb ? 5 How many hours exactly did the shroud was draped over the body ? 6 What is the exact list of chemical products that were left on the top of the linen fibers during the making process ? 7 How fast a tortured and crucified corpse emit gases after death and in which quantities ? Etc, etc. Because of these unknown data, it is really hard to test properly every natural hypothesis… There’s so many facts we will never know for sure ! So, when you don’t know precisely all the starting parameters, how can you test an hypothesis properly ??? I think it’s one major reason why science wasn’t able yet to duplicate and explain this image… And, because there’s so many things we still don’t know about the Shroud, I fully agree with the prudent attitude of my catholic Church ! You can bet one thing : The Church will never used this Shroud as a banner for converting masses of unbelievers ! Faith is not based on scientific proofs and never will. If we could prove our faith, then faith would not be faith no more ! Jesus said it well when he said to the doubting Thomas : Blessed are those who believe without seeing ! This saying of the risen Christ is very important when we reflect about the Shroud. And I think Christ would say this to Dawkins and Al. : “This generation calls for a sign, but the only sign they will get is the sign of Jonas !” (Matthew, chapter 12). And, who know ? Maybe the Shroud is precisely THE SIGN OF JONAS for this generation of materialists and rationalists ! But, don’t forget it is a sign, not a proof ! One thing’s for sure : this cloth is not and never will be a faith dogma. And since science still cannot tell us without any doubts that this cloth is the authentic shroud of Jesus, the Church cannot use it as a main tool for conversion. Imagine if the Church was trying to convert people with this cloth and then, science would show us an absolute proof that it cannot be Christ shroud !!! What do you think people would say ??? The Church is too bright to do this kind of mistake. God doesn’t impose faith to us. Faith is mainly a free choice and God respect every person and their decisions… That’s why the Church mainly use the Shroud as an ICON of the suffering and death of Christ (and as a tool for evangelization like other icons) and, to me, that’s the main function of this cloth… It’s a very good tool to reflect on the Passion, death and resurrection of Christ. It can also be a sign of the resurrection of Christ (like the empty tomb and some other signs) but we can’t talk about a proof of it, in a scientific way. Anyway, the best proof of the resurrection of Christ is this one : You and I still believe in this incredible event some 2000 years after Jesus died on the cross !!! The Church is still here after 2000 years and after a lot of persecutions. That’s the main proof to me that this event wasn’t a joke ! People would never be willing to die for a fraudulent event ! The first Christian martyrs are the best testimony we can find about the reality of the resurrection of Christ. And in your specific case, I think the Shroud was used by the Holly Spirit (who used everything he can !) to leads you to faith in Christ. And I’m glad for you it was the case ! I don’t know you but I’m pretty sure you needed something like the Shroud to start your faith journey… And I’m sure you’re not the only one (maybe some of your friend will take the same road than yours !). I’m pretty sure that’s why the Church, even if it doesn’t used the Shroud for conversion and never claim this is the authentic Shroud of Christ, nor that it is the absolute proof of the risen Christ, still show this cloth periodically because it can affect people and made them think about Christ and what he did for us. God Bless You Nick and I made this wish for you and your faith : I hope one day you won’t need the Shroud no more to fully believe in Jesus Christ ! Your faith will be so strong that you will look at the Shroud with a smile and say : this Shroud was just a turning point on my trip to Heaven !!! It was important for me but now, Jesus Christ is more important than this cloth. And when you wrote : “I’d probably remain a Christian”, I think it’s a very good sign that you’re walking in this direction ! And I’m sure of one thing : The Shroud, unlike Jesus, will not be with us in the Father’s Kingdom… It is a material object who, unlike everyone of us, is condemn to stay in the material world ! So, it’s not so important, after all !!! Yannick P.S. : When you said “Are we not called to evangelize all nations?”, my point of view on this subject is not the same as many Christian. I think the best way to evangelize the world is not with the Shroud or anything like that. It’s not even with what we say (preaching). Instead, I firmly think it’s the quality of our faith in Jesus and the quality of our relationship with him (mainly through spiritual prayer) who is the best tool to evangelize the world. And the best power someone have to change the world his to let God change his own life ! Believe it or not, I think it’s true !.","date":"2011-07-22","mins":"10:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/more-on-crazy-talk-are-atheists-biased-or-just-uninformed/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on Crazy Talk: Are Atheists biased or just uninformed?"},{"id":"comment-3419","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Having said what I just said, I want to add something terribly important : Even if the debate won’t possibly ever be settle, science MUST keep on the research on this intriguing cloth.

Of course, with the eyes of faith, you can use the term “evidence of the Resurrection” when you consider, for example, the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains. Barbet did it too. But personally, I prefer to use the term “sign” in that case because no profesionnal and honest scientist would conclude that the vanishing of the body from inside the shroud is the only sure way to obtain such a result. There will always be some space for other more “rational” explanations like this one : It is possible to imagine that the body was extracted from the Shroud while the blood clots were still very humid and that would account for the fact that there not seem to be broken fibers in the bloodstains area and the bloodstains don’t look to have been disturbed. Of course, such a rational explanation is somehow contradict by the most probable fact that the body must have stayed inside the cloth for at least 24 hours (that was Vignon estimation) in order to get a natural formation of the body image on the surface of the cloth, but who can be totally certain about that since we’re still unsure of the correct image formation process ? So, in the case of the Shroud, I really prefer the term “sign of the Resurrection” because it refers to the faith you have in that event and avoid, at the same time, to make believe that there can be some sure scientific proof of that event on the cloth, which will never be the case I’m affraid..","date":"2013-05-07","mins":"8:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33103","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Seriously, I don’t think many people on the planet believe in Jesus because of the Shroud.

I said it before on this blog, if the Shroud would be proven to be genuine one day, the vast majority of atheists in the world would only say something like this : « Well, this only one more piece of evidence (along with the solid evidence coming from ancient written sources) of the reality of the existence of the historical Jesus and nothing else! » For most of them, a proof of authenticity for the Shroud would only be seen as an archaeological piece of evidence for the existence of Jesus of Nazareth and never as a proof of his divinity or of his Resurrection (I must add : as it should be).

Maybe it could have some impact on some of them (or, more probably, on some agnostics who are seeking truth) but that’s it.

As I said in my message to you: “the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the Shroud’s image area CAN be explained by a stochastic event of coloration because such an event will always produced a uneven, non homogenuous and unpredictable result, just like we see in the image area!” And remember that if the image’s origin comes from a stochastic event of coloration, such an event would have been very mild with a weak release of energy and probably happening at normal temperature, which are things that are truly consistent with the known data from the Shroud… You also said: “Just read your article, you simply don’t mention heterogeneity of fibers but the source of energy as the origin of the “stochastic process”.” I know this and that’s why I wrote all the recent comments, which are trying to explain in some details what I call “an extended version” of the image formation hypothesis we described in our MAA paper. Note also that I clearly mentioned that I am planning to write a new paper with Fazio and Mandaglio (if they agree to do that) in which we would describe this new “extended” version of our hypothesis in more details… Final note: This extended scenario is something I had in mind since last summer but it’s only when I read the recent comment made by Thibault that I thought it was time I talk about it publicly.

I’m still not ready to throw his hypothesis, in the form he described it, to the garbage. It’s just that I think a stochastic event of coloration is something that, in regard of all the known data, is truly possible (and which could have involved the same postmortem gases than Rogers thought). I also think Rogers should have been more precise concerning the thin layer of carbohydrate impurities as the sole image chromophore by insisting on the probable fact that such a thin layer could have been uneven on the surface of the cloth’s top most fibers and that such a probable fact could have played a huge role in the formation of the body image and its particular characteristics, especially when it comes to the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area. Note that this is the kind of precision that is not particularly clear in Rogers’ writings. In sum, here’s my opinion on this subject: We got a stochastic kind of result in the image area when it comes to the colored fibers distribution. What can explain this very particular and important observation? For me, there are 3 possibilities: 1 The nature of the chromophore. In this case, I tend to highly favored the hypothesis of a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities well over the PCW hypothesis because I believe it can offer, on the contrary to the PCW hypothesis, a possible and rational explanation for both the very tiny thickness of the image and its discontinuous distribution. 2 The nature of the image formation process. In this case, I tend to favored the hypothesis of Fazio and Mandaglio over the one of Rogers, as both Italians proposed that the image is the result of an event that involved a so tiny amount of energy that it wasn’t able to colored all the fibers that became in contact with this weak energy. 3 A combination of the first two possibilities, which is something that, to my knowledge, I’m the very first to propose… In other words, in order to explain the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area, Rogers proposed (not very clearly) that a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities was more or less coating the top most fibers of the cloth (in a uneven and non homogeneous way) and that such a thin and uneven layer of impurities was the only thing that became colored in order to form the body image. Fazio and Mandaglio, on the other hand, proposed that such a discontinuous distribution could be explained, not because of the particular nature of the chromophore, but because of the particularly weak nature of the energy that was at the origin of the formation of the body image. And after a long reflection about this complicated issue, I personally came to the conclusion that we must consider the possibility that not only the particular nature of the chromophore could have played a huge role in the image formation and in the resulting characteristics of this image (especially when it comes to the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area) BUT ALSO that the particular nature of the image formation event (namely a very weak release of biological energy, which was not strong enough to be able to color all the coated fibers on the cloth’s surface) could have played a complementary role in the image formation and in the resulting characteristics of this image. But I repeat that even if I propose a third hypothesis in an effort to explain the image formation and its very particular characteristics, I’m not ready yet to totally reject the other two proposal I mentioned above, in the form they were described by Rogers and the Fazio Mandaglio tandem, which is different than you when it comes to Fazio and Mandaglio’s hypothesis….","date":"2014-06-22","mins":"6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us"},{"id":"comment-131794","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Rogers would not have agreed with them about that?

The quote you refer to is a quote that comes directly from one of Fazio and Mandaglio’s paper and when I wrote it on the blog, I was only trying to back up my own conclusion that the image formation was very mild (which is a conclusion that fits with Fazio and Mandaglio’s original proposal as well as it fits with my “alternative” hypothesis involving a thin and uneven layer of impurities that would have taken a huge role in the image formation… At that moment, it was easier for me to take such a quote from authentic experts in radiation like Fazio and Mandaglio in order to back up my idea that the image formation process was surely very mild than trying to describe the alternative scenario I recently proposed on this blog and which I was only starting to build up in my head back then! Such an alternative hypothesis is not something that you can describe easily in one or two days… I takes time to evaluate all the possibilities. At that moment (september of last year), my alternative scenario was just in a embryonic state. Last thing: You wrote: “No, the source of energy is not responsible for a stochastic process.” Again, how can you know this? If the source of energy was really mild and weak, how can you be sure that such a low energy release would not have started a stochastic event of coloration in the PCW or, more likely, in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that would have been coating most of the top most fibers of the cloth (most probably in a non homogeneous and uneven manner)?.","date":"2014-06-20","mins":"3:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us"},{"id":"comment-131266","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Who talks about 3 stochastic events?

Here’s what he told me by email: We have already studied the interaction between alpha particles and linen and I send you the article that has been published in Italian language. In this article,, we have deduced the I(z) correlation when alpha particles of about 6 Me V energy emitted by human body collide with a linen that envelopes his corpse. The above kinetic energy is sufficient to penetrate the cloth for 20 30 µm. This result is visible in Fig. 2 (full line: Jackson fit; dotted line: alpha particle fit). As you can see, the fit of the known experimental intensity of the image data (13 values) in the alpha case was compared with the Jackson one, by using both the correlation coefficient squared r2 and reduced χ2. Our estimations of reduced χ2 and r2 were 0.55 and 0.49, respectively; while the Jackson’s ones were 0.53 and 0.58, respectively (see Table 1). Consequently, the I(z) correlation obtained for alpha particles (see Fig. 2) was very good. However, we have rejected this hypothesis because the alpha can not distinguish the fibril that must be yellowed from the other that must retain the background color. Indeed, the agreement with the characteristics of the body image is only on the macroscopic level because the above particles would strike and to yellow all the fibrils. So, we will have a continue distribution of optical density value, while on the Shroud this parameter has ONLY TWO VALUES. This occurs also if we consider proton, deuteron , 3 H and 3 He.

Personally, I tend to favored the 4th scenario (which was first proposed by John De Salvo during the 80s), while I am not willing to close the door to any of the other 3 possible scenarios, no more than I am not willing to close the door to the possibility that more than one of these scenarios could have been active together at the time of the image formation. And as we state in our conclusion: “Knowing the nature of the stochastic effects, we cannot discriminate with certainty the process (or the processes) that has (or have) triggered the formation of a body image on the Shroud. Indeed, the four mechanisms described above (including the one described by Rogers and Arnoldi, which do not propose that a stochastic event happened during the image formation) could be, in theory, able to gradually yellow a number of fibrils proportional to the absorbed energy over a few years or decades.” Taking this fact into account, you will understand that the answer to your question is not easy at all and would definately need a lot of testing on old linen samples under proper lab control… We also mention this: “Finally, it is still possible to think that other natural mechanisms that have never been proposed yet could be able to yield the kind of stochastic distribution of yellowed fibrils we see in the image area on the Shroud. If someone proposes a natural mechanism of this nature in the future, this could be added in the list of potential sources for the Shroud body image formation. For this reason, this paper does not solve the question. On the contrary, it offers to the Scientific Community, involved in the study of the Shroud of Turin a good reason to pursue further investigations, which could include coloring tests on linen samples that would be made with a known ancient method of manufacturing linen cloths.” If this is not an honest and scientific way to see the reality of the image formation issue, I don’t know what it is….","date":"2014-06-20","mins":"3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/18/catching-up-yannick-to-hugh-anoxie-and-all-of-us/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Catching Up:  Yannick to Hugh, Anoxie and All of Us"},{"id":"comment-131271","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Good enough for me means simply that I agree to consider something as a fact when two experts gets to the same conclusion while working independently of each other.

In his comment, he asked me to find him one proof to support Rogers claim that the color on the Shroud reside on a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the linen fibers. I think Thibault should remember one important evidence mentioned by Rogers in his writings, and you can find it at point #17 in the paper I wrote about the quotes of Ray Rogers concerning the chromophore of the image. Here it is again : 17 A search for carbohydrate impurities on the Shroud CONFIRMED Mc Crone’s detection of some starch fractions. Starch and low molecular weight carbohydrates from crude startch would color MUCH MORE EASILY than would cellulose as a result of either thermal dehydration or chemical reactions. The hypothesis on carbohydrates impurities is SUPPORTED by observations of TRACES OF SOME STARCH FRACTIONS ON IMAGE FIBERS. I think this is a very strong evidence that there really is some carbohydrates impurities on top of the linen fibers of the Shroud !!! Note that those starch fractions were first discovered by Walter Mc Crone and then INDEPENDENTLY confirmed by Ray Rogers ! So, I don’t think anyone can really argue against this evidence ! Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it was those starch fractions (along with maybe other sorts of carbohydrates impurities) that were colored by the image formation process. But we have to say that this finding STRONGLY suggest it ! One things for sure, this finding PROVE that there really is some carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers. The question that still wait to be fully proven is this : Did it really was those carbohydrates impurities that were colored during the image formation process ? I think the odds are strong in favor of a “yes” ! Remember what Rogers said in point #17 : “Starch and low molecular weight carbohydrates from crude startch would color MUCH MORE EASILY than would cellulose as a result of either thermal dehydration or chemical reactions.” And here, we have to think that Rogers had the whole fiber in mind (including the primary cell wall) when he said “would color much more easily than would cellulose.” Remember what I said in my paper on this subject ? I think it’s pretty evident that when Rogers was using the term “cellulose” in his writing, what he really meant was “the whole fiber”, including the primary cell wall. Since this primary cell wall is only PARTIALLY composed of carbohydrates that would color more easily than cellulose itself (like hemicellulose and pection), I think Rogers conclusion his correct : a thin layer TOTALLY composed of reactive carbohydrates can be colored MUCH MORE EASILY than a linen fiber, including his most external layer (i.e. The primary cell wall). That’s the way I understand Ray Rogers reflection on this subject. So, when you consider my own interpretation of Ray Rogers words (I can be wrong but I really don’t think so), I think it’s easy to conclude that if there is a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers (and we can say now that it’s a FACT), then it’s pretty sure that this layer was colored during the image formation process !!! But, even if my interpretation is correct about that, I think it’s fair to say that there still a question that his left open : Did those carbohydrates impurities were the only elements colored during the image formation process or did this process also affect the primary cell wall of the linen fibers ? The more I reflect on the question of the image chromophore, the more I realise that this is THE QUESTION that still wait to be scientifically answered ! I think the odds that there were absolutely no carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers that were colored during the image formation process are EXTREMELY LOW, in regard of all the facts and observations we have concerning the Shroud. Of course, there’s still the question of the exact composition of this thin layer of impurities that is still left open (because there can be more than some starch fractions there), but that’s secondary in my mind. What is the most important question is this : Along with a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers, did the primary cell wall of the fibers (partially composed of other carbohydrates) was also colored during the image formation process ? THAT’S THE IMPORTANT QUESTION ! Finding the correct answer to this question could be a very big step in order to finally resolve the mystery of the image formation that took place on the Shroud… If it’s just a thin layer of impurities that was colored without affecting the primary cell wall itself, like Rogers thought, then it would be very hard for those who proposed any energetic radition hypothesis to defend properly their hypothesis. But if the primary cell wall was colored also during the image formation process, that would open the door much wider for those defenders of a supernatural phenomenon. You can easily see the importance of finding the correct answer to this question ! Unfortunately, in the present state of our knowledge about the Shroud, I think it’s fair to say that this question is still left open… MORE DIRECT CHEMICAL ANALYSIS NEED TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE (along with a close examination of the high resolution images that were taken during the 2002 restoration) !!! Without those new analyses, it will always be impossible to answer this important question properly (with a correct degree of scientific certainty). Nevertheless, Rogers arguments concerning the diimide, the ghosts, the banding effect and the extreme superficiality are strong enough to suggest that it was just a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities (residing on top of the fibers) that were colored on the Shroud and nothing else. That’s why I still think Rogers hypothesis is the best we have right now in order to explain the body image on the Shroud. I think this hypothesis just wait to be scientificaly confirmed completely… That’s were I defer with Thibault’s opinion ! At least, he’s honest enough to not reject the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the image chromophore and, for this reason, I truly respect his judgement. I don’t think I can say the same concerning those who have signed the list of M. Rolfe ! P.S. : Isn’t ironic ? If it can be proved one day that what was colored on the Shroud is really a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities, then that would mean that the first researcher that will have contribute to this great discovery is man by the name of WALTER Mc CRONE !!! Effectively, he’s the first one ever to have reported the presence of some starch on image fibers from the Shroud !!! It was only later that Ray Rogers confirmed his finding. HOW ABOUT THAT ? That would be what I call “another big irony of the history”… : ).","date":"2012-05-13","mins":"5:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-131788","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Hugh, as a proof of what I mentioned yesterday, here’s two quotes from the paper written by Miller and Pellicori of STURP concerning their analysis of the dorsal – calf areas of right and left leg : 1 “On the right leg, the scourges appear to be off the body image area.” 2 “At the expected knee joint, there is no body image apparent and limited scourging.” Considering these two important observations, along with the presence of some more bloodstains that are off the body image (like the one that is off the right elbow), I think it’s impossible for anyone here to completely discard my hypothesis of some very temporary contacts that could have happened between the moistened blood clots of the Shroud man’s corpse and the cloth during a possible transfer of the enshrouded body from a central place inside the tomb to a stone bench carved in one of the walls of the tomb.

All this would most probably leave a different quantity of impurities all over the cloth (this could be also one of the main reason that we see a banding effect on the cloth). It’s impossible to think that a natural phenomenon like the one of evaporation concentration and that a bleaching done differently from one batch of yarn to another could leave the same amount of impurities on every single yarn of the cloth ! And if it is those impurities that were colored, that would explain (maybe) that the image formation was non isotropic. As I say, I’m not an expert about isotropic images, but I think the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the chromophore can explain it because it seems to fit very well with what we know about the Shroud and I think it is another good reason to favor this hypothesis of Ray Rogers… I would really like to know the point of view of M. Schneider about that. And about the other thing you said : “whether it is originated at the impurities layer or at the outermost fibers the image is basically the result of natural chemical reaction.” This is not what the fans of supernatural hypothesis seem to think (many of those defend the primary cell wall hypothesis by the way). Effectively, in Rogers opinion, if the color come from a dehydration oxydation process concerning a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers, then it would be VERY HARD to defend any hypothesis involving any kind of radiation (whether it’s the UV lasers of Di Lazzaro, the Corona discharge of Fanti or the protons of Rinaudo). Why ? Simply because each one of these mechanism MUST penetrate the linen fiber (even if it’s just superficially) to cause an image ! This principle don’t fit very well with the idea that it was a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers that was colored ! For me, that can explain easily why Fanti and others favored the hypothesis of the primary cell wall. It’s simply because if this hypothesis is true, then their supernatural hypotheses would be much more easy to defend ! Do you understand now what is at the heart of the debate ??? That’s why this question of the chromophore is so important.

But I don’t understand why the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the layer of impurities can be harder to explain this 3 D effect than the primary cell wall. It’s true that there is a discontinuity in the colored fibers on the Shroud and that one colored fiber can be next to an uncolored fiber. But that discontinuity is as much hard to understand in the case the primary cell wall would be the chromophore of the image ! In fact, I even have a tendency to think that it would be even more “natural” to have a discontinuity of the impurities on top of each thread. I’m not an expert like Rogers on this question and I don’t remember if he talked specifically about that… But, in my mind, since the impurities would have been put on top of the fibers by 2 natural mechanisms, i.e. The bleaching and the evaporation concentration process after the final washing of the cloth, I don’t think those natural processes would have affected each one of the fibers the same way. In other word, I think it would be normal to expect that some natural processes like that would leave impurities on top of a fiber and none or almost none on top of the next fiber, creating a non homogeneous layer of impurities on top of the fibers. In this context, I think we can expect that it was ONLY the fibers with enough impurities on top of them that COULD HAVE BEEN COLORED. In other words, there was a minimum quantity of impurities that was needed in order to create a coloration that we could see. If the next fiber didn’t have this minimum quantity, no coloration would have been formed. I think this idea is pretty interesting and I hope you understand my thinking. I would like to hear the opinion of an expert about that particular question. On the other hand, if we think that every fiber must contain roughly the same amount of carbohydrates in their primary cell wall, I think it would be VERY HARD to explain why a fiber would have react to form a coloration, while the next one would not ! You understand what I mean ? The hypothesis of Rogers seem to fit more nicely with the discontinuity of the coloration since it is pretty evident in my mind that an impurity layer COULD NOT have been homogeneous on top of the fibers, since this layer was formed NATURALLY. I think it’s safe to think that there was more impurities on some fibers and less on some other, while it is highly unlikely that there was a noticeable difference in the quantity of carbohydrates present in each primary cell wall of the linen fibers. In that context, if we think the primary cell wall is the answer, then why there is a discontinuity in the coloration on the Shroud ? Can a bleaching of the fiber can extract more or less carbohydrates from the primary cell wall and have the effect that the amount of carbohydrates would then be different from one fiber to the next one ? I don’t think this idea is really credible, but, since I’m no expert, I’ll leave this question open. One thing’s for sure : the discontinuity of the coloration on the Shroud, no matter the color reside on a thin layer of impurities or in the primary cell wall, is one of the most difficult aspect of the Shroud to understand. But, because of what I said earlier in this message, I don’t think the impurity layer hypothesis is harder to defend versus that particularity of the coloration. In fact, I think it’s the opposite !

Of course, as you said, all this is theoretically for the moment… I personally think that, to achieve naturally the precision of the image on the Shroud, it must have needed a very particular and favorable condition inside the tomb and around the body. It seems almost impossible for a lot of people but not for me. As I often say : NATURE CAN REALLY BE SURPRISING FROM TIME TO TIME !!! What I suspect about the Shroud is that the image was created because all the necessary conditions were reunite inside the tomb and inside the shroud. That’s why I don’t think this kind of perfect image can be achieve with any dead body and any burial shroud. No, on the contrary, I think it can only be achieve if very particular and favorable conditions (some of which still wait to be discovered, understood and described) can take place in one single place, at the same time… That’s my feeling and I think one of those conditions is that it take a body that suffered a lot before dying in order to produce all the biological elements needed for the correct image creation.

I just want you people to read again the comments that Thibault wrote here. What is the heart of his comment ? That it is presently scientifically impossible to fully confirmed one hypothesis about the chromophore of the image, whether it is the one who state that the color is found in the primary cell wall or the other who state that it is only a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities that was colored on top of the fibers. In fact, what Thibault said is this : In the present state of our knowledge about the Shroud, we MUST considered those 2 hypotheses on the same level. In other words, for him, those 2 hypotheses represent 2 interesting options to explain the chromophore of the image and that those 2 options possessed roughly the same level of credibility because both COULD explain all the observations and facts we know about the body image. If the paper of 2010 would had said something like that, I would have absolutely no problem at all with it !!! BUT… It’s not the case ! When you read this paper, you can easily see that it push forward the first hypothesis (the one concerning the primary cell wall), while, at the same time, trying very hard to put the doubt over the hypothesis of Rogers (the one concerning the impurities). That’s not at all the same thing than Thibault said here !!! And, because this paper is clearly an attempt to push the primary cell wall hypothesis and almost tried, at the same time, to discredit Rogers hypothesis, than I consider it as infamous. The term is maybe hard but what I really mean is that what is found in this paper concerning the chromophore of the image is NOT honest, scientifically speaking. Thibault’s comments here are honest, but I’m sorry, not his 2010 paper. And because this paper pushed so hard the issue in favor of the primary cell wall hypothesis, it is clearly an attempt to comfort the hypothesis of Fanti about the image formation process, i.e. The corona discharge (because an electric discharge like that can color just the primary cell wall of a fiber, just like UV light also can). That’s why I wanted to denunciate this paper with a loud voice. That’s all. I hope you understand better my comments about this paper now. It’s just not fair to favours more an hypothesis while putting great doubts over the other. In the present state of our knowledge, we cannot do that and Thibault’s comments here just prove that it’s true !

Rogers as showed with good scientific arguments that his hypothesis CAN be correct regarding ALL the observations and facts concerning the body image on the Shroud. But I don’t think we can say the same thing concerning the other hypothesis involving the primary cell wall. In fact, I’ve NEVER seen one single scientific paper published by a real Shroud expert (who is also an expert in chemistry and microscopy) that do the same than Rogers did with his papers, i.e. To DEMONSTRATE that the hypothesis he defend CAN be applied to what we know about the body image on the Shroud. I still wait for a paper like that to be published in order to properly defend the hypothesis of the primary cell wall being the true chromophore of the image. I’ve never seen one so far. For the moment, I consider this hypothesis of the primary cell wall more like a personal opinion of some researchers than a real hypothesis that have been correctly DEMONSTRATE with solid scientific arguments, like it was done by Rogers for his own hypothesis. Sorry Thibault for having a different opinion that yours on the subject !!! ; ) In fact, we both agree that there is no way to be scientifically certain about the correct chromophore of the image but, where I defer from him, is because I favor Rogers hypothesis well before the one about the primary cell wall. But that just my opinion, based on a long reflection… Also, you have to know that Thibault Heimburger, a friend of mine, is one of the co author of the paper published in 2010 with Fanti, Di Lazzaro and some other members of the Shroud Science Group that pushed the issue of the primary cell wall. That’s why I’m not really surprised by the fact he put the hypothesis of the primary cell wall on the same level of credibility than the one of Rogers. As I said, that’s where I defer from him. On the general principle, I agree with him but I don’t think it is scientifically correct to think those 2 hypotheses have the same degree of credibility, because the hypothesis of the primary cell wall has never been studied (in regard of what we know about the body image on the Shroud) to the SAME in deep level as the hypothesis of Rogers… For example, can someone give me a solid and credible scientific explanation for the FACT that the ghost and the diimide leave a clean uncolored and undamaged fiber behind ? At first sight, that doesn’t seem to really fit with the idea that the primary cell wall would have been colored instead of a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers !!! If the color would be in the primary cell wall, then the ghosts would be composed mainly of a dehydrated and oxidized primary cell wall that surely would have left a DAMAGED fiber behind. You understand what I mean ? This is PURE LOGIC thinking ! If you take away the colored primary cell wall of a fiber, how in the world the resulting linen fiber can be considered undamaged ??? It just doesn’t seem to fit. And the reduction of the color with diimide, leaving an undamaged linen fiber behind, is also one of the main argument of Rogers (among many other) to show that the whole linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) WAS NOT colored at all during the image formation process, because the resulting fiber seem to be undamaged. Don’t you think that chemist experts like Rogers and Adler (also expert on the Shroud) would not have noticed the absence of the primary cell wall of the fibers after the use of diimide ? I just can’t imagine that ! For me, it’s pretty evident that experts like them would have note a significant change in the physical aspect of the resulting fibers. That’s just my opinion of course but I don’t think it’s idiot to think that way….","date":"2012-05-12","mins":"7:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-11347","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Rogers knew full well the existence of the primary cell wall and, when he analysed all the data concerning the body image, he never consider it as a valid option.

In other words, my intuition was most probably right ! I’m so glad I found those little quotes from Rogers because, now, the defenders of the primary cell wall hypothesis (who are often, at the same time, detractors of Rogers) will have much more difficulty to make believe that Rogers never thought about the primary cell wall as a potential chromophore for the image. First, I will give you one more time my personal interpretation : As I said in my recent paper, for me, when Rogers was using the word “cellulose” (like in the phrase “The cellulose WAS NOT INVOLVED in color production”), he was thinking about the whole linen fiber, including his primary cell wall. I made this interpretation without any clear reference to back it up, but nevertheless, I was almost sure of what I was saying. Now, I’m completely sure ! Here’s the first quote of Rogers that PROVE that I was right : “The image is not simply a result of changes in the CELLULOSE (LINEN).” You see ? For Rogers the two words “cellulose” and “linen” were synonymous ! So, when I said that we can change the word “cellulose” in Rogers writings for the word “the whole linen fiber”, I don’t think I’m wrong ! Again, this little quote from Rogers, found in page 31 of his book, is a proof of that. After having said that, Rogers goes on and say : “Pure cellulose is relatively hard to color by CHEMICAL MEANS, but many common impurities on cloth can be colored much more easily.” Here, I know the sceptics will emit one objection, saying that the term “pure cellulose” mean that Rogers wasn’t thinking about the primary cell wall but just the internal part of the fiber. But this interpretation is most probably false, simply because we know (see the 4 quotes I report in the last part of my recent paper) that Rogers knew full well the existence of this primary cell wall, along with his chemical structure and the way his components could react chemically. And more than this, I even found one quote in the book of Rogers (in page 18) where he clearly made a direct connexion between the words “pure cellulose” and “linen” (exact quote is : “pure cellulose (linen)”) ! So, in this context, the fact that Rogers associate directly the words “cellulose” and “linen” in this quote from page 31 of his book make it clear that when he was talking about “cellulose” in his writings, he was refeerring to “the whole linen fiber” in reality. And all the other quotes I’ve found concerning the term “pure cellulose” made it clear that, in Rogers writings, when he talked about it, he was meaning “pure linen fiber” in reality. The sceptics pretend that we would absolutely need a quote like “The primary cell wall was not involved in the image formation process” in order to be sure that Rogers had thought about the option of the primary cell wall in regard of the body image of the Shroud, but in reality, the quote I just discovered, when you link it with all the other quotes of Rogers concerning the chemical structure of the primary cell wall, make it very clear that this part of the linen fiber was never an option for him, even if he knew well about his components. And I also found another quote to back up this interpretation ! Here’s what you can read in page 109 of Rogers book : “The image can be chemically reduced with diimide leaving colorless CELLULOSE FIBERS. The color reside only on the surface of the fibers, and it is the result of conjugated double bounds. The underlying CELLULOSE (LINEN) FIBERS are not colored.” With this second quote that makes a direct link between “cellulose” and “linen fiber”, I don’t think we need further proof in order to realise that, for Rogers, the whole linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) was NEVER a valid option regarding the chromophore of the image ! I really think that those who have doubt that Rogers never knew or considered the primary cell wall as a possible chromophore of the image should really rethink the whole thing… In summary, those 2 particular quotes where Rogers clearly associate “cellulose” with “linen” or “linen fiber”, along with the FACT that he knew very well the existence of the primary cell wall, along with his chemical structure and the way his components could react chemically, is well enough to show that when he was using the term “cellulose”, in fact, he was refeering to the whole linen fiber (including the primary cell wall). This finding is VERY IMPORTANT because, for Rogers, this primary cell wall, even if he knew well his chemical structure and his properties, NEVER represented a viable option to explain the chromophore of the image on the Shroud. So, in order to understand better what Ray Rogers really had in mind, I give you again all the quotes that I’ve put in my recent paper where we found the word “cellulose” and I’ve changed it to “linen fiber” instead (in capital letters). You’ll see, everything become much more clear !!! Here’s the quotes (I’ve also add the 2 quotes I just discovered) : 1 The image is not simply a result of changes in the CELLULOSE (LINEN). Pure cellulose is relatively hard to color by chemical means, but many common impurities on cloth can be colored much more easily. 2 The medullas of colored image fibers are not colored. The LINEN FIBER was not involved in color production. The LINEN FIBER of the image had not changed as a result of image formation. 3 Heller and Adler found that the image fibers could be decolorized with diimide. Reduction left colorless, undamaged LINEN FIBERS behind. 4 The color reside only on the surface of the fibers, and it is the result of conjugated double bounds. The underlying CELLULOSE (LINEN) FIBERS are not colored. 5 Because chemical rates are exponential with temperature, the LINEN FIBER would react much more slowly than other carbohydrates. 6 The color is only on the outer surfaces of the image fibers. This suggest that the impurities were the result of cloth production methods and they should appear on all parts of the cloth. Until this time, we had assumed that the image color was a result of chemical changes in the LINEN FIBER. 7 The evidence is strong that the image is not a result of dehydration of the LINEN FIBER by any mechanism. 8 Since the LINEN FIBER was not colored, the impurities had to be significantly less stable. 9 The image spectra were essentialy identical to those of aged linen and light scorches. The structures of all forms of dehydrated carbohydrates would be very similar, containing complex systems of conjugated double carbon bonds. LINEN FIBER is not unique. Sugars and starches give the same types of dehydration/conjugation chemical structures. Identical colored structures are produced by low temperature reactions between reducing carbohydrates and amines, i.e., Maillard reactions. 10 A search for carbohydrate impurities on the Shroud confirmed Mc Crone’s detection of some starch fractions. Starch and low molecular weight carbohydrates from crude startch would color much more easily than would A LINEN FIBER as a result of either thermal dehydration or chemical reactions. The hypothesis on carbohydrates impurities is supported by observations of traces of some starch fractions on image fibers. 11 Any radiation that is energetic enough or suffisciently intense to to heat the cloth enough to cause the initial dehydration reactions of THE LINEN FIBER would penetrate into a fiber to a distance determined by its energy. I think, I demonstate here, quite clearly, that, IN RAY ROGERS OPINION, the whole linen fiber, including the primary cell wall that he knew very well, WAS NOT colored during the image formation process. If he never used specifically the words “primary cell wall” in his writings, it is because he never thought that this was necessary, since, up until that time, no one ever proposed this external part of the linen as the chromophore. Here, we also have to remember one VERY IMPORTANT FACT : the cellulose is one of the 3 principal components of the primary cell wall. In that context, isn’t that normal that Rogers used the general term “cellulose” in his writings, in order to include every part of the linen fiber, including the primary cell wall, in one single word ? I really think so ! Now, with those new quotes I just gave you, I think it is very clear that, in Rogers writings, the word “cellulose” was used as a synonymous of “whole linen fiber”, including the primary cell wall. Of course, that doesn’t mean his hypothesis was correct. But that means that Thibault Heimburger’s supposition that Rogers never thought about the option of the primary cell wall is most probably false… completely false ! On the contrary, the reality is this : Rogers knew this part of the linen fiber very well and all the observations and facts he knew about the image on the Shroud NEVER suggested him that the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) had been colored. Instead, what the corpus of data suggested him is that it was UNIQUELY a thin layer of carbohydrates residing ON TOP of the linen fibers that was colored, and nothing else. In the same sense that the under the bloodstains, we found a clear undamaged linen fiber, for Rogers, it is the same exact thing regarding the body image ! For him, under the colored impurities, we also found a clear undamaged linen fiber !!! In other words, for Rogers, the bloodstains AND the body images on the Shroud are both ADDITIONAL SUBSTANCES THAT ARE ONLY FOUND ON TOP OF THE LINEN FIBERS ! Isn’t that interesting ??? So, we can say that, if Rogers is right, all the images on the Shroud, whether it is the blood images or the body images, have NOT AFFECTED DIRECTLY THE LINEN FIBERS, including the primary cell wall !!! Now, after all the evidence I’ve found in the last days, if you’re still not convinced, then what do you think of this quote from Rogers : “The Shroud is nearly pure linen, but linen IS NOT PURE CELLULOSE like cotton.” Personal note : This new quote that I found this morning in page 54 of his book makes it very clear that he knew very well the exact chemical composition of a linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) ! Effectively, Rogers knew that a linen fiber, especially his primary cell wall, is not composed uniquely of cellulose. As we already seen, the primary cell wall is mainly composed of 3 different elements, i.e. Cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. On the other hand, the internal part of the linen fiber is mostly composed of cellulose. So, we can see the importance of this last quote because it’s another very good indicator that Rogers knew very well the exact chemical composition of a linen fiber, including the primary cell wall, but nevertheless, he NEVER CONSIDERED this external part of the fiber as being the real chromophore of the body image on the Shroud. Before I can conclude this long comment, I just want to say that I found the idea emit by Thibault Heimburger the other day, concerning the possibility that Rogers, even if he knew the existence of the primary cell wall, never thought about it as a possible chromophore of the image, highly unlikely. One of Rogers quotes that you can find in my recent paper clearly show that, not only, he knew well about the existence and the chemical structure of this part of the fiber, but also, he knew well about the fact that some elements of it are more reactive than the cellulose. So, I ask everybody the question : Keeping in mind the fact that Rogers knew all that was needed to be known about the primary cell wall in the context of the body image on the Shroud, do you really think for 2 seconds that he never considered the possibility that this primary cell wall could have been colored during the image formation process ??? After my exhaustive research in Rogers writings, I found this idea to be completely ludicrous, especially when you know how professional and perfectionist Rogers was when he did an investigation. Thinking that he could have neglected an evident possibility like that is ridiculous, really. It’s evident that he thought about it (how could he do otherwise ?), but nevertheless, he did not conclude that this part of the linen fiber, just like the rest of the fiber, was colored at all during the image formation process. Again, this fact don’t necessarily mean that Rogers hypothesis concerning the impurities is correct. But nevertheless, the fact that he never considered the primary cell wall as a valid option for the chromophore speak very loud, don’t you think ? To finish, I also want to get back on something important that was said by Thibault in his last comment. He said : “primary cell wall can explain…” Here, I have a very great doubt about that assertion ! In order to demonstrate that, I want to report one more time one important quote from Rogers : “Dehydration causes shrinkage; therefore, any coating of carbohydrate impurities would “CRAZE” during dehydration. Such a crazed coating would be easy to pull off with adhesive, explaining the EASY REMOVAL of tapes from image areas.” And elsewhere, Rogers also said : “…the surfaces (of the image fibers) appeared to be “CORRODED”. That observation suggests that a VERY THIN COATING OF CARBOHYDRATE had been significantly dehydrated on the OUTER SURFACES of the fibers.” Those are important facts and observations the body image, reported by Rogers. For him, those characteristics (i.e. The shrinkage, the crazing and the corroded aspect of the coloration) are all important aspects of the body image of the Shroud. Now, as I know, I’ve never seen ONE SCIENTIFIC PAPER published in a peer reviewed journal that can demonstrate that the primary cell wall of a linen fiber that would be submit to a dehydration oxydation process would produce those same characteristics and that the result would be that the colored fibers obtained that way could be removed much more easily with a sticky tape than non colored fibers. Also, I’ve never seen ONE SCIENTIFIC PAPER published in a peer reviewed journal that can demonstrate that if the primary cell wall of a linen fiber was colored with a dehydraton oxydation process, part of the colored material could be left in the sticky tape while the rest of the linen fiber would be taken out, creating ghosts of coloration like we see on the Shroud… I still wait to get some scientific confirmations of that. If that could be achieved under good laboratory control, then we could start to think that the primary cell wall hypothesis offer some good matches with what we know about the body image on the Shroud. But not before… A good example of that is the fact that I really don’t think M. Di Lazzaro did any test on his colored samples with sticky tapes, in order to see if he could find ghosts of colored material still stuck in the tapes, like it was seen in almost every sticky tape samples coming from the Shroud. I would really like it if M. Di Lazzaro could do some test in order to check out if his samples can really match this specific aspect of the body image of the Shroud !!!.","date":"2012-05-15","mins":"10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-11370","author":"yannick_clément","post":"In the very last part of my previous comment, I realized I’ve forget to give you the complete reference of what Thibault really said.

This was the heart of Thibault’s message, even if his commentary about Rogers human nature can easily being decode like he has more confidence in the pcw hypothesis. Note : When I say “THEIR hypothesis”, I talk about the few people from the SSG (Thibault being one of them) who signed the 2010 paper and who is the first paper (to my knowledge) to ever proposed the pcw as a possible chromophore for the image. I want to say that I don’t have a big problem with the heart of Thibault’s message (the one I just report here), even if, as I said, I consider Rogers hypothesis to have been much more explained and to have been scientifically demonstrate in a more convincing way than the other. But, in reality, the problem is elsewhere. THE REAL PROBLEM IS THIS : When you consider the heart of Thibault’s message here on the blog versus their 2010 paper, that’s NOT AT ALL the same thing ! Exactly ! The heart of Thibault’s message here is not at all what comes up in their 2010 paper !!! THAT’S THE MAIN PROBLEM AND I THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT TO CRITICIZE THIBAULT AND AL. FOR THIS PARTICULAR REASON. I’ll say it again, if this 2010 paper would have put the 2 hypotheses concerning the chromophore on the same exact level of credibility, I would have be okay with it. BUT THAT’S NOT THE CASE ! This paper of 2010 clearly support the pcw hypothesis OVER the hypothesis of Rogers ! That’s why I gave a tough critic to Thibault the other day. There’s a real gap between what he said here and what is the conclusion of their 2010 paper… And concerning the real appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of, at least, some persons who signed this 2010 paper, can I still emit some doubts ? When you know that both Fanti and Di Lazzaro were promoting supernatural hypothesis concerning energetic radiations (corona discharge and UV light) LONG BEFORE writing this 2010 paper, and that both hypothesis fits much better with the chromophore being the pcw instead of a thin layer of impurities, I think it is quite legitimate that I have some serious doubts about the impartiality of their 2010 paper !!! I think at least some questions should be raised concerning the appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of some people who signed this 2010 paper… And I’m not talking about Thibault here. To conclude my comment, here’s a message for Thibault : When you put your name on top of a published paper like that, I hope you’re ready to get some critics and questions over it… If you’re not, I think you should consider not signing any paper at all. When someone go publicly on a delicate subject like the chromophore of the image on the Shroud of Turin, I hope this person is ready to take some shots… So, I hope that will help to set the record straight… I am not angry over anyone (even if sometimes my tone can be interpreted that way), but I feel I have to right and even the duty to ask tough questions and emit tough critics about a paper when I feel that it is legitimate for me to do so. And in the case of this 2010 paper, I think there’s plenty of good reason for me to do so. I’m just someone passionate about the subject who seeks the truth and nothing else. And when I have some doubt over a paper and have a sense that this one have some appearance of a conflict of interest or have some bad approach, I don’t see why I should shut my mouth and don’t say a word ! We live in democracy no ? If my hard critic of the other day has offended Thibault, I’m sorry and I apologize to him. But I will not withdraw my words concerning their 2010 paper. Sorry. I just feel I have the democratic right to do so.

So, I don’t think that this fact concerning the vertical projection of the image from the body to the cloth can permit to completely reject the hypothesis of Rogers about the image formation. Of course, that doesn’t mean Rogers hypothesis is the correct one. That simply mean that Rogers was fully aware of this problematic (the vertical projection) and, nevertheless, for him, in some very particular conditions, it was possible to think that the body image could really have been formed by a gaseous diffusion.

In this context, it’s normal that Thibault wants to put the primary cell wall hypothesis on the same level than the hypothesis of Rogers ! He is stuck with that hypothesis, since he signed this paper that clearly did a great promotion of this hypothesis … Once you take a position like that by co writing a paper, it’s very hard to admit : I’ve made a mistake and I must change my mind… As I said, this paper did also a great self promotion of Fanti’s ideas ! It’s important to note that because the public is generally unaware of this apparent conflict of interest. When you understand that the corona discharge can only affect the primary cell wall of a linen fiber, it’s easy then to understand why Fanti push this issue so hard and why he don’t want to hear about Rogers hypothesis no more ! At least, Thibault is not like Fanti and some others who would like to only consider the primary cell wall hypothesis and completely forget about Rogers work and conclusions. One good point for Thibault ! The fact is this : The ghosts and the diimide leave a clean fiber behind. This can be found in Rogers papers and this observation was the main reason why he conclude that the cellulose (read : the whole fiber) was not affected by the image formation process. Thibault has a different understanding of Rogers work and it is his right. But I think he’s wrong ! Here’s the quotes from Rogers about this : 1 “Heller and Adler found that the image fibers could be decolorized with diimide. Reduction left COLORLESS, UNDAMAGED CELLULOSE FIBERS BEHIND.” Personal note : I think it’s pretty clear ! For Rogers, what diimide could do was only to reduce the carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers, while leaving the whole fiber intact. In Rogers language, as I said, when he used the word “cellulose”, he meant “the whole fiber” because, no matter what Thibault think, it’s not true that the primary cell wall is only composed of hemicellulose and pectin ! See this : http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1 G2 3408000066.html The expert who wrote this paper is clear : The primary cell wall is composed of CELLULOSE, along with hemicelluloses and pectin ! Here’s the quote : “The primary cell wall contains three major classes of polysaccharides: cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin.” So, when Rogers talk about “cellulose”, he was most probably referring to the whole fiber, including the primary cell wall. Thibault can twist this in his head all he want, Rogers knew well about the primary cell wall and the observation concerning the diimide was clear for him : the fiber WAS NOT AFFECTED at all during the image formation process because it leaves a colorless undamaged fiber behind. 2 We can read in page 29 of the paper “Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin” : “The color of image fibers was often stripped off of their surfaces, leaving COLORLESS CELLULOSE FIBERS. The color reside ONLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE FIBERS.” In his answer to question #12 of his paper “Shroud of Turin FAQ”, Rogers said that those “ghosts” of coloration were a CONFIRMATION of the FACT that the CELLULOSE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN IMAGE FORMATION. Personal note : Again, here, we have to understand Rogers expression “cellulose” as “the whole fiber” here. For Rogers, this fact first came from the observation that the diimide would reduce the color on the fibers, leaving undammaged fibers behind. In addition to that, the presence of ghosts of coloration in the sticky tapes, along with the COLORLESS linen fiber that was left behind, was an independent confirmation that the linen fibers themselves were NOT INVOLVED IN IMAGE FORMATION. For Rogers, those 2 observations, along with the banding effect (consistent with the ancient method of making linen cloth as described by Pliny the Elder) and along with the fact that the image is only superficial (consistent with the evaporation concentration phenomenon) was well enough to make him realized that the image did not affect the linen fiber directly but instead, it was only found ON TOP OF THE FIBER IN A THIN LAYER OF CARBOHYDRATES IMPURITIES. Thibault clearly have a different interpretation than mine, but since he’s no more expert than me on the question (the same is also true concerning Fanti, Di Lazzaro and the other co authors of the 2010 paper), I don’t see why his opinion should have more value than mine… Don’t get me wrong here, I don’t say I’m surely right, but I say that Thibault don’t have no more credibility than me on this subject. It’s not because you’re a member of the Shroud Science Group that your opinion become suddenly perfect ! He he ! And here, I’ll leave you with a reflection : Rogers was a true expert in microscopy and chemistry and saw the Shroud with his own eyes during 5 days and night in 1978. None of the co authors of the 2010 paper can say the same. None are experts in chemistry and microscopy and none made extensive direct research on the Shroud. Rogers claim that the whole linen fiber was not affected by the image formation process and claim that it was only a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities found on top of the linen fibers that was colored. Fanti and al. Proclaim in their 2010 paper (to my knowledge, for the first time) that Rogers was probably wrong and that, instead, the coloration reside in the primary cell wall of the linen fiber (a part of the fiber that contain cellulose). The question is : who we can trust ? Imagine you had to understand a complex subject and you have to choose between 2 persons to get information about this subject. The first is a clear expert on the subject and the other is not consider at all to be an expert on that matter, which one will you choose as the best reliable source of information ? I think the answer is pretty evident ! Of course, the first person, even if he’s an expert, is not immune from doing a mistake or giving you an information that is somewhat false, but the odds that this person can give you a better overall understanding is much higher, don’t you think ? That’s why I prefer to trust the judgment of Ray Rogers on that particularly complex question and that’s why I favored his own hypothesis, even if I’m honest enough, like Thibault, to understand that, in the present state of our knowledge, it is impossible to be 100% sure which one of the 2 hypothesis is correct regarding the Shroud. But, I’ll say it again and this is very important to note : Rogers as showed with good scientific arguments that his hypothesis CAN be correct regarding ALL the observations and facts concerning the body image on the Shroud. But I don’t think we can say the same thing concerning the other hypothesis involving the primary cell wall. In fact, I’ve NEVER seen one single scientific paper published by a real Shroud expert (who is also an expert in chemistry and microscopy) that do the same than Rogers did with his papers, i.e. To DEMONSTRATE that the hypothesis he defend CAN be applied to what we know about the body image on the Shroud. I still wait for a paper like that to be published in order to properly defend the hypothesis of the primary cell wall being the true chromophore of the image. I’ve never seen one so far. For the moment, I consider this hypothesis of the primary cell wall more like a personal opinion of some researchers than a real hypothesis that have been correctly DEMONSTRATE with solid scientific arguments, like it was done by Rogers for his own hypothesis. And if I’m wrong here, please show me the paper where I can find a real scientific demonstration that the primary cell wall can answer properly to all the known facts and observations we know about the Shroud, particularly concerning the ghosts, the diimide, the banding effect and the extreme superficiality of the image. SHOW ME JUST ONE SCIENTIFIC PAPER WHO HAVE ACCOMPLISH THAT FEAT !!! I dare anyone to find me just one ! And please, don’t talk to me about the 2010 paper because I’ll laugh at you !.","date":"2012-05-13","mins":"6:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-11344","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Hello Carlos, I don’t think Barbet’s hypotheses versus the Shroud are necessarily in contradiction with Rogers hypotheses. Both favours natural explanations : Barbet for the blood transfer and Rogers for the image formation. Have you ever consider the possibility that there was one configuration of the Shroud over the body at the moment he was put in the Shroud (hallowing some blood transfer), then another configuration during the short transfer of the body from the central room of the tomb to the burial tablet (hallowing some more blood transfer), then, when the body was lying on the tablet, the configuration of the Shroud changed one last time and this final configuration was pretty loose over the body, without any linen strips used to tied it, and then, only then, the body image formation took place ? I think this very possible scenario that I just described can explain pretty welll the majority of the blood and body images on the Shroud (with their particular configuration). No miracle is needed here. We have to remember that the idea that there would be traces of tearing in the bloodstains is only good in the context of completely dried bloodstains….","date":"2012-05-14","mins":"10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-3551","author":"yannick_clément","post":"No problem Rich.

If you ever do a real debate about the autheticity of the Shroud with a sceptic, please, put this subject on the table : In the STURP study entitled “Ultraviolet fluorescence photography of the Shroud of Turin”, Miller and Pellicori made one VERY interesting obseervation. It’s an observation that applies to another aspect of the question we discuss recently. They notice that, on the frontal and on the dorsal part, there is some scourge marks that are not visible in normal light but only visible in UV light. It’s pretty much like some tiny blood stains can only be detected with UV lights on a crime scene. I think it’s a very good confirmation of what I said previously about the probable superficiality of the scourge marks on the cloth. To me, that’s why we can’t see these marks on the backlight photos. This observation fits very well with the idea that the scourges are mainly a superficial transfer of clotted blood on the cloth surface, unlike most of the other blood stains who were more fresh and/or more important in size so they could go way deeper into the cloth (many of them goes all the way to the other side of the Shroud). And this observation proves that the transfer of clotted blood from these scourge marks wasn’t done at the same exact intensity and there is some scourges who are more perfectly shaped and much more evident than others. This tends to prove that we are in presence of a NATURAL transfer phenomenon from clotted blood and not an artistic forgery done with real human blood or with red ochre and vermilion. In a forgery, we would expect to see scourge marks about the same intensity everywhere and, consequently, we would expect to see all of them very easily. It’s NOT the case on the Shroud ! Joe Nickell, Dr. Karl and all the other sceptics will have to explain this to me and to you !!! : ).","date":"2011-08-09","mins":"3:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/09/debate-blog-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Debate Blog Proposal"},{"id":"comment-3553","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Oh, I forget. For your idea that the invisibility of some scourge marks could be explain by aging, it’s interesting but I think the simplest answer is that some marks were better transferred to the cloth than others. If it was so easy to make those few marks disappeared with time, why it isn’t the case for the vast majority of the other scourge marks ? No, since the scourge marks are a direct contact transfer of blood material from clotted scourge wounds, I think it’s very normal that some marks were better transferred on the cloth than others¸. To me, that’s the best explanation to understand why some are more complete and more defined than others and why a few marks are not visible to the naked eye. Those “invisible” marks were surely done by wounds not very humid and/or located in a way to permit just a slight contact with the cloth. That’s the best way I can explain those observations made by Miller and Pellicori..","date":"2011-08-09","mins":"4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/09/debate-blog-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Debate Blog Proposal"},{"id":"comment-4392","author":"yannick_clément","post":"You wrote : “We dont need to have a proof of Yeshua’s ressurection!”.

And for the comment from Holy Objects at Spiritual Questions, I think there is some truth in what it is said ! I really think that if one day science can prove that the body images on the Shroud came from a natural process of image formation (this is what I think myself), MANY PEOPLE (MOSTLY SHROUDIES) WOULD BE VERY UPSET AND DISAPOINTED ABOUT THAT !!! And I’m sure many of those people would never admit a conclusion like that even if science would show them all the proofs to back it up !

He found that the only apparent alteration of the blood stains due to time was microscopic abrasions on the surface of the stains. That’s all ! And consequently, he found tiny little blood particles in every part of the cloth. They were so tiny that you need a microscope to see them ! Those little particles of blood were scattered everywhere on the cloth because of the many handling of the cloth and the many folding and unfolding of the cloth. So, I really don’t think that the time factor could have caused the disappearance of some scourges marks made of blood. If there are some scourge marks invisible to the naked eye so that we need UV lights to see them, I think the most probable answer his that those few scourge marks came from a clotted blood transfer that didn’t made a good result. I think the findings of Adler demonstrate that the blood stains on the Shroud are very resistant to the time factor and are still almost intact after all these years.

Semi natural hypothesis is quite a good term to define my point of view… The “who knows if…” of my 2 questions indicates that there haven’t been a lot of serious researches (including lab experiments) to verify the real possibility of a strong impact of the highly traumatic state of the Shroud man’s body on the image formation process and me leaving the door open to the possibility of a manual extraction of the corpse out of the Shroud was just a way to remain intellectually honest, because it’s impossible to discard completely this hypothesis, even if the way the bloodstains looks (i.e. Undisturbed) really seems to cast some serious doubts over this idea. But having said that, I would really love to see someone making some test with real exudates of blood clots present on someone’s skin and some linen samples to see what kind of damages can be inflicted to the bloodstains when the skin is separated from the linen sample. Would be interesting to make this kind of test on various timing (i.e. Right after the contact, one hour after the contact, two hours after the contact, etc.). Presently, the way the bloodstains looks seems to indicates that if there ever was a manual extraction of the corpse, this should have been done very gently and before the moistened blood clots that were responsible for the bloodstains had time to dry or else, some evident missing parts would be seen in many bloodstains. But this idea doesn’t seem credible at all because of the body image, which most probably needed a contact of many hours (if not days) to get formed on the cloth’s surface..","date":"2015-06-09","mins":"9:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"id":"comment-201480","author":"yannick_clément","post":"“I am sympathetic to Yannick’s hypothesis that the image may have formed by some unknown natural means, because of some exceptional circumstances concerning the burial, such as its environment in the tomb, and the use of myrrh, aloes and other herbs and flora.” Personally, I think the exceptional circumstances that could have lead to the natural formation of the image have more chances to be found in the highly traumatic state of the Shroud man’s body (and the influence such a traumatic state could had on the production of reactive post mortem gases) and also in the very unusual short period during which the Shroud man’s body was present inside the Shroud… By the way, here’s a suggestion of reading for Daveb (as well as for anyone else interested by the question of the potential authenticity of the Shroud): http://shroudnm.com/docs/2015 03 07 Eval of Anonymous Person Image.pdf This is a long paper of mine that can be seen as a follow up to the one I published in 2012 about the evidence of the bloodstains.

And 3 The short period of time during which the corpse was present inside the cloth. To my knowledge, no scientist has ever tried to reproduce these very particular and unusual conditions in order to see what kind of body image we can get on a linen cloth that would be manufactured with a method that would leave the kind of thin layer of impurities described by Ray Rogers. Of course, being able to find a highly traumatized body for this kind of experiment is almost out of range, but I think it would be possible for a biochemist to determine with some precision the exact nature of the post mortem gases that could be released by that kind of tortured body (note that the possible presence of an abundant sweat all over the skin and hair that would be full of urea, lactic acid, etc., would be important to consider here, because of the possible release of some gases such a thing could produce) and then, to submit some linen samples that would get a thin layer of impurities on their surface to that kind of mix of gases for various length of time that could got from a few minutes to several hours. For that kind of experiment, the use of an easily defined object (why not using a freshly amputated limb from an animal or a human being on which you could put some “highly traumatic” sweat?) from which these gases could be released would be a must in order to see if a clear image of that object can be produced on the linen sample. Seriously, I wouldn’t be surprised at all if that kind of experiment could produce some images or, at the very least, some yellow stains. That should be a very interesting avenue of research to consider… Of course, it’s not the kind of experiment that could be done by an amateur!

But, on the contrary to you, I think I’ve been able (or at least I always try hard) to get back to the FACTS AND DATA and stick to them as much as I can, even if that can eventually forces me to sometimes change my mind on one or two things. With the Shroud, we very often deals with PROBABILITY more than sure proven facts and, because of this, I think it’s very easy for anyone to let his imagination goes wild. That’s a real problem in the Shroud world and I think it can only get resolve when a researcher is able to put is ego on the side enough to be able to do a proper and honest evaluation of these probabilities. When it comes to the possible presence of images of flowers and coins on the Shroud, as I said, if we’re honest in face of the FACTS AND DATA and stick to them the more we can, then we have to estimate the probability that these things are really on the Shroud (instead of being simple image artefacts) as being very low (or highly improbable if you prefer). And such an honest and therefore prudent estimation comes from 2 principal reasons that I already described in earlier comments: 1 These kind of « procedures » were not part of the First Century Jewish culture when it comes to burial rituals, at the exception of maybe some very scarce examples here and there. And even if there could be some examples of possible uses of flowers and coins (or any other things covering the eyes) during ancient Jewish burials coming from archaeological findings, these are obviously exceptions that confirm the rule, because these things have been found in just a few cases among maybe 1000 ancient Jewish tombs that were found in Palestine. 2 If there would have been flowers, coins or any other material things over some parts of the Shroud man’s body, including the eyes, then we must expect that absolutely no yellowing of fibers would have happened in these places, because we know for a fact that even a very thin layer of serum located between the cloth’s surface and the corpse was enough to prevent any image formation, so imagine the kind of “protective shield” a flower or a coin placed between the corpse and the cloth’s surface could have been! As I said, there is a slim possibility that the image formation was started by some volatile and reactive burial substances that could have been sprinkled on the body (and on those hypothetical flowers and coins), but as I also said, this kind of scenario is far fetched and should not be considered with a high level of probability. So Max, I think you simply have to redo some probabilistic evaluation concerning these hypotheses of images of flowers or coins being really present on the Shroud while letting your imagination on the side….","date":"2014-10-12","mins":"4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-7518","author":"yannick_clément","post":"He should read also the book of Pierre Barbet.

If it would, then no way the blood stains would have borders so perfect like we see on the Shroud. Fibrinolysis normally come with the first liquid of putrefaction ! Baima Bollone talks in his book about some experiments made by an Italian doctor Sebastiano Rodante about that and he show that the fibrinolysis of dried blood clot starts around 36 to 40 hours after the death. In fact, the post mortem fibrinolysis seemed to be a good indicator of the liquid stage of putrefaction. Jesus body didn’t experiment this stage while he was in the Shroud because if it did, the images would have been messed up ! Barbet thought that the blood clots were completely dried when the body was put in the Shroud and then, because of the aqueous atmosphere, the surface of the clots became humid enough to stain the cloth. I think it’s possible, but my personal reflection (a very long one !!!) about this is a little different than his own reflection (proof that I don’t consider Barbet like God). Effectively, after having check out the images lengthily, I firmly think that the surface of the blood clots SHOULD HAVE BEEN humid enough (at different stages of the drying process) when the body was put in the cloth in order to stain the Shroud the way we see it. And this is true ONLY for certain blood clots (those that were able to stain the Shroud).

He was truly an expert in blood clotting. He knew what he talked about. Unfortunatelly, I can’t give you the name of another expert who agree with Barbet, but I know there is. I’m pretty sure that during his days, Vignon, Volckringer and others agreed with him on this particular topic. And I know doctor Gilbert Lavoie wrote about the fact that, for him, the quality of the blood stains on the Shroud was a sign of Jewishness because those people are particularly maniac (maybe even more during Christ time) regarding the fact that all the blood of a victim should not be disturbed during the burial rite and all the blood should be buried with him (even the blood that failed to the ground) in preparation of the general resurrection at the end of time (jewish belief). But I don’t know if Lavoie agreed with Barbet on the sign of the resurrection we could see in the blood stains… 2 No, because it was in the 30s and 40s he made his researches. He had only access to good resolution photos of Enrie. But, in 1933, he was outside in Turin on the big plaza in front of the St John the Baptist and they showed the Shroud in open air and with a good sunlight. And he was pretty close to the Shroud at that time. He said in his book that when he saw the Shroud in sunlight, without any glass protection, he immediately recongnize the particular signs of decals from humid blood clots. And, with STURP later work (Adler particularly), they prove him right about that. I wonder if there’s some STURP members (Adler in particular) who agreed with him on the subject of the undisturbed blood stains. I don’t know the answer. But for having read Adler’s book, I know he fully agreed with Barbet on the fact that the blood on the Shroud is not complete blood because it came mostly from still humid blood clots. Most of the stains don’t come from blood in liquid phase, except some post mortem blood from the holes in the feet (and maybe the blood that came from the side wound, but even this blood stain, for Barbet, came from a blood that has just started to clot). 3 He’s not American or British ! And also, he made his experiments during the 30s and 40s. Many people have a bad tendency to think old hypotheses regarding the Shroud must be wrong because there are some modern people who have proposed newer hypotheses. I disagree completely with this kind of thinking, especially regarding the Shroud. Just take Ray Rogers and his Maillard reaction hypothesis ! The genesis of this hypothesis came from one of the very first scientific hypothesis proposed by Paul Vignon (another frenchmen) at the very beginning of the 20th century (the vaporographic theory) !!! Rogers at first didn’t thought this hypothesis could be true at all ! And then, he came back to it and realised that many elements from this hypothesis could be interesting after all… The moral of this story : old stuff not necessarily mean crap !!!

In fact, there are changes of intensity because of the ancient technique that was used to make the cloth) and I think that the explaination given by Rogers about this close relationship is very rational and it fits nicely with all the facts and observations we know about the body image. Of course, those who believe the body images were due to a burst of energy at the time of the resurrection will always disagree with Rogers conclusions and hypothesis, simply because it doesn’t fit at all with their point of view.

One more thing that is very important to note and that I completely forget to talk : In my long comment here, I said that, for Rogers, the intensity of the body image is due to the distance between the corpse and the cloth, yes, but it is also due to the intensity of the different bands composing the cloth. I should have add this : The intensity of the body image is also due to a 3rd factor : i.e. The amount and concentration of gas that was present in one particular zone of the body.

I think it is possible, for the hair, to think that the gas there was not coming from the nose and mouth but was coming instead from urea (and maybe other biological products like lactic acid, etc.) that could have been left there in great quantity when the hair full of sweat would have dried. After the drying of the sweat, this (or these) product(s) could have started to produce ammoniac gas that could have been much more concentrate in the hair than in other parts of the body (like maybe the sides of the face). Some years ago, Thibault Heimburger wrote an excellent paper about the hypothesis of Rogers and he proposed a parallel hypothesis based on medical references he found out that proved that a tortured body like Jesus who surely produced a lot a sweating before dying could leave high amounts of urea on his skin. This urea then could have produced fairly rapidly (maybe after 24 hours or so) a released of some ammoniac gas.

It’s pretty clear that, for Rogers, there was a rational explanation for these differences that would prevent him to look for a better hypothesis concerning the banding effect. If he had not been able to explain these differences with satisfaction, you can bet your house that he would have changed his mind versus the banding effect on the Shroud. But the fact is that he did not and, again, that speak very loud to me ! Here, we have to remember that Rogers was not the kind of scientist who wasn’t able to change his mind. He followed honestly the scientific method, so much that, in fact, he had to really change his mind on some major aspects of the Shroud. If he never had changed his mind on anything related to the Shroud, I wouldn’t be so sure of his conviction that there really was a strong correlation between the intensity of the body image and the intensity of the bands on the cloth, even if there are some differences on the cloth like you mentioned. Because Rogers never fear to change his mind on a particular subject IF there was evidence that forced him to do so, I’m sure these little difference were not considered by him as really problematic versus his hypothesis concerning the bands. I just can’t see Rogers going in one direction, while the facts would seem to go in another direction… Quote : “For example, in the face, we can readily see banding effect that are less wide than one column of the Z weave pattern.” Comment : For these cases (I’m not sure there are many), have you ever considered the possibility that there is more or less impurities (depending if the band is dark or pale) located on the sides of these threads versus the middle of the threads ? This could be due to the evaporation concentration process or maybe because of a mix of threads used to make the weave in these areas that would come from more than one batch of yarns (that would have been bleached a bit differently). This is just a guess of mine but, anyway, I’m sure Rogers was well aware of this particularity and he surely had a proper explanation. If he wasn’t able to explain this, do you really think he would have defend his hypothesis so strongly ? No… He would have started to look for another explanation instead. You can be sure that this is what he would have done.

Remember that this process was going on AFTER the bleaching of the cloth, when the weaving was complete. So, in all logic, it could have affected the appearence of the bands in some places by concentrating more impurities (especially those that were added to the fibers AFTER the bleaching, like the starch fraction for example) in some particular places of the weave. I think this evaporation concentration process is probably what can explain the best those apparent difference noted by Mario. And if it’s so, that would mean that Rogers hypothesis concerning the bands cannot be discarded on that base. I want you to remember what I said the other day about the 3 major factors that, for Rogers, played a decisive role for the intensity of the coloration ? For a refresh, here they are again : 1 The relative distance between the cloth and the body. 2 The relative amount of impurities present at the surface of the fibers. Note : For Rogers, the banding effect was caused by some differences in the amount of impurities and these differences could have been important depending on how vigorous was the bleaching of each batch of yarns. I also think it safe to assume that the evaporation concentration process due to the washing and the drying of the cloth could also account partially for the probable variation in the amount of impurities that were left on top of the fibers of the Shroud. 3 The relative amount and concentration of a reactive product. Note : For Rogers, this reactive product was in fact different sorts of amines coming from the corpse and it is very probable that more amines could have come out from some particular parts of the body (like the nose and the mouth) versus other parts of the body. Note the point #2 where I was already mentioning the possibility that the evaporation concentration process could also account partially for the probable variation in the amount of impurities left on the fibers. I should have also said that this process could well be responsible for a non homogeneous repartition of these impurities on the fibers in many areas of the cloth. In fact, I think I should have made a 4th point concerning the evaporation concentration process, separate from the other 3 points, because I’m almost sure that Rogers thought that way. To confirm this, here’s another quote from Rogers book concerning an experiment he made with dye, in order that we understand better the evaporation concentration process and the way it works : “Different types of cloth will show different degrees of concentration of the dye on the evaporating surface, EVEN ON DIFFERENT ADJOINING FIBERS. It is possible to get dye concentration on both surfaces, while leaving the interior of the cloth white.” I think this description from Rogers is well enough to understand that a non homogeneous result in the concentration of impurities, at thread level as much as at fiber level, is what can be expect of the evaporation concentration process that happened during the drying of the Shroud. In that respect, I think my idea that this phenomenon could account, at least partially, for the observation made by Mario, is truly possible, especially if we take note of this description found in Rogers book… Here, it’s important to understand one major particularity that can apply for almost every natural phenomenon : the non homogeneous aspect of the result ! And this evaporation concentration process is surely not different than most of the other natural phenomenon ! In fact, seeing a natural phenomenon producing a real and complete homogeneous result should be considered as something very exceptional… Before I conclude, I want to report what Rogers said in his book, right after the quote I just gave you, when he talk about the Shroud itself : “The puzzling “half tone” effect has been mentioned.” (Note : this concern the fact that, on the Shroud, it’s the difference in the concentration of colored fibers versus non colored fibers that produced the intensity of the body image). Let’s get back to Rogers quote : “All of the colored fibers showed approximately the same color density under a microscope. Assuming that the color formed by reactions with a very thin deposit of superficial impurities on the fibers, all of the fibers should have showed identical spectra and roughly the same intensity of color. THEY DID.” I think this deserves some thoughts ! One thing’s for sure : In regard of all the known facts and observations concerning the Shroud and the body image, the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the thin layer of carbohydrates impurities cannot be discard for the moment ! And I really think it’s exactly the same thing concerning his hypothesis about the banding effect… No matter what the skeptics can think ! And, as I also said Saturday, I just can’t believe that a guy like Mario is not able to see the close correlation that exist almost everywhere on the Shroud between the intensity of the image color and the intensity of the bands, and so, no matter if Rogers hypothesis is correct or if it’s due to another thing, like the density of the threads, as reported by Thibault Heimburger the other day. I’m just amazed to note that Mario don’t agree with the fact that there really is a close connection between the bands and the body image… I’m sorry for Mario but this is a FACT that there really is a close relationship between the intensity of the body image and the intensity of the bands on the Shroud and we can find a very good confirmation of that in this observation of the Shroud, reported by Rogers in his book : “A conservator of Turin’s Museum of Egyptology, Anna Maria Donadoni, point out locations where batches of yarns ended in the weft AND NEW YARN HAD BEEN INSERTED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WEAVING. The yarn ends were laid side by side, and the weave was compressed with a comb. The overlaps are often visible, even in high resolution x ray photographs. When an overlap is observed, THE COLOR USUALLY CHANGES. The color of the Shroud is not simply a result of changes in pure cellulose (linen). Note : When Rogers wrote “the color usually changes”, he refers to the color of the body image. And because this particular change of color observed by Rogers represent a real FACT, this lead to only one rational conclusion : A CLOSE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE BANDS ON THE SHROUD AND THE BODY IMAGE REALLY EXIST !!! Understand that when I say “close correlation”, I don’t pretend it is a complete 100% correlation because the evaporation concentration process done after the bleaching could have affected the bands in some places, along with their influence on the body image. But nevertheless, if we trust Rogers opinion, there is a very good correlation between the bands and the body image that goes far beyond the possibility that it could be simply due to hazard. In reality, how can there be changes of color in the body image when an overlap of threads is observed on the Shroud if there was no direct relationship between the body image and the banding effect ? Good question, don’t you think ? That’s precisely why Rogers was so sure about the fact that there really is a close connection between the bands and the body image on the Shroud. As I said before, this close connection MIGHT BE EXPLAINED PROPERLY because it is a FACT. And, for the moment, in regard of all the known data about the Shroud and his image, I don’t see any better and rational explanation that the one proposed by Rogers. It’s as clear as that in my mind. Of course, it doesn’t mean that Rogers was necessarily right, but it mean that his explanation is the most coherent we have right now. And this can have great implications because, if Rogers is right about the banding effect, then he his probably right too about the image chromophore made of carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers. And if it is so, consequently, that mean that the body image formation process have great chances to have come from some chemical reaction on the top surface of the cloth instead of some burst of energy related to the resurrection of Christ, because, as Rogers said, it is highly improbable that any form of energy that would have been enough “energetic” to produce a coloration on the cloth would have only colored the thin layer of impurities and would not have affected, at the same time, the linen fibers under the coating, which is something unrelated to the reality of the Shroud (for Rogers). I hope you can see more clearly now the real implication that is related to the exact nature of the banding effect on the Shroud !!! If Rogers explanation is correct about this banding effect, I really think we can forget any kind of hypothesis involving some burst of energy, whether it would be related to the resurrection of Christ or not….","date":"2012-06-11","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"},{"id":"comment-12214","author":"yannick_clément","post":"And what do you make of this other quote from Rogers : ” A conservator of Turin’s Museum of Egyptology, Anna Maria Donadoni, point out locations where batches of yarns ended in the weft AND NEW YARN HAD BEEN INSERTED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WEAVING.

What I really wanted to say is this : If Mario Latendresse’s observation regarding a possible difference that can exist in some places (like the region of the face) between the banding effect and the weave on the Shroud was really something new (like a new discovery for example) that Rogers couldn’t have been aware, I would agree that this observation could be considered as really problematic versus his hypothesis concerning the banding effect. But since it’s not something new (in fact, it seem like a pretty obvious observation for anyone who look at the Shroud very closely), it’s evident that an observation like that could not have been missed by Rogers, during the time he was analysing the banding effect on the Shroud. Here, we have to keep in mind that, on the contrary to all of us, he stayed with the Shroud 5 days and nights in 1978 and had the chance to see the cloth more closer than almost anyone in history ! Also, it’s very clear in Rogers writings that he did look closely at the x ray and UV photographs of the Shroud when he was working to find a scientific explanation for the banding effect. So I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the fact that he was fully aware of the particularity reported on this blog by Mario Saturday. Taking this as a fact, we have to presume that if, in the eyes of Rogers, this would have constitute a real problem versus his own hypothesis, he would have taken note of that and search elsewhere for a better explanation. And the fact that he did not and that he defend his hypothesis until the end of his life speaks very loud concerning this “apparent” problematic. In sum, for Rogers, there’s no doubt that the observation reported by Mario never represented a real problem; most probably because he was able to explain it rationally INSIDE his own hypothesis, i.e. With all the elements and processes that are include in his hypothesis. Of course, Rogers is not here with us to confirm my reflection, but anyway, I just can’t see Rogers missing an observation like that, directly related to the banding effect on the Shroud..","date":"2012-06-11","mins":"11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"},{"id":"comment-12219","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Note about my last comment to Collinsberry : Of course, that doesn’t mean Rogers hypothesis is necessarily the right one but that mean the close connection between the bands and the body image does exist on the cloth.

Sorry again for the length of this comment but I think it could help some to understand better what’s at the heart of Alonso’s opinion… In fact, never mind if Alonso’s interpretation is right or wrong on this particular characteristic of the image (concerning the numeric treatment that didn’t produce any deformation of the image), I think the FACT that there is a strong correlation between the intensity of the image and the intensity of the bands on the Shroud is well enough to understand that Rogers conclusion about the banding effect is PROBABLY CORRECT. And if it’s right, then that mean that his hypothesis concerning the thin layer of impurities is PROBABLY CORRECT TOO. Firstly, let’s remind people of the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the bands : For him, the banding effect is directly related to a thin layer of impurities of variable thickness found on the top surface of the cloth (on both sides). In Rogers mind, it is those impurities that were colored during the image formation process (most probably by one or many chemical mechanisms). For Rogers, these impurities were left there after the washing and drying of the cloth and, because this ancient cloth was probably bleached prior to the weaving (bleaching done by batches of threads instead of one global bleaching of the whole cloth), this can account for a difference in the amount of impurities that had been left on the fibers and that’s why we see a banding effect on the Shroud. For Rogers, the more impurities are present on top of the fibers, the more the color of the cloth is dark and inversely, on threads bleached more vigorously, there should be less impurities present and that can account for the fact these threads are more white than the others. And, because there’s a difference in the amount of impurities found on each thread (a difference that can be really different at time), that’s why the intensity of the bands is directly connected to the intensity of the body image on the Shroud. Never mind what can think all his detractors, I really think this hypothesis of Rogers offers the best explanation for this unusual property of the Shroud named “the banding effect”. Recently, here on the blog, Thibault Heimburger said that this banding effect and his relationship with the image COULD well be explained by a difference in the density of the threads. I even read the same possibility in a STURP paper, but with a small difference, i.e. That it concerned uniquely the question of the banding effect on the Shroud, without trying to explain the correlation between the intensity of the bands and the intensity of the image… This hypothesis can be found in the STURP paper “Radiographic examination of the Shroud of Turin – a Preliminary Report” (written by Mottern, London and Morris). Here, I want to state that I don’t think every single threads used to make the Shroud were of the same exact density. In fact, I agree with what Thibault said the other day, when he said that it is common to see some changes in the density of the threads used to make ancient fabrics like the Shroud. So, I don’t have too much doubt that this is also probably true for the Shroud. But nevertheless, it is very interesting to note one particular finding we can see in the STURP paper of Mottern, London and Morris, that really seem to go against the hypothesis that was bring forward by Thibault the other day. Here’s what they wrote in page 43 of their paper : “In constrast (meaning : in contrast to their hypothesis concerning the differences of density that can explain the banding effect), from a limited number of measurements, the linen threads (of the Shroud) are more uniform in diameter.” Of course, this cannot be taken as a proof that every threads used to make the cloth present the same density, but this particular finding from these researchers is very interesting because, at first sight, it really seem to contradict their hypothesis concerning the banding effect, and at the same time, it look like a contradiction with the hypothesis mentioned by Thibault the other day. And more than that, when we put together all the observations and facts we now know about the Shroud and his image (the probable use of a bleaching technique done batch of threads by batch of threads, the ghosts of coloration found in the sticky tapes, the reduction of the color with diimide, the extreme superficiality of the coloration on top of the cloth and possibly on the 2 sides in the region of the face, etc.), I really don’t think that this hypothesis involving a difference in the density of each threads (or batch of threads) can really offer a decent explanation for the banding effect we see on the Shroud along with his close connection with the intensity of the body image. Let me give you one example in order to show that this hypothesis present some enormous problems. First, let’s state one important FACT about the Shroud : There really are body images on each side of the face on the Shroud, but they are very pale. So pale in fact that it need a numeric treatment in order to see them properly. Without any doubt, we can conclude that these 2 zones represent a very drastic change in the intensity of the body image of the face we see on the Shroud. So, when we take seriously this FACT into account, how in the world this drastic change in the intensity of the image of the face can be due to a difference in the density of the threads ? Remember that the correlation between the intensity of the image and the banding effect is a FACT. In other word, if the hypothesis expressed by Thibault or Mottern and Al. From STURP was correct concerning the banding effect, can you imagine the importance in the difference of density that it would be necessary to achieve this kind of drastic change in the intensity of the body image ??? In my mind, it is just unbelievable that 2 series of threads from the Shroud, located side by side, could possess this kind of high difference of density that would be the cause of this drastic change in the intensity of the image. It’s just too much ! In fact, if this was true, I’m sure that the STURP team would have noticed an important difference in the density of the threads in that region (greater there than elsewhere on the cloth and easily noticeable). Effectively, if this hypothesis was true, the difference of density that would be necessary to produce this drastic effect would have been so important that there’s no doubt in my mind that the STURP team would have note this change quite easily. That’s why I don’t believe this hypothesis of a difference in the density of the threads can represent a valid option to explain the close relationship that exist between the intensity of the bands and the intensity of the body image. I firmly believe that we have to look elsewhere for a logical explanation and that’s precisely what Rogers did ! After having put together all the observations and facts regarding the body image of the Shroud, that’s when he came out with his own hypothesis that offer a far better explanation (on the rational level) that the one presented by Thibault the other day. In fact, an ancient bleaching technique done batch of threads by batch of threads with the result of leaving different amounts of impurities on top of the fibers offer, I think, a much better explanation for, firstly, the banding effect itself, and secondly, the close connection that exist between this banding effect on the cloth and the variable intensity of the body image that can be very drastic at time (the face region is a perfect example of that). And if Rogers is correct about that, then the conclusion is this : the image formation of the Shroud has a very good chance to have involved some kind(s) of chemical reaction(s) and logically, those should have been caused by the biological products that were produced by a corpse trapped in the cloth for maybe 36 hours or so. And I really think that’s the main reason why this hypothesis of Rogers is so intensely criticise these days : simply because most of those who yield the louder against it are members of what I call the “supernatural fringe” of the Shroud world. In this context, I think it’s normal that they want so badly to crush down this hypothesis !!! But sadly for them, for the banding effect and his close relationship with the body image, I think science has not been able to come up with a better explanation for the moment. That’s why I truly believe this hypothesis from Rogers is here to stay, at least up until new chemical tests could be performed on the relic (along with new spectroscopic analysis and other tests). I think it’s only then that, let’s hope, we’ll finally know if Rogers was right or wrong !!! To conclude, I want to say this : If you don’t agree with my point of view concerning the hypothesis of Ray Rogers (I’m sure there will be some people in that group !), then I would like you to give me a rational explanation for the sudden and drastic change in the intensity of the body image present in the region of the face ! If this isn’t due to an important variation in the quantity of impurities present on top of the fibers in that region (most probably caused by a difference in the intensity of the bleaching that was performed on each batch of threads), then what is the cause of this drastic change of intensity between the image easy to see of the cheek and the extremely pale image of the side of the face ??? Remember that the presence of this image was scientifically confirmed, even if it is almost impossible to see it with naked eyes. So, taking that into account, if you disagree with Rogers hypothesis, then what is your counter hypothesis for this very particular feature of the Shroud ? I’m open to hear any thoughts about that, as long as it come from someone honest who, like me, only seek the truth about the Shroud ! So, please, don’t bring back ancient hypothesis like the presence of a chin band because the real presence of an image on the sides of the face is a proof that this one is incorrect. In fact, what I would really like to hear is someone offering a rational explanation for the drastic change in the intensity of the image in the region of the face while using the hypothesis proposed by Thibault regarding the primary cell wall that would involved a difference in the density of the threads !!! Personally, I just don’t see how someone can come up with a good scientific explanation involving this kind of hypothesis. On important note to finish : We often hear that the intensity of the body image is uniquely due to the distance between the corpse and the cloth, but, if we believe Ray Rogers conclusions, that’s not completely true. For him, the intensity of the body image is due to the distance between the corpse and the cloth, yes, but it is also due to the intensity of the different bands composing the cloth. In other words, for Rogers, the intensity of the coloration of the body image was not only due to the number of colored fibers per square unit (greater in the zones of direct contact and non existent where the cloth was distant from the cloth of over 4 cm), but it was also due to the amount of impurities present on the fiber. For Rogers, these 2 parameters were both important in the production of the body image we see on the Shroud and the very pale image present on both sides of the face is a very good indicator that Rogers was probably right about that. In fact, in itself, the very good correlation that exists between the intensity of the image and the intensity of the bands on the cloth is THE indicator that he was probably right. I thought it was important to shed light on that important aspect of the question because it is not always (not often I should say !) explained the right way on websites or TV documentary dedicated to the Shroud… On this particular topic, what is very interesting to note is what Marcel Alonso said about it in a presentation he made at the conference of Dallas in 2005. Here’s what he said (we can find this quote in the paper he wrote for the conference) : “In fact, Rogers was the first to question this halftone model of “areal density of monochromatic dots” proposed by Pellicori (note : a member of STURP), suggesting a more “natural” one based on colors intensities.” In fact, what Alonso summarised here is what I just described. For Rogers, the variation of intensity in the body image is not due uniquely to the number of colored fibers by square unit but it is also due to the variation in the amount of impurities that was present on each fiber and his model is interesting because it can account very well (theoretically) for the strong correlation between the intensity of the bands on the cloth and the intensity of the body image on the cloth. So, I think this particular quote from Alonso can help us to understand what he really meant when he said that “Since these treatment leave the image intact (personal note : with no deformation of the image), the formation of this image WOULDN’T HAVE ALTERED THE SURFACE COMPOSITION OF THE THREADS, which would go in the sense of a DEPOSIT OF COLORATION ADDED TO THE THREADS.” Effectively, I think we can presume easily that, for Alonso, if the body image on the Shroud was uniquely a halftone model of “areal density of monochromatic dots” involving some kind of molecular change in the structure of the fiber itself, the numeric treatment that was done by Castex and Al. Would have created some image deformation. To finish, I’ll say it again, I’m not an expert at all in imagery treatment, so I don’t know if Alonso is right or wrong about that. But, nevertheless, I think the close correlation between the intensity of the bands and the intensity of the body image is a strong indicator that Rogers hypothesis concerning the image chromophore is probably correct..","date":"2012-06-07","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"},{"id":"comment-6736","author":"yannick_clément","post":"That’s Zugibe’s point of view but I personally disagree.

If it was the work of a medieval forger in order to produce a false relic, there’s MANY aspects of the Shroud that doesn’t seem logical at all.

I just prefer Barbet’s way because it is simplier and easier to do. Again, if we take the Occam razor principle, it is a better explanation than Zugibe because the angulation of the nailing is done in a more natural way (90 degrees). Of course, we’ll never know the answer for sure but Barbet, on the contrary of Zugibe, did many real nailing experiments on dead bodies and he observe that the nail was coming out EACH time at the same exact spot we see on the Shroud, even if he placed the nail in different zones in the wrist area. Why ? Because the nail found each time the Destot space (believe it or not it’s true) and go through that space between the small bones of the wrist. Just read again Barbet’s book !

It is sure that most of the stigmatised, I mean those that have been recognised by the Church, since Francis of Assisi until this day, bears their wounds in the region of the palms (for the backside of the hands). Did those stigmatised showed exact replicas of the hand wounds of Jesus ? That’s the big question. It is improbable. First, we have to note that those wounds didn’t always show the same appearance. They are more or less superficial or deep, from an excoriation on the skin to a complete hole. Sometimes we see, like saint Francis of Assisi, kind of an fleshy excrescence that I will not try to explain the exact anatomic nature, because they didn’t look like anything we could ever see.” Note : Barbet then give some lines from the Fioretti where those wounds are describe and the text describe those fleshy excrescence as the heads of the nails. Then Barbet wrote : “Then, can we answer yes to my question ? NO ! Those stigmatised don’t show the exact replica of Jesus wounds. The wounds of Jesus didn’t looked like that when his body was laid into the Shroud. This is not like that that he showed them to his disciples, in his glorious body. I also want to say that the exact location of the stigmatised wounds is not always the same. In fact, for the hands, those wounds varied in all the metacarpal region (note : the palm region) and sometimes very close to the carpal region (note : the wrist area). Then, we must conclude that the stigmatised cannot give us any clue about the location or the form of the crucifixion wounds. That’s even the conclusion of the stigmatised themselves. I will just cite one of them, Therese Newmann. She said to one of his friend : Don’t think that the Lord have been nailed in his palms, where I have my wounds. Those wounds have ONLY A MYSTICAL MEANING (note : it’s me, Yannick, who underline). Jesus must have been fixed more firmly on the cross.” Then, Barbet conclude his point of view on this question by saying : “And since we talks about mystics, I will only recall, with great reserve and respect, this revelation of the Blessed Virgin to saint Brigit (or Brigid) : “The hands of my son have been pierced at the place where the bone is more solid.” Personally, I don’t have much to add. I think the most important point to note is that many stigmatised show many types of wounds at many different places (it’s true for the hands and also for the side wounds that was not always on the right side !). Sorry, but that fact, alone, is enough to show that Therese Newmann was right when she said : “Those wound have only a mystical meaning.” We must not see them has forensically accurate replicas of the wounds of Jesus. That would be a terrible mistake. I will conclude this comment with a personal assumption : I think it’s more of a psychosomatic kind of thing, linked with a mystical state. I’m sure most medical experts would agree with me about that..","date":"2012-01-12","mins":"9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/metaphors-or-mix-up/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Metaphors or Mix Up?"},{"id":"comment-6877","author":"yannick_clément","post":"When someone as his idea settled, no way you can change his mind !.","date":"2012-01-12","mins":"5:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/metaphors-or-mix-up/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Metaphors or Mix Up?"},{"id":"comment-6766","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Bullsh** Zugibe was ALWAYS against every possible conclusion reached by Barbet.

Of course, we cannot be 100% sure, but the fact is that Barbet’s hypothesis is TOTALLY CONSISTENT with the Shroud, so it has some good chances to be true. And as Co point out, his hypothesis was INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED by another medical specialist ! Of course, you can still believe Zugibe was right but THAT’S NOT THE GENERAL OPINION OF MOST MEDICAL EXPERTS THAT HAVE STUDIED THE SHROUD..","date":"2012-01-13","mins":"9:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/metaphors-or-mix-up/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Metaphors or Mix Up?"},{"id":"comment-6932","author":"yannick_clément","post":"First, I want to apologize again for the lenght of this comment but you’ll see, I talk about many interesting and important points about the question of the nailing of the hands and also sindonology in general. Here, I want to point out 2 FACTS that are important to consider when someone wants to judge who got the best hypothesis for the nailing of the hands : Zugibe or Barbet. 1 Barbet, while doing his experiments on recently amputated arms (as he said, those arms had still living nerves that still acts like normal arms, except the fact that the blood circulation was stopped) ALWAYS noted that the thumb did a retraction movement into the palms. This FACT was totally consistent with what we see on the Shroud and offered a scientific explanation for the missing thumb. 2 Here’s some reasons Zugibe gave in his article “Pierre Barbet Revisited” in order to support his hypothesis : a.The palm region is the location most Christians across the centuries perceived the wound to be. B.Fifthly, it assures that no bones are broken in accord with Exodus 12:46 and Numbers 9:12. C.Lastly, it is where most of the stigmatists( prior to Dr. Barbet’s book ) like St. Francis of Assisi, Padre Pio, Theresa of Konnersruth, St. Catherine of Sienna, Catherine of Ricci, Louise Lateau, etc. Have displayed their wounds throughout the centuries. For me, the first fact is another important sign that Barbet hypothesis is totally consistent with the way the man of the Shroud was nailed to the cross. Zugibe didn’t conduct experiments like that with freshly amputated arms. Then, we have to conclude that he was not able to show experimentally that his method of nailing would produce the same retraction of the thumb into the palm of the hand, just like we see it on the Shroud. It doesn’t mean that his method would not produce a retraction of the thumb, but he was not able to confirm this experimentally. Nevermind this fact, it seem that Zugibe wanted to pass by this “problem” by giving another explanation (not really convincing to me) about the absence of the thumb on the Shroud image. He simply said that it was due to the position of the Shroud that would have been far away from the thumb, so that no image could be formed. And this reasoning can also be applied to the easiness of the nailing. Effectively, Barbet was able to verify experimentally that his method was VERY SIMPLE, EASY and RAPID to do. Also, it was done in a VERY NATURAL way. All those characteristics are totally compatible with the context of Roman soldiers who surely wanted to nail their victim rapidly to the cross. Zugibe, on the contrary, never did experiments like that and we must conclude that it is impossible for the moment to know if his method can be as simple, as easy and as rapid to do as the method proposed by Barbet. Again, that doesn’t mean Zugibe’s method would not withstand the comparison with Barbet, but, for the moment, the truth is that WE DON’T KNOW ! And until someone can show me real experiments like the one done by Barbet to show me that Zugibe’s hypothesis can be as simple, easy and rapid to do, I will tend to favoured Barbet’s hypothesis, using Occam razor principle. And since Barbet’s hypothesis seem to me much more natural in the context of a victim having his arms and hands maintained flat on a patibulum by Roman soldiers, I think his hypothesis is closer to the reality of a Roman crucifixion. And for the second fact that I’ve mentioned, we have to recognise that those “Christian” reasons given by Zugibe to defend his hypothesis are somewhat BIASED by his personal faith. In my opinion, those kind of reasons have simply not their places in an article that is supposed to be scientific. And the FACT is that the religious reasons given by Zugibe in “a” and “c” of my point #2 are just completely ERRONEOUS ! M. Zugibe forget one thing : his hypothesis, by making the nail exit in the wrist area instead of the backside of the palm, is COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT with the perception of the Christians over the centuries and with the wounds of the stigmatised !!! I can’t believe a brilliant person like him used bad arguments like that in order to defend his hypothesis. One thing’s for sure, it is not on the base of reasons like that, that I will change my mind about the fact that I favored the hypothesis of Barbet !!! I don’t know for you, but for me, it seem obvious that the hypothesis submit by Zugibe was, to some extend, influenced by his Christian faith. This kind of acting is sadly common in sindonology, and even if we can understand why someone do that, for me, it is not “acceptable” in a scientific research because there’s too much danger of errors due to some religious bias… In the end, all I want to say is that Barbet was able, on the contrary to Zugibe, to show EXPERIMENTALLY that his method of nailing through the wrist is completely compatible with what we see on the Shroud of Turin. Again, that doesn’t mean the Zugibe’s way of nailing is wrong, but that there are some chances (good chances in my mind) that Barbet’s way of nailing the crucifixion victims was effectively what was done on the Golgotha 2000 years ago. And to those, like Ron, who don’t believe what I just said, I just have this to say : Read again carefully (and with an honest mind) the book of Barbet and this article from Zugibe and you’ll see that I just wrote some truths here (especially about the FACT that Zugibe was never able to confirm his hypothesis with real experiments, on the contrary of Pierre Barbet). Here’s the link to Zugibe’s article : http://shroud.com/zugibe.htm Here’s the link to buy Barbet’s book (I highly recommend it to anybody who’s interested in the Shroud) : http://www.amazon.com/Doctor Calvary Passion Described Surgeon/dp/0912141042/ref=sr 1 1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326468620&sr=8 1 And, to conclude this long comment, I just want to make a little Shroud history course that is very telling ! Did you know that Monsignor Paleotto, archbishop of Bologna, was in Turin in 1578 with Charles Borromeo to observe the Shroud and after that, he wrote a document in which he describe all the wounds he had seen ? And did you know that, well before Zugibe, he was the first to propose the hypothesis that Jesus was nailed at the base of the palms (in the interior of the hand) with such an angulation that the nails would came out at the exact spot we see on the Shroud ? And did you know that the main reason that was behind his hypothesis was the fact that he wanted to “match” the Shroud with the stigmatised ? I SUSPECT EXACTLY THE SAME THING FOR ZUGIBE AND Co JUST WROTE THE SAME THING IN HIS LAST COMMENT ! This deserve some thoughts, don’t you think folks ??? I’ll say it until I die : When you let your personal faith interfered into your scientific research, IT’S WRONG AND YOU’RE OFF TRACK REGARDING THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD !!! Ray Rogers talk lengthily about this crucial problem in his book. And we have plenty of those bad examples in the history of sindonology… So many that I could not write an exhaustive list without having some cramps in my wrist ! And that’s why I pray that the next series of direct researches on the Shroud will be done by a scientific team composed exclusively of atheists and agnostics that don’t care one second if the Shroud is the authentic Shroud of Jesus Christ, but just want to understand this archaeological artifact from a strict scientific point of view. And I also hope a team like that would exclude every scientist who ever proposed any hypothesis regarding the Shroud, because there would be a great danger of bias obviously. That’s the greatest problem in sindonology : A lot of scientists are not seeking the truth (scientifically speaking) but are searching to comfort their own religious conceptions about Jesus Christ and his burial Shroud ! And I should also say that some of them are also seeking their own little glory, which can be even worse. And I also want to say is this : I wish all the best to M. Zugibe in 2012 because I’ve learned that he have important health problems. It’s not because I’m very critical versus some of his conclusions about the man of the Shroud that I cannot wish him well on a personal level !.","date":"2012-01-13","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/metaphors-or-mix-up/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Metaphors or Mix Up?"},{"id":"comment-7011","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Co, I think we should let our friend Ron in his belief ! You and me knows that Barbet’s experiments were totally consistent with what we see in the wrist area of the Shroud ! As I said the other day : When someone has made up his mind about something regarding the Shroud, no matter how good the arguments or facts you bring to him, no way he will change his mind. This is Barrie Schwortz own words and he was god damn right !!! For Rogers and Barbet, I don’t think they were Gods and the proof of that is this : there’s some minor things they’ve said that I disagree ! So, you see ? I can I believe they are Gods ? And for Zugibe, I want to add something important : yes I criticize some of his conclusions, but there are still some that I find interesting. As a free thinker, how can I be 100% against everything a guy like Zugibe have said ? And as a free thinker, how can I be 100% for everything a guy like Rogers or Barbet have said ? It’s not the way it goes when you’re a real free thinker ! But, in the same time, I’ll say it again : Rogers and Barbet, to me, were amongst the only Shroud scientists to be able to go exactly where the facts were leading them without letting their faith (they were both believers by the way) interfered with the pure scientific facts and observations they had in front of them… Of course, they could made some errors or misinterpret some facts and observations, but, in the end, I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THEIR CONCLUSIONS AND IDEAS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY CONTRADICTED OVER THE YEARS BY WELL CONFIRMED EXPERIMENTS MADE BY OTHERS SCIENTISTS. Yes many of their ideas were challenged by many scientists or pseudo scientists (this is normal), but few of them have been able to really demonstrate scientifically that they were absolutely wrong. That’s why I consider most of their conclusions with higher esteem than many others. And that’s why I consider them to be 2 of the most important sindonologists of all time.

It’s true that, for Barbet, the lenght of the fingers never seem to be a problem, in the sense that his estimations show him that they were not abnormal in length versus a normal human being. But I wanted to show that it is a proven fact that the region of the hands on the Shroud shows some distortions. I don’t say it is major distortions, but nevertheless, there is some. It’s a proven fact. Keeping this fact in mind, we have to conclude that it is IMPOSSIBLE to estimate precisely the exact length of the fingers for the man of the Shroud… It’s simply impossible, scientifically speaking. Of course, we can give some length estimation from precise measurements like Barbet did, but the bottom line is : We’ll never 100% sure about the exact length of the fingers (and many other body parts), simply because there is some minor distortions, especially in the hands and thighs regions. THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT and it’s totally normal that it is that way for a cloth loosely draped over a dead body. It is the contrary (no distortion at all) that would have been abnormal !!! But having check out the drawing we can see in the paper written by Jackson, Ercoline and Downs, I have a feeling that the distortion in the region of the hands is more lateral. If it’s true, then we must assume that it is the larger of the hands that would be more distorted than the length of the fingers… Nevertheless, we have to assume that a minor distortion in the length must also be present..","date":"2012-01-18","mins":"11:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/metaphors-or-mix-up/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Metaphors or Mix Up?"},{"id":"comment-7088","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The best answer to Chris question is pretty evident : it is the FACT that there are some distortion in the frontal body image of the Shroud and those distortions are even bigger in the hands and thighs regions. Those distortions in the hands region are the most probable fact that can fully explain the unnaturally long appearance of the fingers on the Shroud. IN SCIENCE, A LOT OF TIMES, THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATIONS ARE THE BEST ONES !!! This scientific fact can be seen in a paper published in 1982 by Ercoline, Downs and Jackson from STURP that evaluate the possible distortions in the frontal image. The only sad thing about this study is the fact that the authors never did the same kind of examination in regard of the dorsal body image of the Shroud. I really don’t understand why they never did this particular study. I think it would be important and very interesting that someone could do this particular study. If we look at the 3 D images of the dorsal image, we see that this image, just like the frontal image, wasn’t done uniquely by direct contact. In that sense, it is very probable that there are some minor distortions too that would be found in the dorsal body image. But, for the moment, we can just guess that it’s the case since nobody has ever done a proper study of this region of the Shroud. What is interesting is the fact that Mario Latendresse did also a study of the frontal body image of the Shroud versus the most probable configuration of the Shroud over it and he was able to confirm the findings of the STURP study. But, unfortunately, Mario only did a study of the upper frontal part of the body images of the Shroud… Nevertheless, the bigger distortions that were found by the STURP team particularly in the hands region are the most probable answer to Chris question regarding the long fingers on the Shroud. And it’s pretty funny because this question is another example of a probable erroneous hypothesis proposed by doctor Zugibe. Effectively, he said that the long fingers on the Shroud are probably due to a rare syndrome called Marfan’s symdrome that Jesus would have suffered. This rare hereditary disease has among its symptoms elongated limbs, long spidery fingers, and a long, thin face… I’ve never seen a real Shroud expert that is an advocate of this particular hypothesis. If there is some who believe Zugibe’s idea, they’re not a big bunch. Since the study published by the STURP team, I really think this “exterme” hypothesis should not be considered as a good one to explain the long fingers on the Shroud. When you consider the distortions that were found by the STURP team (especially in the hands region), the chances that the explanation proposed by Zugube could be true is extremely low… I really think the proven distortions in the frontal image (especially in the hands region) are the solution for the mystery of the long fingers in the Shroud image..","date":"2012-01-17","mins":"9:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/metaphors-or-mix-up/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Metaphors or Mix Up?"},{"id":"comment-6767","author":"yannick_clément","post":"CO is totally right !!!

For the speculation question Ron, I want you to read my posts again ! I’ve clearly said that Zugibe’s hypothesis can be true, but like many questions regarding the Shroud, since we’re left with hypothesis and speculations (as you say), then we must judge what hypothesis has more chance to be close to the reality. And the best way to judge between 2 different hypothesis is, as I said before, to used the Occam razor principle. And, as I said before, when we used this principle, Barbet’s hypothesis reach a higher point in a probabilistic scale than Zugibe’s hypothesis, just because his description of the way of nailing the victims hands to the cross is much more simplier and more easy to do. That’s all I said. I never pretend Zugibe’s hypothesis is 100% off track. I just say that Barbet’s hypothesis seem more simple and easy to do in the context of a Roman crucifixion. In other word, the way Barbet describe the nailing of the wrist (and don’t forget that he made real experiments of nailing a dead body) seem more “natural” than Zugibe’s hypothesis, and don’t forget also that the outcome is the same : the wrist is completely locked and the victim cannot remove his hands from the cross, even if he pull hard with his arms.

I hope you understand what I mean. Because there are some well known and natural chemical processes (like the Maillard reaction) that can produce a coloration on a linen cloth very similar to what is seen on the Shroud, I think there are some good chances that science will one day resolve the mystery sorrounding this body image. Remember that, beside the STURP effort, there was NO other direct testing on the relic (except for the 1988 C14 dating) !!! STURP knew so well that more researches needed to be done that they planned a Phase 2 program around 1984 (for another series of direct tests), but unfortunatelly, they were turned down by Turin (mainly because of some pressure made by the radiocarbon labs) !!! So, I don’t want to offend you, but before crying out loud words like “supernatural” or “miracle” or “resurrection” regarding the body image that’s on the Shroud, let’s wait please for some more direct analysis on the relic. After that, if science still look for answers, then maybe we could talk about some unkown process involved that science isn’t able to understand for the moment. But until that day, I don’t think the STURP effort is enough to say that science have come full circle regarding the Shroud ! My feeling is that the image formation process have some chances to be something that science already understand well but that the STURP tests of the beginning of the 80s were not able to uncover completely. I think it’s more of a “finding the correct recipe” kind of thing… I have good hopes that a new series of direct testings (done properly and extensively) will help to answer many questions left opened by STURP. And even the STURP team was thinking exactly that way in the 80s because they planned a Phase 2 program !!! They knew that another series of tests could really help to find the truth about the Shroud. You know my feeling right now about the body image ? Maybe the answer to the mystery isn’t so extraordinary than most people think… And probably that resurrection had nothing to do (directly) with it. And don’t get me wrong, I believe in the resurrection and I believe the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, but because I’m a rational kind of guy, I refuse to associate the two. If science wasn’t able to resolve the mystery until this day, maybe it’s just because there wasn’t enough experiments done regarding natural chemical processes. Finding the exact “recipe” is not an easy task ! No doubt it takes A LOT of trials and I really don’t think there was enough trials until this day. MORE RESEARCHES NEED TO BE DONE ! Unfortunatelly, it’s not a research subject that attract a lot of scientist. But I think a second round of direct tests on the Shroud could help to awake the interest of some scientists, and also, a second round of direct tests will surely help to find the correct “recipe” for the image… That’s my feeling..","date":"2011-09-24","mins":"8:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/22/scientific-conclusions-changing-again/","cat":"science","title":"Scientific Conclusions Changing Again"},{"id":"comment-4001","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The only thing I will say is this (and I’ve already said this here) : NATURE CAN BE REALLY SURPRISING !!!!!! : ) People should NEVER forget this when it comes to speculate about what body image formation process was involved with the Shroud of Turin….","date":"2011-09-22","mins":"4:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/22/scientific-conclusions-changing-again/","cat":"science","title":"Scientific Conclusions Changing Again"},{"id":"comment-3986","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Excuse me but here in Quebec, Canada, the vast majority of devout catholics doesn’t care one bit about the Shroud of Turin !!!

I think that can explain pretty well why the Church is doing more exhibitions about the Shroud than about other relics. I don’t think it is a statement of the Church about the authenticity (because the authorities know full well that, whatever the relic is true or false, it has the power to make people meditate on the life, passion, death and resurrection of Christ), and I don’t think we can call this propaganda either because, if they would like to do a real propaganda with this relic, they would show it much more than they have done in the past century. We can even supposed that the Vatican would have organised a kind of world tour for the Shroud or something like that if the intention of the Church would be to used this Shroud for religious propaganda… That’s my perception as a Catholic who’s not attract at all by any “conspiracy” theories regarding the Shroud or anything else..","date":"2012-01-19","mins":"4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/19/the-state-of-skepticism-ridicules-works-right/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The State of Skepticism: Ridicule works. Right?"},{"id":"comment-7199","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I think your point can be true to a certain extend in the sense that I think there’s more people in the Church who believe the Shroud is authentic than there are people who believe any other relic could be authentic. In that sense, the Shroud stand by himself in comparison with other relics and that’s maybe a reason why the Church seem to use it more. The other reason I see is simply because the media have taken this relic into the World public scene like no other relics. The Shroud “popularity” is much more important than any other Christian relics and it’s another important aspect to consider when you analyse the acting of the Church versus this relic..","date":"2012-01-19","mins":"6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/19/the-state-of-skepticism-ridicules-works-right/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The State of Skepticism: Ridicule works. Right?"},{"id":"comment-12096","author":"yannick_clément","post":"To summarize Rogers thought about the body image formation (I think it’s necessary here), I would say that, for him, there were at least 3 major factors that played a decisive role for the intensity of the coloration : 1 The relative distance between the cloth and the body. 2 The relative amount of impurities present on the surface of the fibers. Note : For Rogers, the banding effect was caused by some differences in the amount of impurities and these differences could have been important depending on how vigorous was the bleaching of each batch of yarns. I also think it safe to assume that the evaporation concentration process due to the washing and the drying of the cloth could also account partially for the probable variation in the amount of impurities that were left on top of the fibers of the Shroud. 3 The relative amount and concentration of a reactive product. Note : For Rogers, it was different sorts of amines coming from the corpse and it is very probable that more amines could have come out from some particular parts of the body (like the nose and the mouth) versus other parts of the body. For Rogers, every one of these 3 factors played a major role in the formation of the body image on the Shroud. We can easily see the complexity of the body image formation for Rogers. And I think it’s particularly true for the very pale images on each side of the face ! As Mario said, the particular configuration of the Shroud in these regions (that could have influenced the distance between the body and the cloth) could have played a role in the image formation that could explain partially the very paleness of the body images on each side of the face, but if we follow Rogers thinking, that’s not the only factor that caused those very pale images there ! The FACT that there are lighter bands of threads there cannot be taken for simply a hazardous element that had absolutely no influenced at all in the image formation process (especially the resulting intensity of the image). In fact, most probably, this element also played a major role in the fact that the body images there are so pale. Also, it is possible to think that the amount and concentration of the reactive product (amines) could have been much lower in these areas, which could have also accentuate the very pale image that is present there. We have to remember that, for Rogers, the hair could have trapped a lot of the gas coming out of the nose and mouth, leaving much less gas on the sides of the face to react with the impurities at the surface of the cloth. And in this particular case, since there are lighter bands on each side of the face, it’s very probable that there were not many impurities present in these areas in order to produce a coloration anyway. So, in these particular areas, it is possible that there was not much gas present and not many impurities (and maybe a good distance between the corpse and the cloth). I think all these factors put together (every one playing some role in the image formation process) are responsible for the drastic change in the intensity of the body image there. I think, thanks to Rogers, that’s the most rational way to explain this drastic change. And I think that the #3 factor that I mentioned could also explain why, on the contrary to the image of the sides of the face, we easily see the image of the hair ! Like Rogers said, it is probable that the hair could have trapped more gas with the result of producing a very intense and define image of the hair on the Shroud. To conclude, I just want to say that it is also possible that there was other unknown factors at work in the Shroud and that they could also account partially for the drastic change of intensity we see on each side of the face. Since we don’t know the exact process (or processes) that were at work in the Shroud, we have to leave the door open for some other influential factors that could have taken part in the image formation on the Shroud. But nevertheless, I think the 3 major factors presented by Rogers could have been well enough to produce this kind of drastic change… And what is the most important thing to note is that Rogers hypothesis is consistent with ALL the major facts and observations we know about the Shroud. That’s the way the scientific method should be used (by taking account of every known elements and not just the ones that can fit well with your preconcieved ideas)..","date":"2012-06-08","mins":"1:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"}]
