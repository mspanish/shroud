All I said is that during a short period of time PRIOR to the image formation, the Shroud MUST have been manually compressed (this is the hypothesis I favored the most) or tightly wrapped around the body in order for the bloodstains to formed everywhere we see them on the Shroud. This is pure logic since we know that all these bloodstains came from a DIRECT contact transfer from the body to the cloth. But if the Shroud would have stayed compressed or tightly wrapped around the body at the time the image formation process was active, no way we would see the kind of image that is on the Shroud (i.e. A body image that got no evident distortions but just minor ones in some places). A Shroud compressed or tightly wrapped around the body would have produced an highly destorted image. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

They will produce a color. This is not a hypothesis: this is a fact. A cloth with crude starch on it will ultimately produce a color, if it is left in close proximity to a decomposing body.” Here, it’s very important to understand that, in Rogers mind (and scientifically speaking, he’s right), a dead body is already in the first “decomposition” state way before the appearance of the putrefaction (structural degradation), which generally starts between 36 and 72 hours after death. It is a known fact that a dead body can emit post mortem gases before the appearance of the putrefaction of the body. It is also important to note that you can change “crude starch” in Rogers’ statement for “saponaria residues” and that wouldn’t change much to the quote. The truth is that there are a bunch of possible source of reducing sugars that could have been present in the thin layer of carbohydrate impurities on top of the cloth… Crude starch has been already confirmed, while saponaria residues are still waiting to be found..","date":"2013-06-03","mins":"4:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-completely-inappropriate-experiment-nice-white-lab-coats-anyway/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A completely inappropriate experiment.

The second conclusion described by Barrie at the end of his paper is, in my mind, even more important than the first because it strongly support the idea that a Maillard reaction took at least part in the global image formation process that lead to the formation of the body image on the Shroud… Of course, many other processes could also have been active inside the Shroud but, personally, I would be very surprise (to say the least) if the image had been formed by a global process that completely exclude any Maillard reaction at all….","date":"2013-06-03","mins":"1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-completely-inappropriate-experiment-nice-white-lab-coats-anyway/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A completely inappropriate experiment.

And concerning the Maillard reaction hypothesis of Rogers, I don’t remember having read anything from him saying that a possible loose configuration of the cloth over the body could not have worked… Note that a “pretty loose configuration” just mean, in my mind, a cloth pulled over a body without the use of straps. In truth, while he was working on his hypothesis, Rogers must have been aware that an untight configuration of the cloth over the body was the most rational one to explain the lack of important distortions in the body image, especially lateral distortions. Of course, this is a guess from me but I doubt that he was really thinking of a very tight configuration of the Shroud that would have been strap around the body while working on his gaseous diffusion hypothesis, because such a tight configuration would certainly have caused important lateral distortions during the gaseous diffusion process which would have lead to the image formation.

That don’t necessarily mean that the image on the Shroud is due to the same kind of process, but this good confirmation of Rogers’ claim that every time a must be seen as a pretty good starting point for other experiments done under better conditions. 3 Those who accuse me of having a bias in favor of this experiment should look at themselves in the mirror because I think it’s faire to assume that you got a bias in disfavor of the same experiment.

The simple fact that, at microscopic level, the pig experiment gave a VERY SIMILAR RESULT concerning the fibers that were colored by the Maillard reaction than what STURP has found in the image area of the Shroud can surely be seen as a strong argument in favor of the idea that a Maillard reaction is at least part of the solution for the body image on the Shroud.

Nice white lab coats, anyway"},{"id":"comment-36182","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s a comment I wrote principally for Max and Dave on the issue of the most probable configuration of the Shroud versus Rogers’ Maillard hypothesis: Here’s probably the most relevant quote from Rogers book related to the probable draping configuration of the cloth over the body : « The image seems to show the body of a man, and IT IS DARKEST IN AREAS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSEST TO THE BODY’S SURFACE. » Note the prudence in Rogers’ statement. But anyway, if is assumption is correct (and the 3 D study performed by Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline of STURP strongly support this), then we must assume that the cloth was not tightly wrapped around the body when the image formation process was active, because if that would have been the case, the resulting image would have been dramatically distorted laterally, especially in rounded zones like the face, the arms and the thighs. In other words, there would have been much more dark zones in the image as the ones present today, because the cloth would have been in direct contact with a very good portion of the body, thus producing dark zones almost everywhere that would have certainly distorted the resulting image very much. No doubt that, in such a tight configuration context, the final images of the face, the arms and the thighs would have been much larger than the ones we see on the Shroud… This is pure logical thinking based on the statement of Rogers I gave you at the beginning. In sum, this statement of Rogers, when you link it with the 3 D study done by Jackson et al. Of STURP (see for example figure 10 of their paper which show a possible draping configuration over the body), really seems to suggest that he was aware that the most probable configuration of the cloth was somehow loosely draped over the body without being firmly hold by strips of cloths or something similar. And in such context, Rogers was confident enough in his hypothesis to publish it and defend it until his death. Because of all this, I really don’t think it’s fair to conclude that a possible loose configuration of the Shroud over the body would be enough to discard Rogers’ hypothesis as being unable to produce a high resolution and undistorted body image (except for some slight distortions) like the one we see on the Shroud. I really don’t think such a configuration was problematic at all in the mind of Rogers versus his Maillard hypothesis… Note that the conclusion of a pretty loose configuration of the Shroud over the body when the image formation occurred is also supported by the configuration study done by Mario Latendresse that he published in 2005. In this paper, Latendresse concluded that the Shroud was probably not flattened over the body when the image formation was active, in the way described by Lavoie and others. This was the primary conclusion of this study but when you read it, it’s pretty easy to note that Latendresse did not support also the idea of the very tight configuration of the Shroud, which would have been hold closely around the body by linen strips in the way it is often shown on TV (even in the program showing Jackson making a “reproduction” of the Shroud’s draping over the corpse)… Figures 4 and 6 of his paper are showing a model of cloth configuration that is pretty loose over the body and which is not hold firmly around the body with straps or something similar, which imply that the most probable configuration of the Shroud for him was also a pretty loose one (i.e. A kind of normal draping configuration when a cloth is loosely draped over a body without any packing of the cloth on the sides or any strapping to hold it closer to the body)..","date":"2013-06-05","mins":"10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-completely-inappropriate-experiment-nice-white-lab-coats-anyway/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A completely inappropriate experiment.

The only difference between the image formation process and the bloodstains formation process is this : in the first case, the still unknown phenomenon acted both by direct contact and at a very short distance, while in the second case, the well known phenomenon called “exudates of humid blood clots” acted only by direct contact….","date":"2013-05-04","mins":"8:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/04/a-mysterious-work-of-art/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A mysterious work of art?"},{"id":"comment-32913","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The brownish images of plants and leaves on paper produced by the natural process called the Volckringer pattern are also really “perfect” but, nevertheless, they are produced completely by a natural process involving only the known laws of nature.

And believe me, he would have been able to knock out collinsberry anti Rogers arguments in one single punch. If someone really think that Rogers didn’t know well things like the primary cell wall or the way carbohydrates impurities on linen that were colored by a Maillard reaction would react to water, you must be someone who still doubt that the earth is round ! Incredible… As Barrie Schwortz once said to me, when someone has made up his mind on the Shroud, there’s NO WAY this person will ever be able to change it. Remember that after Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead, there were still people to deny it !!! When someone DON’T WANT to see, what can you do about that ??? If Rogers clearly state that “Water stained image areas on the Shroud showed that image color does not dissolve or migrate in water. Maillard products are not water soluble, and they do not moved when wetted.”, I don’t really see one good reason to deny this fact. And what is not said in Rogers quote is that he was not talking about some fabrication of beer or another food product. He was referring instead to a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities that were colored on top of a linen cloth. So, if Collinsberry still want to deny Rogers conclusions on this topic, then please show us some scientific proof that carbohydrates impurities that are present on top of some fibers and that were colored by a Maillard reaction can be water soluble… The link he gave us talk only about food industry and some beverages like sweet wine or dessert wine, and beer. We’re very far from a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities sitting on top of a linen cloth that would have been colored.

But it’s a fact that Mc Crone discovered some starch fractions in fibers from image areas. This was later confirmed by Rogers himself. That fact alone proves that there really are some impurities on the Shroud. Also, and this is often forgotten, Al Adler, near the end of his life, talk about some tests he made to check out if there wouldn’t be some pectin impurities on the cloth and he was able to demonstrate with both chemical test and spectral analysis that it was really the case ! You can read this in his book “The Orphaned Manuscript”. Those pectin impurities, along the starch impurities, were probably deposited on the top surface of the cloth by the evaporation concentration process after the cloth was washed and dried. Adler did this check out after a Frenchman named Stéphane Mottin emit the hypothesis that the cloth light fluorescence was caused by some deposit of pectin on top of the fibers and that this deposit came from the retting process of the flax plant (note : this is the very first step done to make a linen cloth). I’m not an expert but it seems pretty obvious to me that those pectin impurities come directly from the pectin present inside the primary cell wall. In other words, the retting process seems to be able to extract some of the pectin present in the pcw and make some deposit of this substance on top of the linen fibers… Bizarrely, Rogers never talk about this finding from Adler. It’s bizarre because it seem, at first sight, to be a confirmation of his hypothesis concerning a thin layer of impurities present on the top surface of the cloth… Anyway, scientifically speaking, it is almost sure that there are at least 2 sorts of impurities on top of the cloth, namely starch and pectin impurities, and there can be even some other carbohydrates impurities that are still waiting to be confirmed (like the saponaria for example). The fact that there are at least 2 sorts of carbohydrates impurities doesn’t prove that this was the elements that were colored during the image formation process but, nevertheless, this was probably the case since, at least for the starch impurities, this kind of carbohydrates impurity is much easier to color than the linen fibers themselves (that’s Rogers words). And the question of Collin is this : If the chromophore of the coloration is really a thin layer of impurities, why the water stains on the Shroud don’t seemed to had any effect on this colored layer ? Good question ! In the same sense, we could also ask ourselves the question : While Adler report that there are a lot of little blood particles stuck inside the threads on the Shroud (they were taken out of the surface of the blood clots by abrasion because of the numerous folding and handling of the cloth), why Adler report that there seem to be no particles of coloration struck inside the threads ? Those 2 observations (i.e. Nothing in the image has moved with the water and there is no sign of abrasion on the surface of the image fibers) seem to prove that the coloration that has formed the image is pretty hard to disaggregate. The fact that we need to use very strong chemical agents like diimide to reduce the color seem to confirm that. All those observations lead to only one conclusion : the coloration is very stable and is not soluble in water. Now, the question is this : if the image come from a dehydration oxidation process that has colored a thin layer of impurity, is it normal that this colored layer of impurities is not soluble in water ? One thing’s for sure, Ray Rogers was fully aware of the 2 observations I just report here… So, it seems pretty obvious that, at least for him, a colored layer of carbohydrates impurities that was formed by a dehydration oxidation process is not supposed to be soluble in water ! If this wasn’t the case, do you really think for 2 seconds that Rogers would have emit his hypothesis concerning the Maillard reaction ??? Do you really think an expert in chemistry like Rogers didn’t thought about this aspect of the question ??? Seriously, this idea seem completely ridiculous… Anyway, just to verify that aspect of the question, I made a search in Rogers book for an answer. And I had no difficulty at all to find it !!! Here’s the quote I found on page 106 of Rogers book : “Water stained image areas on the Shroud showed that image color does not dissolve or migrate in water. Maillard products are not water soluble, and they do not moved when wetted.” This single quote prove that my expectations regarding the professionalism of Ray Rogers were right ! On this specific question of the water stains, I think we can say without any doubts that Rogers proved his case ! My friend Collin, I think you’ll have to look elsewhere in order to find a good argument against Rogers hypothesis !!! I recommend you to start with a good reading of Rogers book that you can buy here : http://www.lulu.com/shop/raymond n rogers/a chemists perspective on the shroud of turin/ebook/product 15663522.html Take care of all the details you will found in this book and reflect upon them.

But having said that, I should add this : Since they are both hypothesis, can someone tell me what they do in a list of FACTS ??? I repeat what I said in my recent paper published here : The only acceptable phrasing concerning the chromophore of the image is this : “The coloration of the body image results from a dehydration oxydation process involving some kind of carbohydrates on the top surface of the cloth” That’s why I ask M. Rolfe to reconsider again the point #1 of his list and change it for what I just said. Now, for the second part of the point #1 that state : “There is no body image beneath the bloodstains.”, I think it should not be mixed with the coloration of the body image and be put in another independent point in his list. And I also think that this point could be extend like this : “There is no body image beneath the bloodstains and the serum stains.” Adler discovered that both the blood on the Shroud AND the serum on the Shroud have been able to protect the cloth during the image formation process and that’s very important to note. For example, that was one of the observation that lead Ray Rogers to conclude that the image formation process was a very MILD process, involving probably some kind of chemical reaction(s) on top of the cloth and that this reaction took place most probably at NORMAL temperature, without any emission of heat. That’s why I think this second part of the point #1 SHOULD be separate from the first part and also should be extend to include the serum stains. This is not a banal fact !!! The image formation process had absolutely NO EFFECT whatsoever on both the bloodstains and the serum stains that were already on the Shroud when it took place. At least, because of this recent change in the list of M. Rolfe, I have a sense that this blog has contribute to change things in some people’s head and I’m really happy to see this. That proves the valor of this blog. Of course, I’m not dumb enough to think that this change uniquely comes from me and some other bloggers, but I’m sure M. Rolfe has read all that we have written here and take that into account. I even have a sense that my recent paper about Rogers quotes have been a real eye opener for some people ! Now, if M. Rolfe really wants to write the better possible list of facts he can, he MUST change his point #1 to something like what I just said about the dehydration oxydation process, without any reference to the real chromophore of the image, whether it’s the linen fiber or the impurities, because, for the moment, we can’t be 100% sure of the correct answer to this question. And even more than this, there is even a possibility that the real chromophore could be found, at least in some parts of the Shroud (like, for example, the images of the hair, mustache, beard, etc.), in both an impurities layer residing on the surface of the cloth AND ALSO in the primary cell wall of the most superficial fibers on top of the cloth ! In other words, there’s still a possibility that both hypotheses can be true (to some extend) ! I think even Thibault Heimburger would agree with me about that !!! ; ) But to be perfect, I really think that M. Rolfe should do another change in the point #1 of his list and put the fact concerning the absence of an image under the bloodstains (and the serum stains) in a new and independent point..","date":"2012-05-19","mins":"5:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/19/a-parenthetical-change-in-the-valencia-consensus/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Parenthetical Change in the Valencia Consensus"},{"id":"comment-11473","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If you constantly doubt the profesionnalism of someone who was a head chemist in a place like Los Alamos, it’s your choice but I think it’s a bad one….","date":"2012-05-20","mins":"6:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/19/a-parenthetical-change-in-the-valencia-consensus/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Parenthetical Change in the Valencia Consensus"},{"id":"comment-206046","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Low penetration maybe… But what was the distance between the laser and the target (i.e. The linen sample)?

Rogers did not invent the fact that starch had been found on Shroud fibers in order to comfort his image formation hypothesis. That’s the contrary in fact! Once he get convinced that starch deposits were really present on the Shroud, that’s when he started to think of an image formation process that would have colored, not the fibers themselves (like he was thinking when he wrote his STURP paper), but that kind of impurities instead, which are MORE EASY TO COLOR CHEMICALLY THAN THE LINEN FIBERS (INCLUDING THE PRIMARY CELL WALL). By the way, can you give me the name of the paper in which Adler and Heller wrote that they tested for starch and did not find any? I don’t remember having read something of that nature coming from them… Also, you must consider the fact that, along with Rogers (who did test for starch and came up with a positive result), Mc Crone too found starch in his analysis of Shroud samples… In science, when you got two independent positive results concerning one topic, you should start to consider this positive result with much more confidence. Last thing: Daveb is right! The fact that diimide is able to remove all color, while leaving behind a clean and undammaged fiber is one crucial fact that fits well with Rogers’ hypothesis concerning the image chromophore.

Higher molecular weight starch fractions are MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO HYDROLYZE than are polypentose containing plant gums. Some starch could be detected on H Cl cleaned Raes fibers with an aqueous iodine reagent.” And here’s another quote from Rogers’ book concerning the detection of starch fraction he made on his Shroud samples: “Walter (Mc Crone) also stated that he had found wheat starch on the Shroud. We confirmed this by microchemical testing with aqueous iodine, supporting an hypothesis that the cloth had been made by ancient methods.” By the way, I have read the part of Heller and Adler’s paper in which they stated that they couldn’t find starch residues on their samples. However, in the same section, the authors made a prudent comment, telling their readers that this doesn’t mean starch residues and others residues were not present originally on the Shroud. This could simply mean that these residues have “been “lost” over time through oxidation, degradation, etc.” Taking this into account, I think it’s fair to say that even if Mc Crone and Rogers’ positive results for the detection of starch residues on the Shroud (independent results) would have been in fact false positive results for some reasons (I don’t believe this, but let’s assume it’s right), we would still have no right to state categorically that starch have not been used to manufacture the Shroud, that starch fractions have never been present on the top surface of the cloth and/or that these starch fractions have never been part of the material that have been colored by the image formation process. Last thing: Some years ago, I wrote a paper entitled “My thoughts on a recently published paper by Raymond N. Rogers” (it can be found on shroudnm.com library) concerning the first paper Rogers wrote once he got back to Shroud research at the beginning of the 21st Century. That paper is entitled “An Alternate Hypothesis for the Image Color” and was written in 2001, prior the writing of his book and prior to the publishing of his paper entitled “THE SHROUD OF TURIN: AN AMINO CARBONYL REACTION (MAILLARD REACTION) MAY EXPLAIN THE IMAGE FORMATION”, which he wrote with Arnoldi. There’s a couple of things I wrote in my paper that truly deserves to be read by Hugh because it could show him how Rogers built his image formation hypothesis while respecting the proper scientific method (unlike what he thinks). Here’s what I wrote in page 1 of my paper: “On the contrary to many Shroud researchers who have proposed in recent years their image formation “theories” (mostly supernatural hypotheses related to the Resurrection of Jesus that involve some form of energetic radiation), this “new” paper of Rogers clearly shows that this great scientist had no preconceived ideas about what would have been the main reactive agent (his words: “catalytic compound”) that initiated the formation of the image on the cloth. Effectively, this paper clearly shows that, when he wrote it in 2001, Rogers had not found out yet the Maillard reaction hypothesis (including the idea that some post mortem gases were the main catalytic compounds) he would propose later on and he was, for the moment, favoring the presence of skin perspiration (sweat) and/or skin secretions, including skin oils (which are biological substances that were tested by Samuel Pellicori of STURP), as the most probable catalytic compounds which could have initiated, with the help of heat released by the dead body, a caramelization process of a portion of the top most fibers on the top surface of the cloth. This shows how science should work (i.e. Always keep following all the pertinent data and observations in order to develop a rational hypothesis and adjust it along the way as necessary) and also how science should not work (i.e. Never start with a preconceived notion of what must have been the cause of a phenomenon, in this case, the formation of the body image on the Shroud), in order to avoid the strong temptation of considering only the data and observations that can possibly “fit” with your preconceived idea, while leaving aside all the other data and observations that can be truly problematic to your hypothesis.” And here’s another relevant quote from my paper, which can be found at the bottom of page 1: “After the reading of Rogers’ “new” paper, it’s quite evident that the impurity hypothesis he proposed for the question of the image chromophore was the corner stone and also the starting point of his whole hypothesis for image formation and that was still the case when he proposed his Maillard reaction later on, which proves the solidity of this particular hypothesis (at least, in Rogers’ mind). For him, the presence of a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities on the top surface of the cloth was the most probable explanation for two of the most “mysterious” characteristics of the image, i.e. The discontinuous distribution of the yellowed fibers in the image area and the very superficial aspect of the image, which affected only the top most fibers on the surface of the cloth” I hope these quotes will help Hugh to understand that Rogers did not come up with the idea of Maillard reactions for the image formation and then tried to build a hypothesis concerning the image chromophore that would fit with such a mild chemical process. This 2001 paper of Rogers PROVES that he did the contrary in fact, which is totally consistent with a real professional scientist who followed the scientific method properly. This include the fact that, obviously, Rogers was 100% convinced that starch fractions were really present on his Shroud samples, since this particular discovery was the starting point of his whole image formation hypothesis (which, at the beginning, didn’t involved Maillard reactions but a caramelization process coming from skin perspiration (sweat) and/or skin secretions)! Here’s a message to all the Rogers detractors: If you don’t like Rogers’ hypotheses and conclusions (which are still waiting to be confirmed), you have the right to do so and to prefer other hypotheses and conclusions, but that doesn’t change a thing versus the fact that he followed the scientific method properly, which is not what I can see of some other Shroud researchers who, in recent years, have came up with supernatural hypotheses for image formation and then (only afterward) have come up with a hypothesis for the chromophore that would fit with the mechanism they already proposed! This is not what science should look like and, when it comes to those researchers, truly they deserve some hard critics. That’s not the case for Rogers. But having said that, it’s important to add this: that doesn’t mean that all his conclusions and hypotheses concerning the Shroud are 100% correct. That simply means that his inquiry about the Shroud was done properly (scientifically speaking) with honesty, which truly deserves some consideration if you (like me) really seek the truth concerning the Shroud.

Much more researches (including lab experiments) need to be done before anyone got the right to do so!

What he did when he found that out (probably thanks to Rogers experiment with corona discharge)? He came out and tried hard to make believe the color on the Shroud was precisely located there (in the primary cell wall instead of just Inside the impurity layer)!!! Di Lazzaro followed closely afterward with pretty much the same idea. That’s not how science is suppose to operates. I’m not certain you understand how Rogers really built his hypothesis… The impurities are the corner stone of it and if he wasn’t 100% sure that there was such a coating on top of the Shroud, he would have propose a very different hypothesis! The fact that he never change his mind versus the impurity coating is very telling. Again, I’ll say this: that kind of hypothesis for the image chromophore is the only one to date that can explain rationally two of the most bizarre feature of the Shroud image, i.e. The discontinuous distribution of the yellowed fibers in the image area and the very superficial aspect of the image, which affected only the top most fibers on the surface of the cloth. That should tell you something, especially when it comes to the ultra superficiality… ALL the Shroud fibers got a primary cell wall and not just those located on the top surface of the cloth. This fact is very hard to match with the extreme superficiality, especially in zones of direct contacts. Last thing: you said that Di Lazzaro matches the color and depth of penetration. Maybe. But this is certainly not the only characteristics of the Shroud image he had to match, which I don’t think he succeeded, like the one Rogers described concerning the fact that there are no more structural defects on image fibers than on non image fibers… It’s impossible to color the primary cell wall of a fiber with a laser without leaving evident defects that a specialist like Rogers would have certainly noticed. He did not. Also, as I said earlier, I have great doubt Di Lazzaro could produce the same depth of color penetration with his laser if he would locate it in direct contact with the linen sample (we don’t know the distance his laser was from the target when he achieve his “good” coloration, but it certainly wasn’t located in direct contact with the sample)..","date":"2015-07-19","mins":"6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"id":"comment-206211","author":"yannick_clément","post":"1.One last piece of evidence : In 2005, the SSG published the famous list of data coming from the Shroud (www.shroud.com/pdfs/doclist.pdf). This list of evidences included the presence of starch impurities in it and Fanti was among those who signed this document! At that time, he was already pushing in favor of his Corona discharge hypothesis and had no idea that such a discharge could not produce a color that would be restricted to this kind of thin layer of impurities. In 2008, the book of Rogers was published in which he describe an experiment he made with Corona discharge and show that the color was located inside the primary cell wall of the linen fiber (he didn’t used the term « primary cell wall », but that what he meant anyway), while clearly stating that this was NOT the same kind of chromophore as what he saw on his Shroud sample (reading that part of Rogers book, it’s obvious that, for him, this kind of result was very different). Less than 2 years after the publication of Rogers, here comes Fanti with his idea of a color located solely inside the primary cell wall!!! What a coincidence my friends! If Rogers would have been there, you can bet he would have crushed this idea of Fanti to the ground! And then, after he published his idea in a paper that came out in 2010, he changed the list published in 2005 and present a new list of evidence at the Shroud conference of Frascati in which we don’t find the presence of starch impurities no more and it was replaced by the primary cell wall as the chromophore of the image! It was about the time Di Lazzaro became involved in Shroud research in partnership with Fanti at the time (he was among those who signed the 2010 paper in which they pushed the primary cell wall hypothesis that was discard by Rogers himself in his book).

All of the analytical tests described by Heller and Adler would apply to these impurity colors. All colored fibrils should color to approximately the same degree, depending on the amount/thickness of the impurity layer, explaining the “half tone” effect STRUP reported.” The most important thing to remember is the fact that the impurities are the corner stone of Rogers’ hypothesis about image formation and he first thought that the color reaction was due to skin secretion and/or perspiration coming in contact with these impurities. It’s only afterward that he changed his mind about the most probable “catalytic compound”, which were post mortem gases (heavy amines along with ammonia).

I also read parts of Thibault Heimburger’s paper “ROGERS’ MAILLARD REACTION HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINED IN DETAIL BY ROGERS HIMSELF”. In pages 94 and 95 of Heller and Adler’s paper, we can read this: “These tests were performed on the uncoated (with blood) fibrils: body image, non image and scorch fibrils. With the exception of positive aldehyde and cellulosic carboxyl tests, all other species tested for tested negatively. Thus we see no evidence for stains or dyes ON THE BODY IMAGE FIBRILS at levels that would be evident to the eye.” Then, in page 15 of Heimburger’s paper, we can read these lines from Rogers himself: “Figure 3 of the attachment shows how the different pyrolysis products appear as the sample is heated, with the total ion current being the lower graph. There was RELATIVELY LITTLE POLYSACCHARIDE OF LOWER STABILITY LEFT ON THAT IMAGE FIBER. I have assumed that this showed DEPLETION OF REDUCING SACCHARIDES AS A RESULT OF IMAGE FORMATION.” “Crude starch is composed of a very large number of different chain lengths, and they all have different properties. Remember that the image was not soluble in the water that percolated through parts of it in 1532. Many of the components of crude starch are soluble in water; therefore, I assume that image areas ARE NO LONGER POLYSACCHARIDES.” Even if Heller and Adler described their tests as having been performed on both image and non image fibers, as well as on scorch fibers, the sentence that immediately follow in which they talked about body image fibrils only seemed strange to me and lead me to think of one real possibility, which is that, for at least some of the organic species and functional groups they tested (maybe including starch), they only tested image fibers, which could explain why the test they did for starch came up with a negative result. To understand my thinking, I suggest that you read again the 2 quotes from Rogers I just give you in which he said that the image formation process could have changed the chemical composition of reducing saccharides (which could includes starch) that could have taken part in the image formation… Note that, after all, these specific tests done by Heller and Adler concerning organic species and functional groups had one major goal: to see if one or more of these substances could have been responsible for the image (all this with the idea in mind that this image could be the work of a forger). I’m not an expert at all and I don’t know if Heller and Adler did run all their tests on both image and non image fibers. I just gives you one possible explanation for why they did not find any traces of starch during their tests, while Mc Crone and Rogers did get positive results… It seems evident to me, especially after reading the 2 quotes from Rogers, that he surely did performed his own test for starch on a non image fiber, which is maybe the contrary of what Heller and Adler did at the beginning of the 80s. Again, we must understand that their main goal with these tests was to check out the artistic forgery scenario concerning the body image and if it’s true that, for starch, they only tested an image fiber, this could explain quite well why their test came up with a negative result (i.e. Because, as Rogers said, the image formation process could well have changed the composition of the starch fractions that would have been involved in the image formation process). What do you think of such a possibility? If Heller or Adler would still be with us today, we would get the truth about that… But read again the quote from their paper that I gave you at the beginning of my comment. Note how they seem to focus only on the body image fibers… Is it possible that the reason why they didn’t found any traces of starch is simply because they didn’t used a non image fiber when they were checking out this specific substance? I simply ask the question… Personally, I think this is a true possibility that would explain many things. I other words, is it possible that the negative result obtained by Heller and Adler for starch was in fact a “false negative” result due to the fact that they would only have used an image fiber for this specific test and that the starch that would have been there originally would have been modified chemically during the image formation process, thus leading to a negative result? I simply ask the question… I don’t think this is a dumb question! One thing’s for sure: The great confidence showed by a great chemist like Rogers concerning the presence of carbohydrate impurities (including starch) on the top surface of the cloth (remember that it became the corner stone of his image formation hypothesis and remained that way up until his death) makes me think that he was right. Effectively, I just don’t see a Professional like him building an important hypothesis like that on something that he would have had some doubts about its reality… And if Heller and Adler only used an image fiber to see if there was starch on the Shroud, it’s not surprising at all if the result was negative. But because we don’t know this for sure and there’s still conflicting evidences about this issue, I’m afraid the question concerning the presence of starch on the Shroud’s surface will have to be settled (like many other issues regarding the Shroud) by a new series of direct tests that would be performed on the cloth… Unfortunately, I don’t expect to see this in a near future..","date":"2015-07-21","mins":"7:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"id":"comment-206289","author":"yannick_clément","post":"It’s important to note that Adler and Heller were honest enough to clearly state in their paper that, even if they got a negative result for various substances, this do not represent a definitive result to state that none of them were not present originally on the cloth and this includes starch and saponaria… And the fact that Rogers, later on, was able to detect starch fractions (but no traces of saponaria) seems to indicate that, at least for starch, this substance was effectively present on the top surface of the cloth at the time of the image formation..","date":"2015-07-21","mins":"12:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"id":"comment-206021","author":"yannick_clément","post":"VERY GOOD QUESTIONS and I think asking them gives us already the answer!

But also, the STURP team was able to determine that the color that reside on one single fiber possess the same degree of intensity (yellow straw color) no matter if the body was in direct contact with the Shroud or distant from it by less than 4 cm.

Di Lazarro and his team show the results of those lasers on linen when the lasers are in direct contact with the cloth and compare the result when the lasers are 1 cm away from the cloth, 2 cm away, 3 cm away, 4 cm away, 5 cm away, etc., etc. I am curious to know if the results will be the same each time regarding the color intensity and also regarding the degree of penetration into the fiber… All those results would be nice to read in another scientific article.

If the distance was more than 4 cm, then your result is clearly NOT identical the the Shroud, because we know for a fact that the image formation process was unable to produce any visible color beyond 4 cm. 2 Have you tried the same experiment (with the same exact source of energy) with the laser being located in direct contact with the target (i.e. The linen sample) and then to compare the coloration result you could get with the one you already got (which I have to guess was obtained with a laser not located in direct contact with the sample)? In all logic, you should see some evident differences between the two results… Also, I would like to react concerning one claim made by Mr. Di Lazzaro that I hear all the time from those who contest Rogers’ conclusions that the image on the Shroud could not have been produced by any type of energetic radiation, which can be summarized like this : Rogers based his claim solely on the experiments he did with some high intensity sources of energies. This is a WRONG statement! In his book and in some of his papers, Rogers brought a lot of others scientific reasons to explain why, in any way, the Shroud image could have been produced by any type of energetic radiations. Here are some of those reasons (just a few among others) that can all be found in my paper “Raymond N. Rogers’ observations and conclusions concerning the body image that is visible on the Shroud of Turin” : 1 “An average flax fiber is 10 20 microns in diameter, and some lower fibers are colored in image areas. Any radiation that colored the circumference of two, superimposed fibers would have to penetrate at least 20 40 microns of cellulose. Radiation that penetrated the entire 10 20 microns diameter of a fiber would certainly affect the entire volume of the fiber, including the walls of the medulla (the cylindrical void in the center of the fiber). All image fibers (from the Shroud) show color on their outer surfaces, but the body of the fiber and the walls of the medulla are not colored.” 2 “We had found starch fractions on the cloth during chemical testing. I had to hypothesize that image color had formed in a layer of impurities. I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source: the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose. ” Note that when Rogers wrote « cellulose », he was obviously reffering to the whole linen fiber including the primary cell wall.” 3 “All parts of the Shroud are the same age, and all parts have been stored in the same location through the centuries. Therefore, all parts should have been exposed to the same kinds and amounts of (natural) radiation. Any additional radiation effects found in image areas would indicate excess radiation in that location. Direct comparison between image and non image parts of the Shroud show exactly the same amounts and types of radiation damage in the two types of areas. This suggests that the image was not produced by any mechanism that involved heat, light, or ionizing radiation.” 4 “All parts of a cloth will show the same (natural) radiation damage, unless there has been specific radiation in limited areas. Image areas (of the Shroud) do not show any evidence for excess radiation.” 5 “The primary result of irradiation of cloth with energetic photons is heat. The blood was never heated to a temperature concordant with an intense flux of vacuum ultraviolet photons.” 6 “The blood could be removed with proteolytic enzymes. The blood had not been cross linked by irradiation. It is extremely unlikely that any form of radiation interacted with the cloth.” Isn’t that enough? Coming from someone who was a real expert in radiation and who had the opportunity to study the Shroud up close and personal, that’s good enough for me… We must look elsewhere than energetic radiations to find the right explanation for the image on the Shroud. Important note : This statement of mine doesn’t mean the Maillard reaction hypothesis of Rogers is the solution to the image formation… Last thing : Rogers’ paper about radiation effect was a paper he wrote for the general public. The few examples of coloration experiments he did with energetic radiations that we find in it must never been understand has being the only (or even the primary) thing on which Rogers based his conclusion that the Shroud image is not the product of energetic radiation… The few experiments he did were only intent to show clear examples of the general effects of energetic radiations on linen fibers..","date":"2015-07-17","mins":"10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-very-helpful-answer-from-paolo-di-lazzaro/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Very Helpful Answer from Paolo Di Lazzaro"},{"id":"comment-206170","author":"yannick_clément","post":"AMEN.

It seems like there’s constantly a battle out there between an authentic quest to find the scientific truth about the Shroud (whatever it could be) and a quest to backed up a religious belief (hidden behind a pretension to do science). Unfortunately, I’m not sure that the first quest is looking strong in that battle and I really think it’s a bad thing for the future of sindonology. You wonder why the Vatican has blocked every proposal of direct testing on the relic ? You can be sure that the rising of the second type of quest I just described has a lot to do with that. If the vast majority of the modern scientists who study the Shroud would be members of the first quest I described (without being driven by some preconceived notion of what the Resurrection is supposed to have been and have produced), you can be sure that more studies of the relic would have been permitted since a long time. To me, the problem is not the Turin Centro or the Vatican, but it is much more the supernatural fringe who constantly try hard to prove the Resurrection while using the Shroud. That’s where we found the real problem of sindonology and to me, that’s the main reason why any proposal for direct research on the cloth is constantly blocked. When you think of all the great scientist who has studied the Shroud over the years (some are still there) without having this kind of religious agenda in the back of their mind, the present situation is really a shame ! Let’s just pray that any member of the supernatural fringe will never be able to touch the Shroud in their lifetime because if they did, we’re done !!!

Rolfe, may I suggest you to take a fresh crucified corpse that was highly beaten and tortured for several hours prior to his death and put it in a linen shroud that has a carbohydrate layer of impurities on the top surface. Then let it cool down at room temperature in a closed place without any air current for at least 36 hours. I almost can guarantee you that you’ll have some colors on the cloth after heating it to simulates aging. I don’t say that you’ll get a body image as perfect as the one on the Shroud but I’m almost sure that you’ll get something. I just cannot imagine that after 36 hours, a highly tortured and crucified corpse would not have emit a pretty good quantity of amines gases (starting with a pretty good quantity of ammonia gas). And if there was such a released of gases by this tortured corpse in the first 36 hours after death, it’s almost sure that you’ll get some coloration on the cloth IF (the IF is important) there is a thin coating of carbohydrates impurities on the top surface of the cloth. Like Rogers said : this is not an hypothesis, this is a fact. If amines (ammonia included) gases come in contact with a layer of carbohydrates impurities, there will be a chemical reaction that will leave a coloration. Again, this is a scientific fact. I don’t pretend that the hypothesis of Rogers for image formation can surely explain 100% of the image but I’m trully convinced that it his hypothesis concerning the chromophore of the image (the thin layer of impurities) could be independently confirmed one day, then Rogers hypothesis for image formation could well be good enough to explain at least a good portion of image we see on the cloth. In what proportion ? Very hard to tell without real laboratory tests done with real corpses of mammals or even with real human corpses… In the end, like I said in my recent comment that Dan have given you the link, the most important thing to answer right now is the question of the chromophore of the image. Then we will be well armed to discuss and debate about the possible image formation mechanism !.","date":"2012-09-20","mins":"3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/20/agenda-driven-shroud-science-what-a-pity/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Agenda Driven Shroud Science?

It’s really probable that the exact composition of this coating is very non homogeneous with more pectin in one place and more starch in another and probably more lignin elsewhere. That’s my feeling. Don’t forget that lignin is composed of polysaccharide that can surely be colored by amines. Here’s a definition of “polysaccharide” I have found somewhere on the net: “A complex sugar or carbohydrate like a starch, multiple sugars, or a fiber. A polysaccharide is defined as a molecule made of at least three molecules of simple sugar. The classes known as fibers are polysaccharides that include cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and LIGNIN.” Note that all the different elements that were named (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin) constitutes the composition of a flax fiber and some of them (lignin and pectin at least) have been detected as deposits on top of the fibers because of the retting process..","date":"2012-11-02","mins":"3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/02/an-image-formed-by-the-yellowing-of-lignon/","cat":"image_theory","title":"An image formed by the yellowing of Lignin?"},{"id":"comment-18798","author":"yannick_clément","post":"First of all, if lignin is not an polysaccharide, excuse me because I really thought it was the case. Anyway, that doesn’t mean for one second that some lignin deposits are not present in the most probable thin layer of impurities and could not have been colored as well by the amines coming out of the dead body that was under the Shroud. For Rogers, the image formation process acted as a dehydration of the thin layer of impurities and not as an oxidation of it (on the contrary to most supernatural hypotheses that relies on a burst of energy of some sort). Both process (oxidation or dehydration; alone or combined) could have produced the coloration on the Shroud, but in the hypothesis postulated by Rogers and preliminary tested by himself, no oxidation was at work but only a dehydration process. I’m almost convinced that if there was some lignin deposits present in the thin layer of impurities, the dehydration process thought by Rogers would also have colored it, as well as the starch deposits and the pectin deposits. Of course, I’m not a chemist and it would be nice if a real expert could confirm my idea. Here’s another important quote from Rogers that make me think that some lignin deposits (as well as some possible deposits of hemicellulose, which is another part of the PCW) could well be present in the thin layer of impurities postulated by Rogers: “All of the bleaching processes used through history remove lignin and most associated flax impurities (e.g., flax wax and hemicelluloses). The more quantitative the bleaching process, the whiter the product. The bands of different color on the Shroud are the end result of different amount impurities left from the bleaching process.” What I understand from this quote is the fact that the ancient mild bleaching of the shroud could well have left some residues of lignin, hemicellulose (and also pectin, which has been found by Adler) and flax wax on the fibers of the cloth because this kind of bleaching was much milder than more recent bleaching processes. And here’s the way I understand the formation of the thin layer of impurities (from what I’ve read in Rogers writtings): First, there was the retting process of the flax plant that would have left some deposits on top of the fibers. In all logic, these deposits would be formed by the elements that are naturally present inside and on the linen fiber (i.e. Pectin (as I said, this element had been confirmed by Adler to be present on top of the fibers), hemicellulose and flax wax) and that would have been “extracted” from the fiber during the retting process. Then, the bleaching process was done batch of yarns by batch of yarns with some slight diffrences in the intensity of the bleaching. That’s what would be responsible for the banding effect on the Shroud because the more vigourous the bleaching was, the more thin the layer of impurities would have been, leaving less material coming from the retting process and composing the thin layer of impurities (lignin, pectin, hemicellulose deposits and flax wax) to be colored on top of fibers. Then, AFTER THE BLEACHING, there was some starch that was used on the yarns just before the weaving and again, this procedure would have caused some more impurity deposits (made of starch of course) on top of the fibers. Then, AFTER THE WEAVING OF THE CLOTH WAS FINISHED, it was washed (with saponaria, which was indicated by Theophrastus or another soap product like the one indicated by Pliny the Elder, which is called heraclion and was made with olive oil) and left to dry in open air. This is when the very important process called the evaporation concentration appeared and would have taken almost every impurities that were inside the cloth (i.e. Pectine and starch for sure, along with probably some deposits of lignin, hemicellulose and/or flax wax and maybe some more deposits coming from the soap that was used) and would have concentrated them on the 2 external surface of the cloth. This evaporation concentration process is this process that would be responsible for the extreme superficiality of the body image and maybe also for the presence of a superficial image of the hair, beard and mustache on the back side of the cloth. You see folks ? If Rogers was correct about the thin layer of impurities (and I sure think he was), THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO CALL FOR A DIVINE INTERVENTION HERE IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THIS IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE BODY IMAGE !.","date":"2012-11-04","mins":"8:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/02/an-image-formed-by-the-yellowing-of-lignon/","cat":"image_theory","title":"An image formed by the yellowing of Lignin?"},{"id":"comment-18736","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s the 2 quotes I have found in Rogers book concerning the probable presence of lignin deposits on top of the most superficial fibers on the Shroud : In page 57 of Rogers book, he talks about a pyrolysis mass spectrometry analysis that he did on different samples from the Shroud. Here’s one important thing he said about this analysis : “Mass 131 appeared at much higher temperatures in all of the spectra, but those are in the range of CELLULOSE, LIGNIN AND HEMICELLULOSE .” And elsewhere in his book, Rogers also wrote: “All of the bleaching processes used through history remove lignin and most associated flax impurities (e.g., flax wax and hemicelluloses). The bands of different color on the Shroud are the end result of different amount of impurities LEFT FROM THE BLEACHING PROCESS.” Note : Along with these probable deposits of lignin and the confirmed presence of starch and pectin deposits, it is also truly possible that some residues of saponaria could be present in the thin layer of impurities, but nevertheless, it is very important to understand that the presence of this kind of residue have NOT been scientifically confirmed on the Shroud, whether it be by the STURP team, Rogers himself or other researchers like Adler. Rogers strongly support the hypothesis that some residues of saponaria should be present in the layer of impurities because it “fits” with the sort of low level of fluorescence of the non image areas of the cloth and also because he thought, based on Pliny the Elder writing and also based on information he got from Anna Maria Donadoni, an ancient textile expert from the Egyptology museum in Turin, that the Shroud had been most probably washed with this natural product at the end of the weaving process. But as we recently discovered, it seems that Pliny didn’t talked about saponaria in his writings but he refers instead to another kind of ancient soap made with olive oil. So, in the end, it’s possible that the washing of the cloth was done with this other type of soap (or another one) and that would explain why the presence of residues of saponaria has never been found by STURP, Rogers, Adler or anyone else. And for the low degree of fluorescence of the non image areas, this could well be due to the presence of pectin on top of the cloth instead of the unconfirmed presence of saponaria residues. That’s what Stéphane Mottin in France thought and when Adler confirmed the presence of this kind of residue on the fibers, he agreed with Mottin that this is probably the main cause of the low fluorescence of the non image areas..","date":"2012-11-02","mins":"10:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/02/an-image-formed-by-the-yellowing-of-lignon/","cat":"image_theory","title":"An image formed by the yellowing of Lignin?"},{"id":"comment-6196","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote : “How can a positive report that makes its way to most major news outlets across the world be a bad thing?” Because it tend to MAKE BELIEVE the Shroud offer some proofs of the resurrection which is TOTALLY FALSE !!!

It is like that today (especially when it comes to the Shroud and the Marian apparitions), and if you read well the Gospels, it was also like that in the time of Jesus when most of the people who were following him, did that for one specific reason: his miracles! They were not interested by the profound meaning that was lying under these miraculous act but only by the magical aspect of it and I’m pretty sure that, some times, people were even seeing miracles while it was not the case at all… Things have not change much over the years since humans are profoundly the same than those who lived 2000 years ago. I always say to myself that, beside the great development of our technology, the human being has not evolved a lot since that time and I’m pretty sure St Paul would not be too lost if he would get back here today into ou pagan culture! If we would ask ourselves honestly the question of what is the most profound meaning of the Shroud, I think many Christian (like myself) would end up saying that it is the fact that this cloth prove (I dare to use this word), not the Resurrection (even though, as I often say, it is possible to see some signs of that event in association with this cloth), but the Incarnation of God in our humanity! That’s an extraordinary thing to meditate upon! I’m truly convinced that, as Christians, we keep the focus a bit too much on the death resurrection of Christ while forgetting to seek the profound meaning of the Incarnation of God… Here it is (for me at least): God so love us that he planed from the beginning to come here in our humanity, at the right time, for one reason: to show us is real face (which is the face of Love and Mercy in person and nothing else) so that we can stop being afraid of him. And I truly think that, with the eyes of faith, we can see something of that on the Shroud of Turin! But being able to see a proof of the resurrection on it, I think we can forget about that… And in the end, who cares? As I often say, the only fact that such a gruesome burial cloth was kept and carefully preserved for almost 2000 years is enough to understand that those who did that (Jesus followers for sure) were seriously convinced that he was resurrected.

And finally, as I often said, I’m 100% convinced that the resurrected Jesus that appeared to the disciples was not at all looking like the man of the Shroud, because, if he was looking like that, they would have had no problem at all to recognize him. In sum, the image we see on the Shroud is the image of the historic Jesus right after his death on the cross and not the image of his glorious body in eternity, no more than the body (or, more rightly, the different human forms) he showed to his disciples after his death. I say “different human forms” based on the last Resurrection account in St John’s Gospel in which the disciple had big problems to recognize the Resurrected Jesus, even though they had already meet him twice before (at least). This prove that the Resurrected Jesus could take any human form he wanted in order to appear to them while respecting their freedom to believe or not. Remember that, for me, these material apparitions of the Resurrected Jesus were “just” material signs that were done to help his disciples to believe that he was really resurrected.

Having said that, I can’t deny that the probable suddent disappearance (spiritualization) of the body from Inside the Shroud could have played some role in the image formation process, but in my mind, this was surely not the main cause for the presence of this body image on the cloth..","date":"2013-07-25","mins":"10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/20/any-good-reasons-for-associating-anything-supernatural-with-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Any good reasons for associating anything supernatural with the shroud?"},{"id":"comment-39732","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Ron, I will answer some of your arguments, taking them one by one : You said: “An image ‘exactly’ like we see on the Shroud has never been found in history, that we are aware of.” My answer : If the image formation process was totally natural and occurred only because of some very specific factors were reunited (especially the presence of a fresh corpse that has been highly tortured for several hours prior death, which did stayed in contact with the Shroud before the apparition of the first liquids of putrefaction, the presence of a thin layer of impurities on the surface of the cloth and the presence of a damp stone tomb), this fact can well be completely normal. In sum, if it took the presence of all those factors and some others, it is totally normal that only one imaged shroud like this has survived to this day… Beside the strips of linen cloths coming the Egyptian mummies, are you aware of many intact burial shrouds that were preserved despite they have been used to envelop for a short period of time the corpse of a tortured man and that were made with the ancient method of manufacturing linen cloths? Of course not! That gives you a pretty good answer for why there is no other ancient linen cloth that show the body image of a dead man on it! You also said: “with the Volckringer pattern it takes an extreme amount of time for the process to actually show, or has in many cases of the Volckringer pattern, ever been analyzed as for it’s depth into the material it had appeared.” My answer: The Volckringer pattern effect act very slowly and this feature is not at all in contradiction with the image we see on the Shroud, because in this particular case too, the image formation process can well have acted very slowly. In fact, if the image on the Shroud come from a natural process (like a Volckringer pattern effect or something else), it is pretty sure that the image took a pretty long time to “develop” on the surface of the cloth. Now, if you mean that, in the case of the images of plants or flowers, it takes a long period of contact in order that the image formation process can start, I think it’s true, but even if this is really true, that’s not enough to discard the idea that the Shroud’s image can well be the product of a sort of Volckringer pattern effect quite similar to what we see for plants and flowers but not completelly identical… Finally, you talk about the penetration of the image for the Volckringer pattern effects. It is true that, in the cases of images of plants and flowers on paper, there is an in deep penetration. But, once again, that is not enough to discard the hypothesis that the Shroud’s image could well have been caused by a very similar process because, in the case of the Shroud, we know thanks to Rogers, that there was most probably a thin layer of impurities on the surface of the cloth and it is not impossible to think that this layer of impurities was the only thing that was “reactive” enough with the vapours and molecules coming from the fresh corpse to cause a sort of Volckringer pattern that was not totally identical to the process causing the images of plants and flowers on paper, but very similar in essence. And finally, if you take the two arguments together (the fact that the Volckringer pattern effects normally needs a long period of contact to operate and normally cause an in deep penetration of the coloration of the paper fibers), I think we can say that, in the case of the Shroud, the fact that the body didn’t stayed more than 72 hours (probably more or less 36 hours) and the fact that there was a thin layer of impurities that were much more “reactive” than the linen fibers themselves, can have been a good combination for the start of a sort of Volckringer pattern effect that was quite similar but somehow different than what we see for images of plants and flowers (i.e. The process needed much less time of “exposure” than what goes on for the images of plants or flowers, which can be due to the presence of many factors put together, especially the highly traumatic state of the Shroud man’s body, and the process never caused an in deep penetration of color in the cloth, which can be due to the fact that the thin layer of impurities was the only thing that was “reactive” enough in a so short time of “exposure”). Since we don’t know all the factors that were at work Inside the Shroud during the short period in which the corpse stayed there, and since no one (to my knowledge) has ever tested properly under good lab controls the Volckringer pattern hypothesis proposed by De Salvo (and others) in the context of the Shroud man, I really don’t think we can discard the idea that the image on the Shroud can have been caused by what I call “a different sort of Volckringer pattern effect, which is very similar in essence to the known Volckringer pattern effects for plants and flowers’ images but that was somehow different in some aspect concerning the Shroud. I think this scenario deserve to be analyzed much more in deep than what has been done to this day… Finally, you said: “For instance the depth of the image equal throughout the complete image, the pseudo three dimensional image with very little distortion created on a cloth, which evidence shows actually covered a real corpse….Where has this been seen before? ..NOWHERE!” My answer : Yes it has been seen before Ron! Please, take another look at the study done by John De Salvo concerning the Volckringer pattern effect (http://shroud.com/pdfs/ssi06part4.pdf). You will see that all the “special” aspects of the image on the Shroud that you described (and that you consider as a clue to think it comes from the Resurrection) are ALL present in the images of plants or flowers caused by a Volckringer pattern effect on paper!!! I repeat: ALL! It is simply false to state things like: When it is photograph, the image on the Shroud is the only one in the world to show real 3 D effect. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!! De Salvo’s study has proven that if you photograph the image of a plant or a flower that come from a Volckringer pattern effect, and if you place it under a VP 8 image analyzer, you also obtain the same real 3 D effect! I repeat: the same 3 D effect that comes from the plant or flower paper distance in the same way than the image on the Shroud come from the body cloth distance… So, the few “special” features you described can all be found in nature, so they cannot be taken as good clues to think the Resurrection had something to do with the Shroud’s image. So Ron, I think you will need to come up with better arguments to convince me that the Resurrection of Christ MUST have acted directly on the formation of the image on the Shroud….","date":"2013-07-25","mins":"4:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/20/any-good-reasons-for-associating-anything-supernatural-with-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Any good reasons for associating anything supernatural with the shroud?"},{"id":"comment-14362","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Even if I think it’s more realistic to estimate that the amines were coming from the skin (from maybe urea and other substances left there by the drying sweat or already present in the skin at the time of death), I don’t think it’s fair, in the present state of our knowledge to discard completely the possibility that amines could have come out also from the lungs and maybe from the other natural orifices of the corpse to take part in the image formation process….","date":"2012-07-31","mins":"3:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/30/asking-thibault-for-more-details-concerning-rogers-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Asking Thibault for more details concerning Rogers hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-14367","author":"yannick_clément","post":"All this would need much more experimental testing in order to really see clearly what’s good and what’s not… That’s all I say..","date":"2012-07-31","mins":"4:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/30/asking-thibault-for-more-details-concerning-rogers-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Asking Thibault for more details concerning Rogers hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-20386","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What about UV Dan??? I hope you noticed all the recent posts I made on your blog on this topic! For all the people who didn’t, here’s my most recent comment I published this morning and in which I summarized my thoughts about the UV experiments done by Di Lazzaro and his team: “For anyone who can be interested by the subject, I would like to summarize my thoughs about the coloring experiments done by M. Di Lazzaro and his team with a UV laser. For me, these experiments are very interesting and even important because it clearly shows that the best thing we can possibly expect from an energetic radiation that hit a linen cloth is at least a coloration of the thin layer of impurities located on top of the fibers AND ALSO a coloration of the primary cell wall of the linen fiber, which is the first layer of the fiber. This is very telling because it is a confirmation of Ray Rogers’ conclusion who once wrote that, in his mind, it is highly improbable that any kind of energetic radiation can be able to ONLY color a thin layer of impurities without affecting and coloring the linen fiber located underneath. In fact, Rogers was pretty sure about that because he did make some coloring experiments with energetic radiation and the best thing he could get was the same kind of result obtained by M. Di Lazzaro and his team, i.e. A coloration of only the primary cell wall of the fiber (with no coloration of the heart of the fiber) with a corona discharge. The description of this experiment can be found in his book A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin (take good note of figure X 7 and the comment under it that you can found in page 86 of the PDF version of his book). And Rogers was very clear about the fact that, in his mind, this kind of result is NOT CONSISTENT with the real nature of the body image on the Shroud, which is located only in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities and NOTHING ELSE (i.e. It leaves the underneath fiber COMPLETELY INTACT EVEN ON ITS SURFACE). The bottom line is this: I truly don’t think we can expect anything more from the UV laser experiments of M. Di Lazzaro and his team and, if we base our judgment on Rogers’ conclusions, we have to conclude that this kind of energetic radiation is not able to explain the Shroud’s image. And I think we can expect the same for any other sort of energetic radiation… In sum, I think Shroud scientists who want to explain the Shroud’s image properly have to find other coloration processes that can ONLY color a thin layer of impurities, while leaving the linen fiber underneath completely intact. And so far, as I know, the only experimental result that match completely this very particular characteristic is the one made by Rogers with a linen sample made with the ancient method of making linen and an exposition to ammoniac gas. Again, you can find a good description of this particular experiment in Rogers’ book (note the figure XI 4 in page 104 of the PDF version of his book). Because of Rogers’ experiments, I have a very hard time to believe that anything else than a gaseous or molecular transfer from a dead body to a linen cloth can really give a similar result (i.e. A coloration that is ONLY located in the thin layer of impurities while the fiber underneath is left intact). That’s the main reason why I highly favored this kind of natural hypothesis involving a gaseous and/or a molecular transfer over any other hypothesis that has even been proposed to explain the Shroud’s image.” In this particular comment, I think I have summarized pretty well the situation of all the hypothesis of image formation involving any kind of energetic radiation in the light of Rogers’s conclusion and experimental results (and in the light of Di Lazzaro’s own results that he recently published in a new paper)… Here’s the bottom line of this whole issue : IF WE BELIEVE RAY ROGERS (AND I DON’T SEE ANY GOOD REASON TO DOUBT HIS CONCLUSIONS ON THIS TOPIC), THE RESULTS OF THE UV LASER EXPERIMENTS DONE BY DI LAZZARO AND HIS TEAM ARE NO MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE REAL NATURE OF THE BODY IMAGE OF THE SHROUD THAN ANY OTHER EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OBTAINED WITH ANOTHER FORM OF ENERGETIC RADIATION, INCLUDING FROM A CORONA DISCHARGE. Effectively, all these form of energetic radiation ALWAYS produced some coloration of the linen fiber (whether it be the primary cell wall only or the whole fiber) and, if we believe Rogers’ judgment about this issue, the image formation process for the Shroud has NOT affected the linen fiber in any way and the coloration is ONLY located in the thin layer of carbohydrates impurities that his almost certainly coating the most superficial fibers on the surface of the cloth. I think it’s about time that real honest scientist start to take Roger work and push it forward because he is truly the one who have produced a coloration result that is the closest chemically and physically to what we see on the Shroud and what is very interesting about that is the fact that his hypothesis is totally coherent with the image we see on the Shroud, which is the one of a DEAD MAN.

The only problem for these kinds of hypothesis and it is huge: If the chromophore of the image is really the thin layer of carbohydrates impurities postulated by Rogers (and so far, this is by far the best hypothesis that exist versus the known data from the Shroud), then the chances that one of these energetic hypotheses can be relevant to the image on the Shroud would probably be near zero. Here’s what Rogers said about that: “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source : the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was NO MORE DEFECTIVE than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” So, unless Fanti or Di Lazzaro, using their 21st century techniques that were not there 2000 years ago, can colored only a thin layer of impurities on the surface of a linen fiber WITHOUT PRODUCING ABSOLUTELY NO DEFFECT AT ALL in the linen fiber itself (including the primary cell wall), I think we should stay very careful versus these kinds of hypotheses. So far, I’m not aware that they ever succeed to color a thin layer of impurities on a linen fiber without producing no defect at all in the linen fiber itself (whether it be the primary cell wall alone or the inner part of the fiber). If I’m correct, then this proves that Rogers statement I just gave you is STILL CORRECT. This is very important to note. In the end, as I said many times here (but I believe it’s always important to refresh some memories), the most important data to be confirmed versus the image on the Shroud concern the chromophore of the image. And if Rogers was right with his impurities (I dare to say: it really looks like the correct answer to me), then I really think we could forget all these energetic hypotheses because none of them seem to be able to only colored these impurities without affecting at all the linen fiber that is underneath… Only a new series of direct testing on the Shroud will finally (let’s hope!) settle this issue. No doubt that Shroud science will make a huge step forward when the chromophore of the image will be confirmed..","date":"2012-10-29","mins":"3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/29/big-deal-peer-reviewed-scientific-paper-soon-to-be-published/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Big Deal Peer-Reviewed Scientific Paper Soon to Be Published"},{"id":"comment-20431","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Exactly! And Rogers’ conclusion concerning the effects of a corona discharge on a linen fiber can well be extrapolated to any other form of energetic radiation known to man. The bottom line is this: It doesn’t seem to exist one form of energetic radiation that is “mild” enough to ONLY color a thin layer of impurities on top of a linen fiber without affecting at the same time the fiber underneath in some way that is easily distinguishable for a radiation expert like Rogers. On the contrary, it really seems to exist many types of post mortem gases (amines) that can caused such a result (i.e. A coloration that ONLY affect the layer of impurities on top of the linen fiber without affecting at all the fiber underneath). I’m truly convinced that this is the path Shroud science should follow in order to fully explain one day the body image (i.e. A biological interaction of some kind that include most probably the release of some post mortem gases, particularly ammoniac)..","date":"2012-12-14","mins":"11:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/13/barberis-fantis-conclusions-are-not-scientific/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Barberis:  Fanti’s conclusions are not scientific"},{"id":"comment-18621","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Of course, if you don’t want to follow the laws of nature, you can believe anything !

Coming from that kind of true expert in the field of imagery, this is not a banal conclusion. And here’s the most important thing to note: The only persons who seem to be able to see these coins are the same who really seems to hold stubbornly to see them!!! Isn’t that strange that they are all pro Shroudies? Note that what I just said is also true for all the “I think I see” kind of things related to the Shroud, like the so called flower images for example. Of course, it’s pretty easy for anyone to see that there are some protrusions in the eyes region on 3 D images of the Shroud, but the only sure thing we can say about that is the fact that the density of the coloration is more important there than in the neighboring, which is the real cause of these protrusions on 3 D images. Scientifically, that the only safe conclusion we can make and this higher density of coloration in the eyes region can, in fact, have been caused by many other things than coins over the eyes. In reality, I truly think that it’s safer to assume that this was caused by a biological factor (or many biological factors), just like, most probably, the rest of the coloration that formed the body image on the Shroud. A good example of a possible biological explanation would be to assume that, for some reason (more urea deposit over the eyes than around the eyes?), there has been a higher release of ammoniac gases in this particular region of the eyes versus the peripheral region, which would have caused a more important density of coloration on the surface of the cloth in this particular area. Another rational explanation could come from the fact that the eyes of the Shroud man were very swollen and because of that, they were closer to the fabric than normal, which lead to a more important coloration because of this high proximity (probably a direct contact). And if there are some bloodstains there (it’s far from being proven as I don’t recall having seen anything about that in the STURP literature), then the shape of these tiny stains could have been easily interpreted as letters by Max or other persons, even though that’s most probably not the reality..","date":"2012-12-11","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/11/coins-on-eyes-issue-again/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Coins on Eyes Issue Again"},{"id":"comment-20281","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If Bucklin really wrote this, then I’m affraid that he went a bit too far!

That’s all! Going further is entering into the “I think I see” and the “Bad Speculations” territory! At least, Bucklin didn’t make a specific mention about coins! As I said, these protrusions can well be simply due to the natural image formation mechanism that was, for some reason, more intense directly over the eyes than in their neighboring. Personally, I think this is most probably due simply to the fact that the eyes were probably very swollen and were, because of that, much more close to the Shroud, which has leaded to a more intense coloration because of this close proximity between the swollen eyes and the cloth.

By acting like that, I’m sure we would obtain a list much shorter than the one published in 2005, but, at the same time, that would be very solid and true.

This paper written by Rogers and Arnoldi propose a scientific hypothesis to potentially explain everything about the image formation. Rogers never said that this hypothesis is the sure answer to the Shroud image, but he never publicly wrote or said something like Maillard reactions must have been associated with something else (maybe supernatural) in order to produce the image we see on the Shroud. It’s important to set the record straight here… And if Di Lazzaro’s experiment would be more convincing, then explain to me how in the world the SAME SOURCE OF UV LIGHT could produce the SAME DEPTH OF COLOR PENETRATION (i.e. Color restricted to the primary cell wall of the topmost fibers of the cloth) no matter if the source (which would be the resurrected body of Christ) would have been in direct contact with the cloth or at more or less 4 cm of distance with that cloth, while it wouldn’t have been able to produce any visible color beyond that short distance? In all logic, this kind of supernatural process would have colored the primary cell wall of some fibers located deeper into the cloth in all the areas where the body would have been in direct contact with the cloth. This is not what have been observed on the Shroud.

That’s why I think Adler should only have studied the blood and nothing else. He was an expert in that field… In that regard, he shouldn’t have studied the image, nor take position concerning the conservation. And when it comes to Maillard reactions, if you read well the paper published by Heimburger “ROGERS’ MAILLARD REACTION HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINED IN DETAIL BY ROGERS HIMSELF”, you’ll see that Rogers never claimed he was an expert in this kind of very complex reaction. That’s precisely why, being the good scientist that he was (i.e. Someone who consider all the data while following the scientific method properly), he got in touch with someone who was an expert in that field (Arnoldi) and wrote his Maillard reaction hypothesis paper with her! She was a chemist of the Department of Pharmacological Sciences in Milano, Italy and an expert in this kind of chemical process. So, when Berry attack the integrity of Rogers versus the Maillard reactions hypothesis, he also attack the integrity of a chemist who was an expert in that particular field and who agreed that the image formation hypothesis proposed by Rogers could offer a viable explanation for the Shroud image. I prefer by far to follow the Professional opinion of an expert like her than anything coming from Colin Berry who, this is evident, DON’T WANT Rogers to be right about the image on the Shroud and still want us to believe that the Shroud is not a real burial shroud, even if the bloodstains alone contradict is point of view… Note: when it comes to the antique way to manufactured a linen shroud, Rogers did exactly the same thing, which is to get in touch with a real expert in that field, i.e. Anna Maria Donadoni, supervisor of the Egyptian Museum of Turin. These few example should make people understand once and for all how good and Professional Ray Rogers really was. And if some folks still need more proofs, just see this presentation of my friend Barrie Schwortz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k G6 H5 Mkl K3s Last thing I want to say: It’s so easy to discredit the professionalism and the integrity of someone who’s not here no more to defend himself… That’s very disgusting..","date":"2015-07-25","mins":"5:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/25/colin-berry-on-rogers-groupies-me-and-trolls/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry on Rogers, Groupies, Me and Trolls"},{"id":"comment-206554","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Anna Arnoldi, who was the co author of Rogers’ paper “THE SHROUD OF TURIN: AN AMINO CARBONYL REACTION (MAILLARD REACTION) MAY EXPLAIN THE IMAGE FORMATION” and who was a real chemist expert in these kinds of very complex chemical reactions was there, along with Rogers, to contradict Colin Berry’s assumptions versus the image formation process proposed by Rogers.

Also, that process should have involved a well define panel of Shroud experts that would have come from every spectrum of the scientific fields, in order to write the best possible list.

Jewish ritual in antiquity did not require that the eye be sealed by an object, and it is debatable whether the custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead was practiced among Jews prior to the modern era.” Back to my answer to Max : And even if you could prove that this practice was generalized among pious Jews of Jesus time (but I don’t think so !), even if you’re the best expert on the planet about the ancient coins, sorry but I prefer to wait for a confirmation from A CHEMIST ! Until a direct chemical test could be perform, you can prove NOTHING my friend… I hope you can at least agree with me on this ! You’re in the same position as Avinoam Danin for the flowers question… To finish, I have 2 questions for you : And how in the world a pious Jew like Jesus would need a pagan coin to pay the pagan god is right to cross de Styx river ?????? Explain this one to me… Don’t make any sense to me ! Maybe you think that Jesus, his disciples and his family were hellenistic Jews ? And another thing that I would like you to explain : I’m sure you can agree with me that the burial ritual wasn’t completed on friday and the women planed to come back on sunday morning to do an anointing of the body. In THIS CONTEXT, how in the world someone would put coins over the eyes on friday while they knew the job wasn’t completed and they had to come back to finish it on sunday ? Again, don’t make any sense to me ! But again, I leave to door open that there is really an image there. But even if a chemist could prove this, how can we be sure that it is not just an image of the of eyeballs that were swollen due to blows received before the crucifixion ? To me, this is a far more logical answer than coins over the eyes… But, we live in a free world and you can believe what you want, just like me ! ; ).","date":"2011-10-23","mins":"6:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/19/comment-promoted-of-coins-and-flowers-and-more-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted: Of Coins and Flowers and More on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4293","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Oups… I meant “anywhere” (not anyway)..","date":"2011-10-24","mins":"3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/19/comment-promoted-of-coins-and-flowers-and-more-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted: Of Coins and Flowers and More on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4306","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Anything you want to believe, it’s your freedom. But I have the freedom to disagree with you… Here’s the main argument found in the link I wrote down the other day : “Only rarely does the placement of a pair of coins suggest they might have covered the eyes. In Judea, a pair of silver denarii were found in the eye sockets of a skull (note from Yannick : ONE SKULL, NOT THOUSANDS !); the burial occurs within a Jewish community, but the religious affiliation of the deceased is unclear. Jewish ritual in antiquity DID NOT require that the eye be sealed by an object, and it is debatable whether the custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead was practiced among Jews prior to the modern era.[153] During the 1980s, the issue became embroiled with the controversies regarding the Shroud of Turin when it was argued that the eye area revealed the outlines of coins; since the placement of coins on the eyes for burial is NOT SECURELY ATTESTED IN ANTIQUITY, this interpretation of evidence obtained through digital image processing would not support the shroud’s authenticity.” In another part of the text from the link, here what we found : “Jewish ossuaries SOMETIMES (Note from Yannick : Sometimes doesn’t mean that it was a general practice among pious Jews !) contain a single coin; for example, in an ossuary bearing the inscriptional name “Miriam, daughter of Simeon,” a coin minted during the reign of Herod Agrippa I, dated 42/43 AD, was found in the skull’s mouth.[51] Although the placement of a coin within the skull is uncommon in Jewish antiquity and was potentially an act of idolatry (note from Yannick : do you see Joseph of Arimatea commiting an act of idolatry during the burial of the man he thought was possibly the messiah ???), rabbinic literature preserves an allusion to Charon in a lament for the dead “tumbling aboard the ferry and having to borrow his fare.” Boats are sometimes depicted on ossuaries or the walls of Jewish crypts, and one of the coins found within a skull may have been chosen because it depicted a ship.”.","date":"2011-10-24","mins":"4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/19/comment-promoted-of-coins-and-flowers-and-more-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted: Of Coins and Flowers and More on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4223","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If the coins and flowers images are real, I really think they have nothing to do with Jesus emtombment.

But I always prefer to use my logic and my reason than my feeling on this particular question because science is far away from giving us any real credible proof that those objects are there. When it is question of dirt, pollens, etc., now it’s a different story because science have proven they are there on the shroud.

And for the argument of flowers cover by blood, if it was an obligation to buried them (I really don’t know about that), then, they could have just let them in some part of the tomb, waiting for the burial rite to be finish on sunday, before putting them into the shroud.

Here’s an important quote from that paper concerning the image (emphasis in caps lock are mine): “The Shroud IS NOT THE PRODUCT OF A CLEVER MEDIEVAL ARTIST. And we now have some FIRM AND GENERALLY AGREED UPON EVIDENCE about what caused this hauntingly mysterious image – the accelerated structural degeneration of cellulose fibrils as a result of NATURAL, CHEMICALLY INDUCED MOLECULAR CHANGES IN THE MATERIAL.” Note: for Ray Rogers, this last sentence is close to be correct, except for the fact that this natural, chemically induced changes happened not in the structure of the linen fibers but in a thin and uneven layer of impurities. Now, here’s the following sentence from Pellicori’s paper, which is very telling and interesting: “The hypothesis that these changes were catalyzed by NATURAL SKIN SECRETIONS (note: he said “natural” and not “artificial”) OR PRESERVATIVE BURIAL OINTMENTS (note: no word about lemon juice, which was surely used by Pellicori simply as a form of control substance for comparison with skin secretions and burial ointments) is in no way diminished by the absence of these substances on the Shroud today…” And here’s another important quote, now concerning the blood evidence (which is the kind of strong evidence that most certainly helped Pellicori and the STURP team concluding that the Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man and that the image is most probably the result of a natural interaction between the Shroud man’s corpse and the cloth): “But there seems little doubts that these stains, which penetrate to the reverse side of the cloth, ARE THOSE OF BLOOD. In areas where the particulate clumps have been removed, they have the DISTINCTIVE AND CORRECT homogeneous reddish orange COLORATION. It seems that these areas were probably soaked with a colored liquid less viscous or dense than whole blood – most likely BLOOD SERUM which separates from whole blood at death. Optical spectrophotometry and microchemical analysis have since CONFIRMED that the suspected blood stains in fact CONTAIN HEMOGLOBIN.” Do I need to continue? I hope that these quotes will be enough for anyone to understand that Pellicori coloring experiments were not done to back up the idea of a man made forgery and to find a sort of alchemist formula that could have been used by a medieval forger, but were done to evaluate his hypothesis that this body image came from some form of natural interaction between the Shroud man’s corpse (or some burial substances placed on his corpse) and the cloth’s surface. I also hope these quotes will be enough to understand that Pellicori’s conclusions about the Shroud was exactly the same as the main conclusions of the STURP team, which is that 1 the blood on the Shroud is most probably human blood. 2 the Shroud is therefore a real burial cloth of a real crucified man. 3 the image on it most probably came from an interaction between the Shroud man’s corpse (or some burial products placed on his corpse) and the cloth’s surface. Now, if Colin Berry want to reproduce the Shroud image using skin perspirations and/or burial ointments, that’s fine, but he must understand that, whatever the level of success he can get by doing so, his copy of the Shroud will forever be incomplete (and therefore, not alike) because he will forever be unable to reproduce correctly (forensically speaking) the blood and serum stains that we see on the Shroud and which, alone, are enough to prove the Shroud is not some kind of man made forgery!

Here it is: 1 It is a real burial shroud of someone other than Jesus of Nazareth who suffered the same tortures as he with a forged image done by someone without using any art technique. In this case, a forger “naturally” produced the image while using a real human corpse. Because of the great resemblance between what happen to Jesus in the Gospels, we must assume that this forger did it in order to produce a false relic of the Passion of the Christ. Also, because of the presence of many differences between any known artistic depictions of the Passion of the Christ prior to the first known public exhibition of the Shroud in the 14th century and the bloodstains and the body image that are on the Shroud (for example, the nailing in the wrist instead of in the palms, the wearing of a cap of thorns instead of a crown and the very distinct dumbbell shaped marks of scourging coming from a Roman flagrum), we must assume that if he tortured and crucified himself (with the help of some collaborators), this forger was well aware of the Roman procedures concerning scourging and crucifixion. In fact, it is even more rational to think that this forger used the body of a real crucified victim who was put to death by the Romans, before the crucifixion was banished by the emperor Constantine, in the last years of his reign that ended in 33720. We also have to assume that this forger took the dead body out of the shroud before it started to corrupt in such a way that this extraction did not disturb the bloodstains, never broke the linen fibrils under them and did not disturb the body image21. In sum, this scenario can be described like a “natural” forgery using a real tortured and crucified body. And whether or not the forger knew that he would obtain a body image on the cloth, along with the bloodstains, is not completely clear.

Therefore, before someone can seriously claim he has found a method to reproduce the Shroud, he MUST not only reproduce the image with all its known characteristics but he must ALSO reproduce the very particular kind of blood and serum stains that are present on the cloth, which is something no one has ever come close of doing… I don’t think we’ll see Colin Berry coming close to achieve such a gruesome feat one day because, quite frankly, to achieve this, he would need to get a crucified corpse!!!

That’s why he tried different burial products and also human perspiration. For the lemon juice, I wasn’t aware of this or, at least, I don’t remember he refers to this particular product in the scientific papers he wrote for STURP. In other words, Pellicori’s experiments were not intent to prove the image formation was the product of a human forgery but to find the most probable way a human corpse could left that kind of faint imprint on his burial cloth, which, in Pellicori’s mind (as well as in Rogers mind and some other researchers) must have been completely natural and directly in link with the biological state of the body and/or the kind of burial procedure that was done. And here’s a personal reflection: Pellicori’s experiements are strongly pointing against the idea that there has been some burial ointment of the Shroud man’s body before he was placed Inside the cloth. Effectively, taking Pellicori’s results into account, it’s pretty evident that if burial products like that (especially in liquid or paste form) would have been used for the burial of the Shroud man, a lot of yellow stains would have been created on the cloth after some time and these stains would have produced color that would not have been restricted to the top surface of the cloth. Therefore, it seems to me highly probable that no burial product (at least in liquid or paste form) have been used for the Shroud man and this fits perfectly with what we know about Jesus’ burial, which was hasty. For the aloes and myrrh, Barbet told us that it’s truly possible that these products were in solid state and placed in bags all around the Shroud (and not in direct contact with the body and the cloth’s surface), simply as a way to remove the bad smelling in the tomb, while the participant of the incomplete burial of the Shroud man knew perfectly well that they would have to come back to the tomb to finish the job after the Sabbath..","date":"2015-08-10","mins":"3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/06/comparing-colin-berrys-methods-to-those-of-sam-pellicori/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comparing Colin Berry’s Methods to Those of Sam Pellicori"},{"id":"comment-207893","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Nice to read some rational comment concerning this topic… I think one of the most compelling piece of evidence to understand the Mandylion was not the Shroud is the fact that, for many centuries, there was a shroud of Christ AND a Mandylion that were kept in Constantinople and, among these 2 objects, only the shroud was considered as a relic of the Passion of Christ.

Lemon juice was probably used by him as some kind of control while using something that could evidently caused some oxidation of the linen fibers.

He only talks about what kind of color some known burial products or skin perspiration could produced on a linen shroud many years after a contact occurred. His whole paper was intent to give a rational explanation for the image Under the assumption that this cloth is a real burial shroud that enveloped for a short period of time a real crucified corpse. In no place in his paper you can find any reference to the possibility of a human forgery. Pellicori never believe this and so is the STURP team as a whole. Their main conclusion about the Shroud is clear about that. The Shroud is a real burial cloth. Therefore, Pellicori (just like Rogers by the way), was trying to find what natural process in link with a Jewish burial could have produced that kind of faint image. That’s where he came up with the idea of a direct contact transfer between some burial ointment or some skin perspiration on the Shroud man’s corpse and the cloth’s surface. However, because his hypothesis would surely produced a penetration of color much deeper than what has been detect on the Shroud, most of the STURP members have rejected Pellicori’s hypothesis or, at the very least, have cast great doubts over it… And when Pellicori said: “For Pellicori, though, it would be nearly impossible to “prove” that the shroud is what it is purported to be.”, he was not talking about the question of whether the Shroud is a burial cloth of a real crucified man or not. This question was resolve by the STURP team. It is.

To understand this, you simply have to consider STURP main conclusion, which is that this is not a forgery and the image on the cloth must have come from some kind of still undetermined interraction between the corpse and the cloth.

Starch and low molecular weight carbohydrates from crude startch would color MUCH MORE EASILY than would cellulose as a result of either thermal dehydration or chemical reactions. The hypothesis on carbohydrates impurities is SUPPORTED by observations of TRACES OF SOME STARCH FRACTIONS ON IMAGE FIBERS.” Also, you have to consider the FACT that there are also pectin deposits on the Shroud that could easily have taken part of a Maillard reaction. Also, you have to take notice of an important quote from Rogers book (page 108) that can answer some of your questions : “The Maillard reactions are some of the most studied reactions in food chemistry. The reactions are commercially important , and they have been studied for many years. They involved the condensation of amino groups (the –NH2 in amines, proteins, peptides, etc.) with reducing sugars and reducing polysaccharides such as SUGARS (note : like pectin) AND SOME STARCH FRACTIONS. All reducing sugars and polysaccharides take part in the reactions. WHEN AMINES (note : that include ammoniac gas) AND REDUCING SUGARS COME TOGETHER, THEY WILL REACT. THEY WILL PRODUCE A COLOR. THIS IS NOT AN HYPOTHESIS : THIS IS A FACT. A cloth with crude starch on it WILL ultimately produce a color, if it is left in close proximity to a decomposing body (note : Rogers talk here of the very first phase of the decomposition that doesn’t include the apparition of putrefactive liquids).” This quote from Rogers is VERY IMPORTANT. Like I said to Ron : since science have proven that there really is deposits of starch fractions and pectin on the surface of the cloth, you have to imagine that the dead body that was inside the Shroud (we know for a fact that there was one) emit no amines at all (including ammoniac gas) in order to pretend that a Maillard reaction really had nothing to do with the body image we see on the Shroud !!! I think someone need a very big faith in order to believe that ! And concerning the question of the ancient method of cloth production as described by Pliny the Elder, I just want to repeat what I’ve already said to Dave : It is impossible to know whether or not the shroud was made with the same exact technique as describe by Pliny the Elder, but what we can say is that some observations and facts (like the banding effect who most probably come from the ancient technique of bleaching the cloth before the weaving was done, the confirmed presence of starch impurities and pectin deposit on the surface of the Shroud, etc.) tend to show that it was really the case… Collinsberry, you can have a totally different opinion than Ray Rogers of course, but between an expert in chemistry like him and someone who is not an expert like you (this is an admission you made), I will always choose to believe in the words of the expert Rogers was. Read my long comment that I post below. I didn’t found anything in Rogers writings to suggest me that I should put in doubt everything he said about the Shroud. Of course, that doesn’t mean we have to believe everything Rogers said blindly, but that mean that unless a real expert can scientifically prove him wrong on one aspect or another, I don’t know why we should think that Rogers conclusions about the Shroud were most probably wrong..","date":"2012-05-21","mins":"7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/21/creative-comment-of-the-day-by-colin-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Creative Comment of the Day by Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-11592","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Stop worrying about who I could worship and start thinking about what Rogers said.

It is not a direct response to those 2 comments from Collinsberry but I think it is the right place to post it. Have fun ! In fact, I would like to explain more in details what I tried to express yesterday versus Ray Rogers, his credibility and his Maillard reaction hypothesis, especially concerning the question of the water insolubility of the colored impurities. First, on the question of the credibility of Rogers, I don’t think there’s anyone who can show us one single PROOF that the science of this man was driven by his faith or by any other purpose than to find the truth about the Shroud. There’s NOTHING in all his writings to even SUGGEST something of that nature. I should add : on the contrary to some researchers in the Shroud world today who don’t mind mixing science with some religious ideas (like the resurrection of Christ)… When you take this FACT concerning Rogers into account and you add another fact to it, namely the great professional quality of the man (especially in chemistry and microscopy), I don’t see any good reason to constantly put in doubt everything he said about the Shroud. Of course, it’s not a bad thing to ask some questions about some particular points of his conclusions regarding the Shroud (I do it myself !), but that need to be done by someone who his honest and who seek the truth and by someone who’s only driven by some anti Rogers philosophy ! Because if it is so, I really believe this person and his questions will lose any sense of credibility. Now, let’s think for a second that Collinsberry is not driven by an anti Rogers mindset, I would like to reflect upon his question concerning the fact that nothing in body image on the Shroud has move with the water used to extinguish the fire of 1532 versus the Maillard reaction hypothesis of Rogers. First of all, it’s important to note that it’s not because Rogers didn’t talk specifically about one thing in his writings that he never thought about this subject or do some analysis to make some verifications. Secondly, it’s a fact that Rogers was fully aware of the interesting property of the body image (a property that is almost strong enough in itself to eliminate any painting theory). If you go to the pages 109 and 110 of Rogers book, you’ll see a pretty exhaustive list of FACTS concerning the body image on the Shroud. By the way, I think M. Rolfe should have consider that list with an extreme care before writing his own list ! Obviously, he did not ! If you go to point #1 of Rogers list, you’ll read this : “Nothing moved from an image area when water flowed through it.” This single phrase is enough to prove that Rogers was fully aware of this property of the image. And more than that, we have to take note of what Rogers said in the introduction of his list (page 109) : “A summary of the observations that I believe can now be confirmed and that MUST BE USED in hypothesis testing.” So you can see that, for Rogers, it was clear that any serious hypothesis concerning the image formation on the Shroud should be able to match all these observations !!! So, when you take this into account, along the fact that Rogers was a real meticulous and professional scientist (a real one and not some wannabe), it’s easy to understand that he would never have written “Maillard products are NOT water soluble, and they do not move when wetted” if he was not convinced that it was completely true ! Here, it’s important to note that Rogers was talking about the products of a Maillard reaction in the context of the Shroud (a reaction that would involved a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the cloth and some gases coming from a corpse) and not in the context of the food industry (concerning the fabrication of beer or other products like that)… So, in summary : 1 We know for a fact that Rogers science was not driven by his faith or by anything else than a quest for truth regarding the Shroud. Taking that into account, I don’t see any good reason to think that he would have proclaim something important in his writings if he wasn’t convinced that it was really a FACT. On the contrary, if we could detect even the slightest sign of some religious bias in Rogers thinking, writings and/or sayings, that would be a totally different story. But that’s not the case ! And I think anyone who knew him well (Barrie Schwortz for example) can testify that Rogers was only interested to find the truth regarding the Shroud and nothing else. In other words, he had absolutely no philosophy or religious belief to defend and, in that respect, there’s nothing to suggest that he could have “USED” the Shroud for some unclean purpose. Note : Rogers himself made it very clear in his book that he was following the scientific method, meaning that he was only going in the direction where the facts and observations were leading him in order to find a credible hypothesis regarding the body image. And note that he did it in the correct way : Firstly, he took note of all the confirmed facts and observations he could find about the Shroud (the list of observations he wrote on pages 109 and 110 of his book is the perfect example of that) and then, only after this collection of data was done, he started to reflect on a possible hypothesis that could fit properly with all those facts and observations. In sum, there’s absolutely no proof at all that can show that the pretension of Rogers to follow properly this scientific method was a lie or that he put aside some data that wouldn’t fit with his preconceived ideas (in fact, there’s nothing to even suggest that). The way Rogers have worked regarding the Shroud is the right way to do science. Here, I just want to add a personal comment : Sadly, following the carbon 14 dating of 1988, some other Shroud researchers (I don’t want to give any name here) have done precisely the opposite, meaning that they have firstly thought about a possible process for the formation of the body image (often influenced by their religious belief and also their will to contradict the C14 dating at all cost) and then, they have started to collect all the data that could help them to comfort their preconception, while forgetting some others that would be problematic ! That’s the wrong way to do science. 2 We know for a fact that Rogers was an expert in chemistry and knew anything that needed to be known about the Maillard reactions. Note : On that subject, when you read his book, it’s evident that he made an extensive research about those kind of chemical reactions in the context of the Shroud. 3 We know for a fact that Rogers was fully aware of the way the body image on the Shroud has reacted (in this case we should say has not reacted) in presence of water. 4 We know for a fact that he considered this observation has an authentic and important criterion that NEED TO BE MATCH by any credible hypothesis regarding the image formation. 5 We know for a fact that Rogers proposed his hypothesis with the sense that it was, for him, the most credible hypothesis concerning the body image on the Shroud. Note : This was the case simply because the Maillard reaction hypothesis he proposed was, for him, the best one that exist in order to match properly a majority of the facts and observations he mentioned on pages 109 and 110 of his book. 6 We know for a fact that Rogers was convinced that the coloration that would be obtained with a Maillard reaction (as described in his book in the context of a layer of carbohydrates impurities and some gas coming from a dead body) WOULD NOT MOVE IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER. Note : If he said so in his book, it can only mean one thing : For him, there’s no question that the Maillard reaction hypothesis he described was able to closely match this criterion concerning the water (an important criterion that we found in the point #1 of his list, on page 109). When you take all those facts into account, I think you need the highest faith in the non professionalism of Rogers to still pretend that his Maillard reaction hypothesis is not able to match the fact that “the image color does not dissolve or migrate in water.” (page 106 of Rogers book). All this reflection leads me to believe that Rogers assertion MUST BE TRUE concerning this point. I simply don’t see him pretend something important like that (he consider it himself to be an important criterion) without having done some important verification to confirm his claim… In fact, this question is pretty much like the question regarding the primary cell wall ! You can be sure of one thing : If Rogers wasn’t totally convinced that the Maillard reaction he proposed could match this important criterion (and that it was something else than impurities that was colored, like the primary cell wall for example), he would have dropped this hypothesis well before he died !!! A criterion like the one we found at #1 in his list is simply too important to be forgotten (or to not be verify) when you want to propose any credible hypothesis regarding the image, and you can be sure that Rogers was completely aware of this situation (he wouldn’t have put this criterion at #1 in his list if it wasn’t the case). In that context, I just cannot see Rogers claiming something like “Maillard products are NOT water soluble, and they do not move when wetted” if it wasn’t the case in reality. Now, it’s up to you. Do you really believe that Rogers hypothesis is wrong because of the claim made by Collinsberry, i.e. That “Maillard products are water soluble” ??? P.S. 1 : Of course, all I said here doesn’t mean that Rogers never made any mistakes or misinterpretations, but thinking that an expert in chemistry like him could have pass by the supposed “fact” that every Maillard products would always move in presence of water, that’s enormous !!! And more than this, if this was true, that would even mean that Ray Rogers was a liar because he explicitly pretend the opposite on page 106 of his book !!! And I can say that it’s pretty much the same thing with the idea that he could have confused a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities with the primary cell wall of a linen fiber, because he clearly states that the linen fiber was not affected at all during the image formation process !!! P.S. 2 : The fact that so many people around here ALWAYS put seriously in doubt everything Rogers have said is a pretty good indicator of the great importance of his contribution to the Shroud world, because if it wasn’t so, those people would not consider him and his science seriously at all and they would NEVER even speak about him ! Like I said before, for many people in the Shroud world, Ray Rogers was a big pain in the a**, simply because his findings and conclusions don’t go well with their preconceived ideas concerning the Shroud !!! I’m sorry for those people but, no matter what you pretend, the science of Ray Rogers was never buried with him when he died in 2005 and I think it is here to stay… unless a real scientist can PROVE him wrong properly on a particular point (while using also the scientific method, just like Rogers did). And on his most important conclusions (the thin layer of impurities as the image chromophore and the fact that we don’t need a miracle to explain the body image on the Shroud are 2 examples of these conclusions), I’m not aware that any scientist has ever succeeded, for the moment, to officially and completely discard even one of them… It’s one thing to freely claim he was off track about this or about that, but it’s another thing to go into a laboratory and scientifically prove your pretension with some experimentation done the right way !!!.","date":"2012-05-21","mins":"5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/21/creative-comment-of-the-day-by-colin-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Creative Comment of the Day by Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-11513","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I have made a little typing error in a phrase near the beginning of my long comment.

It is important to recognize that Maillard colors WILL FORM every time amines (note from me : that include ammoniac gas) and simple starches and/or sugars come together.” One more thing : It is important to note that there is some possibilities that the hypothesis of Rogers CAN be one part of a combination of chemical processes. Rogers himself was fully aware of this possibility. And one last thing to conclude : It is impossible to know whether or not the shroud was made with the same exact technique as describe by Pliny the Elder, but what we can say is that some observations and facts (like the banding effect who most probably come from the ancient technique of bleaching the cloth before the weaving was done, the confirmed presence of starch impurities and pectin deposit on the surface of the Shroud, etc.) tend to show that it was really the case….","date":"2012-05-21","mins":"6:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/21/creative-comment-of-the-day-by-colin-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Creative Comment of the Day by Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-11546","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Collinsberry wrote this : “So many words in defence of a man who quite simply did not do enough experiments to back his claim. It’s not rocket science. You make two classes of yellow brown pigments – one with a Maillard reaction between known sugars and known amines, and the other by pyrolysis/caramelisation reactions with carbohydrates alone. You then compare the two classes in their response to a range of chemicals, e.g. Hydrogen peroxide, diimide etc, or behaviour on electrophoresis (do they migrate to the positive or negative electrode?) – or ion exchange resins etc. Having established one or more tests that distinguish between the two classes (which should not be an insuperable task, given the major effect of having an organic base present or absent) you then see how the Shroud image behaves in that discriminating test. Based on the number of factors that would have to coincide for Rogers’ hypothesis to work, I’d estimate the chances of the Shroud image being a Maillard reaction product at about 1% of less. In fact, I’ll make a prediction. The nitrogen content of an image area per mg of organic carbon will be no higher than that of non image area (a Maillard reaction requiring nitrogen in the form of protein or simple amines). I see no a priori reasons for giving the Rogers’ hypothesis equal footing with that of chemical change not needing an external source of nitrogen or reducing sugar. There are plenty of reactive chemicals present in situ, especially the pentosans of PCW hemicelluloses without having to invoke adventitious impurities. Moderator/censor Dan can now have a break for a while, since I’m off on a touring holiday and will only be on line to check emails.” Here’s my reply : When you say that there’s no need to call for a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the cloth to explain the image because there is some carbohydrates in the pcw, you completely forget all the facts and observations that were collected regarding the body image and, by acting like that, I can include you in the category of those who do bad science (or science “in reverse” because they start with a preconception instead of the facts). In reality, it’s obvious that you can’t or you don’t want to follow properly the scientific method. Unlike you, Rogers did. He took ALL the facts that are there and follow them in the direction they were pointing. Sorry, but that’s not what you seem to do. Just because there’s some carbohydrates in the pcw, that’s enough for you to proclaim it the chromphore of the image ! WOW ! What a nice reasoning ! If you really want to defend the hypothesis of the pcw, then can you give me some clear and scientific answers to those questions : 1 If the pcw was colored, how can you explain the reduction of the color with diimide that LEAVE A COLORLESS, LUSTROUS AND UNDAMMAGED LINEN FIBERS BEHIND (that’s a new quote from Rogers that I just discovered recently). How in the world the reduction of the pcw with a chemical agent like diimide would left A COLORLESS, LUSTROUS AND UNDAMMAGED LINEN FIBERS BEHIND ??? 2 If the pcw was colored, how can you explain the ghosts of color in the sticky tapes who also left a clean linen fiber behind ? 3 If the pcw was colored, how can you explain the direct correlation between the banding effect and the body image, especially for the 2 sides of the face where it’s proven that there’s really an image but it is so faint that it is almost impossible to see it with the naked eyes ? 4 If the pcw was colored, how can you explain (without being obliged to invoke a miracle) the extreme superficiality od the body image ? As I know, every single fibers that composed the Shroud have a pcw around them, whether they are located on top of the cloth or more deep into it !!! If the pcw was really colored, I really don’t think there’s one known and natural mechanism that can account for the extreme superficiality of the image, simply because there’s pcw in every parts of the cloth… If the pcw was colored, then why, in no part of the body image (even those who were probably in direct contact with the body), there is absolutely no penetration of the color after we pass the second or third superficial fiber ? In this context, what natural process could have created a barrier to avoid any penetration of the color and protect the pcw located more deep in the cloth ? On the contrary, the hypothesis of the thin layer of impurities on top of the cloth is able to account perfectly, naturally and logically for this very particular aspect of the body image. 5 If the pcw was colored, how can you explain the doubly superficial image of the hair, mustache and beard that can be present on the Shroud ? Here, I know this is not a confirmed fact, but I would like you to think that it is for a second. IF one day science can confirmed that there really is a doubly superficial image in the region of the hair on the Shroud frontal part, then I don’t see one natural mechanism of image formation that can account for the fact that there would only be the most superficial pcw that would have been colored on both sides of the cloth and that, at the same time, absolutely no pcw located more deep into the cloth would have been colored. In other words, what was so special about the most superficial pcw to explain that it was the only pcw that have been colored ? This is completely illogical ! On the contrary, the hypothesis of the thin layer of impurities on top of the cloth is also able to account perfectly, naturally and logically for this very particular aspect of the body image if there really was a Maillard reaction that was going on at the time of the image formation between a thin layer of impurities (located on both surface) and some gas emit by the dead body. I’ll wait patiently for your answers to those questions… One more thing, even if it’s true that the pcw his partially composed of more reactive carbohydrates (hemicellulose and pectin) than cellulose itself, if we understand Rogers writings well, it is MUCH MORE EASY to color a thin layer of starch impurities by chemical means than the linen fiber itself (including the pcw). Note : When Rogers talked about cellulose in his writings, he was referring to the whole linen fiber, including the pcw. And since that’s a proven fact that there really is some starch fractions (along with a deposit of pectin coming from the retting process) on the surface of the Shroud, it is completely logical to assume that this impurity layer would have been colored well before the pcw of the fibers if there was a presence and/or a release inside the Shroud of any products (like ammoniac gas for example) that could react with carbohydrates. On this particular question, I don’t know why you always seem to dismiss out of hand the FACT that there really is some starch fractions and a pectin deposit that have been found on the Shroud. Not taking that most important FACT into account properly is a good example of someone who doesn’t follow correctly the scientific method, on the contrary of Ray Rogers….","date":"2012-05-22","mins":"4:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/21/creative-comment-of-the-day-by-colin-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Creative Comment of the Day by Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-33570","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote : “The TS image is definively unique.” Comment : In many ways, it’s true.

Carreira. You can find this paper here : http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/carreira.pdf Most of these quotes are really helpful to confirm my idea that Rogers was using the word “cellulose” in his writings as a general term for “the whole linen fiber”, including most certainly the primary cell wall. And once you understand that this is really a fact, then all the quotes from Rogers on this important topic became much more clear and you understand that, for him, there was nothing in the data from the Shroud to suggest that the primary cell wall of the linen fiber had been colored during the image formation process. So, here’s the quotes, along with some personal notes from me : 1 The image color can be reduce chemically (diimide and sodium borohydride), leaving COLORLESS, LUSTROUS LINEN FIBERS. Also, in the same paper, there’s another quote from Rogers on the same subject : The layer of color can be specifically reduce with diimide, leaving a COLORLESS FLAX FIBER behind. Diimide reduction CONFIRMED the presence of double bounds. Personal note : It’s very interesting to compare those 2 quotes with another one, found in Rogers book this time, concerning the same topic : “Heller and Adler found that the image fibers could be decolorized with diimide. Reduction left COLORLESS, UNDAMAGED CELLULOSE FIBERS BEHIND.” So you see ? Rogers was sometines using both expressions “cellulose fibers” and “linen (or flax) fibers” to speak about the very same topic. This little comparison between two different quotes from Rogers is nothing less than a confirmation of my interpretation of Rogers words ! Here, there’s no room for misinterpretation. It’s evident that Rogers was often using the term “cellulose” in a very general sense that was meaning “the whole linen fiber” in reality. And because it is so, we have to think that this general terme “cellulose” was also including the primary cell wall, since it is an integrant part of a linen fiber. There’s no way to believe that Rogers wanted to exclude the primary cell wall when he was using the expressions “cellulose fibers” or “linen fibers”. 2 Later we found that the image color reside ONLY ON THE OUTER SURFACES of image fibers : the FLAX FIBER WAS NOT COLORED AT ALL. Personal note : Here again, it is very interesting to compare this quote with another one, found in Rogers book, concerning the same topic : “The color reside only on the surface of the fibers, and it is the result of conjugated double bounds. The underlying CELLULOSE (LINEN) FIBERS are not colored.” Here, again, we have a very good confirmation that Rogers was sometines using both expressions “cellulose” and “linen (or flax) fibers” to speak about the very same topic. And again, since it is really the case, we have to think that this general terme “cellulose” was also including the primary cell wall, since it is an integrant part of a linen fiber. There’s no way to believe that Rogers wanted to exclude the primary cell wall when he was using the expressions “cellulose fibers” or “linen fibers”. 3 I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source : the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was NO MORE DEFECTIVE than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose. Personal note : Here, we can’t use this quote to confirm the fact that Rogers really meant “the whole linen fiber, including the primary cell wall” when he was using the word “cellulose”, but this quote is interesting nevertheless, because it help to understand that the linen fiber itself, including the primary cell wall, was most probably unaffected during the image formation process, because there’s no more defaults in the crystal structure of the flax image fibers than there is in the crystal structure of the non image fibers. That’s why this last quote is also very important. After reading those quotes, if someone still pretend that Rogers didn’t thought about the primary cell wall as a possible chromophore for the image, then I think we can say that this person don’t want to see the reality !!! All the quotes from Rogers that I found during the last week are well enough to conclude, without any serious doubt, that Rogers was well aware of that part of the fiber (like any other part of the fiber) and conclude that this was not a good candidate for the image chromophore, in the light of all the facts and observations that he knew about the body image on the Shroud. Instead, he conclude that a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities that came from the ancient way of manufacturing linen was a much better candidate. Even if I know that some Shroud researchers don’t like it, I’m sorry for them but THAT’S THE REALITY !!! Now, it’s up to everyone to believe Rogers conclusion or not… Personally, I think that until there’s another round of direct chemical, spectral and microscopic researches done on samples from the Shroud, Rogers hypothesis will most probably stayed the most probable hypothesis we have concerning the image chromphore, simply because it is the only one who seem to be able to fit correctly with all the known observations and facts we know about the body image (like, for example, the diimide, the ghosts, the banding effect and the extreme superficiality of the image)..","date":"2012-05-23","mins":"8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/21/creative-comment-of-the-day-by-colin-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Creative Comment of the Day by Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-5945","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I remember !

And as I know, so far, the only scientist who’s ever been able to accomplish the feat of only producing a coloration similar to the Shroud’s image in a thin layer of impurities without affecting the fiber underneath is Ray Rogers himself while using ammoniac gas.

But as I said (based on the words of Rogers himself), it is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that she will be able to ONLY colored a thin layer of impurities without affecting ALSO the underneath linen fibers with her electro static method. And whether it be just the PCW of the fibers or the whole fiber, if we trust Rogers judgment, that doesn’t matter… From the moment one portion of the linen fiber itself is colored or abrade or damaged by one particular source of energy (including the UV laser and most probably also an electro static discharge), then, for Ray Rogers, that means this kind of energetic discharge is INCONSISTENT with the real nature of the Shroud’s image. And for Rogers, it is almost impossible to expect that one particular low energetic discharge can be able to colored or affect ONLY a thin layer of impurities without affecting also the linen fiber underneath. I repeat that all this argumentation is based on the conclusion of Rogers concerning the chromophore of the body image, which he believed was located ONLY in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities AND NOTHING ELSE. For Rogers, the linen fiber underneath has not not affected in any way by the image formation process and the ghost of color found in the sticky tapes, which left a clean linen behind, was for him the best piece of evidence that it is really the case. The bottom line of this whole thing is this: Anyone can claim to have reproduced the Shroud’s image or having produced something similar in many ways, but if it’s not completely the same, I’m affraid we have to start looking elsewhere for a better explanation. I think after all the years of experiments done by the ENEA team, time has come for them to start looking at other possible avenues because I truly don’t think they will be able to only color a thin layer of impurities one day without affecting also the primary cell wall. I think they have come full circle with their experiments and have to wait and see if a new series of direct researches on the Shroud will confirm Rogers conclusion or not versus the chromophore. If it did one day, then that would mean any hypothesis involving one kind of energetic radiation will have to be discarded as a possible solution for the Shroud’s image.

Di Lazzaro and his team with a UV laser. For me, these experiments are very interesting and even important because it clearly shows that the best thing we can possibly expect from an energetic radiation that hit a linen cloth is at least a coloration of the thin layer of impurities located on top of the fibers AND ALSO a coloration of the primary cell wall of the linen fiber, which is the first layer of the fiber. This is very telling because it is a confirmation of Ray Rogers’ conclusion who once wrote that, in his mind, it is highly improbable that any kind of energetic radiation can be able to ONLY color a thin layer of impurities without affecting and coloring the linen fiber located underneath. In fact, Rogers was pretty sure about that because he did make some coloring experiments with energetic radiation and the best thing he could get was the same kind of result obtained by M. Di Lazzaro and his team, i.e. A coloration of only the primary cell wall of the fiber (with no coloration of the heart of the fiber) with a corona discharge. The description of this experiment can be found in his book A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin. And Rogers was very clear about the fact that, in his mind, this kind of result is NOT CONSISTENT with the real nature of the body image on the Shroud, which is located only in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities and NOTHING ELSE (i.e. It leaves the underneath fiber COMPLETELY INTACT EVEN ON ITS SURFACE). The bottom line is this: I truly don’t think we can expect anything more from the UV laser experiments of M. Di Lazzaro and his team and, if we base our judgment on Rogers’ conclusions, we have to conclude that this kind of energetic radiation is not able to explain the Shroud’s image. And I think we can expect the same for any other sort of energetic radiation… In sum, I think Shroud scientists who want to explain the Shroud’s image properly have to find other coloration processes that can ONLY color a thin layer of impurities, while leaving the linen fiber underneath completely intact. And so far, as I know, the only experimental result that match completely this very particular characteristic is the one made by Rogers with a linen sample made with the ancient method of making linen and an exposition to ammoniac gas. Again, you can find a good description of this particular experiment in Rogers’ book (note the figure XI 4 in page 104 of the PDF version of his book). Because of Rogers’ experiments, I have a very hard time to believe that anything else than a gaseous or molecular transfer from a dead body to a linen cloth can really give a similar result (i.e. A coloration that is ONLY located in the thin layer of impurities while the fiber underneath is left intact). That’s the main reason why I highly favored this kind of natural hypothesis involving a gaseous and/or a molecular transfer over any other hypothesis that has even been proposed to explain the Shroud’s image..","date":"2012-12-13","mins":"11:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/10/enea-magazine-special-edition-new-paper-on-shroud-of-turin-conservation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"ENEA Magazine Special Edition: New Paper on Shroud of Turin Conservation"},{"id":"comment-20235","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The most interesting thing for me in this new paper from M. Di Lazzaro and his team is this line : “In our irradiations, a key role is played by the VUV absorption band below 200 nm of alkene groups ( C=C ) [11] typically present in degraded cellulose and in ORGANIC IMPURITIES OF THE PRIMARY CELL WALL of linen fibers.” I think all the discussion I and others did here on the blog were eventually noticed by M. Di Lazzaro because it’s the first time I read a mention of some colored impurities in one of his paper! This quote is VERY IMPORTANT because: 1 It is an indirect acknoledgement from him that Rogers was most probably correct about the fact that there really are impurities on the surface of the Shroud and these impurities were colored during the image formation. 2 It clearly show that in his own experiments with UV lasers, M. Di Lazzaro and his team were unable to colored uniquely the thin layer of organic impurities that was present on top of the linen fibers in their samples and this truly constitutes a MAJOR DIFFERENCE versus the body image on the Shroud, if we believe Ray Rogers conclusion that states that ONLY the superficial impurities residing on top of the cloth were colored during the image formation process and the linen fiber itself (including the primary cell wall) was NOT affected at all by this coloration process. This is truly the most important discrepancy that exist between the results of M. Di Lazzaro and the Shroud, if we believe Ray Rogers conclusions about the Shroud. Concerning these experiments done by M. Di Lazzaro and his team, the bottom line remains the same as I often said on this blog: IF Rogers was right about the nature of the coloration that is present on the Shroud, then I’m afraid M. Di Lazzaro will have to look elsewhere to find the right image formation process that is responsible for the body image on the Shroud! Effectively, Rogers was clear about the fact that, in his profesionnal ONLY impurities on top of the linen fibers have been colored by the image formation process AND NOTHING ELSE. And he was also very clear about the fact that any energetic radiation that would color a thin layer of impurities located on top of a linen fiber would certainly colored also the linen fiber underneath, which is DIFFERENT than the real nature of the body image on the Shroud. And this is exacly the result reported by M. Di Lazzaro and his team in their new paper about the UV lasers!!! Very interesting. If Rogers would be here today, I’m certain he would say that this kind of result is NOT the same as the body image on the Shroud because the fiber underneath the impurities has also been colored… In sum, for Rogers, the ghost of color left stuck in the sticky tapes and the complete dillution of the color with diimide and a few other very strong chemical products made it clear that the linen fiber itself (including the primary cell wall) has NOT been colored at all on the Shroud and only the impurities were, which is truly different than the result reported by M. Di Lazzaro. Finally, note that on the Shroud, there seems to be more than just organic impurities coming from the primary cell wall as it was found by M. Di Lazzaro on his own samples. Effectively, starch deposits (i.e. An added product most probably used for the weaving of the linen cloth, which is a good sign that the cloth is ancient) were also found by Mc Crone and confirmed by Rogers later on. In other words, the linen samples used by M. Di Lazzaro for his experiments is not quite the same as the ancient linen of the Shroud because it doesn’t seems that starch deposits were present on these samples. Would be interesting for him to make another run of testing with linen samples that got some starch deposits added on the surface of the top most fibers. No doubt that samples prepared that way would be much more like the Shroud’s linen, chemically speaking..","date":"2012-12-11","mins":"3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/10/enea-magazine-special-edition-new-paper-on-shroud-of-turin-conservation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"ENEA Magazine Special Edition: New Paper on Shroud of Turin Conservation"},{"id":"comment-20220","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I aked myself the same question that you Kelly and I truly don’t think they did that.

But my point is this: They were unable to ONLY colored the thin layer of impurities they claim to be present over the fibers of their linen samples!!! Effectively, not only did their UV laser colored this layer but he also colored the primary cell wall of the linen fiber too, which is NOT CONSISTENT with Rogers conclusion concerning the chromophore of the body image on the Shroud! In fact, these results of Di Lazzaro and his team only confirmed one important assumptions made by Rogers, which is this: “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source : the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was NO MORE DEFECTIVE than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” In other words, Rogers conclude that ANY KIND of energetic radiation would almost certainly penetrate through a thin layer of impurity to affect and colored ALSO the linen fiber located underneath and THAT’S EXACTLY THE RESULTS REPORTED BY DI LAZZARO IN HIS PAPER!!! Because of this, we can conclude with confidence that ROGERS WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT and since the UV laser is not able to ONLY colored a thin layer of impurities without coloring also the PCW of the linen fiber underneath, we can also conclude with a high level of confidence that this kind of result is INCONSISTENT with the real nature of the Shroud’s image. In sum, it is pretty close but not really on the target. Of course, all this is true only if Rogers conclusion is correct versus the chromophore of the image but right now, I don’t see any good reason to doubt this particular conclusion. In fact, the results reported by Di Lazzaro only reinforced Rogers conclusion! I’m sure you understand my point now! And concerning your idea of pushing the experiments of De Liso further, may I remind you that his hypothesis ALSO rest on one particular kind of energetic radiation? In that context, we MUST expect that any new experiments he can make will ALWAYS give the same kind of results Di Lazzaro obtained with his UV laser, i.e. A coloration that affect not only the thin layer of impurities located over the fiber but ALSO the linen fiber itself, whether it be only the primary cell wall of the fiber or the entirety of the fiber! I really don’t think De Liso can expect another result than the kind of result obtained by Di Lazzaro and his team, which really appear to be INCONSISTENT with the real nature of the Shroud’s image.

Another homogeneous characteristic comes from the fact that the chemical nature of the colored fibers composing the image are identical and, as Rogers said so well, it is a proven fact that every part of this image was produced by the same process. The only slight non homogeneous characteristic of the image chromophore is the density of the image (which depends on the proportion of colored fibers per unit area) that is slightly different depending on the thread. Also, at thread level, we find an important non homogeneous characteristic for the image when it comes to the distribution of colored fibers, which look pretty much like the results that can be obtained by some low energy stochastic processes (like a population exposed to a low amount of chemical pollution or a low amount of radiation). Berry’s image formation proposal is obviously not able to fully reproduce at once all the homogeneous characteristics of the image I just described, so it’s not surprising that he wants to make believe the image on the Shroud not really homogeneous… To conclude my comment, here’s an extract of a previous comments I made concerning the MAA paper I wrote with Fazio and Mandaglio… I think this extract fits very well here: “…it’s obvious that if the release of energy would have been important (like in the case of numerous radiation hypotheses that have been proposed over the years, including a corona discharge and a burst of UV light – note: here, I would add “and also any kind of scorch”), we would expect, in theory, to get a coloring result that would shows some important differences of properties than what has been observed on the Shroud. Here’s some probable differences we could expect: a) a yellowing of all the fibers that would have been hit by this high energy in question, which would probably have resulted in a much more homogeneous distribution of colored fibers in the image area, and particularly in the zones of direct contact where the energy was at his peak (which is not what is seen on the Shroud and which must be considered as a « deterministic process » and not a stochastic process) and/or b) a difference in the level of penetration of the color inside a particular linen thread (which is not what is seen on the Shroud), whether the source of that high energy was located in direct contact with the cloth (thus producing a more in deep penetration of color inside the linen threads receiving that energy, because of the presence of more energy there) or at some distance from it (thus producing a more superficial penetration of color inside the threads, because less energy would be present there) and/or c) a difference in the level of penetration of the color inside the structure of a particular linen fiber (which is not what is seen on the Shroud), whether the source of that high energy was located in direct contact with the cloth (thus producing a more in deep penetration of color inside the structure of the linen fibers receiving that energy, because of the presence of more energy there) or at some distance from it (thus producing a more superficial penetration of color inside the fibers, because less energy would be present there).”.","date":"2014-10-22","mins":"10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/22/homogeneous-or-not-thats-the-question/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Homogeneous or Not?

Here’s my answer to him (that could be good for anyone else) : If you really want to study the question further, buy the book of Rogers and read it carefully. There a part in his book where he comment specifically about the hypothesis of Corona discharge. And don’t forget, Rogers was an expert in the field of radiations. I’m sure of one thing : If he would have thought 2 seconds that the image was generated by some kind of radiation or electric discharge, he would have told us. It wasn’t the case at all ! All he wrote was against this possibility. At least, buy the book and see for yourself ! It’s the best scientific book I’ve ever read about the Shroud. If it would be proved one day that the image was generated by a process involving quantum mechanics, then it wouldn’t be a supernatural event ! What I think is that science for the moment is not able to fully understand the image because there’s too much unknown surrounding it. And maybe these unknown data will make that we’ll never be able to fully understand the image formation process… At least, I’m confident that a new series of direct testings on the Shroud will resolve many issues surrounding it and we’ll be able to understand way better the image on the cloth. Another I’m sure of is the fact that nature is really surprising sometimes !!! Because I think the Shroud is genuine, I had to ask myself why God wanted to let an imprint of his Son on a Shroud ? I think the main purpose of this is, for the Holy spirit, to reach many doubters and made them think ! I also think one other purpose (and it worked for me) is to give more strenght to my faith and also, to provide the most incredible Icon of the passion and death of Christ to help our meditation.

I also want to say thank you also to Thibault Heimburger because we exchange some recent emails and he too forces me to rethink the whole issue in the light of these quotes taken from the 2010 paper he wrote with Fanti and Di Lazzaro.

In sum, I think Rogers was probably right about the impurities as the main chromophore but I think it is truly possible that the growth nodes (or dislocation bands as Thibault call them) could also have been affected by the image formation process directly or by a long time of exposure to a dehydrated layer of impurities that was in direct contact with them. It is this chemical degradation of the growth nodes (dislocation bands) that would have been eventually responsible for the fact that the image fibers really appear to be more fragile and could break more easily… I think this idea deserves some thoughts..","date":"2013-01-02","mins":"2:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”"},{"id":"comment-21434","author":"yannick_clément","post":"First I want to point out the fact that the interpretation made by Fanti et al. In their paper that said this “Image area tapes (pressure sensitive adhesive tapes used by STURP team to sample the TS) “lifted” more easily than non image tapes suggesting that the topmost fibers in the image area were somehow weakened” is in fact an erroneous interpretation of an observation made by Rogers in 1978. I wanted to point out that the original observation Rogers made in 1978 was this: “Tapes pulled from the darker body image areas with extreme ease: I could barely measure the pulling force.” And such an observation concerned ONLY the level of Adherence of the tapes that was much lower in the image areas and this never concerned the strength of the fibers themselves. Here’s the correct interpretation made by Rogers himself: “Dehydration causes shrinkage; therefore, any coating of carbohydrate impurities would “CRAZE” during dehydration. Such a crazed coating would be easy to pull off with adhesive, explaining the EASY REMOVAL of tapes from image areas.” In other words, according to Rogers, the fact that there are fibers in the image areas whose surface impurities were dehydrated, it produces a narrowing of the impurity layer accompanied by fine cracks, which results in reducing the Adherence level of the surface of the cloth and it is for this reason that the tape applied by him were much easier to take off in areas with image. That’s all!!! It has nothing to do with the level of ease to remove fiber or not, as it was suggested by Fanti et al. In their paper. Note that, according to Rogers, the result would be the same if it was pcw (or entire fiber) would be oxidized and/or dehydrated. In short, this observation Rogers made in Turin in 1978 does not say what is the real chromophore of the image. BUT… It cannot be taken as something that can go against Rogers’ hypothesis concerning the chromophore being located ONLY in a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers. And for Rogers, this observation made by himself in 1978 is totally consistent with his hypothesis concerning the image chromophore concerning the impurities. Here’s one relevant quote of Rogers about that: “…the surfaces (of the image fibers) appeared to be “CORRODED”. That observation suggests that a VERY THIN COATING OF CARBOHYDRATE had been significantly dehydrated on the OUTER SURFACES of the fibers.” You see? For Rogers, the corroded aspect of the image fibers was simply to a dehydration of the impurity layer and this dehydrated layer was the cause of the lower adherence level of the image areas surfaces. That’s all!!!! Fanti et al. Would like people to believe that Rogers was dead wrong and that the primary cell wall is the real chromophore and to do that, they have made a bad extrapolation of one of Rogers’ observation concerning the sticky tapes… Why do you think they want so much the chromophore to reside in the primary cell wall instead of a thin layer of impurities? Simply because that’s the result they get with their personal image formation hypotheses involving a corona discharge or a UV laser!!!.","date":"2013-01-01","mins":"5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”"},{"id":"comment-21488","author":"yannick_clément","post":"You should read at the end: on a solid ground….","date":"2013-01-02","mins":"3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”"},{"id":"comment-21490","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The correct title of Rogers’ paper is Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin – A Review in 2002.

Remember that this particular paper was published in 2010, while Di Lazzaro got his first coloration results located in the primary cell wall in 2008 (and maybe even before)!!!

First, I can confirm the accuracy of the quote given by Fanti et al. That say: “Image area tapes (pressure sensitive adhesive tapes used by STURP team to sample the TS) “lifted” more easily than non image tapes suggesting that the topmost fibers in the image area were somehow weakened.” This comes directly from the paper “Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin” published in 1982 by Rogers and Schwalbe for STURP. You can found this exact quote in page 11 of that paper. And I can also confirm the accuracy of the rest of that particular quote in Fanti et al. Paper that say: “the linen fibers seen on the body image tapes shorter and more fractures than are those from nonimage areas.” This comes directly from the paper “A Comprehensive Examination of the Various Stains and Images on the Shroud of Turin” published in 1984 by Jumper, Adler, Jackson, Pellicori, Heller and Druzik. You can find this exact quote in page 454 of that paper, along with the same quote taken from Rogers and Schwalbe’s paper. Here’s the entire quote: “Schwalbe and Rogers note that in removing the tape samples, the tape pulled up more easily from the body image areas than from the non image areas. The linen fibrils seen on the body image tapes are shorter and more fractured than are those from non image areas. Both of these observations suggest that the body image fibrils are more chemically degraded than are those from the non image areas.” It’s interesting to note the little change at the end. Rogers and Schwalbe wrote “somehow weakened” and Jumper et al. Wrote “more chemically degraded”, which can mean roughly the same thing in the end. And in the same paper published by Jumper et al., I have found 2 others relevant quotes: “The physical properties of the cloth in the areas of the body only image (the microscopically corroded appearance, the lack of migration of the image with water, THE LOWER TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE COLORED FIBRILS, and the lack of color change in the presence of elevated temperature) are all consistent with this sort of chemistry (i.e. The chemistry of a light scorch).” You can found this exact quote in page 456 of that paper and they gave the paper published by Rogers and Schwalbe as a reference for these observations. “At 500x to 1000x magnification, the (non image) fibrils have the typical morphology of linen, but their surfaces are only lightly corroded (oxidized) although clearly less than body only image fibrils as seen by phase microscopy. There are, also, FEWER BROKEN AND CRUSHED FIBRILS THAN IN THE BODY ONLY IMAGE AREAS, SHOWING LESS DEGRADATION in further support the arguments presented in the body only image chemistry (i.e. That the image is the product of an oxidation dehydration of the linen fibers).” You can found this exact quote in page 464 of that paper and they gave no reference this time, so I assume that such a microscopic conclusion came from Adler and Heller. Now that I have found all these pertinent quotes, I have to think that Rogers really change his mind drastically between the days of the STURP team and the last few years of his life, while he was trying to explain the image scientifically, because at first sight, when you only consider these quotes, you really have a sense that it is effectively the linen fibers themselves that have been chemically degraded by the image formation process in a similar way than the scorched fibers on the Shroud. It’s somewhat intriguing to note that, in all the writings he did in the last few years of his life, Rogers never reported the observation that probably came from Adler and Heller concerning the fact that “there are more broken and crushed fibrils in image areas, showing more degradation.” However, he did talked about the fact that the surfaces of the image fibers are more corroded (chemically degraded) and interpret it like this: “At high optical magnifications, up to 1000 X, no coatings could be resolve on the surfaces of image fibers; however, the surfaces appeared to be “corroded”. That observation suggests that a very thin coating of carbohydrate had been significantly dehydrated on the outer surfaces of the fibers.” So, near the end of his life, Rogers was really thinking that the chemical degradation noted by himself and other STURP members during the STURP investigation could be consistent with a body image color that would be located only in a thin layer of impurities while leaving the linen fiber intact. He also wrote: “Dehydration causes shrinkage; therefore, any coating of carbohydrate impurities would “craze” during dehydration. Such a crazed coating would be easy to pull off with adhesive, explaining the easy removal of tapes from image areas.” Again, this quote show that, near the end of his life, Rogers was really thinking that the observation he made in Turin in 1978 concerning the fact that the sticky tape pulled up more easily from the body image areas than from the non image areas could be due to a dehydrated layer of impurities instead of an oxidation dehydration of the linen fiber itself (possibly located in the primary cell wall). So far, I have no problem with Rogers reasoning. But I have some difficulty to understand Rogers thinking in the light of the observation probably reported by Adler and Heller that “there are more broken and crushed fibrils in image areas, showing more degradation.” Unfortunatelly, in all the official writings of Rogers that I have read for my documentary research, I never found a place where he talked about that particular observation versus his own hypothesis concerning the impurities. Too bad Rogers is not here no more to adress that issue! Nevertheless, because Rogers seemed to be so convinced that all the facts and observations coming from the Shroud were consistent with the hypothesis of a body image color only present in a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities while the underneath fibers are left intact, I JUST CAN’T IMAGINE SOMEONE AS PROFESSIONAL AS ROGERS NEGLECTING SUCH AN IMPORTANT OBSERVATION when he was trying to build a scientific hypothesis to explain the Shroud’s image! Such an idea is just too ludicrous when you know the integrity and profesionalism of a guy like Rogers and when you consider the fact that he was the one who lifted up the samples on the Shroud with sticky tapes! In fact, when you read the last part of the quote taken from the STURP paper he wrote with Schwalbe and that say: “suggesting that the topmost fibers in the image area were somehow weakened”, you really have a sense that he agreed with this observation probably made by Adler and Heller that the image fibers are more fragile than the non image fibers, which seems to back up the conclusion of the STURP team (including Rogers at the time) that the image on the Shroud was the product of an oxidation dehydration of the internal structure of the linen fibers. Because of this, we must believe that when he build his hypothesis for the Shroud’s image near the end of his life, Rogers wasn’t thinking that this particular observation was in contradiction with the idea that the body image color could really be located only in a thin layer of impurities while leaving the linen fiber intact. I know that, at first sight, this sounds strange because the observation probably reported by Adler and Heller really seem to suggest that it is the linen fibers themselves that have been weakened by the image formation process… But as I say, I just can’t imagine that Rogers would have forgotten or neglected (consciously or not) to taken such an important observation into account while he was building his personal hypothesis. That’s something I just can’t believe! So, if he concluded that a chromophore located only in a thin layer of impurities was the best hypothesis that can explain all the pertinent observations and facts coming from the Shroud, we must think that such an hypothesis can also explain that particular observation that was probably reported by Adler and Heller. I’m sure you understand my reflection! The only problem is the fact that Rogers, to my knowledge, never talked directly about this particular issue in his later writings about the Shroud. Effectively, in all his later writings, Rogers, with his personal hypothesis concerning the impurities, gave a possible explanation for the corroded aspect of the surface of the image fibers and also for the fact that it was much easier to pull out the sticky tapes from the surface of the image areas, but as I know, he never wrote something to explain the fact that the image fibers seemed to be more fragile and easy to broke, in the light of his hypothesis concerning the impurities. Did that mean that, in some chemical way, a dehydrated layer of impurities located on top of the linen fibers could render the underneath fibers more fragile and easy to break??? In my mind, that’s the only rational conclusion we can make if Rogers’ hypothesis is correct… For example, would it be possible that a dehydrated layer of impurities could affect the stability of the “growth nodes” of the fiber so much that the fibers would become more fragile and easy to break, while leaving the crystal structure of the fibers intact? Note: the crucial fact that the crystal structure of the image fibers is no more defective or damaged than the non image fibers is an observation reported many times by Rogers in his writings, making it hard to believe that the structure of the fiber (whether it be only the primary cell wall or the most deeper part of the fiber) could really have been colored during the image formation process. Here the most important quotes of Rogers about that: “Direct comparison between image and non image parts of the Shroud shows exactly the same amounts and types of radiation damage in the two types of areas.” “…the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non image fibers.” “There is absolutely no evidence for destruction (damage in the fiber’s structure) in any of the image fibers: other than possessing a colored coating, they are identical to non image fibers.” “If (John) Jackson were correct, and energetic photons caused the image color, the image areas should show significantly different amounts of diffuse radiation damage than the non image areas. They do not.” Honestly, if these comments of Rogers are correct and if Rogers’ hypothesis is also correct concerning the impurities, then I don’t think there are many other valid options to explain the STURP observation concerning the more fragile aspect of the image fibers than thinking that the growth nodes of the fibers (and only that) were chemically affected (probably degraded) in some way, maybe directly by the image formation process or maybe a long time after that process was active, by the presence of a dehydrated layer of impurities next to them. And I even have a feeling that such an hypothesis could explain pretty well this other observation of Rogers: “The color of image fibers was often stripped off of their surfaces, leaving molds of the fibers in the adhesive. THE MOLDS SHOW BOTH GROWTH NODES AND IMAGE COLOR.” One thing’s for sure: Rogers certainly had a proper scientific explanation concerning that more fragile aspects of the image fibers that would fit with his hypothesis about the impurities, or else, he would never changed his mind so drastically concerning the chromophore of the image!!! So, personally, I still think his hypothesis about the impurities is the best we have to explain the Shroud’s image because, in my mind, it’s the only one that offer a rational explanation for some very particular observations coming from the Shroud like the reduction of the color with diimide leaving a clean fiber behind, the ghosts who also left a clean fiber behind, the absence of a noticeable difference in the crystal structure of image and non image fibers and the very superficial nature of the body image… Effectively, Rogers made it clear in his writings that all these observations are inconsistent with the idea of a chromophore located in the linen fiber itself. But in the light of all the observations I reported in this long comment, I also think that, along with the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the impurities, the growth nodes can also have been chemically degraded by the image formation process or by a long time of exposure to a dehydrated layer of impurities that was in direct contact with them. I truly think that this hypothesis should be investigated more deeply… And if my feeling is right about these growth nodes, then the question that comes to my mind is: Did these growth nodes of the image fibers are also colored like the layer of impurities or did they have been affected more mildly without having produced any color?.","date":"2013-01-02","mins":"2:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”"},{"id":"comment-21547","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Dave, you should read my new paper and especially the quote #129 in which Rogers summarize the very good results he got from a preliminary coloration test made with a linen sample manufactured with the ancient method and a 10 minutes exposition to ammonia gas.

In the personal comments of these 2 quotes, I talk about a recent paper entitled “Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image” that has been published by 2 Italian scientists who firmly concluded that, theoretically, all the hypotheses based on energetic radiation (De Liso’s hypothesis include) cannot produce the discontinuous distribution of the color on the topmost parts of the weave like we see on the Shroud. On the contrary, the 2 authors were clear about the fact that, in theory, the 2 most likely processes that could give such a discontinuous distribution is thermal radiation or low temperature chemical processes and they mentioned specifically the hypothesis of Rogers as a possible answer to the Shroud’s image… Now, if that’s not independent confirmation that, at least, Rogers was close to the truth regarding the Shroud, I don’t know what it is. Of course, this conclusion of the Italian researchers is only theoretical for the moment. But nevertheless, that’s a very good and independent point in favor of Rogers’ hypothesis, which should be evaluated by a good biochemist who could push it further. Here’s the complete reference for that Italian paper (you found the same reference at the end of my paper): G. Fazio and G. Mandaglio, Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image, Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids, Vol. 166, No. 7, July 2011 (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10420150.2011.566877).

I truly think that this hypothesis should be investigated more deeply… And if my feeling is right about these growth nodes, then the question that comes to my mind is: Did these growth nodes of the image fibers are also colored like the layer of impurities or did they have been affected more mildly without having produced any color?” I think we can find a beginning of answer in a few important quotes of Rogers that you can find in my recent paper in which he talks about the reduction of the image color with diimide and the resulting aspect of the linen fiber: “Heller and Adler found that the image fibers could be decolorized with diimide. Reduction left colorless, undamaged cellulose fibers behind. All image color resides on the outer surface of the fibers.” “The image can be chemically reduced with diimide leaving colorless cellulose fibers. The color resides only on the surface of the fibers, and it is the result of conjugated double bounds. The underlying cellulose (linen) fibers are not colored.” “The image color can be reduce chemically (diimide and sodium borohydride), leaving colorless, lustrous linen fibers.” “The layer of color can be specifically reduced with diimide, leaving a colorless flax fiber behind. Diimide reduction confirmed the presence of double bounds.” “Adler’s observation (concerning the decolorization of the image with diimide) proved that the cellulose was not involved in image formation. This is an extremely important observation.” These few quotes of Rogers are well enough to understand that the reduction of color left an linen fiber completely intact behind. It’s important to note that all these quotes of Rogers never suggest that the growth nodes (dislocation bands) were damaged after the color reduction with diimide. So, taking this EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OBSERVATION (Rogers words) into account, I think that even if it’s possible that the growth nodes have been CHEMICALLY DEGRADED enough to render the image fibers more fragile and easy to break, we must assume that those growth nodes of the image fibers WERE NOT AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY (OR IN THE SAME PROPORTION) THAN THE THIN LAYER OF CARBOHYDRATES IMPURITIES ON TOP OF THE IMAGE FIBERS, WHICH IS MOST PROBABLY THE REAL CHROMOPHORE OF THE IMAGE. This reflection makes me believe that, unlike the thin layer of impurities, these growth nodes were PROBABLY NOT colored by the image formation process, which seems to suggest that the possible chemical degradation that could have affect them enough to render the image fibers more fragile only came later on, well after the image formation process has stoped and was probably a bit different than the dehydration process described by Rogers for the impurities. In other words, I still think that a chemical degradation of the growth nodes could explain why the image fibers seems to be more fragile and easy to break, but now, after taking into account Rogers comments about the diimide reduction of the color, I am much more skeptical concerning the possibility that these growth nodes could have been also colored during the image formation process. I think that IF they really were chemically degraded, it is more probable that such a chemical degradation was slowly caused by a long period of direct contact with the colored layer of impurities that has been probably dehydrated during the image formation process. So, if the growth nodes are really the cause of the more fragile aspect of the image fibers, I think it’s fair to assume that their chemical degradation was DIFFERENT (AND PROBABLY LESS RADICAL) than the very probable dehydration of the impurities present on top of the colored fibers. Otherwise, the use of diimide would surely have cause some noticeable damages in these growth nodes, which is something that doesn’t seem to have happened. To my knowledge, there is no report about that in the writings of Adler or Rogers. In fact, when you read their reports about that, you really have a sense that all the diimide have done is to remove the color that was resting on top of the fibers and that’s all! Finally, I think it’s also fair to assume that such a chemical change in the growth nodes probably happened very slowly and gradually, which eventually caused a more fragile nature for the image fibers after a pretty long period of time (i.e. A long time of exposure to the dehydrated layer of impurities present on top of them). And if that’s what really happened, we must also conclude that the rest of the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) was much more stable than these growth nodes because it’s only this tiny part of the linen fibers (the growth nodes) that would have been chemically degraded in some way by the dehydrated layer of impurities present on top of them (which would be the real and only chromophore of the image). Here’s we must trust Rogers judgment who said that the linen fibers were left “colorless, lustrous and undamaged” after the use of diimide and who also said many times in his writings that “the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non image fibers”. Finally, we must also take into account this other very important comment of Rogers concerning the ghosts, which really seem to confirm the fact that the growth nodes are really more unstable (i.e. More susceptible to chemical degradation) than the rest of the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall): “The color of image fibers was often stripped off of their surfaces, leaving molds of the fibers in the adhesive. The molds show BOTH GROWTH NODES AND IMAGE COLOR.” To summarize my thoughts, I would say that the probable more unstable nature of the growth nodes versus the rest of the linen fiber, which was probably caused by the presence of a dehydrated layer of impurities next to them, is probably responsible for the fact that the image fibers really seem to be more fragile and easy to break… Since I’m not a chemist, you can see that I have often used the words “probable” and “probably” in this conclusion! There’s no doubt in my mind that if Rogers could have talked specifically about this issue in his writings, I would not have been forced to use these words and my conclusion would have rest on a much more solid ground! Anyway, that’s where I now stand in my reflection about the chromophore of the image, mainly because of the diimide and the ghosts observations. And this leads me to two important questions: 1 Is it possible that a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities located on top of a linen fiber and that have been chemically dehydrated could gradually affect the integrity of the growth nodes of this fiber so much that some of these nodes would have been left in the sticky tapes used by Rogers, along with the colored impurities of the body image? 2 Is it possible that a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities located on top of a linen fiber and that have been chemically dehydrated could gradually affect the integrity of the growth nodes of this fiber so much that they became weak enough to render this linen fiber more fragile and easy to break? These are good questions that I think only an expert in chemistry could answer properly… Nevertheless, I have a feeling that the answer could be yes to both questions. The key word in these 2 questions is “gradually”, because I have a feeling that a long period of direct contact between the growth nodes and the colored impurities could really be the ultimate cause of the probable weakness of the growth nodes..","date":"2013-01-03","mins":"3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/01/important-aspect-of-flax-fiber-microstructure-and-rogers-ghosts/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Important aspect of flax fiber microstructure and Rogers’ “ghosts”"},{"id":"comment-21435","author":"yannick_clément","post":"May I suggest anyone’s interested in the subject to read carefully my newest paper about all the relevant quotes from Rogers concerning the image on the Shroud?

THAT’S THE REALITY and THIS IS NOT HOW SCIENCE SHOULD WORK. The way they proceed was like doing science in reverse… Rogers proceeded exactly in the contrary of that. First, he collected all the solid facts and observations (especially the diimide and the ghosts, along with the fact that the image only resides on the external surface of the cloth), and then, he build a testable hypothesis and only then, he made some preliminary tests and got a coloration very similar chemically and physically as the coloration he observed himself on the Shroud through a microscope. Note that Rogers was a true microscopist and chemist who observed the Shroud in person in Turin, totally unlike Di Lazzaro, Fanti et al. And concerning the interpretation these authors made about the observation of Rogers that it was easier to remove the tapes in image areas (“suggesting that the topmost fibers in the image area were somehow weakened”), I never found anything of that nature in Rogers papers… On the contrary, here’s what I found: “…the surfaces (of the image fibers) appeared to be “CORRODED”. That observation suggests that a VERY THIN COATING OF CARBOHYDRATE had been significantly dehydrated on the OUTER SURFACES of the fibers.” If you want to put your trust on people who have personal hypotheses to defend (which always represent a great danger of bias), it’s your liberty. Of course, people will tell me that Rogers too had a personal hypothesis to defend, but as I said, in the case of Rogers, and unlike Fanti et al, he followed properly the scientific method by developing a testable hypothesis that include the possibility that the chromophore could really be only located in a layer of impurities and ONLY THEN, he made some preliminary tests to verify if his hypothesis had some chances to be good. His first results were good enough for him, so he continue to defend his hypothesis until his death.

I am saying that the image formation process acted similar to a laser.” Comment : 2 Italian scientists named Fazio and Mandaglio wrote recently 3 very interesting papers about the image on the Shroud and they came to a completely different conclusion, saying that the stochastic (uneven) distribution of the colored fibers in the image area was absolutely not compatible with the effect of a laser, which would have caused an much more homogeneous distribution of colored fibers at the surface of the cloth. For these 2 researchers, the stochastic distribution of the Shroud image is much more compatible with a very mild and natural process involving a low temperature chemical process like Maillard reactions and/or thermal radiation released after death by the tortured and crucified corpse of the Shroud man. And concerning the important question asked by John, I think Mario Latendresse is one of the best person to answer that because he addressed that issue in his 2005 paper about the Shroud presented at the Dallas conference. I think he favored the hypothesis that the process was not necessarily acting in a totally vertical way but more at the shortest distance between the corpse and the cloth, which could be at a different angle than 90 degree). But, being no expert, I will let him address that issue more precisely… One thing’s for sure : I don’t think that, in the present state of our knowledge, someone can be completely sure about that..","date":"2013-04-21","mins":"6:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/john-klotz-new-quantum-christ-blog/","cat":"image_theory","title":"John Klotz’ new Quantum Christ Blog"},{"id":"comment-16480","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I’m convinced that if we could take the fresh corpse of a crucified man who had been tortured for several hours prior to is death and put it inside a burial linen cloth made the ancient way like the Shroud and wait for 36 hours at room temperature, we would get a coloration on the surface of the cloth. Maybe it would take some baking to simulate the aging of the cloth, but in the end, I’m convinced we would get some coloration. I don’t say that the result would be as “perfect” as the Shroud, but I’m sure there would be some color on the surface of the cloth that would be close in color to what we see on the Shroud, because as Rogers said it very cleverly : If amines come in contact with a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on the surface of a cloth, there will be a chemical reaction that will produce a color. Like Rogers said : this is not a hypothesis, this is a fact. So, in order to think that 0% of the image on the Shroud has been produced by a Maillard reaction coming from some amine gases released by the corpse, you have to assume that there are no (or not enough) carbohydrates impurities at the surface of the cloth (even though pectines and starch have already been detected) and/or there was no (or not enough) amines gases released by the beaten and crucified body over a period of approximately 36 hours. Personally, I have a very hard time to believe that this assumption can be correct. I truly think that at least a portion of the image could well have been produced by the Maillard reaction that Rogers proposed with maybe one possible exception : maybe the alternative hypothesis proposed by Thibault in 2007 concerning the urea left by the drying sweat has more chances to be correct in the context of a Roman crucifixion than what was originally proposed by Rogers and could account better for the production of enough gases inside the Shroud during the first 36 hours after death. Definately, more researches need to be done… Maybe the one proposed by M. Rolfe’s website could be a good start but it truly need to be done by a professional chemist (a biochemist would be great).

No. The real question is the question of what is the chromophore of the image. I have already written about that often on this blog and I truly think that’s the main aspect science must determine BEFORE proposing any image formation process. That’s exactly what was the method used by Rogers : First, he took EVERY solid data, observations and facts regarding the Shroud and came up with a good hypothesis regarding the chromophore of the image. And it’s only after he was convinced that a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities was the real chromophore of the image that he start looking for a natural mechanism that could account for it. Since the day he proposed his hypothesis, some members of the SSG (Fanti, Di Lazzaro et al.) have proposed another hypothesis for the chromophore of the image (the primary cell wall of the linen fiber) and right now, because new direct testing could be performed on the cloth itself, this question of the chromophore cannot be settled definitively. It’s only once science will be sure of the chromophore that we will have a better idea of at least the probable nature (chemical, energetic, etc.) of the body image and that we will be able to better judge any hypothesis of image formation that have been proposed over the years. As I said many times here, if Rogers hypothesis is correct regarding the chromophore, any image formation hypothesis that involved any kind of energetic radiation would have to be considered highly unlikely while it would be a very strong argument in favor of a natural occurring image. But we’re not there yet, even though the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the chromophore SHOULD be considered in the moment as the most probable that exists because of many particular data like the pectine and the starch deposits that were find on the fibers, the presence of a banding effects on the Shroud indicating a possible uneven presence of impurities on each threads (with some threads that might even have almost no impurities on them), the ghosts of color (and also the diimide reagent) leaving a clean and undamaged fiber behind, etc. Also, and this is VERY IMPORTANT, there’s one more aspect that strongly favored Rogers hypothesis over the primary cell wall hypothesis of Fanti et al.: it is the fact that the image is very superficial and that this superficiality is the same no matter if the body was in direct contact with the cloth or if it was at a short distance of it (less than 4 cm). Effectively, Rogers hypothesis concerning the thin layer of impurities offered a very good rational and scientific explanation for this very strange particularity of the image while the hypothesis of Fanti CANNOT. Note that it is also true concerning the possible superficial image of the hair on the reverse side of the cloth. This is, for me, the most important argument in favor of Rogers hypothesis over the other ones that proposed a coloration of the linen fiber itself and I think this has been truly neglected in the recent past (the best example of this truth is the first draft of the fact list of Rolfe that was signed by almost everyone present at the conference of Valencia). Sorry but linen fibers (and the primary cell wall too) are scattered everywhere inside the cloth (not restricted to the surface) while the impurities that Rogers propose are only concentrated in a thin layer on the top surface of the cloth (on both sides), which is totally consistent with the superficiality of the image on the Shroud and totally consistent too with the fact that the image possess the same exact superficiality no matter if the body was in direct contact with the cloth or if it was located at a short distance of it. The primary cell wall hypothesis CANNOT offered a rational and scientific explanation for this particularity of the Shroud image and so, no matter what kind of image formation process could have been active to produce the image… That’s the situation right now and anybody who think that the Shroud image is the product of a supernatural kind of event should pray hard that science will never prove that Rogers was right about the chromophore !!! ; ) And I even strongly suspect that this was the real motivation of Fanti when he wrote his paper that proposed another hypothesis (the PCW) than the one of Rogers for the chromophore of the image… Effectively, it’s evident for me that he is fully aware of the fact that his corona discharge hypothesis would have to be set aside if Rogers hypothesis concerning the impurities is right. So, to conclude, I would say that the sindonologists interested by the question of the image on the Shroud SHOULD really focus their attention on the question of the chromophore before even thinking of a possible explanation for this image..","date":"2012-09-19","mins":"8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/18/latest-on-david-rolfes-site-on-maillard-reaction/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Latest on David Rolfe’s Site on Maillard Reaction"},{"id":"comment-16576","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I would add one more little comment to complete my previous long comment. I just want to say that beside focussing on the question of the chromophore of the image in order to have a better idea of the nature of the process that has been active inside the Shroud to formed the image, I also think Shroud scientist should try hard to confirmed the conclusion of Fanti concerning the possible presence of another superficial image of the hair (and maybe some other body parts like the beard and mustache) in the reverse side of the cloth because if it would be scientifically confirmed, this would also be another very important piece of evidence in favor of a chemical process for image formation (that could very well include totally or partially the Maillard reaction proposed by Rogers) and, at the same time, it would be another very important argument AGAINST any form of image formation hypothesis involving an energetic radiation. Effectively, here’s what Rogers specifically said about that in his book: “Heat and radiation of sufficient intensity all the way through the thickness of the cloth WOULD NOT BE LIMITED to producing a color on the back of the cloth in the area of the hair.” He also wrote: “We would expect to see a color in the center of the cloth. We do not.” So I am completely convinced that this is one very important aspect of the Shroud (the possible presence of a superficial image on the backside of the cloth) that should be analyzed more deeply by Shroud scientist well before they proposed any other hypothesis for image formation. Getting access to the very high quality photographs of the reverse side of the Shroud that were done in 2000 and 2002 would be a very good step for this kind of research but I’m convinced that only a direct chemical and microscopic examination of a sample taken from this area will be enough to really settle this debate concerning the possible presence of a superficial image on the backside of the Shroud. So, along with the question of the chromophore of the image, I think scientist MUST focus their attention on this question of the possible superficial image on the backside. Getting finally a definitive and scientific answer to these 2 questions would greatly improve our understanding of the real nature of the image formation process and would help to eliminate many image formation hypothesis, because, as Rogers wrote in his book: “…the appearance of some specific parts of the image on the back of the cloth can contribute critical information toward the understanding of the image formation mechanism.”.","date":"2012-09-20","mins":"9:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/18/latest-on-david-rolfes-site-on-maillard-reaction/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Latest on David Rolfe’s Site on Maillard Reaction"},{"id":"comment-16530","author":"yannick_clément","post":"In his book written in 2000, Baima Bollone mentioned a few examples of body image (I think they were all partial and one of them was a cloth from a mystic in the Middle East as I recall) on linen burial cloths but I’m not sure if there is still one example of these reported cloths that can be seen and examined today.

But, I think there’s a good possibility that this is really the case. The image you see have been made by De Salvo using the same technical device (the VP 8) that was used on photos of the Shroud. The volckringer pattens really seem to have some of the most bizarre characteristics of the Shroud images, i.e. The darks and lights seemed to be reverse. In that sense, the direct contact points between the leaves and the paper appeared darker in the image, and the part that are farther are the lighter in the image, just like the Shroud. If you note how a leave look like, you’ll note that it isn’t uncommon that the veins can be closer to the paper than other parts. In that sense, it would be normal that the image of those veins appeared somewhat darker and, at the same time, appeared also higher on a VP 8 image. In the example proposed by De Salvo, that seems to be the case. If this is real, then the images of plants and leaves have really a distance information incode in them. But, as I said, more researches are needed to check out if this is really the case. In fact, the best thing would be that some scientists do the same kind of research that was done by Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline of STURP to analyze what kind of distance information is really there. Without a proper study like that, we can talk and presume things but it will not prove anything.

Also, one VERY IMPORTANT factor to never forget concerning the Shroud and this could well have had a huge impact in the formation of a body image on the cloth : This was a highly tortured and crucified corpse that was placed in that cloth and not any normal corpse that would have die of a natural cause. No doubt that the biological state of this particular corpse was VERY DIFFERENT than any body that would have died of a natural cause. The very probable presence of a high level of bilirubin in the blood of the Shroud man at the time of his death is only one major biological difference that we know of, but there were most certainly many other important biological differences in the composition of the blood, sweat and other body tissues that could have played potentially a major role in the formation of the body image on the Shroud and, of course, these biological factors were not reproduced in the experiment that was done with the pig… No doubt that, along with the unkown environmental conditions at the place of execution and inside the tomb and also the still not fully determined chemical aspect of the linen cloth itself, the exact biological state of the Shroud man’s corpse when it was placed inside the Shroud is a very important unknown reality that render things very difficult for anybody who wants to reproduce the body image we see on the Shroud on another linen Shroud..","date":"2013-05-18","mins":"6:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/17/more-support-for-treasures-decoded-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"More support for Treasures Decoded: The Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-34071","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Ok… but the most important thing concerning these cases reported in the Gospels is not the medical terminology but the great sign of the unconditional love of God for every one of his beloved children that we all are, especially the most vulnerable.

In fact, de Charny was one of the leading knight of all the kingdom of France when he build the Lirey church. And 2 The program tell us that de Charny claimed he get the Shroud during a crusade he made, which is also totally false. In fact, de Charny NEVER SAID A WORD about how and when he became in possession of the Shroud. It’s also very important to understand that de Charny never participate in the 4th crusade, which saw the Latin crusaders making the sack of Constantinople. This terrible event, which most probably lead to the transfer of the Shroud from that city to Europe, happened a century before de Charny’s time. The only crusade in which Geoffroy de Charny participated is the Smyrna crusade in 1346 and it’s highly improbable that he could have come in possession of the Shroud at that occasion, no matter what Ian Wilson and other “historians” can think. 2 Once again (history always seem to repeats itself), Garlaschelli and Allen didn’t said a damn word about their incapacity to reproduce the forensically accurate bloodstains and scourge marks we see on the Shroud. I think these guys should read carefully the paper I wrote concerning the evidence of the bloodstains (link : http://shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf). How in the world can they pretend having succeed to reproduced the Shroud, while at the same time, they completely failed to reproduced the bloodstains we see on the cloth with any kind of credibility whatsoever? Here’s a good question for them: How in the world someone in medieval time could have artificially produced the forensically accurate bloodstains and scourge marks we see everywhere on the Shroud, while it is a well known fact that the exact Roman method of crucifixion was at the very least partially unknown at the time (the nails driven in the wrist instead of in the palms is just one example of this)? Obviously, in order to produce the bloodstains and scourge marks we see on the Shroud, a forger would have needed to scourge and crucified a real man with the exact Roman method of crucifixion. Not only did such a gruesome idea is ridiculous when you think that our medieval forger did not needed to go that far to produce a false Christian relic (some drops of animal blood in liquid form could have easily do the job), but it is also completely ridiculous to imagine that our forger would have wait until the bloodstains were completely or partially dried before placing his corpse inside the Shroud, while he would have been anxious to leave some clear bloodstains on the cloth in order to reproduce the stigmata of Christ. In sum, the simple fact that Garlaschelli and Allen were, once again, not able to reproduce the bloodstains and scourge marks we see on the Shroud is well enough to understand that their work is NOT a replica of the Shroud. 3 For those of you who pretend that Barrie’s experiment with the pig can be seen as some kind of proof that the Maillard reaction hypothesis is false or cannot, alone, pretend to explain the body image on the Shroud because he wasn’t able to get a clear image on his linen cloth, I have this important comment to make : Barrie did not baked his linen sample in the same way Garlaschelli did with his artistic image in order to reproduce ageing, which is why no image whatsoever could be seen on his linen cloth. If you read again the part of Rogers book in which he present the very good coloration result he obtained in a lab experiment he did with an old fashion linen sample that was exposed for a time to ammoniac gases (this is, for me, the closest matching result ever obtained by anybody concerning the coloration of linen fibers like we see on the Shroud), you will note that he specifically said that it was only after he baked his linen sample to simulate ageing that a clear coloration could be seen at the surface of the cloth to the naked eye. I’m certain that if Barrie would have baked his linen sample, a visible image would have appeared on the cloth. I don’t pretend the image of the pig would have been as good as the body image on the Shroud (in fact, I’m sure it would not because of the conditions in which Barrie did his experiment), but I’m certain we would have seen a faint yellow coloration at the surface of the cloth that would have shown a pretty good chemical and physical match with many aspects of the body image we see on the Shroud. In sum, the fact that no image was clearly visible on the cloth right after Barrie’s experiment can be seen as another good confirmation of an hypothesis first described by Paul Vignon if I remember well (and backed up by Rogers later on), which state that the image on the Shroud is most probably a latent image that only developed at the surface of the cloth after some time. Note that this probable fact can easily explain why there is absolutely no mention in the Gospels of a body image on the Shroud of Christ after the Resurrection. The probable fact that there was no visible image right after the event (pretty much like there was no clear image on Barrie’s linen sample), along with the probable fact that this gruesome and bloody burial cloth was hidden well soon after it was discovered and kept by the disciples on Easter morning is the most rational explanation for why there is no mention in the Gospels of a body image on the Shroud of Christ. In such a context of hiding, it’s very probable that the latent image only started to become visible to the naked eye many years after the Resurrection event, at a time when the cloth was most probably kept hidden in the dark, which probably mean that no one (not even those who were keeping it hidden) was able to noticed it on the cloth. This pretty funny situation could well have last for many years, decades and even centuries after the Resurrection… All this reflection of mine is true of course only if the Shroud is truly the authentic shroud of Jesus Christ. In the end, when it comes to the body image we see on the Shroud, it’s very probable that the disciples of Jesus were not able to distinguish any clear image on the cloth on Easter morning, no more than Barrie was able to distinguish any clear image on the linen cloth he used for his experiment. Time is a very important factor in the production of a Maillard image coming from the close proximity of a linen cloth made the ancient way and a fresh corpse and, in the case of Barrie’s experiment and also in the case of the disciples of Jesus on Easter morning, there was not enough time that had been spent for a clear image to get formed on their cloths. In my mind, Barrie’s result can truly been see as another clue that tend to back up the hypothesis of a latent image that come from a natural image formation, which imply, at least for a part that remain to be know, a Maillard reaction at the surface of the cloth… The main problem that remains to be solved is, of course, the question regarding the very high resolution of the image. That’s why more researches that involve a Maillard reaction (like the one done by Barrie) are truly needed to get closer to the truth regarding the Shroud image. And it’s important to understand that such researches will need to be done in the future with some baking of the linen samples to simulate ageing and to clearly see an image at the surface of the linen cloth. 4 Obviously, Barrie’s experiment with a pig and a tiny linen sample left in open air is very far from having reproduced the most probable environmental conditions that were present inside the tomb when the image formation process was active. For this reason, any image result that can come out of this kind of experiment cannot be consider as a proof of anything. In my mind, the only good result obtained by Barrie that can be consider seriously versus the Shroud image (and it’s a huge one) is the fact that he was able to prove that if we take a linen cloth made with an ancient method that leave a carbohydrate layer at the surface of it and we place it over fresh corpse for more than 24 hours, a Maillard reaction will start, which will lead to the coloration of some fibers that look pretty much like we see on the Shroud. This is great because that tend to confirm Rogers’ claim that “when amines and reducing sugars come together, they will react. They will produce a color. This is not a hypothesis: this is a fact. A cloth with crude starch on it (note that Rogers could also have said : “a cloth with a carbohydrate layer on it” and that would also have been correct) will ultimately produce a color, if it is left in close proximity to a decomposing body.” Barrie’s experiment show that Rogers was right about that, which lead me to this conclusion : It’s very hard for me to believe that the body image we see on the Shroud had nothing to do with a Maillard reaction that came from the close proximity of an ancient linen cloth with a fresh and tortured human corpse. Important note: I don’t pretend that a Maillard reaction, in the way described by Rogers, is the only thing that lead to the apparition of the body image on the cloth, but I’m almost certain that it took some part in it (probably a huge part). 5 I don’t think the linen sample used by Barrie for his experiment was treated with some starch in the way described by Rogers in his book. It’s important to note that, for Rogers, the impurity layer of carbohydrates that caused a Maillard reaction at the surface of the Shroud was mostly composed of starch, along with other residues (like some residues of saponaria and probably also some polysaccharides residues that were extracted from the primary cell wall during the retting of the flax plant). It would be a very good idea for a researcher to do another experiment like the one done by Barrie but, this time, with a pre treatment of the linen cloth with starch. If we believe Rogers, such an experiment would give an even better result than the one obtained by Barrie… And, this time, I hope the researcher who would do this kind of experiment would think of baking his sample after the time of exposure. There’s no doubt in my mind that he would get an image on his cloth. The question is: Could such a natural image show a high resolution? In fact, the real question is this: Under which environmental, biological and linen cloth conditions a Maillard image could present a high resolution like the one on the Shroud? Since we’re almost sure now that a Maillard image would eventually developed at the surface of a linen cloth made with the ancient method if this cloth is placed over a fresh corpse, THAT’S THE REAL QUESTION THAT REMAIN TO BE ANSWERED. 5 Garlaschelli said something like this in the program: “Those who doesn’t accept the validity of the C14 dating result will not accept also my theory of image formation.” I would like to remind Mr. Garlaschelli that even if the C14 dating result of 1988 is wrong and the Shroud is much older than this, that doesn’t necessarily mean it cannot be a forgery done during the first few centuries of Christendom (let say before 500 A.D. And the first apparition of the Pantocrator icon) with the use of a real scourged and crucified corpse. It will forever be impossible for science to clearly and definitely state who the Shroud man really is. Because of this fact, there will forever be an openness (even though this openness doesn’t appear to be very probable) for a natural forgery scenario that would have been done with the use of a real crucified body. Also, there will forever be an openness (very tin nevertheless) for a scenario involving the burial shroud of a real crucified man other than Jesus of Nazareth that was accidentally looking like the Jesus of the Gospel. 6 I hope everybody who will watch this program will understand that if the Maillard reaction hypothesis for image formation proposed by Ray Rogers and partially tested by Barrie Schwortz is correct, THAT DOESN’T MEAN THE SHROUD IS SOMEONE ELSE THAN JESUS AND/OR THAT HIS RESURRECTION NEVER HAPPEN. All right. That’s all for the moment… Yannick.","date":"2013-05-19","mins":"5:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/17/more-support-for-treasures-decoded-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"More support for Treasures Decoded: The Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-34072","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Lazarus was most probably pretty much of the same age than Jesus… In the Jewish context of Jesus time, to die Young like that was almost considered as a curse of God.

Di Lazarro to read (or read again) the book of Ray Rogers please ??? Rogers show in an experiment he did with linen prepared the old fashion way, i.e., with an impurity layer, that 10 minutes of exposition to ammoniac gas can color the fibers in a way which is like the Shroud, i.e. The coloration is present only on the external surface of the fiber and not inside the fiber and did not penetrate into the cloth (the color stayed on the external surface of his sample only). So, you see ? UV lights are not the only way to achieve a coloration that look like the Shroud… And, by the way, Rogers result were not exposed in the media. I think it was not extraordinary enough for them ! I may be a blogger but I have a brain and I can use it. And, by the way, I’ve read his paper ! All Di Lazarro showed with his experiments, is that some UV lights can color the external surface of a MODERN linen fiber, i.e. The primary cell wall, which is not what Rogers reports for the Shroud fibers. For Rogers, the Shroud coloration rest only on a thin layer of impurity and some parts of that layer where stuck in the sticky tapes he used to take samples from the Shroud. In other words, those parts of the coloration were taken out of the colored fibers. Question for M. Di Lazarro : Did you try to put a sticky tape on one of your linen sample and look to see if you can find ghosts of coloration stuck in the tape ? If you can’t, sorry but your result is NOT like the Shroud coloration. I really wonder if he tried this little verification… That can really help to see if the results he had with UV light can really be compared to the Shroud coloration. And, by the way, that your result could be close to the Shroud coloration or not, that prove absolutely nothing about the fact that, as you say, “The probability the Shroud is a medieval fake is really low.” In other words, it’s not because you can produce a coloration close to the Shroud with UV lights that it proves the Shroud coloration was achieve that way and, as a consequence, no medieval forger could have done it ! I’m not as dumb as this ! With Rogers coloration result, some sceptic could even argue the opposite ! Yes… They could argue that some medieval guy took a man, beat him, scourge him and crucified him like Christ and put it in a Shroud. In this manner, if the Shroud was prepared the ancient way and the dead body emits some ammoniac gas (which is probable), then there’s a possibility there for the production of a false relic. I know it doesn’t stand high in the probability scale (and I don’t believe that’s what happen) but nobody (and surely not your results) can disprove that scenario completely !!! Sorry… All you prove (and that would have to be confirmed by an independent scientist) is that UV lights can color a modern linen sample on the external surface only and the coloration don’t penetrate into the cloth.

A particular degree of humidity for example. The amount and location of carbohydrate impurities on the surface of the cloth could also (as it seem to me) have make a good difference between a high resolution image and a not so good resolution… And for the biological conditions, you mentioned the most important for diffusion, i.e. What was the temperature of the body when he was placed Inside the Shroud and how fast did he cooled down? Again, I ask you the same question: What is EDTA? By the way, imagine there would have been a small coach of urea on the skin and hair of the Shroud man after the drying of his intense sweat and before his body was placed Inside the Shroud, which is truly a possibility regarding the context of a crucified body. Don’t you think this kind of biological deposit could have played a huge role in the image formation process? I personally think this is a hypothesis that should have been analyzed more in deep by Rogers during the making of his image formation hypothesis. We know that urea can be transformed into NH3 (ammonia gas), so in my mind, it could have played a role in the formation of the image (even if you think that ammonia cannot in any circumstances produce a good resolution image), along with maybe other biological deposits and/or some molecular diffusion from the corpse (like singlet oxygen molecules; on this subject, see: http://shroud.com/pdfs/n69part3.pdf and http://shroud.com/pdfs/n56part4.pdf).

I hope I put it correctly… In another part of Thibault’s paper, here’s another relevant quote of Rogers about this convection cell issue: “Heavy amines appear much more slowly. I sent the CDH data previously, and Fred sent his alignment chart. Most will start to appear when the body has essentially cooled to ambient. There will be no convection cells to mix and/or transport them. The amount that appears at the surface of the skin will increase on a time scale of days. They are liquids at room temperature, but they vaporize more rapidly than they appear (pools do not form, certainly not in less than 30 hours when tissues start to liquefy). They diffuse much more slowly than ammonia, improving resolution. Putrescine boils at 158 C; cadaverine boils at 178 C. They don’t evaporate as rapidly as water, but they smell a lot worse and are a lot more reactive with saccharides. They are also basic and toxic.

I’m not here to make friends but to express my point of view ! I just want to say this : In science, every conclusion MUST have a scientific confirmation from AN INDEPENDENT researcher or research team. In Shroud science, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to find this kind of independence of mind because almost every scientist who’s interested in the Shroud believe it is the genuine Shroud of Christ and have some preconceptions ideas about the subject. I don’t think we can say that this work of Marion found his scientifically independent confirmation yet ! And sorry, but many of those kind of articles and researches about those kind of images (flowers and coins) are often done to confort the agenda that is to prove the resurrection using the Shroud. Why ? Because it is proven that the Corona discharge can produce an image of coins on linen. So the stretch isn’t to long to associate the image of coins produced by Corona discharge and the resurrection of Christ ! I think there’s a real danger of biais there. I dream of the day when Shroud science will be lead by atheists or agnostics scientists who DON’T CARE ONE BIT about the Shroud being authentic. Understand me, here I’m not talking about the Walter Mc Crone of this world but I’m talking about honest scientist who have no preconception about the Shroud (like the majority of the STURP members were by the way). Now, that would be science we can trust because it would not be agenda driven. And, I think Ray Schneider said it well the other day when he state : “The best of the “enhancements” do present the impression of elements of the Pilate coin, however the elements seem to be out of placement and not in the correct scale, so it may well simply be a case of similarity and not a real image at all. Remember that the folks doing the processing were looking for a particular appearance so there is a selection phenomenon at work which will drive the process to the best apparent fit.” I think the last phrase is very true even when Marion pretend his method avoid every subjective interpretation. I’m not so sure about that because he knew what he was lookin for and I’m pretty convinced that he wanted badly to find it. By the way, this guy Marion worked with Barbara Frele and both believe also that the ghost writtings represent Jesus death certificate !

Mario Latendresse, in his study presented at the Shroud Conference in Dallas in 2005, said that the projection of the image could have been directly vertical, but it the projection could also have follow the closest path between the body and the cloth. If this last hypothesis is right, then I don’t know if this would be more in favor of a gaseous diffusion from the body or from the skin, but it’s interesting nevertheless. Anyway, Rogers was aware of these difficulty concerning the projection of the image, along with his high resolution and, nevertheless, the few preliminary tests he made gave him results that were good enough for him to not look elsewhere to find a better explanation and, on the contrary, to continue his investigation (that was stop when he died of course). I think that’s one very important thing to note and, for me, this is a proof that no one, in the present state of our knowledge, have the right to discard Rogers hypothesis.

As I said before, in Rogers mind, the reactive level of each fibers depend on many factors, not just one. And the banding effect is a good indicator that he was probably right about that. For example, a fiber that would have more impurity on its surface would have a higher coloring potential. Also, a fiber that would receive more amines, no matter the amount of impurities would react more stongly, etc. This is not an easy hypothesis to judge because of the number of factors involved in the image formation process that is proposed… And we also have to remember that Rogers himself agreed that there was probably other process(es) involved, along with the one he proposed, in order to account properly for the final body image. What is interesting to note is this : Recently, I came across an old article written in 1951 which state that Paul Vignon himself had the same exact feeling than Rogers about his own vaporographic hypothesis, i.e. That something else probably had been acting inside the Shroud in order to account for the final image. Taking these point of views into account, the question that come is this one : What the hell can be this other process (or these other processes) involved in the image formation ??? Personally, I think it would be interesting for a chemist to check out the hypothesis proposed by John De Salvo, because I have a feeling that it can well be another complementary process that was active inside the Shroud (involving a chemical reaction coming from a molecular transfer of lactic acid from the skin). You can see that there would be a lot of lab tests that should be done in order to verify all this.

I think that would help to understand better the image formation process… I’m sure there’s some images like that in circulation but I never one really good where all the different colorations on the Shroud would be easy to distinguish from each other. That’s truly a great problem in order to understand better the image formation because many of these different elements have a coloration that is pretty close and it is easy to make interpretation mistakes. One good example of that is the debate I had on this blog with Mario Latendress about the 2 series of 3 stains in the buttocks area ! He was claiming that these where blood stains and I pretend that these are light scorch instead !!! It’s really not easy to be sure about these different coloration. And for the match between the amount of reactive amines and the amount of impurities on the fibers, I’m not so sure about that. In my mind, it is truly possible that there some light coloration that have not been detected on some fibers because these fibers didn’t beared much impurities, while in other areas (where the bands are darker), it’s truly possible to think that the more impurities there are on the fibers, the more we can see an intense coloration. I think there really is a relationship of that nature on the Shroud concerning the body image, but I don’t think it’s a mystery at all. I just think that the more impurities you have, the more dense the coloration will be, that’s it. That’s the way I see the body image coloration. I think we can assume that the density of the image can be due, not only to the number of colored fibers by square cm, but also to the thickness of the impurity layer of each fiber. This idea should be tested with a computerized model to see if a result like the image on the Shroud can be obtain when you put these 2 parameters in the process. And I agree completely with you that many others parameters could have been critical inside the tomb and inside the Shroud in order to produce a body image of the high quality as wee see on the Shroud.

Here’s the last part where I adress these “often heard” critics : And concerning the second assumption made by Thibault, I really don’t think the documentary research he made concerning the production of amines by a dead body has covered all the possibilities that exist, especially when you consider that the dead body inside the Shroud WAS NOT a normal corpse, but was a crucified body that suffered a great deal (and for a long period of time) prior to his death. In this very odd condition, I’m not so sure that someone has the right to completely reject the possibility that heavy amines could have been produced by this very particular corpse in more quantity and in a faster time than a normal dead body… That’s why, personally, I’m not ready yet to reject this possibility, even if I have a tendency to believe that Thibault’s complementary (or parallel) hypotheses can well be close to the truth. In fact, I think it’s truly possible to think that these 2 hypotheses could have acted simultaneously inside the Shroud, i.e. That some reactive gas could have come from inside the body, along with some more gas that could have come from the skin. WHY NOT ? Again, we MUST remember the very particular nature of the corpse that was enveloped in the Shroud !!! That’s a crucial factor in order to evaluate properly the hypothesis proposed by Rogers ! And I think that’s precisely where there was a little “mistake” made by Thibault in his conclusion versus the documentary researches he made on the subject !!! Effectively, I think he has underestimated the particularity of this tortured and crucified corpse versus the known production of amines from a normal corpse… I really think it’s fair to assume that the few scientific studies he found on the subject never intended to characterise the production of amines (especially the amount and the speed of this production) coming from a beaten, scourged, crowned with thorns and crucified dead body that had suffered a very high rising of the bilirubin that was in his blood ! In this context, the fact that he based his conclusion on a “normal” production rate can really be irrelevant versus the reality of the Shroud… That’s really what I think. In that regard, I think we have to consider both hypotheses is “possible” regarding the formation of the Shroud’s image. And to conclude this message, let me share with you a little reflection that can help you understand that, in the present state of our medical knowledge, I don’t think we have the right to conclude that a tortured and crucified body would react in the same exact way than a normal corpse : We know for a fact that rigor mortis would come much faster in the case of a tortured body like the man of the Shroud. This is a fact and we can even see some clear signs of this in the Shroud’s image, i.e. The bending of the knees (one more than the other), the expended chest, the bending of the elbows, the bending of the head forward, etc.). In this particular context, let me leave you with this very good question : If the very particular nature of the corpse that was enveloped in the Shroud was responsible for the fast coming of a state of rigor mortis (that can have been also stronger, as much as faster), than who can really be certain if the production of amine gases from the body could not also have been accelerated (regarding not only the rapidity and the quantity of the gases released but also for the places of the body where those gases were released) ??? WHO CAN REALLY BE CERTAIN ABOUT THAT ??? If you do, please show me a published scientific paper that proves that being tortured for a long period of time and to die of crucifixion has really no effect on the production of heavy amine gases coming from the body after death !!! Even if I consider it to be very good, I’ve not found anything concerning this crucial aspect of the question in the paper written by Thibault… I think it’s fair to presume that, concerning this aspect of the question, MORE RESEARCHES ALSO NEED TO BE DONE in order to really know the truth !!! And I also think it’s fair to say that, in the Shroud world, a vast majority of people (whether it be authentic sindonologists or just interested people like we see here on the blog) have really paid attention to the very particular aspect of the body image on the cloth, but at the same time, those people have greatly neglect the simple FACT that the corpse that was most probably at the heart of this body image formation had a very particular nature too ! I think that’s a big mistake to underestimate, neglect or simply forget that important FACT when it comes to reflect upon the body image on the Shroud, because I really believe that one cannot go without the other ! In other words, I personally think that one (the nature of the corpse) can really help to explain the other (the body image on the cloth)… Reflect upon this folks ! That’s it for this long comment. Since no medical and scientific studies has ever been done on a real tortured, scourged and crucified man, no one can say for sure how much amines could be produced by this kind of corpse and how fast these amines could be released by a corpse. And also, like we found in Thibault’s paper, there’s another complementary solution (urea on the skin left there by the drying sweat) that could maybe account better for the body image on the Shroud, while remaining essentially based on the Maillard reaction hypothesis of Rogers… So, because of all this, I don’t think Rogers hypothesis can be declared dead yet, even if I know that’s the biggest dream of all the members of the supernatural fringe….","date":"2012-07-09","mins":"10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/26/paper-chase-thibault-heimburgers-paper-on-the-maillard-reaction-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase: Thibault Heimburger’s Paper on the Maillard Reaction Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-13762","author":"yannick_clément","post":"To be more understandable, I’ll write again my first phrase : I agree that the idea that the image would be only a contact point process really seem irrelevant versus the Shroud.

It’s true that some good portions of the cloth were most probably in direct contact with the corpse and, how surprising, it is these supposed parts (the nose, the hands, part of the hair, the back, the buttocks, etc.) that are the most define in the image ! I think the high resolution of the image is misinterpreted or overestimated because the highest resolution is found in the probable zones of direct contact that don’t need any image projection… When we have to judge the possibility of the hypothesis proposed by Rogers, we have to understand this FACT. I really have a sense that all the parts of the image that was projected to the cloth are less high in resolution than all the parts that were in direct contact with the fabric and, if I’m right, this is a very good indicator that the image formation (at least, a good part of it) was most probably chemical in nature… And for the comment of Thibault, I would say this : Even if laboratory experiments can be tough to do and expensive, I don’t see why this could not be done in the present state of the scientific research ! Look, if Rogers, alone in his home lab, was able to do some interesting preliminary experiments, I really don’t see why someone else could not take his work and push it forward. Really, I don’t see any good reason to do more experiments to verify his hypothesis more deeply. And I even think that some experiments could be done without being too expensive or too complex… I think this hypothesis of Rogers should be tested step by step, with the purpose of testing every aspects of it. This can be a very long process, but I think if someone would have the guts, he could make a nice portion of the road ! And I don’t think this should mean that no computerize models should not be done in parallel. As I say, I think it should be a step by step process with the main goal of not forgetting or neglecting one or more aspects of his hypothesis, which is a very complex one… Finding the right number of gaseous molecules reaching the target at a given location within a certain time in order to produce an image like we see on the Shroud is one aspect of the problem and I agree that this should be analyzed in deep, because that can help to confirm or not if a gaseous diffusion can really have taken some part in the image formation process. But, because we’re not even sure of the chromophore of the image, a scientist who will try to find the correct model should be VERY CAREFUL before he can say for sure that this is the right model for the Shroud’s image ! I think it’s easy to see the complexity of testing Rogers hypothesis adequately. That’s why I prefer by far to see some real lab experiments done on real linen samples of different natures (one prepared the same way than we found in Pliny the Elder, another more recent sample, another one prepared a like we see in Pliny but with another detergent at the end of the process, etc.) and with real amines sources of different natures (ammoniac only, ammoniac mixed with more heavy amines, etc.). I think the first experiments should be focused mainly on the image chromophore proposed by Rogers and see if he was right about that versus the Shroud. If we could be certain that the chromophore is really a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities located on top of the most superficial fibers and ONLY THAT, then making some real lab experiments with amines and other biological products with a coloring potential would be easier to do and the results of these analyses would be also easier to compare with the Shroud’s reality….","date":"2012-06-28","mins":"1:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/26/paper-chase-thibault-heimburgers-paper-on-the-maillard-reaction-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase: Thibault Heimburger’s Paper on the Maillard Reaction Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-131224","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If we believe Rogers, the surface of the colored fibers is much more cracked than non colored fibers, which is, to him, an indication of a dehydration process that probably involved only a thin layer of impurities and I remind you that such a layer has good chances to be UNEVEN and NON HOMOGENUOUS at the surface of the Shroud, which offer a good explanation for why there are some bundles of colored fibers right next to bundles of uncolored fibers, especially when we understand that this particular observation has been more often reported in zones where we can expect that there was a direct contact between the corpse and the cloth. In other words, for me, the best explanation for the observation of bundles of colored fibers right next to bundles of uncolored fibers is the presence of a uneven and non homogeneous layer of carbohydrate impurities that would have been the only thing yellowed by the image formation process, which can well have been stochastic in nature because, in the face of all the pertinent data coming from the Shroud, this process could well have been very mild with only a tiny amount of energy involved and happening at normal temperature.

THEY WILL PRODUCE A COLOR. This is not an hypothesis: this is a fact.” (A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, page 108). Since it is a FACT that there is reducing sugars on the surface of the Shroud (starch found by Mc Crone and confirmed by Rogers and also pectin sugar found by Adler), to denied that the Maillard reaction had nothing to do with the body image on the Shroud, someone has to believe that the dead body that was brutaly tortured for many hours prior to death didn’t emit ANY gas at all during the first 36 40 hours after death (i.e., before the arrival of the first signs of liquid from putrefaction). No ammoniac gas at all, no putrecine gas, no cadaverine gas, no nothing ! I think someone must have a very great faith to believe that ! That’s why I agree with Dan that the Maillard reaction, in the present state of our knowledge of the Shroud, is the hypothesis that got the most solid base, scientifically and logically speaking. I think the probability that the gaseous diffusion proposed by Rogers took at least some part in the image formation process is VERY high. Now, to say that, alone, it can account for the totality of the image, I still have serious doubts, mainly because of the problem with the high resolution of the images. That’s why my reflection on the subject lead me to think that the solution to the mystery must be seek in an hybrid process (acting partially by direct contact and partically by a diffusion). I think the Maillard reaction is responsible for the diffusion part and a bit also of the direct contact part but I think there’s a missing piece of the puzzle that was acting mostly in direct contact and that is responsible for the high resolution of the body images. I have personally some ideas of what could be this missing piece of the puzzle but since I’m no expert, it’s surely not me who will do scientific experiment in a laboratory to check out my ideas ! ; ) There’s one important fact about the body images on the Shroud that is not often publicize : The parts of the image that get the highest resolution are all parts that were most likely in DIRECT CONTACT with the body. I think this fact is too often forgotten. I think the reason is that people tend to focus only on the fact that some parts of the image were formed while those areas of the Shroud were probably away from the body. Since this property of the images is one of the most awesome feature, I think that’s why people tend to focus only on this aspect and forget that most of the images (some say 80%) were probably formed by DIRECT CONTACT. If someone doesn’t agree with me that the image was mainly formed by direct contact, tonight, when you’ll go asleep, just noticed what’s the proportion of your body that is in direct contact with your blanket !!! It was THE SAME THING for Jesus when he was in the Shroud ! So, for me, I really think this high resolution thing is somewhat misunderstood a bit because I think most of the image (especially the parts with the highest degree of resolution) came from a direct contact process and not from a diffusion process. And it is well known that it’s easier to obtain high resolution in a direct contact context than in a diffusion or projection context. So, my perception (of course, I can be wrong) is this : A part of the Shroud images came from some kind of a vertical projection process, yes. But I think a greater part of the images came from a direct contact process and it was this unknown process that can account for the high resolution of the body images. That’s where my reflection has lead me. Of course, everyone is free to believe otherwise… ; ).","date":"2011-11-20","mins":"7:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/20/quote-for-today-on-a-maillard-reaction-as-the-basis-for-an-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Quote for Today on a Maillard Reaction as the basis for an image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4909","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Nice remark Gabriel ! I don’t think anybody has ever done any kind of experiment like that… If you know a scientist around you, must be interesting to submit him your idea of research. The best would be to find a chemist or a biochemist to do this kind of experiment. And this kind of experiment should be done on linen cloth prepared the ancient way (as describe by Pliny the Elder). If it’s not done with this kind of linen (for example, if it is done on modern linen), the results could not be compared to the Shroud… This is very important to remember. And if you can buy Rogers book, you’ll see that he did some interesting experiment with a piece of linen prepared the ancient way (it’s important because this way, there’s really a thin sugar coating that is present at the surface of the linen). He submit this piece of cloth to an ammoniac vapor for 10 minutes and then, leave it at room temperature for 24 hours. After some heating (to simulate aging), he obtain a result that his very close to the Shroud coloration. Of course, the few other experiments done by Rogers were not able to clearly reproduce a body part on linen with a real 3 D property like the Shroud and with a very high resolution but I’m not fool enough to believe that he had time to fully test his hypothesis before he died. Remember that he came back to the Shroud science only around 2000 and he died in 2005. That’s not very long to develop and test an hypothesis like that ! One thing’s for sure : more tests need to be done to completely check out this hypothesis ! And unfortunatelly, as I know, those tests still wait to be done.

Why don’t you just leave that door open for the moment ??? I don’t ask you to favored this hypothesis. I just ask you to be open minded a bit about it. And remember also that this is not because some gaseous diffusion could have been at work in the Shroud that nothing else could not have been active also ! And remember also that we don’t know all the conditions that prevailed before the death of Jesus, during the wait until his body could reach the tomb and after that, in the tomb ! Since we don’t know everything, we must leave the door open to some “special” conditions that could have favored a better body imprint than in “normal” conditions. Who knows ? And for the 80% estimation for the proportion of the body that was in direct contact with the Shroud, I’ve read it in a french book on the Shroud this summer and it came from Marcel Alonso, who’s a well known Shroud researcher in Europe. Even if I’m not sure about the exactness of this estimation, I agree with him that the majority of the body must have been in direct contact with the Shroud (with a large spectrum of slight differences in pressure). Rigor mortis or not, to think that most of the Shroud wasn’t in direct contact (at various degrees) with the corpse, we have to think that it was stretched out strongly (almost flat) over the dead body or, even worse, that the body levitated in the air while the 2 parts of the Shroud didn’t touched at all the body and were stretched completely flat in the air (like the hypothesis of Lavoie) !!! On the contrary, the work of STURP (with a confirmation study made by Mario Latendresse for the frontal part over the waist) have showned that it was possible that the body images were formed while the Shroud was drapped naturally and kind of loosely (without being tied with ropes) over the body. This kind of configuration made it quite clear that the Shroud would have touched (with different level of pressure) the body in a majority of places, especially true for the frontal part of the Shroud. And even the back part would have touched to at least the feet, the buttocks, a good portion of the back and probably a good portion of the back of the head. In this context, and if we forget to consider the sides of the body of course, I doubt that the proportion of direct contacts would be under 70%… And I’ve never been so sure about the 4 cm estimation reached by the STURP team because I always tought that there was not many places where there really was a distance so high between the Shroud and the corpse, except probably the region of the back of the knees. I think Latendresse estimation that after 2 cm, the image formation process had lost over 80% of his capacity is much more closer to the truth and I even have a tendency to think that beyond 2 cm, no color at all was formed. That’s what I think because of my estimation that the Shroud was pretty close to the body almost everywhere (except the back of the knees). Who knows ? Maybe the image formation process was so subtle that a slight difference in the kind of direct contact (difference of pressure) could had an important effect on the darkness of the image that was formed ? Since we don’t know the real image formation process, I think this idea should not be discard too fast….","date":"2011-11-25","mins":"10:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/20/quote-for-today-on-a-maillard-reaction-as-the-basis-for-an-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Quote for Today on a Maillard Reaction as the basis for an image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4950","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I think this paper misunderstood greatly the diffusion process.

I think it’s prematured to say that it is IMPOSSIBLE to obtain body images like we see on the Shroud with any natural or artificial mechanism operating both by contact (with many degrees of contacts) AND by close promixity. More tests need to be done with many configurations between a corpse and a Shroud. I agree with you on one point : By direct contact only, it seem impossible to obtain images like the Shroud. I finish by a remark : The STURP team found some real distorsions in the images even if they are not apparent enough to be easily seen. And Mario Latendresse confirmed those observations by STURP. Those analyses showed that the images on the Shroud were probably formed while the cloth was resting naturally loose over the body. If the draping was really loose over the body (and I don’t have doubt versus this kind of configuration because it fits with a partial rite done on Friday) and if the draping didn’t imply any direct contact with the sides of the body, I don’t think nobody can totally discard some unknown hybrid process that could have operate both by direct contact AND by a gaseous and/or a molecular diffusion). Since we don’t know the exact “recipe” of the mechanism, we have to keep this door open.

That’s the most honest and logical question (if we want to stay scientifically credible) we can ask on this topic before even considering things like UV light, radiation of some kind or things like that. That’s why I’m open to Max suggestion. I also know that some members of the STURP team and some other researchers tested different kind of natural hypothesis over the years, but we can’t say that they fully tested them in every possible conditions and configurations. Also, many biological products have never been tested at all (as I know). So, there’s room for more researches in this field. Personally, since I don’t believe they had time to do a proper burial rite, I favored the biological products that could have come out of the dead corpse (like gas) or that could have been present on the skin (like sweat and other products that could have been left there by the drying of the sweat). But even I think it is highly probable that only a dead body was present in the Shroud and nothing else, I don’t close the door completely to the possibility that some burial products could have been also present in the Shroud along with the dead body, even if the analysis by STURP didn’t found anything like that. Who knows if those products could have taken part of the image formation and cannot be detect no more because of the chemical reaction they produce on the linen cloth (that would have changed their nature) or just because they evaporate with time ? So, I left the door open for this possibility. But again, the fact that the burial rite was done in a hurry don’t get too well with the idea that those products could have been put on the skin of the corpse or on the Shroud surface… St John mention a mix of myrrh and aloes, but many biblical scholars like Raymond Brown favored the use of those products in a solid state and just being put around the Shroud (or under it) to avoid bad smelling, because the participants knew they had to come back inside the tomb on Sunday morning to finish the rite properly. That’s exactly what I think too and that would explain why the STURP team didn’t found any traces of aloes and myrrh in their analysis….","date":"2011-11-24","mins":"11:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/20/quote-for-today-on-a-maillard-reaction-as-the-basis-for-an-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Quote for Today on a Maillard Reaction as the basis for an image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4907","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Nice comment but is there real scientific proof of what you say Carlos ?

These 2 tests were so good (even if they were not intend to be done to replicate the Shroud), that Rogers stayed with this hypothesis and wanted to search more deeply in that direction. That speak loud to me. Do you believe one second that if his preliminary tests would have gave bad results, he would have stayed with this hypothesis until his death ? This is a ludicrous idea. He would have started to look elsewhere. The reality is this : HE DID NOT… I also want to react to one thing you said : “it is clear that he set out to find some kind of theory for image formation that was a natural process to counteract the claims for the “miraculous” that he felt had tarnished the reputation of STURP.” I’m sure this was not the principal motivation of Rogers. His first motivation was to find the truth and, because he was a credible scientist, how in the world would he start to search elsewhere than in the direction of a “natural” hypothesis ? By the way, if Rogers hypothesis is correct regarding the Shroud, that doesn’t mean one bit that Jesus has not resurrect ! It seem like most people around here think that the Shroud MUST be the by product of a supernatural event in order to “protect” the fundation of Christian faith ! What a ludicrous idea ! If the resurrection was JUST a dematerialization of his body (without puffs of smoke and laser beams !), then how Rogers hypothesis could be seen has a “threat” for the reality of the resurrection ? Don’t you believe in the Incarnation ? That Jesus was a real man and, by implication, his dead body was really a human corpse ? Don’t you believe that a real human corpse that was tortured and died of crucifixion could not have released some biological products (like water vapor, different kinds of amines from ammoniac to putrecine, urea, lactic acid, sweat, etc.) that, IT IS PROVEN (read again please the STURP papers, particularly the ones writen by Rogers and also Pellicori), can leave a coloration on linen that is similar than what his seen on the Shroud ??? In that context, I don’t see one good reason why Jesus corpse could not have stayed in his shroud for, let’s say, 36 hours, well enough time to leave an imprint on the cloth, and then, only at that time, leave the Shroud by the way of a dematerialization that was not accompanied by a release of any kind of radiation… Give me one good reason why the scenario I just describe cannot be true ??? One thing’s for sure : if Rogers hypothesis would be proven one day to be good versus the Shroud, nobody would have the right to claim that it is a proof that Jesus never resurrect. What I really want to say about that is this : In the present state of our knowledge, because science has not come full circle versus all the possible natural hypotheses concerning the image formation, we don’t need the help of a by product of the resurrection to explain this relic… And along with his quest for truth, I’m sure it’s true that Rogers wanted to shut the mouth to the supernatural fringe (that has very sadly taken the lead of Shroud research after the infamous 1988 C14 dating) and, in my mind, IT’S ALL IN HIS HONOUR !!! That’s why the supernatural fringe (with their fanatism to always push forward their bad religious agenda, that is to try to prove the resurrection using the Shroud, which goes, by the way, totally against the correct catholic theology) have started an anti Rogers crusade after his death ! It’s not an happy sight to see them acting the way they do.

Rolfe, for once, I mostly agree with your comment ! I think it’s about time now that some other chemist could take Rogers work and push it forward. I truly believe we could have some nice surprises. You must recongnize that, other than Rogers (who sadly died before having been able to really test and develop his hypothesis properly), there is no other scientist who really took up his work and tried to make experiments in order to analyze it more deeply. That’s maybe the only reason why “nowhere in history or indeed today can anyone point to any kind of image produced by a Maillard reaction”, like you said… Who can be sure about that ? As I said often, Rogers was pleased enough by the few preliminary experiments he made (because they proved that some important aspects of the image on the Shroud could be reproduced with the process he proposed) that he stayed with it until his death. If those preliminary tests would have gaven him very bad results, do you think he would have defend his hypothesis until he died ? I really don’t think so. That’s not a proof that his hypothesis was correct regarding every aspect of the Shroud, but that proved that, theoretically, regarding all the data we know about this relic, more testing deserve to be done to check it out properly and, right now, no one has the right to discard it on the simple base that “nowhere we have found another image like the Shroud produced by a Maillard reaction”. Have you ever thought that the phenomenon that was active inside the tomb and inside the Shroud could have been VERY UNCOMMON (like the tortured and crucified body was also very uncommon) while, nevertheless, remaining totally natural ??? That would explain the lack of other examples like the image on the Shroud. I think it’s fair to say that, in nature, there really are phenomenons that are extremely rare because it need that a lot of different factors (some can be rare too) must be joined together at the same time and in the same place. So, I ask you : Why wouldn’t be the same thing for the Shroud ??? Who can be sure about that ??? And we must also note this important fact : How many burial Shroud from the first century of a beaten, scourged and crucified man do we have intact these days ? Absolutely zero ! So, in that context, if the image formation process that lead to the image we see on the Shroud needed a tortured and crucified body (and not a “normal” corpse) in order to be active (simple supposition on my part), wouldn’t be normal that no other body image as good as the one on the Shroud have been found ??? All that to say this : Can we please wait until all the possible experiments could be performed regarding Rogers hypothesis before thinking that it MUST be discarded ??? Should I remind you that, for the moment, this hypothesis should be seen as one of the only hypothesis that present a true rational explanation (theoretically for the moment) that could account for all the data we know about the Shroud ? I say “could” of course because it’s far from being proven yet, but nevertheless, this hypothesis is one of the few that can pretend explaining ALL the different aspects of the Shroud (even the possible image of the hair, the beard and the mustache that might be present on the reverse side of the cloth)….","date":"2012-07-13","mins":"2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/11/rejecting-all-the-energetic-hypothesis-for-the-shroud-of-turin-image/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Rejecting all the “energetic” hypothesis for the Shroud of Turin image"},{"id":"comment-13758","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I really don’t think that Ray Rogers hypothesis goes against the idea of a vertical projection that COULD have caused that kind of result… More laboratory researches need to be done to verify Rogers hypothesis.

And when I see people acting like that, I just found it completely disgusting simply because it goes against a real seek for truth… There’s a lot of politics and bad agendas in the Shroud world these days and, in my mind, this is going to destroy the rest of credibility that might be left in sindonology. The danger is real and, already, the effects are there. I have talked to a bunch of scientists in the last couple of years (scientists that work outside the Shroud world) and realized that most of them don’t take Shroud science very seriously… It’s sad to see and it’s mainly due to these members of the supernatural fringe who constantly want to destroy any good and rational science made by some credible scientists concerning the Shroud. Why ? Simply because they know that there’s a real possibility that one of them (like Rogers for example, but there are others) can approach the truth versus the Shroud while avoiding to call for any supernatural phenomenon and that goes completely against their system of belief regarding this “holy” relic… For someone who have eyes to see, religious fanatism (that often goes with money making agenda while using Jesus Christ) is everywhere in the Shroud world and it’s very sad to note. And as I say, it all really started when the results of the C14 where published at the end of the 1980s. From that moment on, we saw a bunch of religious fanatics taken the lead of Shroud research and that phenomenon is still going on these days… I’ll leave you with a short reflection of mine : From the moment a person (a scientist or not) proposed some kind of supernatural hypothesis to explain the body image on the Shroud, that person automatically fall in the trap of religious agenda. Why ? Simply because someone will NEED faith in order to believe in his hypothesis !!! Automatically, this kind of hypothesis can only be backed up by “faithful” scientist and, when something like that happen, automatically we’re steping out of true and correct science to fall into what Rogers called “the lunatic fringe” of Shroud science and what I prefer to call “the supernatural fringe” of Shroud science (which is more or less like science fiction to me). And I want to make it clear : I say that even if I believe the Shroud is authentic and Jesus Christ truly resurrect !

Sorry but it’s one or the other! No one can hold both hypotheses together. And because Adler tell us that the blood on the Shroud really show all the characteristics of exudates of blood clots, I don’t know why we should still consider Zugibe’s hypothesis as a plausible explanation for the transfer of the scourge marks. By the way, if Zugibe was right about that, then can you explain to me why there are absolutely no smudges on the cloth, especially in the back region where a high pressure was present because of the weight of the body?

As far as I know, Zugibe never addressed that problem in his writings and, more than that, he never tried to reproduce the kind of blood transfer he proposed with a real adult body and a linen cloth. That’s crucial because if he would have done this, it is EVIDENT that he would have obtained some important smudges on his cloth! There is no way he could have obtained the perfectly bordered wounds we see on the Shroud that correspond to the scourge wounds, especially in the back region where there was an intense pressure present because of the weight of the body. The fresh oozing of post mortem blood in a liquid form that he proposed and that would have come from a vigorous washing of the wounds would never have been able to cause the perfect mirror images of the scourge wounds we see everywhere on the cloth. PERIOD. As Barbet wrote in his book, when there is a transfer of liquid blood on a fabric, the blood tend to follow the weave pattern of the cloth and, because of this, cause a stain that is not perfectly bordered like the ones on the Shroud. Like Barbet said, the only way we can obtain such a perfect mirror image of a wound on a cloth is by a transfer process involving exudates of blood that come from a humidified (or a re humidified) blood clot. And that’s the reason Barbet conclude that there was only one part of the Shroud that has been stained with liquid blood and that’s in the region of the feet (because of a post mortem bleeding of the crucifixion wounds AFTER the body had been laid down in the Shroud). Note that it is also possible that there was some staining of the cloth in the lower back region with post mortem blood in a liquid form but it’s hard to be sure because these stains can also have been caused by some very fresh clots that were still very humid. And there is another very important fact that indicate that Barbet was most probably right about the blood transfer coming from exudates of blood clots, which is the particular characteristic of the bloodstains analyzed by Adler and Heller that really fits with the idea of an exudate of a blood clot (incomplete blood, which can offer a scientific and rational explanation for the absence of potassium) instead of a complete post mortem blood. Finally, there is one more very important reason to accept the hypothesis of Barbet concerning a staining of the cloth with an exudate of blood clots and that’s the presence of a halo of serum around almost every bloodstains (including all the scourge wounds), which is a very strong indicator of that particular kind of transfer on a cloth. Note that the presence of these serum stains has been scientifically confirmed by Pellicori and Miller when they did a good study of the UV fluorescence photos of the Shroud. On that subject, it’s crucial to understand that the fresh oozing of liquid blood after an intense washing of the wounds, as it was proposed by Zugibe, would never have left such halos around the bloodstains because when a liquid blood is drying on a horizontal surface, the clot retraction is not able to create the halos of serum we see on the Shroud and that has been scientifically proven by Lavoie in the 1980s when he did some blood transfer experiments. Effectively, to get the good serum halos around the bloodstains like we see on the Shroud, Lavoie said that the clotting must come when the body is in a vertical position, which is totally consistent with the idea that most of the blood drying on the Shroud man’s body happened when he was still on the cross (before and after his death). For all these reasons, I think Zugibe’s hypothesis concerning a partial washing of the Shroud man’s body must be set aside for good..","date":"2013-03-19","mins":"8:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"id":"comment-27826","author":"yannick_clément","post":"That’s not what the Gospels told us….","date":"2013-03-19","mins":"3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"id":"comment-27794","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Max, don’t mix thing up please!

I wasn’t talking about the question of whether or not the Shroud was tied up around the body, which is a totally different question that has nothing to do with the question of whether or not the burial of Jesus was done in haste. Tying up an enshrouded body with linen strips just take a few seconds, so if it is really what was done to the body (I seriously doubt that, but let’s presume for a second), then this could well have been done during an hasty burial… And concerning your 4 hours gap between the death of Christ and the beginning of the Sabbath, you forget to consider that the body was most certainly kept on the cross for a few hours before Joseph could get to Pilatus and get permission to remove the body. And even then, he wasn’t allowed to take it right away just like that. The Romans wanted to make sure he was dead by stabbing the corpse in the chest region and only then, Joseph was allowed to take down the corpse. We don’t know if this procedure was done really fast or if Joseph had to wait again several minutes or hours before they did it. I’m not sure there was a lot of time after the body was taking down from the cross… Also, if the Sudarium of Oviedo is genuine and if the study done by the Spanish team is correct, then that mean the body only reached the tomb several hours after the death of Christ… In that context, there was not a lot of time left to do the burial..","date":"2013-03-19","mins":"10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"id":"comment-27991","author":"yannick_clément","post":"A few days ago, Ron wrote this: “I believe the body may have been only partially washed and a clue is the fact there is no dirt on the body, except for a few well known areas; heel of the foot, knees and nose; Where is all the dirt?” My answer: Obviously, most of the dirt that stained the Shroud had been lost a long time ago due to the vicissitude that piece of cloth endured all over the years (including a lot of folding/unfolding and many rolling on a stick). Nevertheless, if we believe the report written by Nitowski in the 1980s about the analysis she and Kohlbeck did on many samples taken from the Shroud by Ray Rogers, there is still many microscopic particles of aragonite dirt scattered all over the cloth and what is the most important thing to note (beside the very good chemical match between that aragonite and the one found in a 1st century tomb near the reported Golgotha) is the FACT that there is a very good correlation between the amount of aragonite particles and the most probable configuration of the enshrouded body inside the tomb, which mean that there are more particles stuck inside the weave of the dorsal part of the Shroud than the frontal part of the Shroud. The fact that there were only some very specific areas (foot, knees and nose) where that dirt was truly visible with the naked eyes is a pretty clear indication that there were the most stained body parts of the Shroud man.

The image is not a scorch (whether it would come from a forger or from an Hollywoodish Resurrection scenario). Question for Colin Berry : Don’t you realize that if someone would have had in mind to create a false Shroud of Christ in the 14th century in Europe, the outcome of it would never had been close to what we see on the Shroud? Jesus’ buttocks would NEVER had been shown totally naked and the scourge marks would NEVER had been shown in so many places (and it is highly doubtful that our forger would have thought to place a lot of them in front of the body as well as in the back). Seriously Colin, if you really think the Shroud is a forgery, I have absolutely no problem with that, but please, try to be rational and propose us a credible scenario that will take all the data and observations into account, including the history of Christian art and the socio cultural and religious mentality of ancient time. Here’s an advice for you : I think you should try to build a scenario involving a Christian forger who did his masterpiece after the discovery of the so called “true cross” in Jerusalem around 326 A.D. (which lead to the first golden era of Christian relics) and before the first appearence of the first known Pantocrator like painting in Ravenna, Italy around 500 A.D. And who would have created his false relic by using the body of a real victim of a Roman style scourging and crucifixion (tortures that he would have probably done himself with the aid of some collaborators). In this kind of scenario, the body image would certainly have been left on the cloth by accident and would have come from a natural process involving an interraction between the dead and tortured body and the surface of the cloth. I think it would be very interesting if some skeptic out there could build such a forgery scenario in details because, in my mind, this is the only one that can have some chances (very very small I have to say) to be able to explain the Shroud rationally without involving the dead body of Jesus of Nazareth, while taking into account ALL THE KNOWN DATA concerning this cloth.

I’m sorry but Rogers hypothesis regarding the chromophore of the image is far from being dead ! No scientist have been able to show solid proofs that can completely discard this hypothesis. That’s why I’m a bit surprise that they choose to stick with only one hypothesis, i.e. That the color come from a molecular change in the linen itself (hypothesis that come directly from STURP papers), since it is not proven yet. Also, I have to say that I’m not impressed by this list of facts that can challenge any hypothesis regarding a medieval forger. I’m far from being a scientist myself, but nevertheless, I think the arguments I brought in the other day about the evidence of the bloodstains (see my recent open letter) are much better when it comes to challenge any medieval forgery hypothesis. Besides having point out the most solid fact (the blood is really blood) we know for sure about the Shroud that can permit to reject any forgery hypothesis involving any artistic technique, they choose to point out some facts (far from being an exhaustive list) about the body image and, in this list, there’s even one or two facts that are still disputed among Shroud experts !!!! Personally, I think this list is pretty weak and should at least have included the fact that the blood on the Shroud is real blood that comes from exudates of traumatic blood clots, proving that there was a real crucified men that was buried into that cloth, leading to one evident conclusion : The Shroud cannot be the work of a forger that used any form of artistic technique. This conclusion is sure at about 99.9 % and the list don’t even mention this important fact !!!

But for the chromophore, there are some researches that could be done WITHOUT having to get access to the Shroud or to these images. For example, one very interesting research could go like this: It would be interesting to get in touch with a real expert in ancient textile and ask him (or her) to manufactured some linen cloths made with the known ancient methods that were used in antiquity (I say methods with a “s” because I’m convinced that there were many different methods that were used during that era). Then, these different linen samples should be given to a good chemist so he could analyze them in deep and see if some of them could confirm Rogers hypothesis versus the image chromophore.

But I’ll answer to your first question that is : Do you think radiation, such as UV, not act on the “impurity layer” proposed by Rogers chromophores producing? My answer : That’s not what I mean. What I mean is what Rogers was also meaning : If the chromophore of the image is ONLY a thin layer of impurities residing on top of the most superficial fibers of the cloth (as proposed by Rogers) and that there are absolutely no perceptible defects on the linen fibers that bears the image (other than normal aging defects), then that mean the image formation process was VERY MILD (and, as Rogers said, we can also expect that it most probably occured at room temperature). If this is really the reality for the image that is on the Shroud, then it would be HIGHLY IMPROBABLE to see any form of energetic radiation (like the UV you mentioned and all the others that have been proposed over the years) being able to colorate ONLY this thin layer of carbohydrates impurities while LEAVING THE FIBER THAT LIES UNDER IT WITHOUT ANY PERCEPTIBLE DEFECT that would have been easily visible for an expert in radiation like Rogers. Here’s one of the most important quote from all the writings done by Rogers about the Shroud: “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was IMPROBABLE that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source : the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was NO MORE DEFECTIVE than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose (note that this include the primary cell wall).” What Rogers said here is this : IF the chromophore of the image is really only a thin layer of impurities, then we would have to conclude that any image formation hypothesis involving any form of energetic radiation must be regarded as HIGHLY UNLIKELY, while the idea that the image formation process was chemical in nature (whatever what can be this process or these processes) and that it happened at room temperature would greatly gain in credibility. In fact, this would certainly become the most probable scenario for the image formation because it has been proven that there are some chemical reactions (the Maillard reaction being one of them) could colored a layer of carbohydrates impurities that resides at the surface of a cloth while leaving the fiber that lies underneath these impurities completely intact, undammaged and clean (just like what was reported by Adler concerning the ghosts of color and also the appearence of the fiber after the use of diimide).

That’s why scientists should focus on these 2 aspects : the possible images on the backside of the cloth and the image chromophore. No doubt in my mind that if we fiind a definitive answer to those questions, this would open a brand new era for Shroud study. I would like also to emphasize one aspect of the quote from Rogers I gave you yesterday. When he said “the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was NO MORE DEFECTIVE than non image fibers.”, that’s a very important piece of evidence in favor of his hypothesis of a thin layer of impurities that would have been colored instead of the linen fibers. So far, I estimate that the chromophore has very good chances to be like Rogers thought, but concerning the presence of some superficial images on the backside, I estimate that the probability for this to be true is not as high, even though I think it’s possible.

This paper was presented at the Valencia conference and is available on Shroud.com (http://shroud.com/pdfs/barberisv.pdf). Even if I agree with all the different testing proposals of M. Barberis that could be done if a new series of direct research could be allowed on the cloth by the Vatican, I want to point out one sad fact about this paper : Nowhere I saw a direct and clear proposal to verify in deep the question of the chromophore of the image while making a proper analysis of fibers located in non image area in order to characterize the presence of any possible impurity deposits that could be present on these fibers and try to confirm the presence of some impurities (pectine and starch) that has already been found by some researchers like Rogers and Adler, along with an in deep chemical, microscopic and spectroscopic analysis of the coloration that is found on image fibers to see if the observations reported by Adler and Rogers concerning the ghosts and the diimide that left an undamaged fiber behind could be confirmed. In link with this hypothesis of Rogers, the analysis of the banding effect should also be a priority and I didn’t saw anything about that in M. Barberis paper. In fact, the only thing that comes close to checking out this important question of the image chromophore can be found when M. Barberis talk about the need to verify the official STURP conclusion that the image is a product of an oxidation dehydration process in the linen fibers. Of course, I agree with M. Barberis that this particular hypothesis of the STURP team (along with the parallel hypothesis proposed by Fanti and concerning only the primary cell wall of the linen fibers) should be verify in deep but nevertheless, I would have liked to see M. Barberis talks about the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the thin layer of impurities and ask for a proper check of this hypothesis too, not only for the coloration that is found on fibers located in the image area but also for the possible presence of impurities on non image fibers. To me, the question of the chromophore SHOULD be the most important thing to verify in deep with all the modern techniques available for this kind of task (including of course chemical analyses) and the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the impurities MUST be considered as one if not the most probable. In this regard, building a proper protocol to verify this particular hypothesis SHOULD rank very high in the list of priority for a future series of direct testing on the relic. To be honest, I was surprised that M. Barberis didn’t talk at all about this promising hypothesis of Rogers concerning the chromophore and to me, this is a clear indication that this question of the chromophore is TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED in Shroud studies, while this is maybe the most important key to unlock the “mystery” of the Shroud !!! And I must say that I was also very surprised not seeing any proposal of analysis from M. Barberis concerning the claim made by Fanti and others concerning the possible presence of superficial images of the hair, the beard and the mustache on the reverse side of the cloth. Since very precise images of the backside of the cloth have already been taken in 2000 and in 2002, I don’t know why these data would not be available for the scientists that would take part of this future series of direct research. Making an in deep analysis of these images (with all the modern imagery techniques available) would be a very good start to verify if there really are some images on the backside of the cloth. Why M. Barberis didn’t said a word about that in his paper ? I really have no idea !!! And along with this imagery analysis, I think it would be a must to detach again the backing cloth from the Shroud (at least in the region of the face) to make a proper sampling of material residing on this back surface of the cloth in order to do an in deep analysis of this material (chemical, microscopic, spectroscopic, etc.) and see if traces of coloration similar to the coloration we see on the inner part of the Shroud cannot be detect and confirmed. I know that the official position of the Centro is to say that there’s absolutely no image on the backside of the cloth but nevertheless, this possibility SHOULD be verified in deep if a new series of direct testing is allowed on the Shroud. Doing these 2 particular series of analyses would certainly help a lot in our understanding of the exact nature of the body image and I even have a sense that this could open a brand new era in Shroud study. One thing’s for sure: theses analyses would be excellent in order to confirm even more the hypothesis of Ray Rogers concerning the Maillard reaction or to seriously cast doubt over it. And that’s the same thing concerning all the hypothesis involving some kind of energetic radiation. In other words, if we could be certain of the exact nature of the image chromophore and of the presence or not of superficial images of the hair, beard and mustache on the backside of the cloth, we would be in a very good position to estimate correctly the real nature (chemical or not) of the body image on the Shroud and consequently, we would definitely have a much better idea if the process was natural or not. Again, I really don’t understand how and why M. Barberis has completely pass by these 2 very important series of testing concerning the impurities and the possible images on the backside of the cloth that SHOULD BE DONE ABSOLUTELY AND IN PRIORITY if a new series of direct researches would be permitted by the Church. That’s why I have to consider this particular paper as really incomplete, which is a sad observation that I put in the same category as the incomplete list of facts (especially the first draft) regarding the Shroud that was proposed by M.

He’s wrong. I’m not obligated to follow him in his error.” My comment: In my previous post, all I said is the fact that any credible scientist must remain independent of mind versus the dogma of the Resurrection of Christ when he wants to study this cloth and the image that we see on it. The concept of Resurrection is a religious concept that should not create any bias in the scientific study of any credible scientist who wants to study this piece of cloth. That’s all I said and I think we can agree on that. Quote : “Furthermore, science is likewise associated with other fields of knowledge, such as philosophy and history. Your arguments about science in this thread are philosophical arguments. It’s not as though we can place your arguments in a beaker and test them in a laboratory. (Even if we could, as soon as somebody would report what happened in that experiment, the report would involve historical claims.) None of us rely strictly on science for our conclusions about the Shroud. All of us are bringing philosophical views, historical beliefs, and other non scientific perspectives to the table.” My comment: Ok. But what I was refering to is the fact that if a scientist wants to explain the image on the cloth, he should try to evaluate and even test all the possible natural explanations before even thinking about a supernatural cause for the image. Such a scientist must leave his faith in his back pocket while doing his research because if don’t act like this, sure he will get biased by his faith and his science has great chances to go off track versus the reality of the Shroud. Quote: “The long train of failed naturalistic explanations goes well beyond STURP.” My comment: Since science is far from having come full circle in the study of potentially good and natural explanation for the image, I think you should remain prudent before putting the tag “failed” over these hypotheses. Much more study remain to be done before we can definitively put them aside. And even if you don’t base your supernatural judgement on the failing of STURP to find a scientific explanation (which should be understand, by the way, as a synonymous of “natural explanation”), be certain that many people from the supernatural fringe does and that kind of thinking is just wrong!

When I’m posting on Shroud topics at my blog, I often point people to your comments here. But I’ve never understood why you’re so adamant in opposing supernatural views of the Shroud, given how good the evidence is for such a view.” My comment: If the image would be caused by a substance that would be unknown to us or that would defy the known laws of nature (like the Guadalupe Tilma by the way), I would agree with you but because I never seen any proven data or observation coming from the Shroud that seem to contradict the known laws of nature (even though the exact process of image formation remains to be resolved), I continue to think that any credible scientist should keep on searching in the direction of a natural process that has nothing to do with the Resurrection of Christ, except maybe for the possibility that the disappearence of the body from inside the cloth could have happened at the best possible time in order to leave the very high resolution image we see on the cloth. I think you should read the great paper written in 2011 by 2 Italian scientists about the image on the Shroud called “Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image”. In this paper, the Italians wrote that even the 3 D and the negative characteristics of the image are not at all hard to explain naturally.

It is clear in the writings of Rogers that if the chromophore is really a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers and not the fibers themselves, then any energetic radiation must be exclude as a cause of the image… So, in my mind, mixing radon radiations and a Maillard reaction is most probably a bad idea. By the way, in Rogers book and writings, he NEVER said that a Maillard reaction alone cannot explain the image. I think much more researches need to be done to fully test his hypothesis before claiming that there was surely “something else” at work. It’s truly possible that there was something else, but it’s also possible that a Maillard reaction alone (in a very unusual context which need to be fully determined) could have given the result we see on the Shroud.","date":"2013-05-23","mins":"1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/22/struggling-with-naturalist-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Struggling with Naturalist Explanations"},{"id":"comment-34447","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Along with De Salvo’s hypothesis, I consider Rogers’ hypothesis as the most promising by far to explain the image.

This type of reasoning is called « The God of the breaches » (a convenient God who fill the gaps of our understanding of the natural world if you prefer) and can be ok in a religious discourse but not in a scientific one. Science is VERY FAR from having come full circle concerning the testing of the numerous potentially good natural explanations concerning the image. And think about that : If the bloodstains on the cloth came from a completelly natural phenomenon (transfer of exudates of humid blood clots), then why science would have to start searching elsewhere than in a natural direction for the image? Because it is the reported Shroud of Jesus Christ?

Personally, I’m a bit disappointed that Barrie report this quote from Ray without saying more about it because, as it is written, it is very easy for a member of the supernatural fringe to replace « something else » by « miraculous intervention », while it’s far from being the case concerning Rogers opinion about the image on the cloth.

How can we be so sure that there were not images like that at the surface of other shrouds of crucified criminals after 72 hours? It’s impossible to know if the image on the Shroud is unusual or not in the context of the Jewish burial of a crucified man because the Shroud of Turin is the only one we have.

I have, like most catholics I guess, absolutely no problem at all with this scenario… But, at the same time, we have to make a clear difference between “decomposition” and “putrefaction”.

But again, we have to remember that words like “mystery” or “unexplained” doesn’t necessarily equal “supernatural”… Thinking that way is an extrapolation that is not based on scientific facts. Last thing : If the thin layer of impurity proposed by Rogers is really the chromophore for the body image, then I don’t see any good reason why the color should have been totally homogeneous. The thin layer would have been formed by a mix of natural and technical processes involved in the fabrication of the cloth. In this context, why we cannot postulate that the thin layer was effectively present in a discontinuous form on the top part of the weave on the Shroud ? My comprehension of the formation of the thin layer of sugar and carbohydrates on the top part of the weave, has described by Rogers in his book, fits pretty well with the observation made by STURP (especially in the paper published by Evans and Pellicori) that the coloration is present on the Shroud in a discontinuous form (and present mostly on the top crown of the thread and not much in the region where a surface thread start to go down before passing under another thread. In other words, the color reside mainly on the part of the thread that was exposed the most and his thickness was estimate at about 200 to 600 nanometers (ref. : Rogers). Note : this is the correct estimation. Anyone who state only 200 nanometers on the nose is not scientifically correct because it’s almost impossible to be so precise in the case of a tiny layer like that). Also, the coloration is discontinuous, meaning that some fiber were colored beside other non colored fibers. So, if there really is a thin layer of impurity at the surface of the cloth (and it look like there’s one because STURP found starch traces in their samples and Adler found also pectin traces that could have come from the retting process of the flax plant) and if that thin layer would have been deposited there by a natural process called “evaporation concentration”, don’t you think that there’s some chances that the thin layer could have been present on some fibers and not at all on some other fibers located nearby ??? I’m not a chemist but I think this scenario sound very logical… I don’t see why this evaporation concentration phenomenon should have deposited a totally homogeneous layer of impurity on every single fibers located at the surface of the cloth… The way I see this is precisely the opposite : I think it is logical to assume that the amount of impurity created by this process, since it’s a natural process, would have been very fluctuant and it’s not difficult for me to think that some fibers could have been left without any impurity at all. Again, I’m not an expert in this field and I’ve don’t think Rogers even talk precisely on this aspect of the question in his book. So, I would like to ear the thoughts of a chemist about that possibility ! But, again, the finding of STURP that the color reside mostly on the top crown of the exposed threads and start to disappear when this thread start to go down to pass under another thread is consistent with my understanding of an evaporation concentration phenomenon that would have created an impurity layer at the surface of the cloth… I hope you understand what I try to explain here ! All I say is that the STURP finding about the coloration at thread and fiber level is pretty consistent (from what I understand) with the impurity layer as proposed by Ray Rogers. I know Fanti, Di Lazzaro, Heimburger, Svensson, Schneider and Botella have signed a paper that was highly critical about the thin layer of impurity proposed by Rogers… But even they did so, they left this possibility open, even if they didn’t favored it. Personally, I think Rogers was better qualified than those guys to answer the question of the exact nature of the body images. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean he was 100% right about that but, for the moment, on this particular question, until new direct research could be done on the Shroud, I have a strong tendency to believe more in his conclusions than on the conclusions reached by the group cited below (they think the body images lies on the primary cell wall of the linen fiber instead of a thin layer of impurity). And IF Rogers was right, then I think a thin layer of impurity like he proposed can explain many parts (not every parts of course) of the mystery of the Shroud. The greatest one would be to explain why the color reside only on the extreme surface of the Shroud. Note : On the contrary, the conclusions reached by the group cited below (especially the one that state the chromophore is the primary cell wall of the linen fiber) cannot give any rational explantation for why the coloration was confined to the extreme surface of the Shroud… Sorry again for the lenght of my comment but I think some people will find it interesting..","date":"2011-12-26","mins":"1:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/23/surprising-live-poll-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Surprising Live Poll on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-6064","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Those results are intersting but it’s important to understand that “Unresolved mystery” doesn’t mean that a supernatural phenomenon created this image. And for Di Lazaaro comment, when he wrote : “”By the way, Nickell will be interested to know that using VUV photons we obtained this shallow coloration thickness.” I would reply this to him : Rogers obtain also this result with an old fashion piece of linen exposed 10 minutes to ammoniac gas ! You obtained that result by coloring the primary cell wall of a modern fiber. That’s not the most probable way the coloration was produced on the Shroud of Turin ! The most probable way, despite of what you believe, is that a thin layer of impurity was colored and not the primary cell wall. Fanti, you and other guys published a paper in 2010 to make believe it was really the primary cell wall that was colored on the Shroud. That’s very far from being proven even if it was a peer review paper. In fact, that was Fanti’s INTERPRETATION. It was not Rogers interpretation. To be sure on this issue, it would take some more Shroud samples to analyse chemically to know the real chromophore of the image (the support for the coloration). So, for the moment, your experiment and Rogers experiment produced results very similar. So, what conclusion can we draw from this ? That there’s not only UV lights that can produced a surface coloration on linen that is very thin. And what I want to say about those experiments is this : Before Di Lazzaro and his team did those experiments, the probability for a medieval fake (the one I once talk about : a guy who would have crucified some person to produce a relic) was about 0.1% After those experiments, it is STILL 0.1% Those experiments changed nothing at all regarding the possibility of a medieval fake… It was very low before they were done. It is still very low today. The problem with this kind of experiment is that it serve to confort BY EXTRAPOLATION the views of those who have an agenda behind the head (and the agenda is this : proving the resurrection with the Shroud). Here I want to be clear : I don’t say M. Di Lazzaro fits into that category… I don’t know him that much, so I can’t tell. But anyway, that’s not what matter here. What’s REALLY important here is the word “Extrapolation”. Those agenda driven people (I don’t name anyone. They know who they are) take a fact “A” (i.e., that UV lights can color linen close to what we see on the Shroud), then they do an extrapolation “B” (i.e., that the Shroud body images were surely produced by those UV lights), all this in order to produce a conclusion “C” (i.e., that those UV light are a clear PROOF that the Shroud body images are a by product of the resurrection). In science, using an extrapolation like that is ALWAYS walking into a VERY dangerous zone ! The risk of mistakes is very high when you do this… Those agenda driven people think that “A” + “B” SURELY = “C”, but that’s wrong ! A lot of times, when you do extrapolations like that “A” + “B” don’t = “C” at all, except in the dreams of those people ! ; ) And unfortunatelly, in the Shroud world, we see many supposed scientists do extrapolations like that ALL THE TIME ! Again, I don’t want to mention any name but I’m sure those who know the Shroud world enough knows who I’m talking about. Even more than the present media crazyness, it’s precisely this aspect of the Shroud science that REALLY bugs me. And I’m not alone. Even Ray Rogers was pissed off by this kind of pseudo science ! And I’m sure there’s a lot of people today who still think like Rogers… But unfortunatelly, those who keep a cool head are normally not the ones who gets the attention of the media. The bottom line is this : The results of Di Lazzaro and his team just show (and that would be a very good thing that those results can be confirmed by independent researchers) that UV lights can colored a linen surface in a very superficial way, close to what we can see on the Shroud (without penetrate into the cloth).

Thibault Heimburger, Di Lazarro and even Fanti are not specialists in chemistry and still, they co wrote a paper to try to invalidate Rogers opinion on the shroud (particularly about the chromophore for the color) ! I just don’t buy this kind of stuff and I made Thibault aware of it as soon as the paper was published. And by the way, were you there inside the tomb ? How can you be so sure about the fact that in some abnormal conditions (remember that we deal with a tortured and crucified body here), ammonia could not came out of a body before the rotting process ? And if Jesus died from ASPHYXIA like Barbet and others thought, don’t you think there are more chances from a fast released of ammonia from the lungs before the rotting process took place ??? The body stayed maybe some 36 hours inside the Shroud. So, how can you be so sure that there was no ammonia at all released ? Are you a specialist ? If not, please bring me the scientific paper where it is written. I’ll wait for this. Even Thibault wrote a paper about Rogers hypothesis some years ago and found out medical references that proved that a tortured body like Jesus who surely produced a lot a sweating before dying could leave high amounts of urea on his skin. This urea then could have produced fairly rapidly (maybe after 24 hours or so) a released of some ammoniac gas… So, you see ? Ammoniac could have came from inside the body (who can be 100% sure it’s not possible before the rotting process start ?) or from the skin ! I don’t know how you can be so sure about the fact that there was 0 ammoniac released before the resurrection ! Are you so close minded to not accept that there’s still some possibilities for this to happen ? There’s so much data we don’t know about the corpse conditions, the tomb conditions, the environmental conditions, etc. How can you be so sure that there was no ammoniacal release at all my friend ??? The fact that you’re so sure about something like that make me think that you’re agenda driven a bit. Excuse me if I’m wrong. Here’s what we can read on wikipedia about the decomposition process : “Oxygen present in the body is quickly depleted by the aerobic organisms found within. This creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of anaerobic organisms. Anaerobic organisms, originating in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system, begin to transform carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, to yield organic acids (propionic acid, lactic acid) and gases (methane, hydrogen sulphide, AMMONIA). The process of microbial proliferation within a body is referred to as putrefaction and leads to the second stage of decomposition, known as bloat.” You see ? It’s not me who wrote that ! Ammonia gas release is a normal part of the very first stage of the decomposition process… BEFORE THE SECOND STAGE CALLED BLOAT WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST CLEAR SIGNS OF DECOMPOSITION. What’s the problem with the possibility that the body of Jesus could have took part of the first stage of decomposition ? Maybe it hurts your theological concept of the resurrection ? I remember you once quote the psalm 16 where we can read : “For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption.” Hey, don’t you understand that this particular part of the bible is not an historical fact ??? It’s just an image. The writer knew that God will not leave him in the void after death. It was a hope cry ! But for Jesus resurrection, there’s nothing in catholic theology against the possibility that his human body could have experiment the first stage of decomposition before the resurrection… What’s the problem with this possibility ??? Don’t you believe that Jesus was human like you and me ? The Shroud is the biggest proof that he had a corpse like you and everyone else ! So, for me, I don’t see one good reason he could not have emit some ammoniac gas before his resurrection that could have happened 36 hours or more after his death !!! Having said that, I want to state that there’s no proof that Rogers hypothesis is 100% correct regarding the Shroud, but there’s a fairly good possibility that at least some parts of the image could have come from ammonia gas released by the corpse before the resurrection. Scientifically, I don’t think nobody can be 100% sure that this possibility is completely incorrect….","date":"2011-12-24","mins":"12:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/23/surprising-live-poll-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Surprising Live Poll on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-7095","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What is called 3 D regarding the shroud images is in fact an error of interpretation.

I would add this one : It’s not because nobody has been able to fully explain the image formation mechanism of the Shroud that it mean it came directly from an ACT OF GOD (in the miracle sense of the term) ! When I see interviews about the Shroud, more than half of them are done in a supernatural or a paranormal context and it bugs me alot. For me, the Shroud is a material object that can be analysed by science. It doesn’t fit in the same category than ghost, UF Os, etc. And if science has not been able to fully understand the images, for me, it’s just because science didn’t fully test every possible natural process and also, because finding the correct process is not something easy. Why ? Just because nobody know every elements that were present 2000 years ago when the images were supposedly formed. We don’t know the exact conditions. We don’t know what was the temperature. We don’t know what was the exact humidity level. We don’t know what kind of biological products could had been present on the skin of the dead man. We don’t know how much gas and what kind of gas could have been rejected by the corpse. We don’t much ! In this context, finding the correct “chemical recipe” that could have been acting is not easy at all… So, I’m not surprise that the mystery is still alive and well.

The very good probability that the image formation process affected only this thin layer can explain why the coloration is the same at a fiber level, no matter if it was a contact zone or not. If this is true, that would mean that the image formation process was very mild and wasn’t able to color the linen fibers but only the thin layer of sugar and carbohydrates. By the way, this is pretty logical since it is proven (see Rogers book) that, when it gets in contact with a gas, a layer of impurities composed of sugars and carbohydrates is easier to color than the linen fibers themselves. And I’m pretty sure it is also true for other biological products… If it was the linen fiber that would have been colored, your right, it would be VERY HARD to understand why the coloration would be the same at fiber level no matter if it was a contact zone or not (a close proximity zone). Normally, we would expect that the coloration of the zones in direct contact would have penetrated the cloth more deeply and would have created a coloration more intense on the fibers that were on the top surface of the cloth. We would expect to see a gradation in the coloration from the surface to the interior of the cloth. That’s not what we can see on the Shroud. I really think the idea of Rogers that it was just the thin layer of impurities present mainly on the top surface of the cloth that was colored can answer your question.

For me, believe it or not, even if I did some nice debate over the past few weeks on the question of the image formation (no doubt that it is a very interesting subject to discuss), what is on the Shroud (the body and bloody images) is far more important than to learn what kind of transfer was involved. As a believer, I don’t need a proof of the resurrection to see a great sign of it on the Shroud and, furthermore, to believe in it ! And except for the scientists that studied the cloth and will surely keep on in the future, I think it would be a very nice thing if people start to turn a little bit more their attention on what the images have to say about Jesus, his humanity and the gift of his life for mankind than to focus only on what kind of mechanism was at work to create those images. On this particular aspect of the question, I think the medias didn’t helped because, in the past decades, almost 99% of the documentaries, interviews, news headlines or TV shows about the Shroud, only talked about the mystery surrounding it instead of what the images have to say to humanity… But I’m not surprise at all that it is this way because “mystery” sell more than “spirituality” !

Here’s what he wrote: “A single fiber from the center of figure 2 in water. Hemicelluloses and pectins have been oxidized (note: here, Rogers don’t use the term “primary cell wall”, but that’s what he meant anyway), leaving most of the more stable cellulose. The spiral structure of the cellulose ultimate cells is visible.” If we believe Rogers, such a result, which look pretty much like Di Lazzaro’s result while using a UV laser, is NOT THE SAME as the color found in the image area on the Shroud. Note that, in this same section, Rogers wrote: “the Shroud provides its own internal standard for testing this effect. Image and non image fibers show exactly the same amount of electromagnetic radiation damage. ” Clearly, for Rogers, this kind of color located in the primary cell wall of the fiber is obviously showing an excess of electromagnetic radiation damage in comparison to the non image fibers of the Shroud that he analyzed. Taking this into account, I think we can reject Fanti and Di Lazzaro’s hypotheses for good, unless they could provide clear evidence that one of their energetic mechanism could be able to only color a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities while leaving the whole fiber underneath it uncolored, which doesn’t seem to be possible (again, if we believe Rogers)..","date":"2015-07-23","mins":"12:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/the-morphing-of-rogers-and-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Morphing of Rogers and Berry?"},{"id":"comment-206404","author":"yannick_clément","post":"All I say is that the hypothesis of Rogers is far more credible and possible than those proposed by Fanti and Di Lazzaro.

BTW, Rogers’ explanation for the craking (which was wrongly understood by Adler as corrosion) is not naive at all. It is simply the normal consequence of a dehydration process instead of an oxidation process and such a process fits with Maillard reactions and not with any process involving an intense burst of energy. Note that all the data coming from the blood support much more this kind of mild process (i.e. Dehydration instead of oxidation) that can happen at normal temperature….","date":"2015-07-23","mins":"12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/the-morphing-of-rogers-and-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Morphing of Rogers and Berry?"},{"id":"comment-206399","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Rogers did show through a real lab experiment that Maillard reactions coming from ammonia entering in contact with a layer of carbohydrate impurities located on top of some linen fibers could occur at room temperature.

It is a description of a coloration experiment done by Rogers himself with a linen sample made with the ancient method of making linen cloths that he obtained from Kate Edgerton, a linen expert): “A sample of Edgerton’s bleached linen was placed on four drops of dextrin solution on a plastic plate (note: this was done to simulate crude starch that could have been used to protect the threads during the original weaving of the Shroud and traces of it could have been part of the thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that could have been colored by a Maillard reaction). A round spot was obtained. The water was allowed to evaporate from the cloth. No color could be seen on either surface. The middle of the same sample was placed on four drops of Saponaria solution. The wet spot expanded radially through the cloth. The water was allowed to evaporate, and no color could be observed. The sample was then treated at room temperature for 10 minutes with ammonia vapor. A VERY LIGHT COLOR could be observed on the top surface after standing 24 hours at room temperature. THE SAME EFFECT AS AGING CAN BE OBTAINED BY HEATING MAILLARD REACTIONS. The reaction rates are determined by the Arrhenius activation energies and pre exponentials of the processes, and the rate is an exponential function of the temperature. REACTIONS THAT REQUIRE YEARS AT NORMAL TEMPERATURES CAN BE ONTAINED IN MINUTES AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES. The rates of different Maillard reactions increase by factors between two and three for each 10C (18F) increase in temperature. This indicates that they have relatively low activation energies; rates will be significant at lower temperatures. The color shown in figure XI 4 (note: the picture we see in Rogers book show a very distinct yellow coloration of the linen sample, pretty much like the body image we see in the more dense parts of the Shroud’s body image) DEVELOPED AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF HEATING AT 66C (150F). This temperature is far too low to scorch cellulose. Figure XI 4 shows that the most intense color appear in the ring on top. Some color appears around the ring on the back surface; however, the center of the back is nearly colorless. Experimental manipulations of concentrations and one dimensional migration of solutions, as in a large cloth, could produce the same front to back color separation and color density as observed on the Shroud. The fibers on the top most surface are the most colored when observed under a microscope, and the color is a golden yellow similar to that on the Shroud (figure XI 5 / note under the picture : “Medullas are clear”). The coating of Maillard products is too thin to be resolved with a light microscope, and it as all on the outside of the fibers. There is no coloration in the medullas: The color formed without scorching the cellulose. There is a very little color on fibers from the middle of the back surface (figure XI 6 / note under the picture : “A nearly colorless fiber from the middle of the back surface of figure XI 4. Reactants were concentrated at the evaporating surface.”). The color producing saccharides had concentrated on the evaporating surface. Water stained image areas on the Shroud showed that image color does not dissolve or migrate in water. Maillard products are not water soluble, and they do not move when wetted. As a peripheral, non scientific comment, several Shroud researchers have wondered why there is no mention of an image on the “cloths” reportedly found in Jesus’ tomb. Assuming historical validity in the accounts, SUCH A SITUATION COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE DELAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAILLARD REACTIONS’ COLORS AT MODERATE TEMPERATURES. NO MIRACLE WOULD BE REQUIRED.” Final comment from me: If the TV producers had read carefully this section of Rogers book, they would have come easily to the conclusion that a heating of the linen sample after he had been in contact with the pig’s body was truly needed in order to see some clear coloration on the cloth. Unfortunately, they did nothing of that nature and that’s most certainly why there was no image at all on the cloth after the experiment… But, as I said before, the simple fact that there was already some colored fibers pretty much like the ones we see in the image area on the Shroud is a proof that a Maillard reaction was already in place and was slowly developing at room temperature. In the case of the Shroud, this is probably what also happened, which explain why no Gospel writer has made any mention of an image on Jesus’ burial cloth. In any case, it is safe to assume that if the image on the Shroud is a product of a natural phenomenon, this type of image was surely a latent image that took months, years, decades or even centuries to fully develop. And if there really is a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities at the surface of the Shroud and if the Shroud man’s body stayed inside the cloth for more than 24 hours, it is also safe to assume that a Maillard reaction was already in place on the cloth at the time the cloth became empty and this reaction most probably took part (in what proportion?) in the formation of the final image….","date":"2013-05-21","mins":"8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/21/the-pig-experiment-was-not-barries-experiment/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The pig experiment was not Barrie’s experiment"},{"id":"comment-34330","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Mr. Kearse, I really think you should read Rogers book because he address all the issues you describe… Personally, I would say this : Since we know that the Shroud is a real burial cloth that contained for less than 72 hours the dead body of a tortured and crucified man, I can’t imagine that a Maillard reaction is not, at the very least, part of the solution concerning the body image on the Shroud..","date":"2013-05-22","mins":"10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/21/the-pig-experiment-was-not-barries-experiment/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The pig experiment was not Barrie’s experiment"},{"id":"comment-34359","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Mr. Kearse, if you read Rogers book, you’ll see how confident he was on the fact that there is nothing of that nature on the Shroud.

Here it is : In normal conditions, maybe the amount of heavy amines seems inadequate in Rogers hypothesis. But who can say if Jesus case was “normal” ??? Who was there 2000 years ago to take measurements about the amount of amines released by the corpse ??? I think we should be very prudent before claiming “Maillard reaction was very likely not possible in the first days after the death of the TSM simply because the necessary heavy amines postulated by Rogers (Putrescine and Cadaverine) were missing.” I truly think this is a very bad statement, scientifically speaking. Normality is not always at work everywhere, everytime and any good scientist SHOULD know this basic FACT ! Before someone crucified me for this critic versus Thibault’s comment, I should add that I take good note of the words “likely not possible” he wrote. But in my opinion, it’s the same as saying “highly unlikely” and it’s not correct, for the simple reason nobody know what was the exact conditions inside the tomb and inside the Shroud. In this context of darkness, nobody can be sure if there was not some “special” conditions that could have contributed to a release of more amines than “normal”. I don’t think there are enough studied in that matter to be so sure about that. So, can we keep an open mind about the possibility that Rogers hypothesis can be correct IN THE STATE he wrote it ? Who really knows ? One data that is always neglect versus the production of amines is the FACT that we’re dealing with a corpse that is FAR FROM BEING NORMAL !!! It is a tortured, scourged, crucified corpse that was on the cross for at least 3 hours !!!!!! Do you know one single scientific study that have measured the amount of heavy amines postulated by Rogers that could have been released by an “abnormal” corpse like that ? There is none ! So please, can we avoid words like “highly unlikely” or “likely not possible” please, because in the present state of our knowledge, NOBODY CAN BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT !!!! One truly scientific truth is this : THERE CAN BE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE, ESPECIALLY IF “SPECIAL” CONDITIONS EXISTS !!! Personally, unless someone can show me a good scientific study published in a well respected peer reviewed journal that can PROVE that a dead body who suffered similar tortures like the ones suffered by Jesus is not able to emit enough putrecines and cadaverines to produce a Maillard reaction at the surface of an ancient linen cloth, I will still leave the door wide open for the possibility that Rogers hypothesis can be “generally” correct IN THE STATE HE WROTE IT. And before ending my present comment, here’s a message for Ron : You wrote some days ago that Rogers once wrote this : “Even Rogers made statement to this in his paper! He was well aware that diffusion (alone) COULD NOT HAVE CREATED THE IMAGE.” Sorry Ron but I have finish the reading of the very interesting paper recently published by Thibault in which we found all the known comment made by Rogers on the SSG concerning his hypothesis of the Maillard reaction. I have also read all the papers and the book published by Rogers concerning the Shroud. And in all these public and private writings of Rogers, I NEVER WAS ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING WRITTEN BY ROGERS HIMSELF THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED CLOSE TO WHAT YOU PRETEND… Of course Rogers, in some written comments he made, was leaving the door open (as it should) to the possibility that some other process(es) could have been going on inside the Shroud during the image formation process, along with the gaseous diffusion he proposed. There’s no doubt that there is a pretty good probability for this and Rogers was not fool enough to deny it. BUT… from my reading of Rogers writings, I can state with confidence that he NEVER wrote something definitive and without appeal such as : “diffusion alone could not have created the image.” I ask the question : Today, in the present state of our knowledge, who can really pretend without any doubt that Rogers hypothesis alone, in the form he wrote it, is SURELY unable to explain the image on the Shroud ??? I don’t think science as reach that point yet…Honestly, because of all the unknowns that exist concerning Jesus burial conditions and the exact amount of heavy amines his tortured corpse could have produced in the first 36 hours after death, I think we should be very prudent before even thinking that Rogers hypothesis can really be inadequate to explain the body image on the Shroud.

It’s interesting BUT we have to be very cautious here because none of these studies have been done with fresh corpses that were tortured in a similar way than what happen to the man of the Shroud. It’s evident that the studies cited by Thibault were done on “normal” corpse who didn’t suffered intensely like the man of the Shroud prior to their death, and consequently, we can consider them as “not representative” of the kind of dead body that has been the primary source of the image formation process. 2 We’re almost sure about the fact that the type of intense suffering endured by the man of the Shroud would have produced, prior to his death, a high rising of the body temperature, accompanied by much more sweating than normal, along with a high rising of many toxic substances in the blood and/or in the body and/or on the skin like bilirubin (scientifically confirmed), CO2, urea, lactic acid, etc., in levels much higher than normal, and the probable apparition of many important biological problems like metabolic acidity, respiratory acidosis, respiratory problem, dehydration, ionic trouble, renal failure, tachycardia, etc. We’re also almost sure that the body of the man of the Shroud suffered rigor mortis much faster than normal after death. Consequently, in this context of “abnormality”, how can we be so sure that a tortured and crucified corpse like the man of the Shroud would have released the same amount of heavy amines like putrescine and cadaverine than a “normal” corpse during the first 36 72 hours after death ??? On the contrary, how can we be so sure that the very traumatic state of the corpse of the man of the Shroud just prior to his death would not have caused a important and “abnormal” increase in the release of a heavy amines like putrescine and cadaverine during the 36 72 hours after death ??? Taking all this into account, how can someone conclude that it is “likely not possible” that the released of heavy amines like putrescine and cadaverine would not have been sufficient in the case of the man of the Shroud in order to start the Maillard reaction as proposed by Rogers ??? How can we be so sure about that, while there is absolutely no scientific study concerning the amount of heavy amines that a tortured corpse can emit in the first 36 72 hours after death ??? I’ll say it again because this fact is way too much neglected in the Shroud world : The corpse that was the source of the body image on the Shroud was NOT a normal corpse !!! It was a tortured, scourged and crucified corpse who had suffered intensely for many hours just prior to his death and who could well have react very differently in comparison of any “normal” corpse !!! I hope you’ll get the point… Until new scientific studies can be done concerning the amount of heavy amines that can be released by a corpse that has been severely tortured for a long period of time prior to his death, I think GREAT PRUDENCE is needed before making any kind of conclusion versus this important aspect of the Maillard reaction hypothesis as proposed by Rogers.

In the light of all that was written on this blog since a few months regarding Rogers interesting hypotheses concerning not only the image formation but also the chromophore of the image, I think M.

I just can’t imagine an artist or a forger taking a tortured corpse, putting it in a Shroud first in order to get real blood stains, and then, after this first “natural” operation, artificially create the body images by a mechanism that we still don’t know, all this while reproducing accurately all the forensic details of a beaten, scourged and crucified body with no great distorsions between the blood images and the body images !

That’s why the actual Shroud science should do testings to verify (and possibly confirm) this hypothesis of Rogers because if he was correct about that, then, the probability that the Maillard reaction was at least part of the image formation procees would be VERY HIGH, no matter what Carlos and Colin Berry think. Effectively, if the chromophore is really a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers, then we have to assume that there was not gaseous emission at all inside the Shroud during the possible 36 hours the corpse was present there !!! Remember what Roger said in his book : If carbohydrate impurities and amines come into contact with each other, THERE WILL BE A MAILLARD REACTION ! And Rogers emphasize this by saying : This is not an hypothesis, this is a FACT !!! So, I really think the priority of Shroud science should be to verify this hypothesis of Rogers in deep. And this can be done (at least partially) while we wait for another series of direct testings on the relic ! Many very interesting lab experiments (possibly backed up by some computer analyses) could be done right now to verify scientifically the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the chromophore of the image on the Shroud (that is linked with the probable ancient way of making linen cloths, including the most important part called the retting of the flax plant) and I wonder why these kind of important experiment (as long as the nature of the image is concerned) has not been done so far !!! I think it’s probably because most of the Shroud researchers are way too much focussed only on the question of the image formation process. I know it seem redudant to hear me constantly say this but I will keep on because I really think this reflection of mine is very important and should be heard by some scientists interested to learn the truth about the real nature of the image on the cloth !!!.","date":"2012-08-13","mins":"3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"id":"comment-14990","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Message to Daveb and Ron (in particular) and to all the other fans of the “energetic radiation” hypotheses of image formation : I hope you have taken good note of the comment I put here yesterday and that received no reply : https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/08/12/thibault heimburger i hope now that nobody will claim that there is no maillard reaction and no color at room temperature/#comment 14936 I truly hope that all the energetic fans out there will take very good note of this comment of mine because it contain one of the most important quote in all Rogers writings about the question of the chromophore linked with the question of the image formation process… Don’t miss it !.","date":"2012-08-15","mins":"10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"id":"comment-14936","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here, I would like to say “thank you” to Thibault Heimburger for giving us, the general public, the opportunity to read these private messages written by Ray Rogers on the SSG ! Your paper Thibault is a great gift for someone like me ! Thanks again ! I’ve already read more than half of the document and I’ve already found a GREAT QUOTE from Rogers in page 10 that PROVE without any serious doubt that he knew about the less stable nature of the primary cell wall (versus the inner part of the fiber that is more stable and hard to colored) and, nevertheless, he NEVER thought of this part of the fiber as being the real chromophore of the image !!! Here’s the quote (let’s never forget it because it speaks real loud !!!) : “For the ones that like to defend the Shroud image as a « byproduct » of the resurrection, the only thing needed is a kind of energy emanating from the body and able to induced rearrangement of the sugar molecules in the same way that heat does but without affecting the cellulose of the linen at the same time. Does anyone have suggestions of a kind of energy (not infrared, apparently) that could produce a CARAMELIZATION (note : This process mentioned by Rogers refers here to a coloration of a thin layer of impurities) WITHOUT ANY EFFECT ON THE POLYSACCHARIDE STRUCTURE OF FLAX FIBER.” Here, not only did we have a great objection from Rogers against any kind of energetic radiation (UV light, corona discharge, protons, neutrons, near infrared, electromagnetic or electrostatic discharges, etc.), but we also have an incredible piece of evidence that he was well aware of the whole polysaccharide structure of the linen fiber, including necessarily the primary cell wall, since it is this part of the fiber that gets the most polysaccharides elements (hemicelluloses, pectines, etc.) that are less stable (in other words, that can be chemically colored more easily) than cellulose. No way Rogers was only talking about cellulose here !!! This particular quote from Rogers proves without any serious doubt that he never thought that the primary cell wall could offer a good solution for the chromophore of the body image. On the contrary, for Rogers, if any colored sample that is claimed to be “similar” to the image on the Shroud (like the samples obtained by Di Lazzaro with UV lasers or the samples obtained by Rinaudo with protons or the samples obtained by De Liso with electromagnetic discharges) present any kind of defect on the linen fiber itself (even if it would be just minor defects in the primary cell wall), this result SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS INCONSISTENT WITH THE IMAGE ON THE SHROUD !!! PERIOD !!! I hope anyone understand perfectly Rogers point of view now !!! That’s why I ask sindonology to verify more deeply Rogers hypothesis for the image chromophore, because if it could be confirmed without any serious doubt, that would mean all these supernatural hypotheses involving any kind of energetic radiation WOULD HAVE TO BE SET ASIDE… In the very same way than any artistic hypothesis (scorch, robbing, painting, medieval photograph, etc.) have been set aside by science long ago !!! This would be the case for all these supernatural hypotheses, unless some people would just wanted to seek their own truth instead of the real scientific truth regarding the image on the Shroud. I know we’re not there yet, but I really feel we’re pretty close… no matter what many Shroud scientists can say in order to disprove Rogers science. All we need now is a confirmation of the image chromophore hypothesis of Rogers and Shroud science would make a HUGE STEP forward in his quest for truth about the Shroud and his image. That’s what I truly believe. Some months ago, I wrote on this blog that I wasn’t 100% sure if it is only the thin layer of impurities proposed by Rogers that have been colored on the surface of the Shroud or if it is possible that, at least in some places, the primary cell wall too could have been colored. Last night, I received the answer from Rogers himself and his response is “NO WAY” !!! It’s now clear that, in Rogers mind, the coloration only affected a thin layer of impurities and nothing else and that a result like that CANNOT be obtain with the use of any known form of energetic radiation, because they would ALSO produced easily discernible defects in the primary cell wall of the fiber… And the fact is this : Such defect simply don’t exist on the Shroud and the proof of this come especially from the observations made concerning the ghosts of coloration and the use of diimide that has left a COLORLESS, UNDAMAGED CELLULOSE FIBERS BEHIND, in both cases (showing that the color has not affected at all the linen fiber, including the primary cell wall). All these things really seem to point toward the fact that Rogers was right concerning the chromophore. All we need is a scientific and independent confirmation of this… And if this could be done one day (the “if” is important here), then I truly think that there would not be much room for anything else than natural hypotheses of image formation (whether it be the Maillard reaction proposed by Rogers and/or another process), probably chemical in nature coming from the corpse itself and/or from some products that were on the corpse while he was enveloped in the Shroud. I think this is a very good time to use another time the great quote from Francisco Alconchel Pecino : “Probably the controversy arose because, once more, HUMAN INNOCENCE WAS SURPRISED BY THE SUBTELTIES OF MOTHER NATURE.” Meditate on that my friends !!! Important note to all of you who wants the image on the Shroud to be a by product of the Resurrection or a pure miraculous act of God : If all I said in the comment is true (again, the “if” is important here), that wouldn’t mean at all that the Shroud is not the genuine Shroud of Jesus or that he never resurrected ! That would just mean the image on it is another masterpiece of Mother Nature (one more !), which is itself a pure masterpiece of God !!! But while I say that, I’m fully aware of the fact that the interest in the Shroud would dramatically dropped if what I said above if true (and could be scientifically proven one day). Yes, it’s a sad fact that a lot of people are only interested in the supposed “marvellous” aspect of the body image and nothing else. That remind me of the crowds who were following Jesus in the Gospel not because of who he was, but simply because they were looking for some mighty deeds from him !!! It’s a shame that the attention concerning the Shroud is almost only focussed on the “mysterious” aspect of the body image (and this attention would surely dropped dramatically if it would be proved that it was formed by Mother Nature), instead of a seeking of the profound message of redemption, forgiveness and love contain IN this image (no matter if this image was effectively formed by Mother Nature)… That’s part of human nature and nobody will change that. It was the same thing 2000 years ago and it will probably be the same thing 2000 years from now..","date":"2012-08-14","mins":"8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"id":"comment-15066","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I have no problem with the fact that you favored some energetic hypotheses over the one of Rogers Dave.

In his comment, Joe Verhulst concluded that it is extremely unlikely that the Shroud of Turin can be the one of Jesus if the body image on it was formed naturally. I think Joe Verhulst forgot many basic facts in his reflection. Here they are : 1 Jesus of Nazareth is an historical Jew who lived in the 1st century. He was a real human being with a real body like anyone of us and right after his death, it is obvious that Jesus corpse was no different than any other crucified corpse. In other words, his Incarnation didn’t stopped when he died on the cross !!! In consequence, if the body image on the Shroud is the product of a natural process between a corpse and a linen cloth, I don’t see any good reason to doubt the possibility that it is his own dead body that have really take part in this natural process (probably chemical in nature). 2 Despite the C14 dating result of 1988, there’s many good reason to think that the Shroud is much older than the medieval time and can well come from the 1st century. In consequence, since the C14 result has been scientifically proven problematic because the dating was done on a non representative sample from the Shroud and because there’s a vast amount of data from the Shroud that seem to indicate that this cloth is probably antique, I don’t see any good reason to doubt the possibility that the burial shroud that “received” the natural process of image formation at his surface can really be the shroud of Jesus, especially in the light of Ray Rogers hypothesis concerning the chromophore of the image, i.e. A thin layer of carbohydrates impurities found almost only on the top most fibers of the cloth (on both sides) and that would have been caused by the ancient method of making linen cloths. On this subject, remember that, so far, starch fractions and pectin deposits have already been found on the Shroud of Turin. 3 Jesus was scourged, he was crowned with thorns, he carried his own cross beam and then, he died by crucifixion. Since the Shroud of Turin show a body image and bloodstains that are totally consistent with the Gospels accounts of what happen to Jesus prior to his death on the cross, I don’t see any good reason to doubt the possibility that the body image and the bloodstains that we see on the cloth were caused by the corpse of Jesus and not another. 4 On the contrary to Joe Verhulst comment (and other similar comments we often see here or elsewhere), there are a few examples of cloths that bears at least a partial body image on them. The Jospine mattress being the most known. In his paper about the Shroud’s ancient history, Maurus Green reports some other examples of burial garments that showed some body images on them. Because we can assume that these examples (especially concerning the mattress) are all natural occurring body images on cloth, I don’t see any good reason to doubt the possibility that the body image and the bloodstains that we see on the cloth were caused naturally by the corpse of Jesus. And here’s an additional note about a very interesting similarity that exist between the Shroud and the mattress : In both cases, the dead bodies who caused the images on the cloths had a high level of bilirubin in their blood prior to their death, which is a fact that can be important if these body images were made naturally. The high level of bilirubin indicates that, in both case, the bodies of these persons were in a very bad physical state, which could have increased dramatically the production of certain biological substances in the body, in the blood, in the sweat and/or on the skin (like the urea level, the acid lactic level, etc., etc.). It’s truly possible to think that this probable increase of toxic biological substances could have formed some very particular (and rare) conditions that hallowed a the formation of a body image on a cloth that was in close proximity with these corpse, shortly after death. Here, I don’t pretend that both body images were necessarily caused by the very same exact chemical process (or processes), but I say that at least part of the image formation process could well be similar in both cases. And if I’m right about this aspect of the question of the body image, that might offer a good rational answer to the speculative remark made by Joe Verhulst that “there is no special reason why an image thus produced should have formed on the very shroud that envelopped the body of Christ.” I say “speculative remark” for the simple and good reason that the Shroud of Turin is the ONLY archaeological remain of an authentic and complete burial shroud of someone who’ve been scourged and crucified (probably under Roman law). In this context, who can say if the very bad state of the tortured body that was enveloped in the Shroud cannot be that “special reason” why a body image has formed on the cloth ? If the very bad state of the body was really a factor in the image formation, then there will be effectively a “special reason” why the Shroud of Christ would bears the image of his tortured corpse… 5 Jesus was buried in a clean linen shroud according to the Gospels, which his, historically, a very rare fact for a man who died of crucifixion. Because of the historical fact that most crucified victims were not even put in a burial shroud after their death on the cross, I think it’s fair to estimate the probability that the Shroud is really Jesus burial cloth as excellent. 6 The shroud of Jesus was found empty roughly 36 hours after his body was put in it, which is the ONLY historical account that reports such a finding. In history, we have no other historical account that the burial shroud of a crucified man would have been found empty shortly after his death. In that context, I think it’s fair to estimate the probability that the Shroud is really Jesus burial cloth as excellent. 7 Concerning the idea that someone would have taken, kept and preserved with great care a burial shroud like that (full of bloodstains), this idea seems to be completely irrational (especially if the Shroud is antique, because we know that most people of that era, not only the Jews, were horrified to touch or kept such stained burial cloths) except for the case of Jesus Christ, because of the context surrounding his Resurrection (i.e. The founding of the empty tomb and the empty shroud on Easter morning, the claim that Jesus was now living a different life that has conquered death, etc.). I truly think that it’s only in the context of the Resurrection of Christ that we can understand why a stained burial shroud like that could have pass through the centuries and still be venerated today !!! Because of all these FACTS that created a favorable context, I think the scientific PROBABILITY is PRETTY GOOD that : 1 The Shroud of Turin is really the shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. 2 The image on the Shroud is really the image of Jesus corpse after his death (and before his Resurrection). Here, we must never forget the FACT that the image is that of a dead man ! 3 The image on the Shroud, just like it is for the blood and serum stains, was formed on the cloth naturally with the help, in the case of the image, of some chemical interaction between the corpse (the tortured state of the corpse might be one crucial factor for the formation of the image) and the top surface of the linen cloth (that might well be coated with a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities that were the only thing colored furing the image formation process). And I truly and honestly think that this good probability is much better than what can exist for any other man (known or unknown) in history, especially when we consider the question of the preservation of such a bloodstained burial cloth. Finally, I want to react to this statement made by Joe Verhulst : “Nevertheless, we are supposed to accept that the only one image that came into existence in this natural and accidental way happens to be both a *complete* body image that concerns, moreover, not some random person, but Christ himself. All this is extremely unlikely.” My answer to that is this : From a strict scientific point of view, it is simply impossible to be so categorical as to state that there is only one image (like the complete image on the Shroud) that came into existence. In fact, we don’t know anything about that for 2 very good reasons that I already described : 1 There is only one burial shroud in all documented history that was found empty shortly after his used for burial and that’s the one of Jesus. In this context, it is highly unlikely that there were many other shrouds that have been separated from the corpse before the liquid phase of putrefaction had begun and that could have been well preserved until this day. And 2 We know for a fact that the dead bodies of most criminal from the Roman period (especially those who died of crucifixion) were not hallowed to be placed in a burial shroud. So, in this context, mainly because of these 2 good reasons, it is impossible to know if other linen shrouds (especially shrouds of crucified victims) could not have bears a body image on them after 36 hours !!!! On this question, I think Joe Verhulst should read the excellent article published by Dan Porter on his website entitled “The Shroud of Caiphas”. Here’s the link : It shows how a body image like the one on the Shroud could have been formed (or at least, the chemical “seeds” would have been planted for a later formation) on the surface of his shroud after the first few days in the tomb, but would have been destroyed shortly after because of putrefaction. How can we be so sure that this hypothetical case would not have been the norm (and not an accident) in the context of a corpse enveloped in a shroud made with a similar antique method as the one kept in Turin (especially in the context of the few shrouds that could have been used to enveloped the corpse of crucified victims) ? And finally, concerning the very high quality of the body image and the fact that it is almost complete, I would say that it might well be due to a possible separation of the cloth and the corpse at the “right” (or optimum) time in order that the body image would reach a level of definition and completion very high. This could be seen as a pure hasard, but with the eyes of faith, if we believe (as I do) that the Shroud is really the genuine shroud of Christ, we can see more than hasard and see some “Will” of God behind that (note that it’s very different than an “Act” of God)… Note : For the question of the identity of the man of the Shroud, that’s exactly the subject of my upcoming paper that will follow the recent paper I published on shroudnm.com ! I will try my best to analyzed the probabilities for and against this idea that the image on the Shroud is the image of Jesus of Nazareth and I think I will be able to show that it is most probably the case (even if it’s very hard to give the exact level of this probability). I expect to be able to publish it during the Fall… Stay tuned !!!.","date":"2012-08-16","mins":"10:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"id":"comment-15074","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I just forgot to give you the link to the article The Shroud of Caiphas.

I don’t think there are enough studied in that matter to be so sure about that. So, can we keep an open mind about the possibility that Rogers hypothesis can be correct IN THE STATE he wrote it ? Who really knows ? One data that is always neglect versus the production of amines is the FACT that we’re dealing with a corpse that is FAR FROM BEING NORMAL !!! It is a tortured, scourged, crucified corpse that was on the cross for at least 3 hours !!!!!! Do you know one single scientific study that have measured the amount of heavy amines postulated by Rogers that could have been released by an “abnormal” corpse like that ? There is none ! So please, can we avoid words like “highly unlikely” or “likely not possible” please, because in the present state of our knowledge, NOBODY CAN BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT !!!!.","date":"2012-08-17","mins":"4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"id":"comment-14884","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s a reflection about that (this was also included in my long comment) : When someone (De Liso or another) will be able, with his hypothesis of image formation or another involving an electric discharge (like Fanti’s corona discharge), to produce an image of a wig (made of human hair) that would be similar to the Shroud, I will start to consider this hypothesis as credible versus the Shroud.

The solid evidence of the bloodstains ALONE is well enough to prove that the Shroud CANNOT have been created by someone using a scorch technique !!! Question : Do you really think someone could have been crazy and skilled enough to take a blood stained burial cloth and reproduced a body image around the stains with a scorch technique so well that it would have fooled all the medical experts that have studied the Shroud over the years and have all concluded that the body image MUST have come from the natural (or supernatural) interraction of a real crucified corpse with a real burial Shroud made of linen ??? This simple exercise of logical thinking is well enough to understand that the Shroud CANNOT have been created with any artistic technique, including a scorch technique ! Thibault, don’t take my comment as an insult or anything like that. I’m sure you did a great analysis of that hypothesis but the thing is this : I really think this was a useless effort and you should concentrate on analysing all the natural hypothesis for image formation that has been proposed over the years. On this subject, I have a question for you : In 2007, you published a very interesting paper that analyzed the image formation process proposed by Rogers and you came up with a very interesting complementary hypothesis concerning the possible presence of urea all over the skin of the Shroud man that could have caused the released of ammoniac gases and eventually lead to the formation of the body image on the top surface of the cloth (note that if this hypothesis is correct, we must assume that the chemical reaction occured with the thin layer of impurities proposed by Rogers). At the end of this paper, you wrote that you would published a follow up paper for this 2007 paper. WHY DON’T YOU START WRITING IT RIGHT NOW ???

It is crucial to emphasize the fact that these two scientific conclusions are VERY SOLID since they are only based on the vast amount of data and observations that were accepted by the majority of the scientists who have studied the Shroud. BECAUSE OF THAT, THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO SERIOUSLY DOUBT THESE TWO CONCLUSIONS. It’s also important to mention that these conclusions are the same as the main conclusions reached by the STURP team, after the scientific investigation they did on the Shroud at the end of the 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s. In this context, why would we waste one more second of our precious time arguing about false ideas (like the Shroud being an artistic forgery) that simply do not fit with what science knows about the Shroud?” Unfortunatelly, Thibault di djust that (wasting one more second of his precious time) with his paper !!! This quote from my paper that you just read IS THE SOLID TRUTH WE KNOW RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE SHROUD. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS. Because of this, I really don’t understand that a doctor like Thibault don’t seem to be able to understand that the bloodstains evidence (which is far from being a banal data concerning the Shroud) is WELL ENOUGH to conclude that this cloth is a REAL BURIAL CLOTH OF A REAL CRUCIFIED PERSON and consequently, the image on the cloth IS NOT and CANNOT BE the work of an forger that would have use some sort of artistic technique (like the scorch technique he analyzed)… Unlike Thibault, the vast majority of the medical experts who analyzed the Shroud over the years (from Barbet to Zugibe and many others) NEVER thought for one second that the image on this cloth could have come from anything else than an interraction between the cloth and the corpse that was once present inside it !!! The truth is this: once you accept the STURP conclusion that the blood on the Shroud really comes from exudates of blood clots, you have to also agree with the conclusion that the image can only comes from an interraction with the cloth and the corpse it covers and not by the will of a forger using some sort of artistic technique! THIS IS PURE RATIONAL THINKING! And this leads me to state this other truth that most people don’t seems to understand: even if Thibault’s experiments would have give a result that would have closely match up the chemical and physical nature Shroud’s image, that would not have change one iota of this truth that the image on the Shroud is NOT the product of a scorch and can only comes from the interraction between the cloth and the corpse it covers!!! Again, the FACT that the blood on the Shroud really comes from exudates of blood clots is the SCIENTIFIC CONFIRMATION of this TRUTH!!! Note that the same line of thinking is also true for all the 20th and 21st centurties technologies that could produce a coloration that can come more or less close to match up the chemical and physical nature of the Shroud’s image, like the UV lasers of the ENEA or any kind of nuclear bombardment of linen that have been done in the past (by Rinaudo for example). Sadly for some “true believers”, the image on the Shroud is no more the product of 21st century technologies than the product of a forger who would have used some sort of artistic technique… I hate to make this kind of hard critic (especially in this case because I know Thibault really seek the truth with honesty), but I definately think it is important to clearly set the record straight once again versus what the Shroud is and what it is not !!!! Sometimes, like in this particular case, truth hurts and I know it very well… So, Thibault, I hope you’ll forgive me for this “hard” critic that I hope will be constructive in the end. Believe me, I only hope this critic will help you to focus on serious and credible things like all the possible natural hypotheses that exists regarding the image formation, while it will leads you to forget definitely all the artistic hypotheses that have been proposed over the years. I repeat that this is a pure waste of time for the simple and good reason that all those hypotheses have been set aside by science long ago and again, the very particular nature of the blood transfer that occurred on the cloth is the best SCIENTIFIC CONFIRMATION of this… And by making the kind of paper you just wrote (note that I don’t have any doubt that you made a clever job as usual), you only play the game of skeptical persons like Colin Berry and I still think it’s a pure waste of time… In your reply to my first comment, you end’s up by saying that in our quest for truth about the Shroud, we have to go step by step. Even if I agree with the heart of this general principle, that doesn’t mean we have to constantly take 2 steps back by trying to disprove what already have been solidly disprove by the STURP team or by some others SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD. Again, by acting like this, you only play the game of people like Colin Berry. The question is : WHY? I really don’t understand. Don’t you think the mystery of the Shroud is enough thick right now when we try to find a natural mechanism that could have come from the interraction of the corpse and the cloth and that can account for the image on the Shroud??? When it comes to explain the image on the cloth, I really think we should only focus on hypotheses of that nature because that’s the correct and only road science tell us to follow right now if we want to finally solve the mystery of the Shroud!!!! As for the potential supernatural aspect of this image, I don’t think science should focus on that because it goes way beyond his field of expertise..","date":"2012-10-23","mins":"8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18330","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Unfortunatelly my friend Andy, this is not admit by everyone around here !!!

And this is exactly the impression we get when we analyzed properly all the data coming from the Shroud… In other words, these data that indicates a very incomplete burial (that include no wrapping of the body with strips of linen, except maybe for the feet, no washing of the body and no anointing as well) exactly echoes the Gospel accounts of Jesus burial. For example, let’s read the description from St Matthew’s Gospel: “Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.” Many people like like to speculate wildly about certain Gospel parts in order to fit them with their preconceive notions concerning Jesus burial, but when we forget to make any speculation or additions to this particular text, we understand perfectly that Jesus burial was very partial and done very fast. In fact, that’s exactly what the data from the Shroud indicates : When it reached the tomb, the corpse was most probably put inside the Shroud without any preparation of the body whatsoever (i.e. The body was still covered with dirt, blood clots, etc. And no anointing was done) and then, move to his final location, which was a stone bench. Nothing more, nothing less, except maybe, if we believe St John’s account, for the possible use of aloes and myrrh (most probably in powder put in bags that were placed around the body) that was only done to chase the bad odours in prevision of a return to the tomb on sunday morning to complete the burial rite properly. That’s what the Shroud’s data indicates and it fits very well with the Gospel accounts. The idea that they could have continue to work on the burial rite during the Sabbath (which was also the day of the Passover by the way) is quite simply ludicrous and doesn’t rest on any credible historical source as I know….","date":"2012-10-25","mins":"4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18005","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Oups, I forgot two word in my last phrase.

IT IS NOT THE PRODUCT OF AN ARTIST. The blood stains are composed of hemoglobin and also give positive test for serum albumin…» And if this last quote is not enough for you, then here’s some quotes from Ray Rogers book A Chemist’s perspective on the Shroud of Turin (published in 2008): First quote: “Microscopy proves that image fibers and scorch fibers are quite different in structure and composition. The distribution of color is different, even at the level of single fibers. The image was NOT formed by scorching the linen fibers.” Here’s another one: “Other than observing collored medullas, crystallinity and birefringence give good clues for differenciating between scorched and image fibers. The evidence is strong that the image is not a result of dehydration of the cellulose (note: don’t forget that when Rogers was using this word, this included the primary cell wall of the fiber, which is partially composed of cellulose) by any mechanism, thermal or radiation.” And here’s a third one: “Image fibers do NOT show the properties of scorched linen fibers.” Then he add this very important comment: “The observation of colorless cores in image fibers, « ghosts » pulled from fibers by the adhesive, the reduction of the color with diimide, lack of fluorescence in image area and optical differences between image and scorched fibers eliminate any high temperature heating event or energetic radiation in image formation.” Now folks, what do you need to understand that Thibault’s demonstration don’t really bring any new stuff to the sum of data we already knew about the Shroud ??? I’m sure Thibault did a great comparative analysis (as usual) between the image of the Shroud and a scorch image on linen, but the truth is this: it was unnecessary ! Just like any future comparative analysis between the Shroud and any other artistic technique on linen will also be unnecessary because WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THAT WAY THAT THE IMAGE ON THE SHROUD WAS FORMED !!!!! WHEN DOES PEOPLE WILL FINISH TO UNDERSTAND THIS BASIC TRUTH ABOUT SHROUD ??? And in the future, if there’s another Garlaschelli or Colin Berry who wants to make us believe that the image on the Shroud don’t come from the natura interaction between the tortured corpse of a crucified man (most probably chemical in nature and related to some biological products released by the dead) and an ancient linen burial cloth that most probably possess a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on its surface, why not just ignore their false claims ?

But to assume that the impurity layer and the transfer mechanism was homogenous over 14ft x 4ft and (probably) acting over parallel planes is stretching credulity further than any alternative.” My answer: the only answer I can give you David is a TRUTH I already said many times here on the blog: Nature can really be surprising sometimes!!! Please don’t underestimate the power of nature (which was created by God as you know) to create masterpieces. We got plenty of good examples of this if you look carefully around us. And here’s a good example of this: the images of plants, leaves and flowers that are created by the Volckringer pattern phenomenon! On this subject, I really encourage you to read carefully (and with an open mind) the very good paper that was written by John De Salvo about a possible link between this natural phenomenon and the Shroud image: http://shroud.com/pdfs/ssi06part4.pdf Question for you (and anyone else): And what if Rogers’ hypothesis could not be coupled with De Salvo’s own hypothesis in order to explain the Shroud image? I don’t see why some elements of both hypotheses could not be considered together to build a new natural hypothesis that could maybe explain even better the Shroud image. On this subject, I think there are some possibilities that some biological substances (like urea and lactic acid for example) were still present on the skin and hair of the Shroud after the probable drying of his intense sweat, which could have taken part in the image formation process by a diffusion mechanism of the molecules of those substances, along possibly with the post mortem gases described by Rogers. I think it’s fair to assume that there is a real possibility that such a mixture of gases and molecules could well have taken part in the final formation of the image. Until some scientist can investigate properly and in deep all these possible avenues, I think it’s intelligent to leave this door open for the moment… Remember that it is even possible to think that a fine coach of urea that would have been left on the dry skin and hair of the Shroud man after the drying of the intense sweat could also have produced a release of ammoniac gas as well… By in the end, the most important question we must answer to determine if a natural process should be seen as the most rational and probable thing that lead to the formation of the body image is the question of the chromophore of the image. And as I said in my guess posting, in face of all the pertinent data and observations coming from the Shroud I never encountered so far a better, simpler and more rational hypothesis than Rogers’ own impurity hypothesis..","date":"2013-09-04","mins":"2:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"id":"comment-42951","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “The idea that the expectation of finding starch on the shroud meant that they didn’t look for it, is ludicrous.” My answer: STURP main purpose was to check out the painting hypothesis regarding the Shroud image. That’s probably why they never check out for the presence of starch, although Rogers was clear in later writings that Mc Crone had already reported a probable presence of starch on some Shroud fibers during his microscopic inquiry of the samples that were taken by Rogers. Note that it’s a bit bizarre that Rogers didn’t said a word about that in his 2001 paper, but later on, he was very specific about that. Also, you must understand that Rogers eventually did exactly what he wrote in his 2001 paper, which is that he went on checking out for starch and, guess what? He was able to confirm Mc Crone’s claim about that! If you read carefully my paper about Rogers’ observations and conclusions regarding the image (http://shroudnm.com/docs/2013 01 10 Yannick Clément Reflections on Ray Rogers Shroud Work.pdf), you will find these important statements made by Rogers about the presence of starch impurities on the Shroud: Quote #35: “The fact that the color resides only on the fiber surfaces leads to the hypothesis that the color formed as a result of chemical reactions involving impurities on the surface. The spectra strongly suggest that the impurities were carbohydrates that dehydrated as a result of image formation process. The hypothesis of carbohydrates impurities is supported by observations of traces of some starch fractions on image fibers.” Quote #36: “Microchemical tests with iodine detected the presence of starch impurities on the surfaces of linen fibers from the Shroud. Impurities were detected that could take part in color producing Maillard reactions.” Quote #37: “A search for carbohydrate impurities on the Shroud confirmed Mc Crone’s detection of some starch fractions. Starch and low molecular weight carbohydrates from crude startch would color much more easily than would cellulose as a result of either thermal dehydration or chemical reactions.” There is no good reason to doubt these statements from Rogers (especially when you understand that starch was not found by just one researcher but by two independent researchers), which strongly support his hypothesis about the image chromophore, which is the corner stone of his whole Maillard reaction hypothesis and which strongly suggest that a totally natural process was what has formed the image on the cloth. Important note to conclude my point: whether this image formation process only came from post mortem gases and a release of heat from the body and/or from some other biological or burial substances that could have been present around the corpse and/or from some other “facilitating” factor, that remains to be verify more deeply under proper lab control..","date":"2013-09-04","mins":"5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"id":"comment-42927","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “The funny thing about this infallibility imparted to Rogers is that it is sounding like a broken record.” My answer: Louis, you really misunderstood my comment.

It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” Taking this fact into account, if the image chromophore is truly located in a thin and uneven layer of impurities on top of the most superficial fibers of the cloth, then the conclusion must be that the image formation was most probably natural in nature..","date":"2013-09-04","mins":"4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"id":"comment-42924","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What I meant is that if someone would used the possible doubt Rogers had versus the capacity of his hypothesis to explain the high resolution of the image (I said “possible” because I’m still not convinced of this and, in fact, we can even trace some quotes of Rogers where he said just the opposite of this) in order to make believe that this automatically mean that something supernatural related directly to the Resurrection MUST also have been active to “complete” the final image, this person is guilty of doing an unscientific reasonning.

Once again, I realize that most people interested in the Shroud don’t want to hear anything regarding a potential natural formation of the body image we see on the cloth! Even though the whole portrait given by the numerous data and observations coming from the Shroud (in my guess posting, I’ve mentioned the most important ones) really point in the direction of a natural formation of the image (most probably coming from some biological substances released by the dead body or already present on his skin and hair), which was related to a very mild image formation process that most probably didn’t implied an important release of heat and/or energy, people still wants (seem to me that this is at all cost) to keep on believing in a supernatural cause for the image that would be related directly to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and, consequently, would give them a sure proof of this event. More deeply, the major part of all the comments regarding my guess posting really give me the strong impression that most “shroudies” (by the way, I hate that very American way of talking of someone interested in the Shroud – Sounds like “treekies” to me) are associating the question of the authenticity of the relic with the Hollywoodish idea that the Resurrection of Christ (its “dematerialization” if you will) must have produced a release of energy of some sort. Their thinking can be summarized like this: If the Shroud is really authentic, then the “mysterious” image on it MUST be directly related to the Resurrection of Christ. It cannot have come from anything else than a supernatural burst of energy coming from the corpse, which was in its “Resurrectional” mode. And, even worst, I can sense that many of these people are even thinking something like this (which has absolutely no sense to me): If the Shroud is authentic and the image on it came from a totally natural process, then this could mean that Jesus’ Resurrection did not really happened. Personally, I think that this is a very bad way to look at the Shroud, because this kind of thinking really open the door very wide to the strong temptation to put aside (or not really considering with true rationality) all the pertinent data that really point in the direction of a natural cause for the image, mainly due to a fear (conscious or not) that such a natural cause could really be true. Here’s an example of such data that are pointing strongly in favor of a natural process for the image formation: The very probable location of the chromophore in a thin layer of impurities (honestly, I think Rogers has given us well enough solid arguments to place this hypothesis in no.1 place concerning the chromophore question) really makes it almost impossible to think that any form of energetic radiation (related to the Resurrection or not) could have produced this very subtle, superficial and discontinuous coloration everywhere on the cloth (no matter if the body was in direct contact with the cloth in some places and as far as 4 cm away from it in other places). Here’s another one: the fact that the bloodstains were not affected at all by the image formation process, along with the discontinuous and very superficial aspect of the image strongly suggest that the image formation process was very mild and that it happened at normal temperature with no release of a high amount of energy. As Fazio and Mandaglio wrote (along with another researcher named Roberto) in a short paper that was published in 2012 in the British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter (link: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n75part10.pdf): “Nowadays, we know that a slight transfer of energy triggered a stochastic process.” Note: this is a kind of process that can cause an image that is discontinuous and very superficial like the one on the Shroud and that can only be natural in nature (in a paper entitled “Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image”, these 2 Italian scientists were very clear on this question and there’s no doubt that Ray Rogers would have agreed with them about that). And in the same BSTS Newsletter paper I just mentioned, they emphasized this conclusion by saying: “The Shroud body image, produce over many years (e.g. A few decades), is natural. Therefore, to explain the image formation we do not need to say that it was a miracle and we can rule out the medieval forgery hypothesis.” And they also said: “…the UV radiation, the corona discharge and the attempts made to demonstrate a forgery must be excluded.” Also, the idea that if the Shroud is authentic, the body image that we see on it must be directly related to the Resurrection leaves the door wide open for every possible supernatural concepts (which, as I said before, often rests on a magical thinking, which, by nature, is truly unscientific) that could make believe that the image was really formed at the time of the Resurrection. Finally, and it’s a shame for a Christian like me: This kind of thinking seems to completely put aside (or forget or even denied) the reality of God’s Incarnation in our humanity! One thing’s for sure: For me (who is also a Christian who believe in the reality of Jesus’ Resurrection), the Shroud is a burial cloth showing the bloody stigmata and the body image of a dead Jesus in a total state of rigor mortis, which makes me feel strongly that the image on the cloth is most probably related much more to the Incarnation of God than to his Resurrection! Here, it’s important to state this very loud: this probable fact shouldn’t be seen as a denial of the reality of Jesus’ Resurrection in any way! Having said this, I really think that the “supernatural” fans out there should try for a second to forget about the Resurrection when it comes to reflect upon the image of a dead Jesus that we see on the Shroud and concentrate much more on the very important concept of the Incarnation of God in our humanity. Effectively, most people interested in the Shroud (most of them being faithful Christians) seems to forget that before his body disappeared from inside the Shroud (as well as from inside the tomb), Jesus’ body was dead like any other body would be after a Roman crucifixion and this dead state of Jesus’ body was still an integrand part of God’s Incarnation! As such, there should be absolutely no theological or philosophical problem for anyone interested in the Shroud (especially the Christians) to consider the idea of a natural formation of the body image with great peace, knowing that, if this is really how the image of a dead Jesus got on the cloth, this would NOT AT ALL be a fact that could put the Christian concept of the Resurrection of Christ in jeopardy, while, at the same time, it would emphasize even more the Christian concept of the Incarnation of God in our humanity, which is a reality that speak about who God really is as loud as the Resurrection! Unfortunately, this is not what I normally see in most blog comments, especially when it comes to talk about a probable natural cause for the body image… I really think those persons should really ask themselves these good questions: What would be the problem for your Christian faith if the body image on the Shroud would be directly related with the Incarnation of God instead of the Resurrection of Christ? How would this be a problem for the Christian concept of Resurrection? And why would the idea of a body image produced by the dead body of Christ (which is a possibility that is still somehow related to the concept of the Incarnation) BEFORE the happening of his Resurrection would not be possible in your mind or, worse, would be problematic for you and your faith? And why would such a scenario (i.e. A natural image formation process that was active before the Resurrection) be in contradiction with the reality of Christ’s Resurrection or be in contradiction with the idea that this Shroud and its body image were really part of God’s plan for each one of us who would eventually be interested and fascinated by this relic, even though he didn’t needed, to accomplish such a plan, to rely on some supernatural powerful means but on the natural laws that he created? And here’s the most crucial questions of them all: Is it possible that, since the conclusion of the STURP inquiry, most people have completely passed by the most profound message the Shroud had to give us by thinking that this relic is mainly speaking about the Resurrection of Christ while, in reality, there are some very good chances that the Shroud, with its image that probably come from a natural interaction between the dead body of Christ and the cloth, is speaking primarily of the Passion and death of Jesus Christ and, by implication, of the Incarnation of God in our humanity (without putting aside the Resurrection of Christ that immediately followed this natural process of image formation)? Before answering this question, I think you should read and reflect upon the great article written by Father Peter Rinaldi in June 1934 and entitled “The Holy Shroud” (link: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rinaldi1934.pdf), in which you will clearly see that, back then (and up until at least the STURP days), most Christians (and even serious Shroud researchers like Barbet, who was able to analyze the Shroud while leaving his faith in his back pocket) were understanding the main message coming from the Shroud exactly that way (i.e. As a relic that’s mainly speaking about the Passion and death of Christ, well before his Resurrection). In sum, is it possible that the Shroud, with its body image of a dead, beaten, tortured and crucified Christ in rigor mortis and its bloody stigmata, is speaking first and foremost about the Passion, death and Incarnation of Christ (in other words, of his human nature that would have been able to left a natural and graphic body and bloody imprint on the cloth, which represent the greatness of his love for all humanity), much more than his Resurrection or his divine nature (even if it really does in the end but surely not as clearly and not as directly)? More profoundly, is it possible that the most important message of the Shroud talks primarily of the greatness of the love of God for all humanity much more than his own personal Resurrection, while showing us in graphic details where such a God was willing to go with his human body in order to reveal us this awesome and eternal truth: His merciful love for all humanity (Christians or not, “good” or “bad”, that doesn’t matter to him) has absolutely no limit at all when it’s time to save even the most lost of his children and, consequently, we have absolutely no good and rational reasons to fear such a loving and merciful God (even though most people, Christians included, still do even today)? And in the end, is it possible that the body image that we see on the Shroud (along with all the bloodstains on it) can really be a real and great SIGN of the Incarnation of God (a real and complete incarnation in our humanity with a real human body that can suffer and die like the body of every other human being, which therefore could surely have emitted some “catalytic compounds” that could have colored the surface of the cloth soon before and/or soon after his death) instead of being, like many people today desperately wants to see (even if it’s simply not there), a real and sure PROOF of Christ’s Resurrection? And here’s a final and important question for all the Christians interested by the Shroud: If the answer to all those questions (or even just a few) should be “yes”, what would be the problem for your faith in Christ (including your faith in his Resurrection)? I hope those who will read this comment of mine (especially those who are thinking the Shroud image cannot have come from anything else than the Resurrection event) will at least take some time to ask themselves seriously those questions and, more importantly, will reflect with an open mind upon the possibility that the formation of the body image of a dead Jesus that we see on the Shroud could be related directly, not to the Resurrection of Christ, but to his Passion, death and, by extension, to his divine Incarnation in our humanity and therefore, could really come from a natural interaction that happened between his human corpse and the cloth in which he had been placed after his death… I think such a concept, which reinforce the conviction that the Shroud is truly an authentic burial cloth and that it is truly associated with Jesus of Nazareth, while never putting the reality of Christ’s Resurrection in jeopardy in any way, deserve some serious thoughts, especially in the light of all the pertinent data coming from the Shroud, which strongly suggest that the body image of a dead Jesus that we see on the cloth has been formed by a totally natural process that still need to be fully describe and reproduce. Important note to conclude (which is mainly for all the anti Rogers folks out there): Whether or not a Maillard reaction, in the way it was proposed by Rogers, can have taken part in this still undetermined but natural process is another story that shouldn’t interfered here. Yannick Clément, Louiseville, Québec. P.S. : When I look at the Shroud, I see, first and foremost, an image of a dead and crucified Jesus that mainly speak of his Incarnation in our humanity and, therefore, I don’t see any good reason why such an image could not have been caused naturally by his human corpse (especially by the fact that his body was tortured so bad before his death). And when I analyze all the pertinent data and observations that have been collected over the years versus the Shroud image, the fact that there is none of them that need to be link with the Hollywoodish notion of what should has been the Resurrection of Christ (i.e. A supernatural and extraordinary event that must have been accompanied with a burst of energy of some sort) in order to get explained just reinforce my way to understand the most important message coming from the Shroud and its image of a dead Jesus in rigor mortis (i.e. As the greatest sign of the reality of the Incarnation of God in our humanity and, by implication, the greatest sign of the unconditional love of God for every one of his children (Christians or not, “good” or “bad”, that doesn’t matter to him) that we all are)..","date":"2013-09-10","mins":"8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"id":"comment-43202","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Interesting quote: “Your Quotes 36 and 37 directly contradict the above. There is very good reason, therefore, to doubt either Rogers’s post 2000 work, or his and STURP’s 1978 work. Would you care to speculate which one is wrong?” Hugh, in this “new” paper from Rogers, I think you you can find a pretty good explanation for why the post 2000 finding of starch claimed by himself (which confirmed a previous microscopic conclusion made by Mc Crone) is most probably correct and it doesn’t necessarily contradict the conclusions you quote from his STURP paper. This comes from the fact that the detection of carbohydrate impurities like starch in the context of the ancient method of manufacturing linen cloths was not part of the official STURP test plan, which means that Rogers and other STURP members did not build specific chemical tests to detect this particular substance, especially on non image fibers. Rogers was very specific about that in page 6 of his “new” paper: “We expected to find starch on the Shroud (here, Rogers certainly means in non image areas), so we did not specifically look for it.” And he had: “We should have tested for starch and other polysaccharides.” This must be understand like this: Back in the STURP days, he and others scientists from STURP should have designed a microchemical test plan to detect residues of starch, saponaria and other possible polysaccharides (like hemicellulose and pectin residues) that could have been left on the top surface of the cloth (in a layer of various sort of carbohydrate impurities) by the ancient manufacturing method that was used to make the cloth, which could have been dehydrated (colored) by the very mild (and probably natural) image formation process, instead of just checking out if the image fibers could have been artificially colored by a starch based painting media (which is something totally different, chemically speaking, than a dehydration of starch and other carbohydrate residues by some “catalytic compounds” like post mortem gases). In sum, Mc Crone check specifically for things like starch because he had in mind to prove the Shroud had been painted and starch could have been used in the painting media, and he found some but, on the contrary to his idea that such a substance had been used to paint the Shroud, Rogers explained in his later writings that such residues would most probably have been left on the fibers by the ancient method of making linen cloths (with starch that was used to protect the threads during the weaving) and not because of a painting forgery (note that the bloodstains on the cloth are enough to discard any painting hypothesis while showing that the Shroud is a real burial cloth that was used to bury a real crucified body). Note also that most of the quotes from the STURP paper of Rogers concern specifically the painting hypothesis (which was the primary goal of STURP). This means that Rogers had most probably designed a microchemical test plan to see if some starch based painting media could be detected in image fibers (which was one part of the whole “check the painting theory” build by STURP) and if such a media could be the cause of the color of the image. Obviously, he wasn’t able to confirm the presence of such a painting media that would be responsible for the color. In the meantime, he or any other STURP member never did a specific microchemical examination of the non image fibers of the Shroud samples (especially in non image area) in order to detect or not the presence of starch fractions (or other polysaccharides) that could have been left on those fibers by the ancient method of making linen cloths, for the simple and good reason that, back then, no one had in mind that the image color could have been located in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that would have been made partially of starch. On the contrary, back then, every members of STURP was almost sure the image chromophore was located directly inside the structure of the linen fiber, because (among other things) they were able to totally discard any painting hypotheses (including the idea of a painting forgery that would have been made with a starch based painting media)… I think this is the most logical and probable explanation for this apparent discrepancy (only apparent but most probably not real) between the paper Rogers wrote for STURP and his post 2000 writings. In sum, back in the STURP days, he and all the other scientists of the team had not thought of designing a specific microchemical test plan to verify the presence of possible traces of starch, saponaria and other possible carbohydrate in non image area that could have proved the presence of a thin layer of impurities on the top most fibers of the cloth, thus giving us a pretty good confirmation that this is really were the image color is located on the Shroud (image chromophore). And when, after 2000, Rogers made new chemical tests that were more specifically designed to detect the presence of traces of starch and saponaria, he came out hitting 1 for 2, as he was able to confirm Mc Crone detection of some strach fractions, while he wasn’t able to find traces of saponaria, even though he was able to find some circumstantial pieces of evidence that can support the real presence of such substance in the thin layer of impurities that was probably colored during the image formation process. One thing’s for sure: this confirmation of the presence of starch residues on top of some superficial fibers on the Shroud, along with the observation of ghosts of color and the banding effect, strongly support the idea that the image chromophore is located only in a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities and that no part of the fiber structure was colored during the image formation process, which, if this is correct, MUST have been very mild in order to color only this kind of unstable carbohydrate layer, while not affecting at all the underlying fiber (including the external part of the fiber, i.e. The primary cell wall). Concerning this, Rogers was very clear about the fact that if the color is really located in this kind of thin layer of impurities (as he proposed), then this means that we can forget any image formation process that would involved some form of energetic radiation (including the UV light, the corona discharge and the earthquake hypotheses of Di Lazzaro, Fanti and De Liso)..","date":"2013-09-07","mins":"6:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"id":"comment-42913","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “One of the reasons is that Rogers himself wasn’t convinced that the maillard reaction alone could explain the high resolution image we see especially of the face and hands.” My answer: This is not at all a good argument!

Here, I think it’s good to reprint a new though I wrote this morning about Rogers’ new paper: “It’s also important to note that because it is a proven fact that a dehydration of ONLY a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities located around a linen fiber is almost impossible to achieve with any sort of energetic radiation, and because all the data coming from the Shroud (especially the fact that the bloodstains were not affected at all during the image formation) strongly suggest that the image formation was very mild, I’m almost sure that this is why Rogers became convinced that a totally natural process (which he was still seeking to fully determined at the time of his death) was really what have caused the formation of a very faint image on the cloth. In sum, the strong conviction of Rogers that the body image color must only reside in a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities, which would be completely independent from the entire structure of the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall of the fiber) is the most important thing that lead him to conclude that the image formation process was most certainly totally natural. I think it’s fair to say that, in Rogers’ mind, the most probable nature of the image chromophore (i.e. An impurity layer) was the most crucial data to consider when it was time for him to determine the particular nature of the image formation process (i.e. Natural and very mild or supernatural and much more “strong” because it would be related to some form of energetic radiation). And here’s the most relevant statement made by Rogers to explain why a thin layer of impurities as the image chromophore should automatically lead to the conclusion that the image formation process must have been natural and very mild: “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source: the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” We can find this particular quote in the paper The Shroud of Turin from the viewpoint of the physical science published by Emmanuel Carreira in 2010.” All this to say that even if Jesus body truly disappeared from Inside the Shroud during the Resurrection, that cannot be taken as any serious evidence to think that his body image that we see on his shroud was formed by anything else than a natural process. Remember this great truth (which is an integrant part of the Christian faith): Jesus body was a dead body before he resurrect and disappear from Inside the shroud! This is an important part of the Incarnation dogma that most people sadly seem to deny, forget or underestimate. And because it is a very probable reality that his body was a dead meat for several hours prior to his Resurrection, I don’t see why this tortured corpse could not have emitted any biological substances that could have taken a huge part in the formation of the body image… So far, there is nothing in all the Shroud data to really contradict such a possibility.

Concerning Heller and Adler test, here’s my non expert guess: They probably did a iodine test on colored fibers to detect if this coloration could have been produced by a starch based painting media and they were not able to detect the presence of starch most probably because, in color area, the starch residues have been chemically changed by the image formation process. If they would have done the same chemical test with some non image fibers, we have to assume that they would have detect the same traces of starch that were detected by Rogers after 2000, while using the same kind of iodine test.

In 2010: People should know this fact (believe me, I’m not making this up. It’s real and it’s very telling of the dishonesty of some Shroud researchers): At the time this 2010 paper was published, I learned from a very reliable source (which I won’t tell the name) that Fanti (especially him while I don’t know for the other authors) was not willing at all to even mention Rogers’ impurity hypothesis as a possible explanation for the image chromophore and other authors of the paper (which I won’t tell the names) had to make some pressures on Fanti so that he finally was somehow “forced” to recognize Rogers’ hypothesis as being one possible solution for the image chromophore by including statements like these ones in the paper, while making sure to clearly put their personal hypothesis of the primary cell wall well ahead of Rogers’ hypothesis as the most probable solution for the image chromophore: 1 Page 4: “According to Rogers, the body image color resides on a thin impurity layer. This layer could be made of residues (starch, détergents) used during the textile making process that concentrated on both surfaces according to an evaporation concentration process. Alternatively AND PERHAPS PREFERRED, this thin layer may simply be interpreted as the primary cell wall of the fibers.” Note: the first question that came to mind when you read this is: On which scientific and solid basis do the primary cell wall hypothesis should be “preferred” to the one proposed by Rogers, at the exception of Fanti and others will to back up at all cost their supernatural hypotheses and the kind of coloration results they got after doing some coloration test on linen samples? 2 Page 7: “Phase contrast photomicrographs show that there is a very thin layer on all the TS fibers, characterize as “ghosts” by Rogers (SIC – this term originally came from Adler if I’m right), which MAY CORRESPOND TO THE PRIMARY CELL WALL; this is the external thin colored layer pulled from a linen fiber by the adhesive in the TS STRUP sampling.” Note: the first question that came to mind when you read this is: why only speaking of the primary cell wall hypothesis here, while completely avoiding to mention the impurity hypothesis of Rogers, which has probably more chances to explain these “ghosts” with 100% satisfaction (especially when we also consider another important data concerning the fact that the color can be reduce with diimide leaving an UNDAMAGED linen fiber behind)? Again, believe me, what I said earlier about Fanti’s will to completely reject Rogers’ hypothesis regarding the chromophore question is completely true and, consequently, it is very telling of the motivation of this guy. I hope people (especially those who defend the idea of a supernatural process for the image formation) will finally open their eyes about “scientists” like him (and some others) and will never trust anything that could come from them in the future. Effectively, how can you trust someone who is willing to totally reject the very pertinent hypothesis of another researcher for the evident and sole reason that such a hypothesis goes totally against his personal image formation hypothesis (in this case, we’re talking about the corona discharge, but please note that it is the same thing concerning Di Lazzaro’s own hypothesis regarding a flash of UV light)?

Question 2: If the coloration would have been located in the primary cell wall, then the resulting fiber after the reduction of the color with diimide would not have been “undamaged” (quote from Rogers’ Shroud of Turin FAQ paper) and this must be the same thing for the resulting fiber that became free of its coloration coach after it remained in the sticky tapes. For me, if the color would have been found in the primary cell wall and it would have been “extracted” by the sticky tapes or “reduced” by the diimide solvant, no way the resulting fiber could be described as “undamaged”. On this subject of the primary cell wall hypothesis for the image chromophore, I hope you will read carefully a long comment that I’m about to post in a moment… Just check for it Under the comment I wrote September 8, 2013 at 5:10 pm. Question 3: I think only these 2 persons (now dead) could have answered this question with a high level of certainty. I’m also pretty sure that Ray Rogers, because he knew very well Adler’s researches about the Shroud, could have given us a sure answer to this question… My guess here is the same I told you yesterday: I really think they never found any confirmation of the presence of starch on the Shroud because looking for traces of this product on non image fibers was not part of the STURP test plan (this info is coming from the 2001 paper of Rogers), or else, they would surely have found some traces of it because, later on, as we can read in Rogers’ book, new microchemical tests were made again with iodine (most probably on non image fibers) and, this time, traces of starch were found. In sum, I’m almost sure that Heller and Adler only did their test with iodine on colored fibers, which is probably why they didn’t found anything since the starch on those fibers would have been modified chemically during the image formation process. And why I’m almost sure of this? Simply because it was part of the STURP test plan to verify the presence of a possible starch base painting media that could have formed the body image on the cloth, while it wasn’t part of the same test plan to verify the presence of polysaccharides on the Shroud fibers that would have been left there because of the ancient method of making linen cloths (as Rogers said in his 2001 paper, they should have check for these kinds of impurities but the fact is that they didn’t). With such a test plan (mainly designed to verify in deep the medieval painting theory regarding the Shroud image), there was no reason at all for Heller and Adler to start checking for traces of starch on non image fibers. Question 4: Here, it’s a bit disappointing to note that you don’t trust my words! I repeat it: the info I gave you concerning Fanti’s antics regarding the impurity hypothesis of Rogers versus his personal hypothesis regarding the primary cell wall is completely true and I can say this with insurance because of the very good and reliable source who told it to me. Important note about that source: he’s an official Shroud researcher that has a very good reputation, so when he said something about someone, we can be sure that it is the truth… And if Thibault should answer to your question, I just hope he will be honest enough to say that it’s true that if this has been only for Fanti, their 2010 paper would not have made any mention of the impurity hypothesis proposed by Rogers as being a possible answer for the image chromophore of the Shroud’s body image and they would only have talked about the primary cell wall hypothesis, as if it would have been a fully accepted theory!!! I know this sound incredible coming from someone who consider himself as an authentic scientist, but it’s the sad reality! And here’s a very good clue for you to understand that this is true: in 2005, many Shroud researchers from the SSG (among them was Fanti) published a paper at a Shroud conference in Dallas entitled “Evidences for Testing Hypotheses About the Body Image Formation of the Turin Shroud” (link: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/doclist.pdf) in which they recognized as an “unquestionable observation” this observation: “Body image color resides on a thin impurity layer of outer surfaces of the fibers” (note that this is a pretty good summary of Rogers’ hypothesis concerning the image chromophore) and then, in 2008, after the ENEA did their first coloration tests with UV (which showed that it was possible to color only the primary cell wall of a linen fiber), Fanti and a few others members of the SSG (among them were many of those who first signed the 2005 paper) published a new list of facts about the Shroud (which I personaly call “The list of Fanti”) in a paper entitled “List of Évidences of the Turin Shroud” that was presented at the Frascati Shroud conference in Italy (link: http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Fanti List Web.pdf) in which they dared to change the previous “unquestionable observation” for the primary cell wall hypothesis WITHOUT ANY SOLID PROOF that this hypothesis could be more relevant versus the image chromophore on the Shroud and without have the decency to at least keep Rogers’ hypothesis as another true possibility that can explain the image chromophore! Here’s the new “unquestionable fact” (SIC) regarding the chromophore of the Shroud that we can find in this 2008 paper: “Body image color resides only on the thin layer that is probably the primary cell wall (SIC – they call this an unquestionable fact, while they use the term “probably” to talk about it!) (pcw) of outer surfaces of the fibers.” Noticed how they kept a very similar formulation and changed the term “impurity layer” for “primary cell wall”! Such a change WITHOUT SOLID PROOF is truly unscientific and biased in my mind, because it is pretty evident that it was mainly done as a try to back up Fanti and Di Lazzaro’s image formation hypotheses involving a corona discharge and UV laser (which cannot colored just a thin layer of impurities without affecting the underlying fiber, but which could truly colored the primary cell wall of a fiber without affecting its core)… In sum, in 2008, Fanti already did what he was about to do in his 2010 paper!!!.","date":"2013-09-08","mins":"6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/05/thoughts-on-the-thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers"},{"id":"comment-43339","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “Surprisingly, I cannot find that Rogers actually found any starch himself.” My answer: Again Hugh, you should read again the quotes I gave you the other, which can be found in my paper about Rogers’ conclusions and observations versus the Shroud image. Here they are again: 35 The fact that the color resides only on the fiber surfaces leads to the hypothesis that the color formed as a result of chemical reactions involving impurities on the surface. The spectra strongly suggest that the impurities were carbohydrates that dehydrated as a result of image formation process. The hypothesis of carbohydrates impurities is supported by observations of traces of some starch fractions on image fibers. (Reference for this particular quote: Raymond N. Rogers and Anna Arnoldi, Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin – A Review, 2002). 36 Microchemical tests with iodine detected the presence of starch impurities on the surfaces of linen fibers from the Shroud. Impurities were detected that could take part in color producing Maillard reactions. 37 A search for carbohydrate impurities on the Shroud confirmed Mc Crone’s detection of some starch fractions. Starch and low molecular weight carbohydrates from crude startch would color much more easily than would cellulose as a result of either thermal dehydration or chemical reactions. (Reference for the two last quotes: Raymond N. Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, Barrie Schwortz Editor and Publisher, July 2008). Complementary comment versus these 3 quotes: All these quotes from Rogers’ writings proved that there really are some traces of starch on his old STURP samples (no matter what Fanti think or what Adler thought), which confirmed Mc Crone detection (which he did only via a microscopic analysis on the contrary to Rogers who also did find traces of starch via a microchemical analysis) and which also strongly support two important hypothèses proposed by Rogers: 1 His hypothesis concerning the image chromophore (which would only be located in a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities and nothing else) and 2 His hypothesis that starch had been used to protect the threads during the weaving of the cloth, which can also be seen as a strong indicator in favor of a much older age for the cloth, because this is consistent with the ancient method of making linen cloths during Antiquity. Quote from Hugh: “The newly published paper does not mention any tests for starch carried out by Rogers.” My comment: Effectively! At that moment in time, it seems that Rogers had not made any new microchemical analyses to verify if Mc Crone’s claim could be confirmed. The quotes I just give you strongly suggest that he finally did some microchemical analyses on his old STURP samples and was able to detect traces of starch. I will go in Rogers’ book to look at the context of those quotes in order to confirm that Rogers himself did those tests that were able to confirm Mc Crone’s claim and I will share the info with you tomorrow. Quote from Hugh : “There is a mention in another paper, which is often quoted: “Microchemical spot tests with aqueous iodine indicated the presence of some starch fractions on Shroud fibres,” but the references given for this evidence do not back this up.” My comment: Look at quote #36 that I just gave you and you’ll noticed that it is the very same quote! I found it in Rogers’ book about the Shroud. Can you tell me where did you find it yourself (in which paper)? I would be very surprise to learn that this particular claim that we can find in Rogers’ book doesn’t come from a microchemical test he did himself after the writing of his 2001 paper… Again, later tonight, I will check the context in which we find this quote from Rogers in his book and I will tell you more about that tomorrow. But seriously, if Rogers made all those statements in his later writings about the fact that deposits of starch were find after the detection made by Mc Crone, I don’t see why we should seriously doubt such a fact. Last thing: Thank you very much for having shared this quote from Mc Crone’s book. I don’t have this book, so this was new information for me and I hope it will help you to trust Rogers statement #37 that I just gave you in this present comment… Note: Rogers was truly an honest scientist and I don’t understand why people in the Shroud world are constantly putting his statements and conclusion in question just like we had serious reasons to believe in his dishonesty! I don’t understand at all. Anyway, concerning the quote you mentioned concerning the supposed finding of starch residues made with a microchemical test with iodine, I will try to find some confirmation in Rogers’ book..","date":"2013-09-08","mins":"5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/05/thoughts-on-the-thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers"},{"id":"comment-43348","author":"yannick_clément","post":"In this comment, I would like to expose you some crucial facts that, I hope, will make you realize the big difference between the way Fanti and Di Lazzaro are doing their research on the Shroud image and the way Rogers did his own. Fact 1: For years now, Fanti has been convinced that the image on the Shroud must have come directly from a burst of energy that was released at the time of the Resurrection of Christ. Fact 2: Then, Fanti made some coloration experiments with a corona discharge and thought it could offer a good solution for the Shroud image. Fact 3: Then, Ray Rogers tested the hypothesis proposed by Fanti by making some coloration experiments on linen with a corona discharge and noted that the coloration result he obtained (see figure X 7 in page 86 of the PDF version of his book about the Shroud for an example of such result) was not at all the same as what he saw on the Shroud. And guess what? The result he obtained was showing a coloration confined to the primary cell wall of the linen fiber! The crucial thing to remember is the fact that, for Roger, this kind of result WAS DIFFERENT from the color of the body image on the Shroud that he analyzed for so long, most probably because a coloration obtained with a corona discharge did some evident damages to the linen fibers, which cannot be seen in image fibers taken from the Shroud. Right then, Fanti must have forget about his corona discharge hypothesis and also about the idea that the body image color on the Shroud could be located in the primary cell wall of the linen fiber. Fact 4: Some time after this rebuttal of Fanti’s hypothesis by Rogers, he turn to Di Lazzaro and the ENEA team and convinced him to performed some new coloration tests, but this time with a UV laser instead of a corona discharge, while, at the same time, he still proposed publicly his corona discharge as the best solution for the “mystery” of the Shroud image formation. Fact 5: Di Lazzaro and his team did some coloration tests on linen with their UV laser obtained pretty much the same kind of result that was obtained years before by Rogers when he did his testing of the corona discharge hypothesis, i.e. A coloration confined to the primary cell wall of the linen fiber. At that moment in time, Fanti and Di Lazzaro should have recognized with humility that this kind of result is different than what Rogers saw at microscopic level during his analysis of the Shroud image and therefore, they should have forget about the idea that a burst of UV could have been the cause of the body image on the Shroud. But this is not at all what happened! Fact 6: What really happened is this: instead of recognizing with humility that the coloration results they obtained with a corona discharge or with a UV laser was DIFFERENT from what Rogers noticed during his close examination of the Shroud image fibers, Di Lazzaro choosed to keep on making new experiments with UV laser, while keeping on pushing hard in favor of this particular hypothesis in order to explain the Shroud image and Fanti did the very same thing with his corona discharge hypothesis! Fact 7: Then, both Fanti and Di Lazzaro, being obviously unable to recognize the negative judgement of an expert like Rogers versus the kind of coloration results they both obtained with a corona discharge and also with UV lasers (i.e. A coloration confined to the primary cell wall, which obviously for Rogers, produced some damages to the linen fibers that are not at all present on the Shroud image fibers), decided to wrote a paper (the 2010 paper that is mentioned on top of this page) in order to push the primary cell wall hypothesis for the image chromophore (knowing very well now that this is the only kind of coloration results they could get with a corona discharge and a UV laser), while, at the same time, making believe (with some subtlety) that Rogers’ own hypothesis for the image chromophore (i.e. Color located only in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that doesn’t affect in any way the underlying linen fiber) is most probably incorrect. And in order to discredit Rogers’ impurity hypothesis, they used these few arguments that are completely false (at least, in the present state of our knowledge): 1 This impurity hypothesis would be unable to explain the discontinuous distribution of the colored fibers in the image area (note that the “new” paper of Rogers that was recently published on shroud.com offer some pretty solid reasons to reject such an argument, especially when we note the kind of result Rogers obtained after an evaporation concentration experiment he made with a cotton nap and a dye solution, which show that, normally, this kind of natural process happening inside a cloth will produced an uneven layer of “impurity”, thus offering a simple and rational explanation for the discontinuous aspect of the Shroud image). 2 There would be no reference stating that starch was used in Antiquity to produce linen cloths (note that this argument is completely contradicted by the expert opinion of Anna Maria Donadoni, which was the conservator at the Turin’s Museum of Egyptology, who clearly mentioned to Rogers that starch was often used in Antiquity to protect the threads during the weaving of the cloths). 3 This impurity hypothesis would be unable to explain the fact that the color is found all around the circumference of a colored fiber (note that this argument is truly misleading because it gives the wrong impression that every colored fibers on the Shroud are showing a coloration all around their surface in a homogeneous way, which has been proven by Rogers to be completely false. Effectively, Rogers showed to the SSG (which I’ve been able to see for myself) a very high resolution close up of a colored fiber taken from his STURP samples (here’s a link to see a small version of this photo: http://www.shroud.com/gallery/pages/Rogers%20 DISCONTINUOUS%20 YELLOW.htm) and we can easily see that the distribution of the color on this fiber is not even at all in every part. In fact, we can see a certain amount (thickness) of color in some areas and even more color (more thickness) in other areas, while no color at all can be found in some other areas of the same fiber. In sum, from this photo showed by Rogers, we can conclude that the distribution of the color at fiber level is almost as much discontinuous and non homogeneous than what it is at thread level when we compared all the fibers of one colored thread, which is a very particular characteristic that really seems to agree with Rogers’ hypothesis of a very thin and UNEVEN layer of impurities that is probably forming the image chromophore. In fact, the only correct thing we can find in this argument saying that the color is found all around the circumference of a colored fiber is the fact that the color CAN be present in any area of a colored fiber, whether it be “over it”, “under it” or “on both sides of it”, and this cannot be taken as a characteristic that goes against Rogers’ impurity hypothesis, especially when we consider the high resolution photo he show in page 105 of his book about the Shroud, which is called “figure XI 5”, that is showing the result, at microscopic level, of a coloration test he did on a linen sample prepared with the ancient method of making linen cloths in order to verify the kind of coloration he could get with his image formation hypothesis that include a Maillard reaction on the impurity layer. On this photo, we can clearly see that the color is present all around the colored fiber but not in a homogeneous way (we can see a degree of thickness that is stronger in some areas than in others, while there seem to be some areas where there is absolutely no color at all), which is very similar to the high resolution photo of a Shroud image fiber that I just mentioned and therefore, can be seen as a pretty strong indicator of the validity of the impurity hypothesis proposed by Rogers versus the reality of the colored fibers on the Shroud. In the end, we can say that Rogers’ hypothesis for image formation is able to produce a coloration that can be located anywhere on a particular fiber but not in a homogenuous way (in other words, we can say that the coloration is discontinuous even at fiber level), which is exactly what he was able to see on the surface of the colored fibers from the Shroud that he analyzed with his microscope. Final note: on the contrary to Rogers’ image formation hypothesis, I really doubt that a corona discharge or a burst of UV light can produce a very evident non homogeneous coloration on the surface of one particular colored fiber in the same way than we see on the high resolution photo showed by Rogers, especially when we think that such high energy processes always colored the primary cell wall of the fiber, which can be found in roughly the same amount (thickness) all around every linen fibers, i.e. More or less 200 nanometers, and which is totally different from the very uneven layer (even at fiber level) of impurities proposed by Rogers. Note also that we can also strongly question the capacity of those high energy processes to produce a discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in one particular colored thread (which is the very bad argument #1 they used against Rogers’ hypothesis). Fact 8: To this day, Fanti and Di Lazzaro still maintain publicly (and also in their official writings) that the image chromophore is located in the primary cell wall of the linen fibers (again, we must note that this is the best they can get when they try to color some linen fibers with a corona discharge or a UV laser), while keeping on pushing in favor of their “pet theories”, while knowing full well that the kind of result they can obtained from such hypotheses was completely rejected by Rogers as a possible explanation for the formation of the Shroud image because it was showing an obviously (for him anyway) different kind of coloration result, especially concerning the microscopic aspect of the colored fibers. Here, it’s crucial to note that Rogers knew what he was talking about when it comes to the microscopic appearance of a Shroud image fiber. And it’s also important to note that we’re not even talking here about the theoretical incapacity of such high energy hypotheses to produce an image on linen that would ALWAYS be discontinuous and extremely superficial like the Shroud image, no matter if the source of energy is located in direct contact with the linen sample or at 4 cm or so of the same linen sample. On this subject, it should be noted that Fazio and Mandaglio (who are two Italian scientists who analyzed these kind of high energy hypotheses) were very specific about this FACT. Fact 9: On the other side, you got a very professional scientist like Rogers who had no preconceive notion about the cause of the body image on the Shroud who did his own research in a completely different manner than Fanti and Di Lazzaro. Effectively, Rogers started, as it should, by trying to understand and describe the image chromophore of the body image on the Shroud by taking into account ALL the pertinent data and observations related to it (especially the discontinuous and very superficial aspect of it, as well as the presence of “ghosts” of color in the sticky tapes, the reduction of the color with diimide, which left an UNDAMAGED and CLEAN linen fiber behind, the banding effect that we see everywhere on the Shroud and the most probable method that was used in ancient time to produce linen cloths). After analyzing all these data, he came to the conclusion that the image chromophore was most probably located in a very thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities that would be more unstable than the linen fiber itself (including the primary cell wall) and therefore, which could become dehydrated (colored) much more easily and even at normal temperature. Then (AND ONLY THEN), he tried hard to find a viable hypothesis to explain the process that lead to the formation of the body image on the cloth. As we can see in the 2001 paper that was recently published on shroud.com, he first proposed, on the basis of the results obtained by Pellicori of STURP, that skin perspiration (sweat) and/or skin secretions, along with possibly a certain release of heat by the corpse could have been the “catalytic compounds” that produced a caramelization (coloration) of the thin and uneven layer of impurities on the top surface of the Shroud through a mix process that would have acted by direct contact, as well as by diffusion. Then, after he became convinced that the body of the Shroud man was most probably dry at the time he was placed inside the Shroud (this imply that there was a certain delay of time between the time of death and the time of the entombment to allow the most probable intense sweat that was covering the Shroud man’s body and hair to dry completely, which is truly possible, especially in the light of the Gospel accounts of Joseph being forced to go to Pilate to ask permission to take the body and buried it in a normal tomb), Rogers was somehow forced to search elsewhere for a better solution (which is something that Fanti and Di Lazzaro where unable to do when they noticed that they couldn’t get anything better with corona discharge or UV laser than the coloration of the primary cell wall of the linen fibers). That’s when he started to take much more seriously the “vaporographic” hypothesis that was proposed by Vignon at the beginning of the 20th Century and ultimately found out that some crucial elements in it could well be valid versus the reality of the Shroud image, which lead him to elaborate a new image formation hypothesis involving primarily a diffusion of post mortem gases that would have caused, along with a probable release of heat from the corpse, a Maillard reaction in the thin layer of carbohydrate impurities (made primarily of starch that was found by Mc Crone with a microscopic analysis and also by a later microchemical test with iodine done by the STURP team) that resides on the top most fibers of the cloth. Noticed that on the contrary to Fanti and Di Lazzaro, Rogers built his image formation hypothesis AFTER he analyzed and understood correctly the image chromophore and then (and only then) he made sure that his image formation hypothesis would be able to produce the same kind of image chromophore by doing some preliminary test of coloration on linen samples that were made with the ancient method of making linen cloths. The results of his preliminary tests were good enough for Rogers (especially the one we can see the result in figure XI 4 in page 104 of his book about the Shroud) to convince him that he was on the right track and that his image formation hypothesis deserved to be well described and well defended publicly. In sum, Rogers was convinced that his hypothesis was really able to produce a yellow coloration on linen fibers that is showing very similar characteristics than the Shroud image at microscopic level (much more in Rogers’ opinion than what can be seen after a coloration test done with a corona discharge and certainly also after a test done with UV laser, since it present roughly the same characteristics, especially when it comes to the location of the color in the primary cell wall and most probably also when it comes to the kind of damage it can do to the structure of the linen fiber). He was also convinced that it could theoretically produced the same kind of full length body image (which contain some 3 D properties) that we see on the Shroud if all the right conditions (still undetermined for most of them) could be reunited, but unfortunately, he died before being able to performed more complex imaging tests to see what kind of result he could obtain under different textile, environmental and biologicial conditions. All that I said in this comment is, I believe, the truth or at least very close to the truth. Of course, I can be wrong on some minor aspects of the whole issue but I’m certainly not wrong on the most important ones, which is that Rogers and the Fanti Di Lazzaro tandem have not followed the different steps of research in the same order. Now it’s up to you to decide who followed the correct steps in his research about the Shroud image (Fanti and Di Lazzaro or Ray Rogers) and consequently, who has more chances to be close to the truth regarding the kind of image formation process that occurred on the Shroud (at least when it comes to determine the nature of this image formation process, which can be natural or supernatural)….","date":"2013-09-08","mins":"6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/05/thoughts-on-the-thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers"},{"id":"comment-43355","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I think you made a little understandable mistake concerning this particular quote Hugh! I have found the original paper in which Rogers mentioned the fact that microchemical tests (note: most probably done on non image fibers) indicated the presence of some starch fraction and it is this one: Raymond N. Rogers and Anna Arnoldi, Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin – A Review, 2002. The quote in question can be found in page 7 of the paper and it is found in the middle of this paragraph: “Image color does not appear under the blood stains when they are removed with a proteolytic enzime (reference: “A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin” by Heller and Adler). Whatever process produced the image color must have occurred after the blood flowed onto the cloth, and the image producing process did not destroy the blood (no reference for this sentence most probably because this was a brand new statement written by Rogers and Arnoldi for this particular paper). Here’s the quote in question: Microchemical spot tests with aqueous iodine indicated the presence of some starch fractions on Shroud fibers (again, no reference for this sentence most probably because this was a brand new statement written by Rogers and Arnoldi for this particular paper, which most probably means that this finding had been done around that time (2002) by Rogers himself with a new microchemical test with iodine, which was most probably performed on non image fibers taken from his STURP samples). No proteins could be detected in either image or non image areas; however, they were easy to detect in blood stains; however, they were easy to detect in blood stains (reference: “A Comprehensive Examination of the Various Stains and Images on the Shroud of Turin” by Jumper, Jackson et al. And “Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin – A Summary of the 1978 Investigations” by Schwalbe and Rogers and also “A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin” by Heller and Adler). We have recently found that some plant gum, mordants, and dye(s) coat the yarn of the sample which was taken by Gilbert Raes in 1973 for textile analysis (reference: “Rapport d’analyse” by Raes). These deposits are unique to the Raes sample; however, that area was in immediate contact with the radiocarbon sample that was removed for dating in 1988. This fact makes the validity of the radiocarbon sample questionable (no reference for this sentence most probably because this was a brand new statement written by Rogers and Arnoldi for this particular paper). So Hugh, I hope this explanation of mine will help you to understand your mistake regarding this particular and very important statement of Rogers! Again, this is quite understandable, because there was many references that were given by Rogers and Arnoldi for other sentences in the same paragraph. In the end, I think we MUST consider as very sure the fact that Rogers was able to find some traces of starch on his old STURP samples with new microchemical spot tests done with aqueous iodine that he most probably did after the writing of his “new” 2001 paper and the writing of this 2002 paper entitled “Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin – A Review”. Note that it would have been very strange to see Rogers wrote in his 2001 paper that no STURP member (including himseld) was able to detect some traces of starch back then and then, one year later, in another paper, to see him wrote that microchemical tests with iodine were able to find some traces of this product, if these new tests would not have been made by himself, but would date back to the STURP days!.","date":"2013-09-08","mins":"7:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/05/thoughts-on-the-thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers"},{"id":"comment-43349","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s a small erratum concerning my previous long comment: In fact #9, I wrote this: “a Maillard reaction in the thin layer of carbohydrate impurities (made primarily of starch that was found by Mc Crone with a microscopic analysis and also by a later microchemical test with iodine done by the STURP team).

And why do they push this hypothesis, which is totally unable to offer a rational explanation for the very superficial aspect of the image, since there is a primary cell wall around each linen fiber of the cloth, no matter if this fiber is located on the top most part of the cloth or more deeper inside it, and there is no good reason to assume that a particular primary cell wall should show a very different degree of thickness versus another one (which is a probable fact that seem to be, at first sight, much less able to explain the discontinous aspect of the body image than the uneven layer of impurities proposed by Rogers. This particular paper is, in fact, an attempt made by Di Lazzaro, Fanti and others from the SSG to back up their supernatural hypotheses, while they were perfectly aware of the fact described by Rogers, who sais that such high energetic processes are completely unable to produce a only color a thin layer of impurities that would be located on top of the linen fibers without, at the same time, affecting the underlying linen fiber in a way that would be easy to detect for a specialist. And here’s the most important thing to note: Di Lazzaro and Fanti had already proposed their supernatural hypotheses regarding the Shroud many years before they wrote this paper to back up their preconceived ideas with an attempt to make believe that the color would resides not the thin layer of impurities proposed by Rogers but in the primary cell wall of the linen fibers, which is something that goes against some of the most important observations coming from the Shroud (i.e. The ghosts of color extracted from the image fiber that left a clean and UNAFFECTED linen fiber behind along with the banding effect on the Shroud, which is most probably due to the fact that various batch of yarns had been bleached separately, thus leaving a various average amount of impurities on top of the fiber, including on top of the primary cell wall). Finally, I don’t think this particular paper have considered the finding of some starch fractions on Shroud samples by Mc Crone (which were independently confirmed by Rogers later on) with enough care, because this is a very important finding that strongly support the impurity hypothesis of Rogers for the image chromophore against the primary cell wall hypothesis of Di Lazzaro, Fanti et al… Truly, the first time I read this paper, my blood boiled because it was easy for me to detect a high level of scientific dishonesty in it, linked with the high desire of Di Lazzaro and Fanti to make believe that their supernatural hypotheses could truly offer a valid explanation for the Shroud image..","date":"2013-09-07","mins":"5:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/05/thoughts-on-the-thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers"},{"id":"comment-43206","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I need to write again the first paragraph of my previous comment: And it should be noted that this hypothesis is totally unable to offer a rational explanation for the very superficial aspect of the image, since there is a primary cell wall around each linen fiber of the cloth, no matter if this fiber is located on the top most part of the cloth or more deeper inside it, and there is no good reason to assume that a particular primary cell wall should show a very different degree of thickness versus another one (which is a probable fact that seem to be, at first sight, much less able to explain the discontinous aspect of the body image than the uneven layer of impurities proposed by Rogers).

I also know that this 2010 paper of Di Lazzaro and Fanti was done in a complete dishonest and unscientifc way. Why? Very simple: remember what I said in my guess posting about the fact that Rogers, on the contrary to those guys, followed the correct steps of scientific research concerning the image by first looking to explain the image chromophore, while taking into account for this all the pertinent data and observations (that’s when he proposed his “impurity” hypothesis) and then (AND ONLY THEN), did he tried hard to find the most probable “catalytic compounds” that could have produced the very subtle, superficial and discontinuous coloration of the image. That’s when he first came out with the idea developed first by Pellicori of sweat and/or skin secretions and then, probably when he realized that the body of the Shroud man was most probably dry when he was laid in the cloth, he changed his mind and proposed a new hypothesis involving post mortem gases (including ammonia gas) and probably a release of heat by the corpse, which would have produced a Maillard reaction (instead of a caramelization reaction) in the thin layer of impurities. On the contrary to Rogers, Di Lazzaro and Fanti did exactly the opposite by first proposing a supernatural image formation based on their preconceive notion that the Resurrection of Christ must have release some form of energetic radiation and then (AND SADLY ONLY THEN), they proposed an hypothesis for the image chromophore that could fit with the testing they did on linen samples, while trying hard to discredit the “impurity” hypothesis of Rogers, for the evident reason that they became aware (most probably through their coloration tests on linen) that Rogers was right about the fact that they (or anyone else) would never be able to only color such a very thin layer of unstable impurities without affecting in an evident way the structure of the underlying linen fiber. That’s why I consider their 2010 paper as being totally scandalous… It’s like if Rogers would have obtained some interesting color results through coloration tests he would have done with post mortem gases and a layer of impurities located on top of a sample of linen, and then, after he was sure of his result, he would have written a paper to back up the idea that the image on the Shroud must be located in the same place than the chromophore of his coloration results.

Personally, I have nothing against that, as long as the hypothesis in question stay inside the range of the known laws of nature, while taking into account all the known characteristics of the body image. And secondly, when it comes to the critics adressed to the presentation of Fazio and Mandaglio hypothesis, and especially the claim that “high energy physical processes can create a stochastic process as well as low energy ones”, I would say that, in Fazio and Mandaglio’s mind, this is not true IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SHROUD IMAGE. In another context completely different than the Shroud image, I don’t know if there can be some stochastic processes that can get started with the presence or the release of some high amount of energy, but I know that, from Fazio and Mandaglio’s perspective, this could not be the case in the context of the Shroud image, once we understand well all its known characteristics… To them, the global portrait given by these characteristics of the image, and especially the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area (which can be seen as a “stochastic result” of coloration) coupled with the extreme superficiality of the image, could only be explain by the presence of a low amount of energy that was released by the corpse (or by something resting on the skin and hair of the man) and which started the yellowing process on the cloth’s surface. However, after a lot of exchanges between me and Mr. Fazio, I succeed to convince him (and Mandaglio through him) that there was another alternative that could also explain quite well the body image and particularly the two interesting characteristics I just mentioned… But I can ensure you that a sudden burst of high energy from the corpse was not part of that alternative scenario! Not at all! In fact, the alternative in question that can offer, we believe, a viable solution to explain the discontinuous distribution as well as the extreme superficiality of the image is the one proposed by Ray Rogers, which is related to the potential nature of the image chromophore (i.e. A chromophore located only in a thin AND UNEVEN layer of carbohydrate impurities). And that’s when, after some more reflection on the subject, I came up with the personal feeling that there are probably some chances that, in fact, the discontinuous aspect of the image and its extreme superficiality can well have come from BOTH SCENARIOS (i.e. The release of a low amount of “energy” from the corpse that could only have been able to interact with A PORTION of the coated fibers located on the top surface of the cloth). As I said before, I truly believe I’m the very first one to ever come up with such a theoretical proposal, which can be seen as a kind of fusion between Rogers and Fazio Mandaglio hypotheses in order to explain all the known characteristics of the Shroud image and particularly the two characteristics I underlined in this comment + the banding effect visible on the cloth and its relationship with the various densities of the image. One thing’s for sure : Rogers did not thought about such a fusion, nor the tandem of Fazio and Mandaglio! Seriously, I truly believe that such a proposal would deserve to get fully tested under proper lab control by a real expert in the field of biochemistry (a CSI type of scientist would be great). Of course, I’m well aware of the fact that this would need someone very motivated with a lot of resources (effectively, the range of possible source of the weak energy is quite large and there are a lot of different possible environmental conditions to reproduce), but I think this kind of testing could greatly help our understanding of the most probable mechanism that lead to the image formation… Hopefully, one day, someone will come across my hypothesis and will get interested so much by it that he will decide to go ahead with some testing… P.S.: I would like to say to Mr. Gian Marco Rinaldi that we (me, Fazio and Mandaglio) had NO IDEA who were the 3 referees that had to judge our paper until they send us their first report. And even then, Mr. Fazio only learned the name of one of the 3 referees, so there are good chances that the other two were not sindonologists at all. One more comment: Even if Mills did was a sindonologist at one point, that doesn’t change the FACT that he’s a real scientist who knew physics very well and, therefore, was a good choice to evaluate our paper and propose some changes. As I said, our paper wasn’t approved in the first time and 2 or the 3 referees (including Mills) forces us to rework our paper a bit in a few places. Again, I want to ensure everyone who will read my comment that the peer review process was completely legit, honest and professional, just like the other peer review processes in which Mr. Fazio had to pass before he could publish all his other papers about the Shroud. As I said, at the beginning of the peer review process, we didn’t knew the names of the 3 referees and we never gave any money to the journal to get published. I will never let anyone here make comments to suggest our paper hadn’t been evaluate correctly through a real and serious peer review process. You can disagree with our image formation hypothesis, but please, don’t attack the credibility, honesty and serious scientific background of nuclear physicists like Fazio and Mandaglio, who are well known and well respected in their field of expertise in Italy…”.","date":"2014-10-10","mins":"8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"id":"comment-161002","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I want to inform people here that me, Fazio and Mandaglio had the project to write a complementary paper on the subject, but unfortunately, due to health problem, Mr. Fazio decided to put a hold on this project. I don’t even know if this new paper will ever get done in the future. Nevertheless, I would like to give you 2 important extracts that were parts of this paper (which was almost finished when Mr. Fazio droped out of the project) and I hope this will help some people to understand better our ideas about the Shroud image formation and maybe see the potential good value of our theoretical work on the subject: Extract #1: « Concerning the amino reactant, they start to get released by the corpse some time after death, when the decomposition process starts producing ammonia and amines (e.g. Cadaverine and putrescine). It’s important to note that ammonia and many of the amines are volatile and would rapidly undergo Maillard reactions with any starch deposits and/or reducing saccharides they contact, thus causing a dehydration of these carbohydrate impurities that lead to the production of the same kind of yellow color that has been observed in the image area of the Shroud. These authors take also into account the high temperature gradient d T/dx value, which would have had a large effect on the above reaction rates. Here, we must underline the fact that this hypothesis do not propose that a stochastic event happened at the surface of the cloth during the image formation process because, as it was described by Rogers and Arnoldi, we must expect that each topmost fibril that would have come in contact with the postmortem gases released by the corpse would have theoretically been yellowed if such a fibril was coated with carbohydrate impurities. In this case, the discontinuous distribution of colored fibrils and the extreme superficiality of the image would be entirely explained by the uneven distribution of the impurities on the surface of the cloth, instead of by a weak amount of energy that would have been responsible for the start of a stochastic process of yellowing. Consequently, we think it’s relevant to propose an alternative scenario to Rogers and Arnoldi’s hypothesis that would involve the release of a small quantity of ammonia and/or amines by the corpse, which would have still been enough to start a stochastic process that would have slowly yellowed the surface of only a portion of the most superficial fibrils of the cloth that would have been hit by this weak energy (or only a portion of the carbohydrate impurities that were possibly coating those fibrils, as it was described by Rogers and Arnoldi), thus leading to the formation of a very superficial body image with a discontinuous distribution of yellowed fibrils some years or decades later. In sum, this alternative hypothesis is quite similar to the one described by Rogers and Arnoldi, except for the change we introduced in one crucial parameter, which is the amount of energy (i.e., post mortem gases) that could have been involved in the image formation process. We believe that this new parameter could be enough to change the nature of the image formation process proposed by Rogers and Arnoldi from a deterministic one, in which every coated fibrils that would come in contact with the post mortem gases would eventually become colored to a stochastic process, in which only a portion of the coated fibrils that would be hit by these gases would eventually become visibly yellowed. To our knowledge, such an alternative hypothesis has never been proposed before and should be the subject of future investigations. Before concluding this part of our paper in which we talk about our alternative hypothesis, it’s important to note that the question remains open as to whether the weak release of post mortem gases could have come from the surface of the skin and hair (because of the presence of urea that would have been left there after the drying of the abundant sweat and which would have been transformed into ammonia gas some time later), or directly from within the corpse during the very first stage of its decomposition (as it was described by Rogers and Arnoldi), or eventually from both sources. There’s no doubt that this is an important aspect that would need to be investigated more deeply in order to refine our hypothesis. Finally, we must also underline the fact that if the image color is truly located in a thin and uneven layer of impurities on the cloth’s surface (and in the light of the very interesting result obtained by Rogers during a coloration experiment he described in his book, this might well be the case), then the particular nature of this chromophore could certainly have played an important role in the formation of the body image, along with the stochastic event of coloration that would have been triggered by the release of a weak amount of post mortem gases by the corpse. Effectively, there’s no doubt that the concentration of these impurities on the surfaces of the topmost fibrils of the cloth would have contributed heavily to prevent the production of color deeper into the cloth and the probable uneven distribution of these impurities from one fibril to another (with a greater concentration on the fibrils located at the highest parts of the weave) would have contributed to accentuate the discontinuous distribution of colored fibrils in the image area. Also, the presence of some small differences in the average thickness of the impurity layer from one batch of thread to another would have certainly contributed to produce the slight differences in the image density that has been observed on the Shroud.” Extract #2: “Here, we must underline the following: (a) theoretically, it would be easier for a stochastic event involving a weak amount of energy to affect and colored these kinds of external impurities located on the surface of the fibril, which are made almost exclusively of carbohydrates, than it would for the structure of the linen fibril itself, including its most superficial layer known as the primary cell wall, which is easier to color nevertheless than the deepest layers known as the secondary cell walls because of the presence of a much larger amount of polysaccharides of lower activation than the cellulose (like hemicelluloses and pectin) in that first part of the fibril, and (b) if the chromophore of the image is only located in this sort of layer of carbohydrate impurities, it is probable that it was not evenly distributed on the top surface of the cloth at the time of the image formation, which can explain the general discontinuous distribution of colored fibrils that has been observed in the image area, as well as offering a pretty good answer to the observation that, among this discontinuous distribution, we sometimes see bundles of yellowed fibrils right next to bundles of uncolored fibrils (this seem to be particularly true in expected zones of direct contacts between the body and the cloth, where the energy that hit the cloth was the more intense during the image formation process). On this subject, we must note that Rogers made some experiments to simulate the evaporation concentration phenomenon that would have created this layer of carbohydrate impurities on the top surface of the Shroud during the final drying of the cloth (probably in open air), after its weaving and washing (probably with Sapanaria Officinalis). A good summary of these experiments can be found in the book he wrote about the Shroud and the most important results are the fact that such a natural phenomenon can take the impurities that are usually trapped inside a cloth after its manufacture and final washing, and concentrate them as a thin coating on the evaporating surface of the cloth (sometimes even on both surfaces, depending of the way the drying his done) and such a concentration of impurities on the cloth’s surface can get formed in a very non homogeneous way (depending of the type of cloth) and this is true even at fibril level where the surface of one particular fibril can get coated by those impurities, while the one located right next to it can stay completely free of any impurity. Here, it’s important to note that if such an evaporation concentration phenomenon really formed a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities on the top surface of the cloth, this kind of non homogeneous and unpredictable result can be seen as another stochastic event that possibly contributed heavily to the formation of the body image on the Shroud, even if it happened during the manufacture of the cloth, well before the beginning of the image formation process. Effectively, if the image chromophore is really located solely inside this sort of thin and uneven layer of impurities, this would explain, at least partially if not completely, some of the most particular characteristics of the image, including its very thin thickness, the discontinuous distribution of yellowed fibrils in the image area, as well as the fact that the density of the image is slightly different on the various lots of threads that have been used to manufacture the cloth, even though the spectra of each colored fibril is identical in every part of the image. Taking this into account, we must consider the possibility that such a uneven (stochastic) distribution of carbohydrate impurities on the top surface of the cloth can be, in fact, the primary reason for the presence of a discontinuous (stochastic) distribution of colored fibrils in the image area, instead of the weak nature of the energy that was released by the corpse and which started the image formation process on the cloth’s surface, as we proposed in our previous papers. However, we must also state categorically that, even if the uneven nature of the impurity layer would really be the main reason why the body image is showing a discontinuous distribution of colored fibrils, the fact remains that the energy that would have reacted with it (whether it be the post mortem gases proposed by Rogers and Arnoldi or the other forms of weak energies we analyzed in the present paper) must have been pretty weak, because it would have only been able to yellow these carbohydrate impurities, while leaving the underlying fibrils undamaged and uncolored. That’s why even if such a scenario would be true, we should still consider the various types of biological energies that we analyzed in this paper as being the most probable forms of energies that could have been at the origin of the image formation process. In sum, we can conclude that the discontinuous and very superficial nature of the Shroud image at fibril level and the slight differences of image density from one thread to another could not have come from anything else than: (a) the particular weakness of the still undetermined energy involved in the image formation process (as it would be for our own image formation hypothesis involving thermal diffusion or for those proposed by Mills and De Salvo) or by (b) the uneven and very thin aspect of the image substrate, which would have been composed uniquely of carbohydrates impurities residing on the outside surfaces of the colored fibrils (as it would be for Rogers and Arnoldi’s image formation hypothesis) or by (c) both factors acting together (as it would be for the alternative scenario we propose concerning Rogers and Arnoldi’s image formation hypothesis, as well as the ones proposed by Mills, De Salvo and us, if the weak energy they imply have only reacted with a layer of carbohydrate impurities residing on top of the colored fibrils). Finally, it is still possible to think that other natural mechanisms that have never been proposed yet could be able to yield the kind of stochastic distribution of yellowed fibrils we see in the image area on the Shroud or at least, to have reacted with the carbohydrate impurities proposed by Rogers and Arnoldi, thus causing this kind of stochastic result. If someone proposes a natural mechanism of this nature in the future, this could be added in the list of potential sources of energy that could have contributed to the Shroud body image formation. For this reason, this paper does not solve the question. On the contrary, it offers to the Scientific Community involved in the study of the Shroud of Turin a good reason to pursue further investigations, which could include coloring tests on linen samples that would be made with a known ancient method of manufacturing linen cloths. Here, it should be noted that, at the exception of Raymond Rogers, who did some preliminary tests on linen samples to verify some important aspects of his image formation hypothesis (in some cases, Rogers get very interesting results and in some other cases, not), no other natural hypothesis that have been described in this paper have been tested under proper lab control, which means that, for the moment, their potential to explain the Shroud body image remains theoretical only. P.S.: I want to thank Dan Porter for having remove the “embargo” against me, so that I can publish these extracts from our unpublished paper.

Besides, their optical density value (always the same) is independent of this energy. With this state of affairs, we obtain a stochastic yellowed fibril distribution. In fact: (a) the probability of a fibril yellowing is a function of the energy; (personal note : this means that in places where we found a higher proportion of colored fibers for example : in the zones of direct contact between the corpse and the cloth), that’s where the energy that yield this yellowing result was higher). (b) the optical density value of a fibril is not a function of the energy. (personal note : this means that no matter the quantity of energy present in a zone, if there was a coloring result coming from that energy, it produced roughly the very same color. Here, in order to be more precise, I think Fazio and Mandaglio should have wrote « of a yellowed fibril » instead of just « of a fibril »). This picture is very similar to that which occurs when numerous groups of persons absorb energy by radiation. In fact, it is known that when the absorbed dose is low, the risk of falling ill for the persons that constitute the irradiated group is of stochastic type. The probability of the event is a function of the absorbed dose, while this is not the case for the seriousness of the effect. Regarding the Shroud of Turin, all the fibrils in the image area represent the numerous groups of persons; the most yellowed ones, those that yielded the Shroud body image, represent the events. The radiation and the chemical processes, when little quantities of energy are transferred to a large number of subjects, can yield stochastic distributions. In such a case, the effects have times of latency that are of the order of many years (e.g. A few decades). Besides, these effects do not need a threshold dose to appear. For the Shroud of Turin, this statement means that the fibrils that have yielded the body image have increased their optical density over a few decades. Therefore, we can state that the Shroud body image is a latent image, in agreement with the hypothesis that its formation is not due to an artist. » This quote gives you a pretty summary of the kind of stochastic process of image formation they had in mind concerning the Shroud. They gave a pretty good example of such a stochastic process, which concern a numerous group of persons that would absorb a little quantity of radiation and only a portion of them would eventually get ill after a certain period of time. In the context of the Shroud image, such an example can be transposed like this : a high portion of the topmost fibers in the image area on the Shroud (and maybe all of them) have been hit by a weak release of « energy » (which can well have come directly from the Shroud man’s corpse), but only a portion of these fibers that came in contact with this weak energy have eventually been yellowed over a certain period of time, which can be counted in years and maybe in decades. The basis of their hypothesis is summarized in this sentence: « The radiation and the chemical processes, when little quantities of energy are transferred to a large number of subjects, can yield stochastic distributions ». This is that particular kind of stochastic process they had in mind in the context of the Shroud image and not another type of stochastic process that would get started by a high amount of energy! For them, it’s obvious that if the release of energy would have been important (like in the case of numerous radiation hypotheses that have been proposed over the years, including a corona discharge and a burst of UV light), we would expect, in theory, to get a coloring result that would show some important differences of properties than what has been observed on the Shroud. Here’s some probable differences we could expect: a) a yellowing of all the fibers that would have been hit by this high energy in question, which would probably have resulted in a much more homogeneous distribution of colored fibers in the image area, and particularly in the zones of direct contact where the energy was at his peak (which is not what is seen on the Shroud and which must be considered as a « deterministic process » and not a stochastic process) and/or b) a difference in the level of penetration of the color inside a particular linen thread (which is not what is seen on the Shroud), whether the source of that high energy was located in direct contact with the cloth (thus producing a more in deep penetration of color inside the linen threads receiving that energy, because of the presence of more energy there) or at some distance from it (thus producing a more superficial penetration of color inside the threads, because less energy would be present there) and/or c) a difference in the level of penetration of the color inside the structure of a particular linen fiber (which is not what is seen on the Shroud), whether the source of that high energy was located in direct contact with the cloth (thus producing a more in deep penetration of color inside the structure of the linen fibers receiving that energy, because of the presence of more energy there) or at some distance from it (thus producing a more superficial penetration of color inside the fibers, because less energy would be present there). I hope this will help some people to understand why they associated their stochastic process of image formation with a low level of energy that would have been released by the corpse and why they reject the possibility that a high level of energy could have been present at the time of the image formation. Note that the fact that the bloodstains have not been affected or damaged by the image formation process, even though they were already on the cloth, is a good piece of evidence to back up such a conclusion, along with the kind of discontinuous distribution of colored fibers and the ultra superficiality of the image. But having said that, I have to say that there’s another possibility that exist other than a stochastic process that would have been started by a weak release of energy and that’s the deterministic process described by Rogers, who propose that a release of post mortem gases could have interracted with a thin and uneven layer of impurities, which would have produced a visible yellowing on the fiber’ surface each time a minimum amount of « catalytic compounds » (still undetermined, but which could probably have been pretty small) would have come in contact with a mimimum amount of impurities (still undetermined, but again, which could probably have been pretty small). Because of the kind of very thin and uneven chromophore involved, this other scenario could also account theoretically for all the known characteristics of the body image on the Shroud. In our MAA paper, we mention this particular hypothesis as being another possible solution for the Shroud image formation. And after the publication of our paper in the MAA journal, I came to the conclusion that there are some good chances that, in reality, they acted together in order to produce the kind of highly discontinuous and ultra superficial image we see on the Shroud, which means that only a portion of the coated fibers that were hit by the weak energy would have been yellowed in the end, leaving the rest of the coated fibers uncolored, as well as all the non coated fibers without exception (even those who would have been hit by enough energy), thus producing a very discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area. The unpublished paper we wrote recently was intended, among other things, to propose this new alternative hypothesis. The bottom line is this : on the contrary to what some people have seem to understand, our paper has not been written to try to prove that in nature there’s only one kind of stochastic process that exist, which is triggered by a small quantity of energy that only affect a portion of the « population » submitted to that weak energy in a visible way, but to propose that, in the context of the Shroud, this sort of weak energy process can possibly explain the formation of the Shroud image. And I’m personally more convinced than ever (mainly because of the banding effect we see on the cloth and its close relationship with the image density) that if such a stochastic process really happened inside the Shroud, this can only have been in association with a color residing only in a thin and uneven layer of carbohydrate impurities located over the linen fibers, while leaving the entire structure of these fibers free of any yellowing. That’s precisely what’s at the heart of my alternative scenario… I hope this new comment of mine will finally help some people to understand better our work and note the potentially high value of the 3 scenarios we propose to explain the image formation (2 of them being included in our MAA paper)….","date":"2014-10-11","mins":"5:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"id":"comment-113698","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s a reply for Dan concerning the comments he made on top of this page (I hope this will help people understand better the heart of what I tried to expressed): What I tried to express is the FACT that Rogers proved, at least to me, that the image on the Shroud CANNOT have been produced by a high amount of energy (whatever energy you can think of) but, on the contrary, come from a very mild process involving a low amount (and probably a VERY low amount) of energy that occurred at normal temperature. Here, people MUST NOTE that this conclusion of Rogers (again, remember that he was one of the few scientist who was able to see the Shroud image up, close and personal in Turin and then, to analyze it in deep after that) has been fully accepted since by nuclear physicists like Fazio and Mandaglio in Italy who are true expert in questions related to high energetic radiations. Consequently, what I wanted to underline is the FACT that Rogers’ conclusion about the image formation on the Shroud goes TOTALLY AGAINST any image formation hypothesis involving some form of a high energetic radiation, whether it concern a burst of UV light (Jackson, Di Lazzaro, etc.), a burst of electric discharge (Fanti, De Liso, etc.), a burst of radiation (Moran, Rinaudo, etc.) or some other form of process involving a high amount of energy (like Colin Berry’s scorch hypothesis for example). Therefore, Rogers’ conclusion is able (at least to me) to completely discard any image formation hypothesis involving a by product of the Resurrection (or a manmade forgery involving a high amount of energy) and that’s why I said that Rogers was able to proved the image was not the result of a supernatural process. Of course, there is still a (very slim in my mind) possibility that this image was the result of a true miraculous process that did not involved any high energetic by product of the Resurrection (but if that would be the case, then why on earth such a miraculous image would be incomplete with some missing parts like STURP saw behind the knees or in the feet area???)… But that was not what I had in mind when I wrote that he did proved that the image was not the result of a miraculous process. You can understand now that what I had in mind was all the supernatural hypotheses that have been proposed over the years involving some form of a high energetic radiation, which are the most common hypotheses proposed by those who believe the Shroud image is directly related to the Resurrection… I hope that, now, you understand better what I tried to express in my recent email to you..","date":"2014-05-07","mins":"8:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/05/to-yannick-on-science-and-philosophy/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Yannick on Science and Philosophy"},{"id":"comment-115618","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Rogers did used ammonia during a coloring experiment and got the best matching result anyone ever had versus the Shroud image in term of color, color penetration, etc. So, I don’t think we should discard ammonia has the primary source of the image IF this is a result of a stochastic process involving FAR LESS ammonia than what Rogers thought.

Then, later on in his inquiry, he concluded that the Shroud man’s skin was most probably dry at the time of his burial and that there was probably no burial product that were present on his skin, and that’s when he favored the release of post mortem gases (including ammonia for the head region including the hair) and heavier amines for the whole body). 2 While it is a proven fact that Rogers changed his mind about the most probable “reactive agents”, it seems to me (based on this paper written in 2001), that he already had came up back then with the impurity hypothesis for the image chromophore and stay with it up until his dead. Thiis fact is very telling to me when it comes to favored the most probable hypothesis concerning the image chromophore and that’s why I favored Rogers’ hypothesis about the impurities much more than Fanti’s PCW hypothesis… 3 Based on this 2001 paper, it also seems that Rogers changed his mind concerning the exact nature of the image formation process, while he first thought of something involving a caramelization of the impurities and then, came up with the idea of a Maillard reaction, which happen at much lower temperature than what it takes to obtain a caramelization of carbohydrate impurities. 4 I think Daveb misunderstand Rogers words concerning melanoid, which doesn’t exclude the presence of ammonia as part of the global Maillard reaction. What I understand personally is this: Once he changed his mind about the most probable “reactive agents” that would have contributed to the image formation (from skin secretion and/or burial products to post mortem gases), he always kept ammonia as a possible source for the Maillard reaction, BUT ONLY for the head region (including the hair). The rest of the body image would have been formed, in Rogers mind, by heavier amines that would have been released by all the pores of the Shroud man’s skin. And, for Rogers, all those amines (including ammonia) would have taken part in the Maillard reaction that possibly occurred in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that was coating the topmost fibers of the cloth, which produce brown compounds called “melanoids” by chemists. So, the probable fact that the Shroud image “is a complex mixture of melanoids” (Rogers’ own words taken from Thibault’s paper) doesn’t exclude for one second the possibility that a certain amount of ammonia had taken part in the global image formation process. Now, the question that would be nice to determine is: in what kind of proportion did ammonia could have been part of the whole image formation process? As I said earlier, if we believe Fazio and Mandaglio’s hypothesis concerning a stochastic process, I don’t think we can discard completely the idea of an image totally produced by a very small release of ammonia from the skin and hair (which would have come from urea deposits that would have been left there after the drying of the intense sweat of the Shroud man; note that Thibault proposed this possible “alternative solution” in his paper and personally, this is the kind of solution that I consider very interesting and which deserve to be tested properly under good lab control). I also want to comment this recent quote from Anoxie: “Temperature gradients required (in order for Rogers’ hypothesis to work good) are unrealistic,” Reply: I’m not sure this is 100% sure, especially if the image came from a stochastic process, as proposed by Fazio and Mandaglio, which would have needed a much low amount of energy released than what Rogers thought. Note that Fazio and Mandaglio both concluded that a weak release of heat by the fresh tortured corpse was the most probable source for the image, while Rogers only thought heat was a “secondary” source for the image (note again that he never had a stochastic process in mind for image formation). And concerning Fazio and Mandaglio’s hypothesis, I would like to say that even if they think heat coming out of the corpse is the most logical primary cause for the image on the Shroud, they never rejected a Maillard reaction coming from post mortem gases released by the corpse as another good possibility (but at the difference that it would have happen, for them, in the context of a stochastic process, which could well have involved a much fewer amount of post mortem gas than what Rogers thought). One very interesting way to check out the validity of Fazio and Mandaglio’s stochastic hypothesis in regard of Rogers’ own hypothesis would be to take the very same kind of linen sample used by Rogers (made the ancient way) and, instead of submitting it for 10 minutes to ammonia vapor, submitting it to just 1 or 2 minutes of the same ammonia vapor and then, bake it a bit stronger than Rogers did to simulate more ageing (in the context of a latent image that would have taken decades to fully develop) and see if the coloring result could be similar to what Rogers get.","date":"2014-05-12","mins":"3:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/05/to-yannick-on-science-and-philosophy/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Yannick on Science and Philosophy"},{"id":"comment-117156","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Message for Daveb and anyone else interested by the subject of ammonia as a potential source for the image formation process. I have made a quick survey of Ray Rogers writings and here’s what I have found concerning this topic: “Image characteristics indicate that AMMONIA diffused from the nose and mouth, suggesting that the body was wrapped fairly soon after death. The body image has good resolution, suggesting that heavy amines appeared slowly at lower temperature.” (quote from “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin”). “The cloth was used to wrap a dead body. AMMONIA and other volatile amine decomposition products reacted rapidly with reducing saccharides on the cloth in Maillard reactions. The cloth was removed from the body before liquid decomposition products appeared. The color developed slowly as Maillard compounds decomposed into final colored compounds.” (quote from Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin – A Review). “Post mortem body temperatures can reach 43°C (110°F), and steep temperature gradients would exist across the cloth as a result of the low thermal diffusivity of linen and the angular dependence of radiant heat flow from a nonmetallic surface. The temperature gradients will have a large effect on Maillard reaction rates and image resolution before the body cools, i.e., while AMMONIA is the predominant amine.” (quote from “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin”). Personal note: This particular quote clearly shows that, for Rogers, ammonia was the predominant substance involved in the first stage of the image formation on the Shroud (which would have been mostly restricted to the head area), before heavier amines could takes the lead and complete the process in order to form the full body image we see on the Shroud. “Most of the very volatile AMMONIA diffuses out through the nose and mouth soon after death. This fact may explain the darker image color between the nose and mouth and penetration of image color in the vicinity of the hair.” (quote from “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin”). “The ammonia and many of the decomposition amines are volative and basic (they increase the p H into a more favorable range for Maillard reactions), and they rapidly undergo Maillard reaction with any reducing saccharides they contact. The reactions are rapid at room temperature, or even lower. Such sugar amines reactions offer a natural explanation for the color on the Shroud.” (quote from “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin”). “Experimental manipulations of concentrations and one dimensional migration of solutions (of Saponaria), as in a large cloth, could produce the same front to back color separation and color density as observed on the Shroud. The fibers on the top most surface are the most colored when observed under a microscope, and the color is a golden yellow similar to that on the Shroud. The coating of Maillard products is too thin to be resolved with a light microscope, and it is all on the outside of the fibers. There is no coloration in the medullas: The color formed without scorching the cellulose. There is very little color on fibers from the middle of the back surface. The color producing saccharides had concentrated on the evaporating surface. Water stained image areas on the Shroud showed that image color does not dissolve or migrate with water. Maillard products are not water soluble, and they do not move when wetted.” Personal note: This is the summary of the results obtained by Rogers after he did a preliminary coloration test with a “primitive type” linen sample (i.e. Made with the ancient technique used to manufacture linen cloths) that had been treated at room temperature for 10 minutes with AMMONIA vapor. As Rogers said: “A very light color could be observed on the top surface after standing 24 hours at room temperature.” But, in order to obtain a similar coloration than what is observed on the Shroud, he had to heat his sample, which indicates that such coloration would only appear after a pretty long period of time (which could possibly be counted in years). That means the image on a linen cloth that can be obtained with a Maillard reaction is a latent image that can only become fully visible a long time after the initial reactions occurred. I hope Daveb that you now understand that, in Rogers mind, ammonia probably played a partial role in the global image formation, so it would be wrong, for any serious researcher, to discard this biological product as a potential source (alone or with other substances) for the process that lead to the formation of the image on the Shroud. Note that, in Rogers’ mind, the ammonia that could have taken part in the image formation was mostly coming from the lungs out of the nose and mouth, while there is also another possibility that was mentioned in Thibault’s paper, which is that the intense sweat of the Shroud man, because of the tortures he endured, had a very high content of urea and then, after a complete drying of that sweat (which was most certainly covering every part of his body, including the hair), part of this urea would have been left there and eventually turn itself into ammonia, which would have been released by every parts of the body. This possible hypothesis has never been properly analysed by a chemist (not even Rogers!) and it would be nice if someone could do the work, while keeping in mind the conclusion of Fazio and Mandaglio in Italy, who think the image, because of its very unique characteristics, is the result of a natural stochastic process involving a dead body (note again that Rogers never thought about that possibility). I said this because, for a stochastic process of that nature, it would probably not require as much amines as Rogers thought in order to achieve the image we see on the Shroud (which would have been a latent image that would have only become fully visible after maybe a few decades). So, a good scientific inquiry would be to test the “urea left over the body and hair by the drying sweat” hypothesis in the light of the stochastic process proposed by Fazio and Mandaglio and see what could be the minimum amount of ammonia that would be required to achieve an image like we see on the Shroud and if this kind of very weak release of ammonia vapor could be able, under certain specific conditions and without the help of heavier amines or other biological substances, to produce a body image like the one we see on the Shroud. I’m pretty sure the result concerning the first question (i.e. How much ammonia would be needed to produce the kind of body image we see on the Shroud if the image formation process was stochastic in nature) would be much lower than what Rogers had in mind concerning the minimum amount of amines (including ammonia) that would be needed to produce the kind of full body image of the Shroud (of course, this is only a personal guess, but which is nevertheless based on the work of Fazio and Mandaglio)….","date":"2014-05-11","mins":"4:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/05/to-yannick-on-science-and-philosophy/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Yannick on Science and Philosophy"},{"id":"comment-118538","author":"yannick_clément","post":"There are so many possible (natural) factors that could have been at work in order to produce the image that it would be nice to see a biochemist taking the work of Rogers and others (like Fazio and Mandaglio’s work) and push this further through much more experiments than what Rogers had time to do before his death. Note that Fazio and Mandaglio’s hypothesis has never been tested Under proper lab control (not even by them!), so it’s evident that much more work needs to be done before we can see more clearly if some form of diffusion from a dead body can eventually produce the kind of image we see on the Shroud….","date":"2014-05-13","mins":"8:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/05/to-yannick-on-science-and-philosophy/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Yannick on Science and Philosophy"},{"id":"comment-115382","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s MY personal guess: Probably some biological substance left on the skin and hair by the drying sweat (like urea for example, which could have eventually produced some ammonia gases or like lactic acid) and/or some highly volatile and reactive burial product (or products), along with a probable release of heat from the fresh tortured corpse and also a possible release of water vapor, which could have contributed to a coloring reaction on parts of the Shroud that were at short distance from the corpse (less than 3.7 cm). And I must say that, on the contrary to Anoxie, I’m not ready to completely discard the possibility of a very weak release of post mortem gases by the whole corpse and, if I understand correctly Fazio and Mandaglio’s hypothesis concerning a stochastic process for image formation, I think such a very small amount of energy that could have been released by the dead body (which could well have been much lower than what Rogers thought) could well have been able to start the process of a latent image that would, some decades later, « develop » into the very faint image we can still see on the Shroud… I think such a possibility should be investigate much further by a biochemist.

The Suducees were mostly rich families well known for their Greco roman way of life. Many of them were Hellenistic Jews. The skeptics who don’t believe me just have to go there : http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/sadducees pharisees essenes.html and here’s what they’ll found about the Saducees : “The Sadducees The Sadducees were elitists who wanted to maintain the priestly caste, but they were also liberal in their willingness to incorporate Hellenism into their lives, something the Pharisees opposed. The Sadducees rejected the idea of the Oral Law and insisted on a literal interpretation of the Written Law; consequently, they did not believe in an afterlife, since it is not mentioned in the Torah. The main focus of Sadducee life was rituals associated with the Temple. The Sadducees disappeared around 70 A.D., after the destruction of the Second Temple (see below). None of the writings of the Sadducees survived, so the little we know about them comes from their Pharisaic opponents. These two “parties” served in the Great Sanhedrin, a kind of Jewish Supreme Court made up of 71 members whose responsibility was to interpret civil and religious laws.” Back to my comment : So, once you know this part of Jewish history, it’s not a surprise at all to find the sign of a pagan rite in the tomb of Caiphas, even if it was a close member of his family or even his wife. Now, if this coin would have been found in the own skull of Caiphas, that would have been another story in regard of his function as a leader of the Jews. But who knows ? He wouldn’t have been the first one in history to not doing what he preached !!!  So, to me, this finding is not a proof at all that this Pagan rite was generalized among pious Jews of the time of Christ. Was it so among Hellenistic Jews ? Now, this is another story… It’s hard to say. But, I wouldn’t be so surprise that it was not so uncommon among them. On the other hand, the fact that coins like that seemed not to have been found in great quantities in ancient jewish tombs is a sign that maybe it wasn’t a procedure so common, even for Hellenistic Jews..","date":"2011-10-25","mins":"3:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/24/use-of-coins-in-jewish-burial/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Use of Coins in Jewish Burial"},{"id":"comment-4447","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Ron, looking at the facts we know from the ancient Jewish customs, it just doesn’t fit.

You can twist it all you want in your head but the FACT is that the burial rite wasn’t completed when they left the tomb in a hurry on friday night. In this context, how in the world would people thought of putting pagan coins over the eyes ?

He saw the Shroud in person in Turin in 1933 and saw it in a public showing outside the cathedral. With the sunlight, he automatically recognized authentic blood stains. Later, he made a lot of researches with the photos of Enrie (from 1931) and was totally convinced that it was real blood stains. Later, history proved that he was completely right ! Adler, Heller, Baima Bollone, Zugibe, Bucklin, etc. All those medical and blood experts were convinced that it was real blood stains. Adler and Heller made chemical test that proved that the blood stains contains real blood material coming from real blood (from a human or an ape – their tests couldn’t be more precise). The same year, those results were confirmed by Baima Bollone own chemical research (he was even able to specified that the blood was clearly human). And later on, there was even some DNA tests on blood samples coming from the Shroud proving once more that the blood is human and even male. So, all those data make it clear that the blood stains on the Shroud are real blood stains and that it is human.

And it’s a good thing that you approach this subject (the authenticity of the Shroud) with a critical view. But, I just want to remind you of one particular aspect of the question that have really been confirmed independently over the years and that’s one of the most critical aspect of the question : the blood issue. I don’t think any serious person today still deny that there is real blood stains on this cloth and that those stains were formed by the direct contact of a corpse with the Shroud. Those points have been proved by many independent medical experts over the years. Taking that for granted (because it is 100% sure), just come back to my first comment on this page regarding the crown of thorns. In all the history, there’s only one person that have been tortured that way and it’s Jesus of Nazareth. From my perspective, if the Shroud is a genuine burial Shroud, I just can’t see it belonging to someone else. I really think the most compelling evidence that exist to say that this Shroud is the one of Jesus reside in the blood stains and particularly the blood stains in the forehead and head region (coming from something like a crown of thorns; a cap of thorns would be more accurate). And notice one thing : This blood aspect is ALWAYS the big problem for the ones who proposed an hypothesis involving a forger ! Nobody has ever been able to reproduce those blood stains. No one has ever come close ! In fact, many of them have not even tried ! The best example of this is Garlaschelli ! Why is it that way ? Simply because those blood stains are real and have not been made by a forger or an artist. And that’s precisely why all those “Shroud debunkers” don’t want the Shroud to be a real burial Shroud !!! Why ? Because if it is so, they know that the only person who can pretend to have been wrapped in it is Jesus Christ ! It’s true ! If the blood are real, then who else could have been put into a Shroud with all the stigmata of Christ (including the cap of thorns) and that his Shroud would have been preserved until this day ?

Even in the “disciples has stolen the corpse” scenario, keeping this bloody shroud doesn’t make any sense at all.

Other than that, effectively, the man of the Shroud could well be anybody for all we know. After all, Jesus is not the only one to have been beaten, scourged and crucified by the Romans. But the crowning of thorns fit only for him (for all we know historically). Some might also say that the wound in the side is not typical of a normal Roman crucifixion and that this could be taken as another clue to say that the man of the Shroud is really Jesus, but, personally, I would be real prudent here because, in the context of the Jewish laws and traditions, this procedure could have been applied to other crucified victims to accelerate their death. We know that the Jews didn’t want the victims to be left on the cross for days, especially if there was a feast or the Sabbath coming.

I think these 2 lines of thinking are just simply false. Completely false. Sadly, many people interested in the Shroud these days really seems to think that way. I really have a sense that many “shroudies” out there have some fears that if the image on the cloth would be proven one day by science to be the natural product of a biological interraction between a corpse and the cloth that this would mean Jesus has never resurrected… Here, I want to be clear : THIS KIND OF THINKING THAT MAKES SUCH A BAD LINK IS JUST WRONG ! Totally wrong. The Resurrection and the Shroud are 2 very different things and the authenticity of one of these 2 things should never depend on the authenticity of the other. Final note : The way I understand the Shroud is no different than many ancient Shroud researchers like Vignon, Barbet, Legrand in France and some others after that who were all Christian believers but who never accepted the idea that the image on the cloth could have come from a so called “by product” of the Resurrection or from a direct act of God. I guess there are still some modern Shroud researchers who still think like us, but sadly, I really think they are RARE. Most of today’s Shroud researchers always seems to have the Hollywood concept of the Resurrection in the back of their mind when they study this relic and this makes me sick, because if they really were honest in their science, they would NEVER leaves the door open for that kind of supernatural scenario when they do their researches about the Shroud.

But I’m prudent. VERY PRUDENT ! So Dave, if you want to focus on a real miraculous image, why don’t you start looking at the Guadalupe Tilma ? From what I’ve read so far about this mysterious object, I have no difficulty to believe this is a real miraculous image that come from another world (i.e. The spiritual world). And believe me, I’m serious here. As a Christian, by focusing on the miraculous aspect of this image of Mary instead of the Shroud, I truly think you would have far less chances to be disappointed by science one day… I have studied every important and solid facts and observation coming from the Shroud and I found nothing that can make me believe for one second that this incomplete and slightly distorted image of a dead man could have been formed because of the Resurrection of Christ. A miracle to me is something that goes beyond the known laws of natures (note that this is very different than something that still wait for a complete explanation) and in the present state of our knowledge, I don’t see why scientist should follow that path for the Shroud. Now, for the Tilma, this is another story… Seriously, this image of Mary defy the known laws of nature and to me, this is the signal I need to open my mind to the possibility of a divine intervention. Again, when I consider all the known solid data coming from the Shroud (I’m not talking about the supposed images of coins and flowers here), there’s nothing in this corpus that can make me think that science one day will not be able to properly explain the image formation process that lead to the body image we can see on the cloth. You have to understand that so far in history, there were only one preliminary scientific study of the relic done in 1973 and another much more extended one done in 1978 and that’s all !!! This is not very much to fully explain a complex relic like the Shroud of Turin. That’s why I’m very confident that if a new and proper series of direct researches could be allowed by the Vatican, this will certainly help science to get very close to the complete truth about this cloth. In fact, the only door I left open concerning an aspect of the Shroud that can be directly related to the Resurrection event, is the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains on the cloth. But as I often said, this is just a sign of the Resurrection and should never be considered as a proof of this event. In fact, I truly think that more testing should be done concerning the transfer of exudates of blood clots from the skin of a corpse to a linen cloth in order to see if Barbet was right when he said that this unusual aspect of the bloodstains on the cloth was unexplainable scientifically. Note that even Barbet was able to stay open minded about that by saying that we can’t predict future and maybe this aspect too could well be scientifically and rationally explained one day… More research need to be done about this most intriguing aspect of the Shroud..","date":"2012-11-09","mins":"5:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/07/you-shroudies-and-your-fallacious-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"You shroudies and your fallacious thinking"},{"id":"comment-19000","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Clearly Dave, I see that you’re interested in the Shroud for his potentially (even if it unlikely) miraculous side !

Yes I agree that the Shroud and his image is truly unique and exceptional, but I don’t see any good reason to take this fact as a basis to believe it is miraculous !!! As I said, there’s a very important difference between something that goes well beyond the known laws of natures (like the reality of the piece of human heart and blood from the miracle of Lanciano in Italy or the unexplainable image of the Guadalupe Tilma – 2 “mysterious” objects that have been examined by science and that undoubtly defies the known laws of nature) and something like the Shroud and his body image, which is only (for the moment at least) considered by science as an object that his unexplained YET. The first category can easily be seen by a faithful as something coming from a real miraculous event while it should not be the same for the second category in which the Shroud belongs. Effectively, on one side, you got some miraculous objects that science CANNOT explain with the known laws of nature (like the Tilma for example) and on the other side, you got an object like the Shroud which doesn’t possess any feature that science could really considered as being impossible to explain with the known laws of nature but only as being waiting for a proper explanation. I think it is very important to make this kind of nuance before claiming that something (like the Shroud for example) might be miraculous… So far, there are some very interesting natural hypotheses that exist to explain all the most “intriguing” features coming from the Shroud. For example, the extreme superficialityt of the body image can well be simply due to a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities residing on the top surface of the cloth (on both sides). And here’s another example : If the image really comes from some kind of biological interraction between a corpse and the cloth, how can the resulting image could be something else than a negative image ? The simple hypothesis that the image comes from some kind of a natural and biological interraction like this allow us to explain very well this particular aspect of the image. And it’s the same thing for the 3 D information encoded in the image, which is certainly the feature that is the harder to explain scientifically. But nevertheless, the simple FACT that nature can created natural images of plants and flowers with this kind of 3 D information (see slides 19 and 20 on this page: http://www.gizapyramid.com/LECTURE SHROUD3.htm) is enough to understand that this kind of information in an image CAN be naturally encoded without the need of any miraculous event. So far, I’m not aware of even one single feature from the Shroud that science has really “tag” as “impossible to explain”, except for the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains, which cannot be seen as something related to the formation of the body image and also cannot be seen as a direct result of a miracle, but only as some kind of a “collateral outcome” of a possible miraculous event (i.e. The “spiritualization” or the “dematerialization” of Jesus body at the moment of the Resurrection). Because of this lack of features versus the Shroud that would undoubtly surpass some known laws of nature (which is totally different than the reality of the Tilma and the Lanciano miracle, which truly possessed some characteristics that completely defies some known laws of nature), I think it’s much too soon and even pretentious and unscientific to consider very seriously the possibility that the image on this relic might be miraculous (i.e. Having been formed by a process that would be consider as being supernatural in the context of a dead body being enshrouded in a burial cloth)… In my paper about the evidence of the bloodstains, I admit I have left that possibility open in my list of possible scenarios that could explain the Shroud, but I only did it to stay the more honest intellectually I could versus the very particular nature of the cloth (directly associated with the Passion and death of Christ), while at the same time considering this particular scenario as being extremely unlikely in the light of all the data and observation we know about the Shroud..","date":"2012-11-11","mins":"8:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/07/you-shroudies-and-your-fallacious-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"You shroudies and your fallacious thinking"},{"id":"comment-18870","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Precision: Of course, when I say that I truly think the image has been formed naturally, I refers to a biological interraction between the body of Jesus and the thin layer of impurities located at the surface of this antique burial Shroud..","date":"2012-11-07","mins":"11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/07/you-shroudies-and-your-fallacious-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"You shroudies and your fallacious thinking"},{"id":"comment-19007","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Calm down Dave.

I’m glad you refer to my paper because I truly think, like any credible medical expert who have examine the shroud, that the evidence coming from the blood and serum stains on the cloth is well enough (no matter what some might think) to understand that if there was a forgery in the case of the Shroud, it could ONLY have been created by someone who used a real scourged and crucified corpse to do so. And since there are so many aspects of the Shroud that are very far away from the artistic trends of the medieval period (like the cap of thorns, the nails in the wrist area, the scourge marks all over the body and not only on the back side of the body but on the front side too, etc.), in my mind, the only possible forgery scenario (note that it’s only a slim possibility and surely not the most probable scenario) would be to think that this was done by someone who had seen legal Roman scourging and crucifixion with his own eyes, that he knew very well all the aspects of it and that he was so much a perfectionist and fanatical that he dared to take an unwilling victim and did to him all the tortures we found in the Gospels (including the way of the cross). But even such a scenario got a major problem in my mind: why this hypothetical forger would have wanted to perform such an intense scourging on his victim while there is absolutely no precise description in the Gospels about the severity of this torture in Jesus case? Why he would have taken the risk to kill his victim before his crucifixion, while obviously, this would have been the most important part of his forgery? Don’t make any sense at all. And to me, along with the evidence of the wearing of a crown of thorns, the very high intensity of the scourging of the Shroud man is probably the most important aspect of the Shroud that lead to one conclusion: this man was surely Jesus! Effectively, since it was very important for the Romans, when they sentenced someone to be executed by crucifixion, that the condemned person died on the cross and not before (this fact is reported in Barbet’s book), we have to assume that, normally, the scourging of an average victim of crucifixion was far from being as severe as the one endured by the Shroud man, for the simple and good reason that the authorities didn’t want the victim to die before being nailed on the cross. In fact, the main purpose (maybe the only one) of the legal scourging that was done by the Roman prior to a standard crucifixion was to remove the strength of the condemned person so that he could not offer any resistance no more on his way to the cross and during the procedure of nailing. In that regard, we must assume that the kind of very severe scourging endured by the Shroud man was very exceptional when this was done inside the standard procedure used by the Romans for a legal crucifixion… And guess what? Such a severe scourging fits very well with St John’s account (who was probably the only eye witness of all the 4 evangelists) that the scourging of Jesus was not done in the context of his crucifixion but, instead, it was done as a separate form of punishment, BEFORE Pilatus finally ordained his crucifixion. In such a context, it is much easier to assume that this kind of independent scourging sentence was done much more brutally than a standard scourging done prior to a crucifixion, because those who did the dirty job didn’t know at the time that Jesus would end up on the cross… In this very particular context, and on the contrary of a scourging done before a standard crucifixion, the soldiers were not afraid that he could die fast after the scourging, since it was surely not something prohibited by the Roman legal system (on the contrary to a crucifixion where the victim had to die on the cross and not before). In sum, the conjuncture created by the crown of thorns and the very severe scourging endured by the Shroud man (along also with some other things that I didn’t describe here like the piece of evidence coming from the aragonite dirt found on the cloth, etc.) is enough for me to put a very serious doubt over the “natural” forgery scenario that I described in my paper concerning the evidence of the bloodstains as being one possible scenario that could explain the Shroud. The odds against such a scenario are so high that it’s much easier to believe the Shroud is really the genuine Shroud of Christ..","date":"2013-01-31","mins":"5:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/31/how-could-a-medieval-mind-create-an-image-such-as-the-one-on-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"How could a medieval mind create an image such as the one on the shroud?"},{"id":"comment-23272","author":"yannick_clément","post":"And to all of you, here’s another strong argument of mine against the idea that the Shroud could have been created (during medieval time or before) by someone who used the body of an unwilling victim in order to produce his false relic of Christ : The very particular nature of the vast majority of the bloodstains on the cloth! Effectively, Al Adler’s analyses of the blood samples from the Shroud have confirmed Pierre Barbet’s hypothesis that most of the bloodstains on the cloth came from moistened (or more probably re moistened blood clots instead of coming from blood in liquid form), which clearly indicates that the Shroud man was already dead for quite some time (which could well be more than a few hours) when his corpse came in contact with the Shroud. This reality is very inconsistent with the idea that someone would have wanted to create a false relic of Jesus’ Passion while using the scourged and crucified body of an unwilling victim, since, in all logic, that person (or persons) would never have wanted to wait a long time after his death before placing his dead body inside the Shroud. Why we must think that way? Simply because the more this supposed forger (or forgers) would have wait before placing the corpse in the cloth, the higher was the risk that the blood clots would have been too dry to produced a good imprint of all the major wounds on the cloth! And in the context of a “natural” forgery done with the body of a real crucified victim, we must believe that the reproduction of all the bloody stigmata of Christ on the cloth would have been one if not the major aspect of the forger’s plan. In such a context, we would expect the Shroud to show bloodstains that come from still fresh wounds, which is absolutely not the case (except for some post mortem blood flows from the feet and the post mortem blood flows coming from the side wound). In sum, the particular nature of the vast majority of the bloodstains on the Shroud clearly indicates that there was a pretty long delay between the death of the Shroud man and the deposit of his corpse inside the Shroud (a delay of possibly a few hours), which is totally inconsistent with the idea that this relic would have been “naturally” created by someone using the real scourged and crucified body of an unwilling victim… On the contrary, in such a forgery scenario, we would expect to see some evidences of a very short delay of time between the death of the victim and the deposit of his body inside the cloth, which doesn’t appear to be the case for the Shroud.

To answer this question properly, I think we must rely again on the conjuncture of the puncture wounds in the head area (coming most probably from the wearing of a cap of thorns covering all the head) and the very high number of scourge marks all over the body of the Shroud man (indicating that the Shroud man suffered a very severe scourging). Effectively, even though it’s impossible to conclude that no other crucified victim could have been crowned with a cap of sharp objects by the Romans (especially in the case of rebellious leaders or self proclaimed Messiahs), it’s easy to assume that such a torture was extremely rare. Here, it’s important to note that there is no known ancient manuscript that clearly described a torture of that nature in the case of another crucified victim other than Jesus of Nazareth. And concerning the very severe scourging endured by the Shroud man, which must be considered as being very unusual for a crucifixion victim, I encourage you to read again my first comment (comment #2) that you can find on this same page. And along with these 2 crucial elements, there are all these other problematic features coming from the Shroud that we can add to our analysis: 1 The presence of a side wound that comes most probably from a lance stab in the chest area that was done after the death of the Shroud man, which was probably not part of the procedure used by the Romans during a standard crucifixion, especially in Palestine where the breaking of the legs to accelerate death was the common practice to “finish the job”. Note that the fact that there is no sign that the Shroud man had his legs broken cannot be taken, alone, as a highly problematic feature concerning the scenario involving the burial cloth of an anonymous person who was tortured like Jesus because we must assume that some other crucified victims could have died on the cross in the same manner (especially those who died faster than normal), but when we consider it along all the other problematic features, it can be seen as one more confirmation that the Shroud man is most probably Jesus of Nazareth, especially in the light of some pieces of evidence (like the the general anthropometric and physiognominic characteristics of the Shroud man, some particularities of the cloth itself or the very particular chemical signature of the aragonite dirt found on the cloth), which suggest that the Shroud man was most probably a Jew who was crucified in Palestine during the Roman occupation. 2 The man of the Shroud had the privilege to be buried in a high quality linen shroud (most probably in a family tomb), which is far from having been part of the procedure used by the Romans after a standard crucifixion. For example, some specialists of the second temple period like Daube have indicated that the normal procedure in Palestine at the time of Christ was to buried all the crucified victims in a common grave and only after a full year, the authorities could allowed the family to collect the bones in order to place them in a ossuary and buried them in a family tomb. 3 When we put together the fact that no traces of any known ancient burial products have been found on the Shroud by the STURP team and also the fact that the corpse has not been washed before being enveloped in the Shroud, we can conclude that the burial of the Shroud man was incomplete. This point is still debated, but personally, I think this is where the data leads us. And if this is correct, then it is a very problematic feature coming from the Shroud. Effectively, after having said that the Shroud man received the very unusual privilege to be buried inside a high quality linen shroud (most probably in a family tomb), it is very strange to note that his burial really seem to have been done in a great haste. This feature fit very well with the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ burial, which was done just before the beginning of the Sabbath and the Passover feast, but the probability that another person could have been buried that way, after receiving from the Roman authorities such a privilege, must be considered as being extremely low. 4 The data coming from the Shroud indicates that the corpse must have stayed inside the cloth for a short period of time that goes from approximately 24 to 72 hours. Again, such a feature would fit very well with the Gospel accounts for Jesus, but the probability that this can be related to another person as to be estimated as extremely low. 5 Never mind the fact that the Shroud is a blood stained burial cloth that has covered a corpse for a time, it was kept and well preserved until this day. As Barrie Schwortz’ mother once said to him: “If the Shroud would not belong to Jesus, they would not have kept it for 2000 years! This is a burial shroud. It’s supposed to be kept in a tomb…” This is a very clever comment from an old Jewish lady! Effectively, whether the Shroud man was buried in Palestine or in any other parts of the Roman Empire during Antiquity (I think there are enough data So, when we take into account all these problematic features together, we have to conclude that it is extremely unlikely that the Shroud can really be the burial cloth of an anonymous man who would have been tortured in the same way than Jesus of Nazareth, as reported by the Gospels. In conclusion, for all the reasons I have exposed here in this comment and also in the previous ones you can read on this page, I think it fair and clever to consider the first two scenarios that I have described in my paper about the evidence of the bloodstains (here’s the link for that paper: http://shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf) as being both extremely unlikely. Also, I think it’s very important to mention another potentially very problematic feature of the Shroud regarding these first two scenarios involving another person than Jesus of Nazareth and that have been described by Paul Vignon, Pierre Barbet and Antoine Legrand during the first half of the 20th century (and that have since been accepted by author medical specialists who have also studied the Shroud, like Baima Bollone and some others): it is related to the “potential fact” that the “extraction” of the dead body out of the shroud before it start to corrupt there was done in such a way that it doesn’t seem to have disturbed the bloodstains or broken the linen fibrils under them. Note that I have used the term “potential fact” regarding this feature because I think it’s fair to say that such a feature still need to be scientifically confirmed properly because I’m not aware of any solid conclusion about that which would be based on solid data and observations and which would have been published in a peer reviewed journal… One thing’s for sure: If a microscopic examination of the bloodstains (and particularly of the state of the linen fibers underneath them) could scientifically confirm the observation made by Vignon, Barbet and Legrand, this would be a highly problematic feature for the two scenarios I described that involved another man than Jesus. That’s why I think this particular kind of close examination of the bloodstains and the fibers located underneath should be absolutely included in the scientific protocol that would be built if a new series of direct tests on the relic would be allowed by the Vatican. But never mind this last feature that still need to be properly confirmed, that doesn’t change a thing about the fact that there are too many features attached to the Shroud that would be very problematic in the case this cloth would be a false relic done with the use of a real tortured and crucified body or if it would be the shroud of an anonymous victim of a Roman crucifixion. I really think the reflections and argumentation I’ve made here on this page during the last few days are solid enough to conclude that there’s only one scenario that can pretend to rationally explain all the features coming from the Shroud and it involves the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth! For me, this is a pure elimination process: Since it is a proven fact that the Shroud cannot be the work of an artist and since it is a proven fact that the Shroud is really an authentic burial cloth of a real crucified man who was tortured like the Jesus of the Gospels and since the probability is extremely low (near absolute zero) for this cloth to be the one of an unwilling victim of a “natural” forgery and since the probability is also extremely low (near absolute zero) for this cloth to be the one of an anonymous crucified man who endured the same kinds of tortures than Jesus, all I’m left with is the idea that this cloth is really the authentic burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. Sorry for the skeptics and the defenders of the accuracy of the C14 dating of 1988, but there is no other rational possibility than this one. All the others are shown to be extremely weak when you consider all the available data and observations concerning the Shroud and his image. I hope the personal reflection I have exposed on this page in numerous comments have been able to convince you of that reality… This is where I stand right now in my reflection about the identity of the Shroud man. And right now, you can be certain that I’ll leave the question of whether the body image came from a natural process or not on the side, because after many debate on this blog, I have understand that this is a deaf debate that goes nowhere since it’s virtually impossible to change another person’s opinion about that once his mind has been set. And since it’s impossible to completely reject the possibility that this body image of a crucified man who can well be Jesus of Nazareth could be related to his Resurrection, I think such a debate will still be a waste of time in the future, even in the case where some scientists would be able to find a completely natural and reproducible explanation for the formation of this image. In sum, the only way we could settle this debate for good would be, for science, to find an definitive proof that this cloth cannot be the one of Jesus of Nazareth and, honestly, because of the long reflection and argumentation I’ve exposed here on this page, I’m very confident that this hypothetical day will never come. Additional note: In his 1983 paper about the Shroud’s authenticity, the archaeologist William Meacham mention one more alternative scenario that imply the preservation of the burial cloth of a willing martyr of the late 3rd or 4th century A.D. Who would have wanted to do a close and complete imitation of Jesus’ Passion and death. Even if such a scenario would explain many features we see on the Shroud, it’s important to note that there are still some features about the Shroud that doesn’t seem to fit well with it, which are: 1 The very violent scourging endured by the Shroud man, which could have killed him before he could be crucified. 2 The data coming from the Shroud indicates that the corpse must have stayed inside the cloth for a short period of time that goes from approximately 24 to 72 hours, which is very hard to explain in the context of an imitation of Jesus’ Passion and death, except if we believe that the followers of this willing martyr would have wanted to reproduce also the finding of the empty tomb and the empty burial cloths. But even then, that wouldn’t explain why they would have wanted to keep such a gruesome grave cloth, which is another very problematic aspect of the Shroud regarding this particular scenario. 3 This willing martyr and his collaborators would have been able to do all the tortures and crucifixion so much in secret that their gruesome reproduction of Jesus’ Passion and death never became publicly known, which is very hard to believe because such a plan would have probably needed to be done in open air, at least for the crucifixion. Also, the fact that such a plan would have needed the participation of many persons makes it hard to believe that they would not have wanted to talk about publicly about in order to emphasize the courage and valor of the martyr who was able to imitate Christ so well. 4 The exact reproduction of the Passion, death and burial of Christ by this willing martyr would have been a unique case in all the history of Christianity and would never has been documented in any known ancient manuscript, even though his burial cloth would have been kept very soon after his death and well preserved until this day. 5 This willing Christian martyr would have been totally naked during his scourging and crucifixion and finally, his corpse would have been kept that way for his burial, which is somewhat problematic in the context of a close reproduction of the burial of Christ. In other words, as a sign of respect toward Christ, it’s very hard to imagine that the group of followers would not have put a modesty cloth to at least cover the buttocks of their imitator of Jesus.

Here’s an advice for you Louis: If you really seek a true miraculous imprint, I think you would be better served with the Guadalupe Tilma and that’s not a joke from me.

This difference is this: On the contrary to the Shroud of Turin, the Guadalupe Tilma CANNOT BE the result of some natural process still undetermined! That’s why, in the case of the Shroud, things are much complicated… As I often said before, in the case of the Shroud, there are no data that exist right now that can be seen as defying so much the known laws of nature that it can discard the idea that the image can really be the result of one or more natural process(es). This is not the case for the Tilma who can only be an artistic forgery or a miraculous imprint, period. This image cannot be anything else… Here, there’s no middle ground, it’s one possibility or the other, which is totally unlike what goes on for the Shroud. This is truly a HUGE difference that can (and must) be acknowledged by everyone! And because, so far, the few scientific inquiries regarding the Tilma have come out empty of any rational and scientific explanation, that’s why I have no difficulty to believe that such an imprint is truly miraculous in nature. Again, we must understand (and this is also true for the partisan of the supernatural and the skeptics) that, in the case of the Shroud, such a statement can’t be made (if we really want to stay scientifically sound) because there is still a true possibility that the image is the result of some natural interaction between the cloth and the corpse it covered. In that sense, one must be very prudent before claiming this image cannot be anything else than a by product of the Resurrection of Christ, since science has been able to conclude that it cannot be the product of an artistic forgery… That’s why I dare again to say to the skeptics and, particularly, to the strong defenders of an image that would be the result of a supernatural process: LET’S NOT FORGET THE TRUE POSSIBILITY OF AN IMAGE COMING FROM A NATURAL PROCESS. After all, before he resurrect on Sunday morning, Jesus body was dead like any other victim of a Roman crucifixion and it’s fun to note that this is exactly what we see on the Shroud! People constantly tend to forget that the body image on the Shroud is not the image of a glorious body of light but it is the gruesome image of a dead and tortured Jesus. In fact, it is the image of the body described by the Evangelists on Good Friday, not the image of the body they later described on Easter morning. So, in that context, and keeping in mind that this image cannot be the work of an artistic forger, why not thinking that such an image of a dead man could (I don’t say “must”, I say “could”) have come from an interaction between his dead body and the surface of the cloth? To me, , unlike the Tilma, which cannot at all be rationally considered as being the product of a natural process of any kind, there is still a very good probability that such a natural scenario regarding the Shroud can be true. Of course, more researches are truly needed for the Shroud and for the Tilma to get closer to a definitive answer on the nature of both images. Now, concerning the Shroud, as I often said, if Ray Rogers hypothesis concerning the chromophore (i.e. An image ONLY residing in a thin layer of impurities, some of which, like the pectin deposits found by Adler, that were “extracted” from the primary cell wall of the linen fiber during the retting process of the flax plant) is correct and if there really is a second superficial image of the hair, beard and mustache on the backside of the Shroud that would be identical in nature to the image visible on the front side, then I think a natural hypothesis to explain the Shroud would have to be considered as being much more plausible than any supernatural one, including the ones defended at all cost presently by Jackson, Fanti, Di Lazzaro and many others “true believers” of the Resurrection of Christ… And if this happen one day, then I hope it will finally force people to rethink the Shroud in order to see more clearly what’s really there, i.e. An image of a dead man!.","date":"2013-02-06","mins":"9:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/31/how-could-a-medieval-mind-create-an-image-such-as-the-one-on-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"How could a medieval mind create an image such as the one on the shroud?"},{"id":"comment-23154","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Message for Paul and Andy: You’re right when it concern an artistic forgery.

But as I also said, this scenario is so improbable that it’s much easier to assume that the Shroud is really the authentic burial cloth of Jesus. The probability for that last scenario to be true is much higher than the previous one and I must also say that it is highly unlikely that someone from the 4th century had enough “balls” to produce a gruesome, bloody and crude (Jesus is nude!) relic like the Shroud by using a real human body.

Scientifically speaking, nobody (especially those who see the Shroud has a “proof” (SIC) of the Resurrection) has the right to reject the possibility that the image on the cloth can strictly come from a natural interraction between the corpse and the surface of the cloth. I said it often on this blog and I’ll say it again: There’s absolutely nothing in all the known data from the Shroud that can allow us to reject such a natural possibility. Of course, since we talk about the probable Shroud of Christ, the Resurrection is always near and anyone can believe what you believe (that the image came directly from this miraculous event). Look… Even me, in the paper I wrote about the evidence of the bloodstains (and which was published in the December issue of the BSTS Newsletter), has left that door open as a “possibility” because of the name that is associated with the cloth.

Except maybe some other small linen cloths that could have contained aloes and myrrh in powder to avoid bad smelling and delayed a bit the decaying of the corpse(on this particular subject, I really recommand anyone to read the wonderful book of doctor Pierre Barbet called “A doctor at calvary”). The presence in the shroud of matters like aloes and myrrh is logical in the context of a partial rite that needed to be completed on sunday morning… But, it’s just an hypothesis. The only thing we can be sure that was inside the shroud was a dead body !!!.","date":"2011-10-21","mins":"1:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/21/there-is-an-image-of-a-flying-saucer-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"There is an Image of a Flying Saucer on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4241","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If you read carefully my first reflexion about this, I stated clearly that there’s is a possibility (even if I have great doubts to say at least) that those images (specially the flowers) could be really there. But, my point is this : Even if science prove one day that those images are there, that will never tell us WHEN they get there ! And if we go back to the context of the Jesus burial, it is pretty sure that those flowers would have been put on the Shroud at a later time and consequently, they have nothing to do with the burial of Christ. Honestly, would you put flowers on a dead body inside a shroud BEFORE the ending of the burial ritual and knowing that you have to comeback to the tomb in 2 days to do an anointing of the body ??? Seriously… I don’t see any reason at all to do a thing like that. So, if there is really some flower images on the Shroud, they were transfered to the cloth well AFTER the body image formation process and having nothing to do with Jesus burial… They just don’t make any sense at all in the case of an hurried kind of incomplete burial ritual on friday… And anyway, where is the exact reference to this kind of flower throwing on a dead body in the context of a first century jewish burial ??? I’VE NEVER seen anything at all about this. I think it’s a modern way to think… It’s not because we used flowers at our burial ceremonies that the first century jews did the same !!!!

I totally agree with your point #2. For your point #1, I’m not so sure about that because Golgotha was just a big rock. I have great doubts about the fact that there was really flowers there. Also, you have to think that those flowers, to be soaked with blood, would have been just underneat the cross… Personally, I’m really not sure about this idea. For your point #3, I think that if there was some object covered with Jesus blood, the jews who took part of the burial would have wanted them to be buried with the corpse. It is true for clothing and thing like that. But flowers ? I’m not sure. Someone must find me a clear quote of this kind of use from the Talmud or from the Mishna before I believe in this. But, even if it was proven that the Jews took even the flowers that were soak with the blood of the dead to buried them with the body, I don’t see why they would have put those flowers or anything else soaked in blood inside the shroud before the end of the ritual on sunday. As I said, I think they could easily left them in another part of the tomb. I don’t want to bring this too far (because I have another interpretation) but some people (like Mark Guscin) have interpreted the empty tomb story of the gospel of John by thinking that the sudarium of Oviedo was left in another place inside the tomb. Obviously, if it’s true, this blood stained cloth wasn’t left inside the shroud on friday… Most probably, it was left in one corner inside the tomb. So why would that have been different for flowers, coins or any other objects ???.","date":"2011-10-22","mins":"10:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/21/there-is-an-image-of-a-flying-saucer-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"There is an Image of a Flying Saucer on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4283","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Or when we really want to see what we want to see… ; ).","date":"2011-10-24","mins":"11:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/21/there-is-an-image-of-a-flying-saucer-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"There is an Image of a Flying Saucer on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-5622","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I really appreciate the comment of Maria about the fact that if the Shroud was done in the Middle ages by a fanatic who wanted to reproduced the Passion of Christ in order to produce a relic (what a crazy idea, but it’s there’s very a slim possibility there anyway that we can’t disregard completely), then you can bet your house that the images we see on the Shroud would have been very different. In the Middle ages, nobody knew that the Roman drove the nails in the wrist instead of in the palms. This fact alone is enough to understand that the Shroud came from the Antiquity instead of the Middle ages. And there’s also the very particular and typical wounds (with dumbell shapes) that came from a Roman flagrum that nobody in the Middel ages would have been aware of. I can keep on with others facts like that for a long time.

Of course, we will never be certain of that, but that’s truly one interesting scenario. Those bags would have been placed on the dorsal part of the cloth (the one which was laid on the stone bench of the tomb) all around the body (in direct contact with it or very very close to it) and finally, the other part of the Shroud would have been folded over the top of the body and over the bags, which would have created a good space between the Shroud and the sides of the body and the top of the head. This would have been enough to prevent the formation of an image in those areas.

Note that such a particularity of the image is totally compatible with a natural and pretty mild interaction between the heat and/or the vapors (water vapors, ammonia, etc.) coming from a recent dead body and a linen cloth, especially when consider the fact that this image is discontinuous at fiber level (this can be understand as a stochastic effect). Since the last update of Shroud.com, we have the pleasure to be able to read the first few issues of the excellent publication called Shroud Spectrum International. In the #4 issue (September 1982), there is a pretty good summary article written by Robert Dinegar concerning the STURP team work of 1978. Here’s the link: http://shroud.com/pdfs/ssi04part3.pdf Now, if you go to page 7 of that paper (which is in reality page 6 of the PDF version), here’s the excellent description of that particular characteristic of the image made by Dinegar: “The image is best (most vividly) seen at a distance. It fades as the observer approaches and is difficult to locate under magnification. THERE IS NOTHING MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THIS PROPERTY; IT IS A WELL KNOWN PHENOMENON. In diffuse image situations, the human eye discriminates better when more area of the image can be seen at one time.” I think Dinegar’s quote says it all and nothing else need to be added here.

Effectively, since we believe in the Incarnation of God (at least, we should, but I seriously doubt that many Catholics really believe this), that means God has showed his face and from then on, we can make images of Jesus how many times we wants and the image on the Shroud, if it is truly the one of Jesus as I think, is no exception. And it’s even more allright since it is not an artistic image created by the imagination of an artist but an true image of Jesus made most probably by the natural laws created by God himself! In sum, there’s absolutely no violation of commandment regarding any image of Christ. And here’s an important point: In Jesus time, the image on the Shroud would not have been considered as a violation of the second commandment for a pious Jew since it would only have been for him the image of a man and not the image of God… Only Christians eventually started to believe Jesus was God incarnated in our humanity and it takes a pretty long period of time before they started to really believe this truth. Of course, for a pious Jew of Jesus time, the image on the Shroud would have been considered scandalous because it shows the naked body of a man (and a crucified man at that!) and also because it is completely gruesome, but it would not have been considered a violation of the second commandment since no Jews of ancient time would have think for one second that this would be a representation of God….","date":"2013-08-05","mins":"4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/05/why-would-jesus-defy-the-2nd-commandment-and-create-a-graven-image-unto-himself/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why would Jesus defy the 2nd commandment and create a \"graven image\" unto himself?"},{"id":"comment-18151","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I agree to some extent concerning the principle that making experiments can help to understand some phenomenon but this has already been done by Jackson and other members of the STURP team who tested in real time the effects of scorch on linen and came out 100% convinced that the body image on the Shroud WAS NOT created by heat and this is normal since this image come from a most probable natural and chemical interraction between a dead body that has been severily tortured just before dying on the cross (remember the very high level of bilirubin folks because this can potentially be important in order to understand the nature of the image and to eventually solve the mystery) and a linen burial cloth that was most probably covered on his surface with a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities… In that context, how in the world a corpse like that could generated enough heat to colored the top surface of the cloth ?
