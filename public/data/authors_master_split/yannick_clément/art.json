In fact, I was aware of this very different depiction of Christ done AFTER the one that represent the Pantocrator image of Christ, but I completely forgot to mention it… The fact that after the Pantocrator Christ coins, there were another sort of depiction of Christ on coins minted under the reign of Justinian II is a confirmation that the comment of yesterday (https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based on the shroud of turin justinian ii solidus has face of christ with skewed nose and unbalanced hair length/#comment 18030) was totally correct, i.e. That the depictions of a bearded Christ with long hair that we found on some coins of Justinian II NEVER represented the facial image that we see on the Shroud but instead, they were representing the Pantocrator icon of Christ, which is an artistic tradition that appeared around 500 A.D. And that was most probably influenced (directly or not) by the facial image on the Shroud. In other words, the Pantocrator Christ coins of Justinian II were influenced directly by the Pantocrator icons of Christ, which were most probably influenced (directly or not) by the facial image on the Shroud. This is the most probable reality versus these coins of Justinian II that represented not the Shroud but the Pantocrator icons, which were very popular in the Byzantine world. And this high level of popularity can easily explain why the emperor wanted to mint some coins with this particular depiction of Christ. And the bottom line is this : Making wild speculations (a la Wilson) here in order to make believe that the Shroud was the direct model for the creation of such coins (sadly, Fanti, Whanger and other pro Shroudies seem to follow this wrong path) would be a TERRIBLE MISTAKE from an historical point of view..","date":"2012-10-23","mins":"10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/23/a-good-question-about-justinian-ii-coins/","cat":"art","title":"A good question about Justinian II coins"},{"id":"comment-18468","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Very simple my friend Andy : Because the coins of Justinian II, just like other coins minted by other Byzantine emperors from the same era, are representing all the main characteristics of the Pantocrator image, especially the fact that Jesus is holding the Holy Scriptures in his left hand and that he’s raising his right hand as a sign of teaching.

Farey at the top of this page (Can anyone suggest why the changed their mind about Christ’s appearance?), I have read in a very interesting paper about the history of Byzantine coins that this change was influenced by a new style of icon of Christ that has become very popular during that era (beginning of the 8th century) and that come from Syria… It’s important to note that this drastic change most probably had nothing to do with the Iconoclast period, which started in 726 B.C., well AFTER the reign of Justinian II who ends up in 711.

For example, if the Image of Edessa did survived during that time, it’s only because of a lucky historical context: the city of Edessa was occupied by the Arabs and the Christian Iconoclasts could put their hand on it in order to destroy it.

In my opinion, because the two images appeared around the same time (second half of the 6th century), this Image of Kamouliana was most probably a painted portrait of the face of the living Christ on linen, just like the Image of Edessa. No doubt that this is the most likely scenario for the historical context of the time in the Middle East (with all the theological debates that were going on versus the supposed two natures of Christ, the Incarnation and possibly also versus the veneration or not of sacred images)….","date":"2012-10-23","mins":"3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/23/a-good-question-about-justinian-ii-coins/","cat":"art","title":"A good question about Justinian II coins"},{"id":"comment-11820","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This is another long comment (sorry again). But I hope you’ll find it interesting !!! What is very important to understand is this : The depiction of the Pray Codex is not a direct copy of the Shroud like it was often done in the Middle Ages in France and in Italy. On the contrary, it is the same kind of depiction we often see on the famous epitaphios of the byzantine era. That’s why I always had serious doubts about the possibility that the artist who did the drawing of Jesus was a real eye witness of the Shroud of Turin while the cloth was kept in Constantinople. But the very particular weaving of the cloth (done approximately), the missing thumbs and most of all, the series of 4 holes we can see that are identical to the L shaped burn hole we see on the Shroud leaves no doubt in my mind that those particular elements could not have been draw there if the person did the artwork (probably a monk) did not learn these particularities from someone else who was a real eye witness of the Shroud of Turin while he was kept in Constantinople during the 12th century. Personally, I just the coincidence is just too big to be due uniquely to hazard. It’s just too big ! So, to summarize my point of view about the Codex of Pray, I would say that the most probable scenario is this : The depiction of Christ being put in his burial Shroud was done by a monk in the pure style of many depictions we can see on the epitaphios. This monk was not a direct eye witness of the Shroud of Turin but he incorporated some particularities of the Shroud he learned from another person who was an authentic eye witness of the Shroud (i.e, mainly the very particular style of weaving of the Shroud and the L Shaped burn holes, and maybe the missing thumbs). Here’s another thing I want you to note : The first epitaphios are dated from the beginning of the 8th century. Here what Maurus Green had to say about that : “It was thought that all hope of tracing the Epitaphioi earlier was gone (note : the author mean earlier than the 12th century), when Müntz came across the manuscripts of Jaques Grimaldi’s work on Veronica and her veil. He has left us drawings of two objects that existed in the treasury of Pope John VII in the old St Peter’s (Plates 15 and 17). One was an actual epitaphios showing Christ on an oblong linen with the inscription, Jesus Christos ho epitaphios threnos. The other was the central figure of Pope John’s umbella (canopy or baldechino) used to decorate the altar of St Veronica once a year when the relic was exposed. This was the Veronica shrine in the chapel of Our Lady, both of which were erected by order of Pope John, who reigned from 705 to 708. Grimaldi tells us that the scenes depicted on the umbella reproduced those of the mosaics decorating the chapel. The Christ of the umbella seems to be lying on the stone of anointing.” Note about the manuscript of Grimaldi : In it, there is a drawing of the umbella he personally did before the shrine was destroyed and the 2 epitaphios were lost. You can see the drawing depicting Christ here : http://www.crc resurrection.org/878 histoire du saint suaire.html (it is the first image you can see on this page). There’s a VERY GOOD PROBABILITY that the artist who did these 2 epitaphios for the pope John VII was someone who was able to see the actual Shroud of Turin because of some very interesting similarities we can see on the drawing of Grimaldi, namely the hands crossed over the pubis and, even more, the fact that the thumbs are missing ! Again, I really don’t think that those kinds of very particular similarities can be only due to hazard. It must come from an eye witness of the Shroud. So, we can say that, along the depictions of Christ in the Pantocrator icons and the face of Christ on the Mandylion, the depictions of Jesus burial we see on the byzantine epitaphios probably came from the Shroud of Turin and it’s another good clue that point toward the fact that this relic is much more older than the date given by the C14 labs !!! To finish, here’s a little reflection : Since the first epitaphios are dated to the very beginning of the 8th century (and who knows if there was not some epitaphios done before that time), if the depictions of Christ burial we can see on those artwork really come from the Shroud (as I think), then this is another very clear indicator that the hypothesis of Ian Wilson versus the Mandylion is MOST PROBABLY WRONG !!! Effectively, at the time the epitaphios of pope John VII were done, the Mandylion was still kept with great care in Edessa ! In that context, if we think for 2 seconds that Wilson’s idea is correct, how in the world an artist of John VII could have known for the hands crossed over the pubis and the missing thumbs when these features would have been well hidden behind the only exposed layer of cloth of the Mandylion (i.e. The region of the face) ?!?!? I’ll say it again, when it comes to evaluate the level of likelihood of the hypothesis of Wilson, what is the most important thing to remember is the historical context of the time !!! So, because history know now that the first epitaphios were done at the beginning of the 8th century (or even earlier) and with the high probability that this art form originate from the body image we can see on the Shroud of Turin, this historical context is VERY BAD for the idea defended by Wilson and others that, during that same period of time, the Shroud (called the Mandylion back then) would have been folded four times to show only the region of the face !!! In reality, the facts and probabilities regarding the epitaphios and the fact regarding the Mandylion just don’t fit together !!! For me, this is just one more very good clue (this time given by the history of byzantine art) that shows one more time that, in fact, the Shroud and the Mandylion were 2 different objects. Of course, this is not the biggest clue that exist leading to this conclusion, but nevertheless, this is a very good clue that represent a very difficult task for Wilson and his followers to explain !!! In fact, I’ve never read anything about this particular problem from Wilson himself or another one of his gang and, most importantly, I’ve never seen any of them offering a rational explanation about that. For me, this speaks very loud. I think the only way those people can escape the problem would be to make believe that the depiction of Christ burial on the epitaphios of John VII had nothing to do with the body image we see on the Shroud !!! But, I hope you’ll agree with me that this scenario is highly unlikely ! Look at the picture one more time (http://www.crc resurrection.org/878 histoire du saint suaire.html) and note again the missing thumbs folks ! Now, be honest with me for once !!!! How in the world this very odd feature could have come from something else than the Shroud of Turin ???.","date":"2012-06-02","mins":"7:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/02/a-masterly-demolition-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Masterly Demolition of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-11825","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I’ve decided to write again my second paragraph because I made some mistakes that can make the text hard to understand.

When you understand that this naked depiction of Christ is the only one who shows this very particular feature before the Shroud was publicly known in France during the 14th century, it is pretty EVIDENT that this can only be explain by the fact that the artist saw the Shroud with his own eyes or by the fact that he received some very precise information from someone who was an authentic eye witness of the Shroud when the relic was kept in Constantinople during the 12th century. There’s not much room for another rational explanation folks than these 2 possibilities ! Here I dare any sceptic to find me a depiction of Christ from the 12th or the 13th century ! You’ll search a long time because there’s simply no other. And personally, because the depiction of Christ in the Pray Codex looks more to me like an epitaphios that was modified to include some very particular features of the Shroud than an exact copy of the Shroud, I tend to favoured the second option, i.e. That the artist (probably a monk) who did the artwork never saw the Shroud himself but had the chance to receive very clever information from a real eye witness of the relic and decided to include them in his drawing. These information include the very particular weaving of the cloth, the L shaped burn holes, probably the missing thumbs too and, last but not least, the fact that the body of Christ was completely naked. Right now, that’s where I stand in my reflection about the Pray Codex and there’s no doubt in my mind that it is a very powerful proof of the existence of the Shroud during the 12th century (most probably in Constantinople). By the way, if what I suspect is true about the depiction of Christ on the umbella of Pope John VII, i.e. That the artist who did the work was an eye witness of the Shroud, that mean, at that time (8th century), this artist didn’t had the same guts than the one who did the depiction of Christ in the Pray Codex and decided not to show the nudity of Jesus by adding a modesty cloth… That says a lot about the FACT that, at that time, it was completely unthinkable to show Jesus body naked, even for those who had seen the Shroud with their own eyes. And I just want to make you understand that it is exactly the same thing in regard of the blood !!! Effectively, the history of art informs us that it’s not until the 13th century (first in Europe) that we see the very first depictions of the suffering Christ showing bloodstains and bruises. In this very particular context, do you really believe for one second that the Mandylion could have been exposed regularly, first in Edessa, then in Constantinople, while showing a lot of bruises and bloodstains that were very easy to see ? You really believe that ??? The reality is this : at the time the Mandylion first come up in Edessa up until the time it left Constantinople during the 13th century, if the face of Christ would have been showed with bruises and bloodstains like we see on the Shroud, it would have been judge as disgusting and scandalous for the time as if a depiction of Christ would have showed him with his body completely naked !!! It’s sad people don’t know that (or don’t want to hear this historical truth), but THAT’S THE TRUTH. And this truth lead us toward one single conclusion : The hypothesis of the Mandylion is most probably wrong and this relic was most probably what every artistic copies shows us, i.e. A cloth featuring only the face of the living Christ without any signs of injuries or bloodstains. Again, when we understand correctly the historical context of the time, the reality is this : a cloth featuring this kind of living face of Jesus would have been “religiously correct” for the time, but never the face we see on the Shroud !!! Sorry to come back again with this subject but it’s important that everyone understand that most important aspect of the historical context of the time (before the 13th century) regarding the depictions of Christ when it comes to evaluate correctly the hypothesis of Ian Wilson. Evidently, but sadly too, it’s not a FACT that Wilson himself have emphasise in his books !!! And you can easily see some bias right there… Effectively, I just cannot believe that a man like Wilson is not aware of this important fact concerning the artistic context of ancient time and, nevertheless, he choose consciously to put that aside in order to sell his hypothesis. This is not what I call an authentic quest for TRUTH. Sorry folks but that’s the reality and that’s why I fight so hard against this particular hypothesis ! In the end, I think I have some very strong arguments that allow me to do so….","date":"2012-06-03","mins":"4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/02/a-masterly-demolition-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Masterly Demolition of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-11863","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Before you leave this blog (I will miss you, I tell you that !), please read my other comment just above and explain to me how in the world a naked Christ like we see on the artwork of the Pray Codex could not be linked with the Shroud of Turin while you surely know that they were no such depiction of a naked Christ at that time in all the Christian world !!!

In fact, what the history of byzantine art shows us is that, before the 14th century, there was absolutely no depiction of Christ in the East showing him with bruises and/or bloodstains.

Awesome ! He he ! Even if I think the weaving done in the artwork of the Pray Codex can be directly related to the Shroud, I don’t think that this particularity, alone, can allow us to conclude that way. Why ? Simply because there are some examples of epitaphios from the 12th century that showed the same kind of weaving. In that respect, one can think that the monk who did the artwork in the Pray Codex didn’t based his weaving style directly on the Shroud but instead, on another epitaphios. But nevertheless, even if that was true, I think it’s pretty logical to assume that this very particular weaving style that we found on some epitaphios is also directly related to the Shroud. Anyway, I think that it is always an error to evaluate the question concerning a possible direct link between the artwork of the Pray Codex and the Shroud by taking only one particular element from the whole picture… To do a proper and intelligent evaluation of the situation, we MUST look at all the different elements together. And when we do that, there’s not much room for another possibility than to think that there really is a direct link between the Pray Codex and the Shroud of Turin, whether it come from an artist who was a real eye witness of the Shroud or, more probably, from an artist who received some precise information about some particular aspects of the Shroud from an eye witness. Here, I think mostly about the holes we see in 4 places on each side of the body images on the Shroud because, as I know, there’s no other artwork from the pre 13th century era that show holes exactly like that. But I should also say that the other elements related to the Shroud (the nudity of Christ, his hands crossed over the pubis, the lack of thumbs, the weaving style, etc.) that we can see in the Pray Codex can also have come from an eye witness, whether it was the artist or someone else who gave him these info, but I’m not so sure because we can see other examples of these elements in other artworks of the same era (particularly on other epitaphios). That’s why the holes are the key to understand that the Pray Codex and the Shroud are most probably linked together..","date":"2012-06-07","mins":"1:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/02/a-masterly-demolition-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Masterly Demolition of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-11999","author":"yannick_clément","post":"On this particular question of weaving style, I have to say this : when you take it alone, we cannot consider this particularity of the artwork of the Pray Codex as a real link between the Shroud and this artwork because there’s others epitaphios that exist and where you can see the same weaving style that was reproduced on the linen shroud. This historical fact tell me 2 things : 1 That I’m probably right when I say that the monk who did the artwork in the Pray Codex based his technique on the byzantine epitaphios. And 2 That the first epitaphios was probably based on the Shroud and the artist who did this artwork had probably the chance to see the relic very closely in order to noticed this strange sort of weaving. I should also say that the reproduction of the weaving style in the artwork of the Pray Codex must be regarded along all the other particular features that are there and that we can also found on the Shroud.

This is a fact well supported by historical documents.” Comment from me : It’s true that there was a shroud kept in Constantinople as a relic of Christ, and it’s ALSO TRUE that, at the same time, there was also the Mandylion and the Keramion that were kept in that same city. This is also WELL SUPPORTED by historical documents… So, on that solid historical base, I tell you this : You can forget about Wilson hypothesis folks, unless you still believe in Santa Claus !!! And I here, I don’t even talk about a bunch of artistic evidences that makes also a very solid case against the hypothesis proposed by our friend Wilson. It’s funny how some people have a different interpretation of historical documents, whether it goes in the direction of their preconceived ideas (i.e. For the presence of a Shroud of Christ in Constantinople) or not (i.e. For the presence, at the same time, of a Shroud of Christ AND the Mandylion in Constantinople, proving that the Mandylion had absolutely nothing to do with a burial cloth of the Passion of Christ)… In fact, there’s at least 10 different ancient sources that specified, in the SAME MANUSCRIPT, that there was a shroud (or burial cloths) associated with the Passion of Christ AND the face cloth known as the Mandylion (some of these sources mentioned also the Keramion in association with the Mandylion). The best known of these sources being the eyewitness testimonies of Nicolas Mesarites and Robert of Clari, which are both dated from the early 13th century, just before the sack of Constantinople. These documents that make a clear separation between the Shroud of Christ and the Mandylion (most of them being eyewitness accounts) are well enough to support the FACT that the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson is completely wrong, just like they are well enough to support the FACT that a Shroud of Christ (most probably accompanied by other non imaged linen cloths from the tomb) was being kept in Constantinople as an authentic relic of the Passion of Christ (from at least 958, which is the first known written attestation of its presence in that city). Sorry for those who can be offended by the truth contain in this comment but I couldn’t help myself !!! ; ) I also want to specify again this other truth : Even if the Mandylion hypothesis is no good, that doesn’t mean at all that this relic, who represent a living Christ rlookin a lot like the face on the Shroud, is not related in some way with the authentic Shroud of Turin. For me, the study done by Vignon and somewhat confirmed by Whanger, concerning the high level of concordance between the image of the face on the Shroud and the image of Christ’s face on the copies of the Mandylion, gave results that are good enough to state that there really is a true link between the 2 objects, even if the Mandylion is not the Shroud, just like the Pantocrator is not the Shroud… This link proves that the Shroud is much older than the C14 result of 1988 and can be dated to at least the end of the 6th century, if it’s not before….","date":"2012-06-18","mins":"5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/13/a-pointless-discussion-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Pointless Discussion of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-12697","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Since it’s far more easy to replicate the Pantocrator Icon or the Mandylion (remember that nodoby has been able yet to replicate the Shroud), I would say that, in all logic (and if we use the Ockham Razor to help us), it’s much more probable that the Shroud was at the origin of these artworks (because I’m pretty sure the Mandylion was also a painting) than the reverse. Remember that the Pantocrator and the Mandylion were copied on numerous occasion and these copies are pretty much the same.

That explain why he still goes on with his hypothesis, simply because it sell !!!

Maybe it’s just because other Shroudies (some are authentic historians) have defended his ideas, giving them more “credibility” (SIC). But the truth is that they did it in such a way that bias (often religious bias) is evident. That should have ringed a bell for some people involved in the Shroud world, but that’s not the case, obviously. Another good reason I think is the fact that most people don’t go deep into this historical subject (as I have done) to really learn ALL the historical and artistic FACTS surrounding it. In the Shroud world, for years, people have been only fed with one side of the coin (the Wilson side) ! That’s completely deplorable. If they would learn what I’ve learn, I think most of them would simply drop this Mandylion hypothesis, as I’ve done myself, and start to look elsewhere for a rational explanation concerning the Shroud’s obscure history. But in the end, as I also said, the fact that the Mandylion, just like the Pantocrator Icon, was probably an artwork based (directly or indirectly) on the Shroud is, for me, a proof that the Shroud was there at the time (5th or 6th century) and this can be considered as solid evidence.

I don’t trust at all this comparative image technique. It’s not a very scientific technique in my mind. Way too much suggestive. In fact, if the author took the Shroud face as the main image and use his technique again to compare it to other Jesus depictions, he would probably get the same result and the Shroud face then would be consider as the primary source for ancient Jesus depictions and not the ISA mosaic ! If he used one of the oldest Jesus fresco from the Roman catacombs, he would surely get, again, the same result and this fresco would be consider the primary source, etc., etc. And another thing I want to underline is the fact that this article don’t give us any proof at all that the Shroud and the Mandylion are one and the same thing. It’s a preconception in the mind of the author. In fact, even if the ISA mosaic hypothesis is true and was made around the time that the Mandylion came to Edessa, how can we be sure that this Mandylion wasn’t just another artistic depiction of Jesus (maybe or maybe not based on the Shroud) ? It could well be the case ! In EVERY surviving copies of the Mandylion, Jesus is ALWAYS depicted has a living men without any traces of blood or injury in the face. And another thing this article don’t give us is the real age of the ISA mosaic. If we don’t have a true age for this mosaic (and also an absolute authenticity proof), then I found the author hypothesis to be really week… In fact, one of the only good thing about this article is to point out the fact that, surely, there is a primary common source for the ancient depictions of Jesus and that this source was so important that it came to be THE source for every Jesus depictions… But the question remain unanswered : What was the primary source ? We still don’t know. And I still think the first source (the original one) was the Shroud but, as the author of the article point out, it could well be a fact that the Shroud was a primary source for just one artistic depiction of Jesus and then, this artistic depiction (the Mandylion ?) became THE main source for other Jesus depictions.

Also, if you read carefully Meacham’s book, you will noticed that the most rational (and thus, probable) reason that can explain why the authorities choose to take only one sample in that particular corner of the Shroud is not at all because they thought or knew that this action would produce a false positive result (again the conspiracy theory put forward on a purely speculative basis!) but simply because this was a corner that had already been cut once before (in 1973, so it was already “damaged” in their minds) and it was also located in one of the areas of the cloth that was the most distant from the body image (thus making the sampling of a few grams of fabric more subtle in their minds for future public showings). These 2 very probable reasons (both related to the preservation of the “good look” of the cloth much more than a desire to take the best possible samples for C14 dating) were what really drove the authorities (including their scientific adviser Gonella) to take such a bad decision, which was taken long before the sampling day (again, if we believe Meacham’s claims that we can find in his book).

First, his testimony about the whole “C14 affair” is one of the most credible we can find because he was in Turin when the protocol meeting was done and, after that, he kept in touch with Gonella and also with Father Rinaldi who knew everything that was going on in Turin. So, by talking with these guys, he became fully aware of the fact that only one sample would be taken long before the sampling day mainly because the Turin authorities wanted to preserve the “good look” of the Shroud and he clearly said that Gonella fully agreed with this plan. It is an “insider” information that we should consider very solid. And concerning your argument that, with such a state of mind, the authorities could have agreed that multiple samples could be taken underneath the patches of the 1532 fire, again, I would like you to read again Meacham’s book because he talk in length about that aspect of the question! Effectively, Meacham wrote in his book that this possibility was put on the table at the protocol meeting but it was eventually rejected by all the participants, mainly because of the good and scientific argument that was brought in by one of the radiocarbon expert (Bib Otlet) who clearly said to the others that taking such samples was very risky to produce an imprecise result. Here’s what Otlet said (quote taken in Meacham’s book): “Yes, there is the burnt toast problem. If you want to remove the butter, you have to do it before you toast the bread.” This image was used to make understand that, by taking the charred material underneath the patches, there was a true possibility that an exchange of carbon atoms could have been done between a substance that could possibly have been present on the cloth with one of the component of linen. Seriously Ron, I don’t think we can reject the whole testimony of Meacham on the subject of the C14 dating just by saying it was only speculations! One thing’s for sure: his testimony appeared to me much more credible and plausible than all the complete speculative non sense related to a conspiracy theory that would have been performed by the Church or the C14 labs!

This come from pages 87 and 88 of William Meacham’s book “The Rape of the Turin Shroud”. Remember that Meacham was present at the protocol meeting and had good contacts with both Gonella and Father Rinaldi, so he knows what he’s talking about. Here’s the summary he gave about the situation that prevailed just before the dating (I underlined some parts that I consider crucial to understand the dating mess of 1988 by writing them in caps lock): “Cardinal Ballestrero’s letter of October 1987 at last set the ball rolling towards a radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, despite the continuing and sometimes frantic machinations of the Gove Canuto Harbottle axis, now without Chagas, particularly in a last ditch but futile campaign to forge a united front amongst the original seven labs to insist on no reduction in their number. The appeal of dating the most famous relic in the world with all the attendant favorable publicity was too strong for the chosen ones to resist. Representatives of the three labs met with Michael Tite of the British Museum and Gonella in London in January 1988, supposedly to find out if their “stringent requirements” would be met, but in fact to accept THE CONDITIONS WHICH GONELLA WAS SETTING. The basic parameters of the new protocol were spelled out: each laboratory would send a representative to Turin to witness the sample taking which would be “under the supervision of a qualified expert”; control samples of known age would be provided by the British Museum; the whole procedure would be recorded by video; the labs would submit their results to the British Museum and a statistical institute in Turin. A date for the sample taking was not announced, but rumored to be in the spring. It was hoped that results could be announced by the end of 1988. One certainly felt that an historic occasion was approaching; I doubted that a bulls eye date of first century would be obtained, but was cautiously optimistic that a result would indicate some antiquity for the Shroud, perhaps back to the 4th or 5th centuries, owing to some intractable contamination. This could be taken as a good indication that the Shroud was the genuine article. I made one last effort to persuade Gonella of the need for the SMALL TEAM OF ADVISORY ARCHAEOLOGISTS that I had suggested, PARTICULARLY FOR THE SELCTION OF SAMPLING SITES. Again, I put it to him in the strongest terms that A MINIMUM OF TWO SITES WAS NEEDED. BY THIS STAGE, HE WAS NOT LISTENING, and I did not receive a response. Fr. Rinaldi kept me informed of what he learned of the developments; and IT WAS CLEAR THAT GONELLA WAS PROUDLY RUNNING THE SHOW. No one knew just HOW MUCH HE WAS GOING TO RUIN IT, but there was a shadow in my mind of continuing NAGGING WORRY THAT HE WOULD TAKE THE SOLE SAMPLE FROM A BAD LOCATION, AND THE SHROUD COULD BE ASSIGNED AN INCORRECT AGE.” That’s it my friends! Now, after this reading, if someone still want to claim that Gonella did a good job and that he was not responsible for the dating mess of 1988, I think this person will have to look at himself in the mirror and ask himself if he can have maybe a little bias in favor of the late Gonella, which goes just too far versus the reality and the truth! Seriously, from Meacham’s testimony, it is clear that, not only the pressures coming from the C14 labs (especially Gove) to take STURP out of the picture and do the whole dating alone by themselves, but also Gonella’s antics and lack of listening to true experts in the field of radiocarbon dating (like Meacham) had a huge impact on the dating mess of 1988… Nevertheless, it should be noted that maybe Gonella’s was somewhat forced to do what the Church authorities had decided (especially concerning the will to take just one sample in an already “damaged” corner of the cloth to preserve his “good look”) , but in the end, even if this is true, that would not be enough to make him totally not guilty concerning the most probable erroneous dating result of the Shroud’s age. Effectively, as the official scientific advisor of the whole project, it would have been of his duty to get out of the project (or at least threaten the authorities to do so) well before the sampling day if, as Meacham’s say in his book, he knew that only one sample should be taken in one corner of the cloth. And also, it would have been of his duty to hardly criticize the medieval result after its publication. But unfortunately, as Meacham’s clearly wrote in his book, the official scientific advisor did nothing of that nature and, even worse, he seem to have done precisely the opposite, as he kept pushing very hard, during the months preceding the sampling day, for that only one sample should be taken instead of the 3 different samples that were originally planed. But the main point of the whole thing is this: The decision to take only one small sample from one already “damaged” corner of the cloth, no matter if this came from Gonella himself or from the Church authorities, was most certainly driven by a desire to preserve at the max the look of the Shroud. As Meacham’s wrote in page 68 of his book: “I believe he (Gonella) genuinely wanted to limit the amount of material removed from the Shroud and any visible alteration to it, which is of course a legitimate concern, BUT HE TOOK IT TO THE EXTEME.” The remaining question is this: Did Gonella was the one in Turin who really choose to take only one sample in a corner of the cloth to preserve his look or did the real responsible was the Cardinal of Turin, Ballestrero? Here’s the opinion of Meacham (found in page 69 of his book): “The pity is that Gonella involved himself so deeply in this matter and took charge at the final stage, COMMITTING A HUGE ERROR IN THE CHOICE OF SAMPLING SITE AND THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES. At the higher level of responsibility is Ballestrero, who delegated too much power to Gonella and failed to see the dangers of this.” Conclusion: If we believe Meacham, the biggest responsible of the 1988 mess (at the scientific level) was Gonella and Cardinal Ballestrero was almost as guilty as him, but not on a scientific level, but only because he blindly followed the opinion of his scientific advisor without consulting or listening to other experts in the field of radiocarbon dating (like Meacham’s himself), and the principal reason of the medieval result was the choice of Gonella to take just one sample from an already “damaged” and potentially contaminated area of the cloth. So, if we believe Meacham’s “insider” opinion on the subject, there’s absolutely no need to call for a conspiracy theory of any sort to explain the medieval result… Instead, this mess was mainly caused by the “extreme” desire of one man (Gonella) to absolutely preserve the “good look” of the cloth, instead of making everything he could (for example, by taking at least 3 different samples and saying yes to Meacham’s suggestion to form an advisory team of archaeologists to supervised the sampling) to find the real age of the cloth. I really don’t think we have to look elsewhere to find the real explanation for the dating mess of 1988 and, having said that, I don’t really see the need to produce another documentary on the subject..","date":"2013-08-14","mins":"8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"id":"comment-41207","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Interesting note: Even though, at the protocol meeting in Turin, Meacham agreed with the others concerning the fact that there was potentially a high level of risk to date the charred material that was present underneath the patches of the 1532 fire, he wrote in his book that, later on, he changed his mind about that (mainly because of Ray Rogers, who reassured him about the validity and the relevance to date such material) and even wrote an official request to the Turin authorities (signed by many Shroud researchers, among them Rogers himself), asking them to allow a new C14 dating that would be done on the charred material that was extracted from the immediate vicinity of the burn holes in 2002 and has been preserved to this day in small bottles.

Remember that there was no need at that time to take a huge amount of material for the dating… Look, in all logic, this particular kind of thread sampling could even have been done for threads located on the backside of the cloth, preventing even more the risk of making a visible impact on the cloth. Some will say that taking these kind of small threads here and there on the cloth would have been risky because some of those could have come from another cloth than the Shroud itselfm but if a proper microscopic and chemical analysis would have been done by STURP after the sampling of those threads and before the C14 dating by the labs, the risk of dating another piece of fabric than the Shroud would have been near absolute zero. This is the kind of sampling and dating that should have been performed in 1988 in order to really find the true age of the Shroud. But as Meacham said in his book, that was not the main priority of Gonella and the Turin authorities! Their main priority was to prevent any noticeable damage to the cloth. And to take the words of Meacham: Gonella pushed that notion to the extreme… There’s no doubt in Meacham’s mind (and in my mind also) that, as a scientific advisor, he could have done a much better job in 1988.

First, I want to clearly state this: I have no problem to see profesionnal film maker like you doing a serious and well documented film about the Shroud. I saw your last one and I thought it was interesting in many aspects. What I meant with my previous comment is that, unlike documentaries like yours and some others, what makes my blood boiled is to see a book or a documentary capitalizing on complete non sense about the Shroud or on some new theories that are purely based on speculations and not on hard scientific facts. That’s what I call “the Jesus inc. Consortium”. So, when I heard that you were talking about a pure speculation about the Shroud and the Vatican, I just wanted to learn from you if you had the idea of making a new movie that would rest on this speculative basis. I just hope you’ll never do anything of that nature related to the Shroud… A 3rd movie in the line of the previous 2, no problem! But a new movie about some highly speculative hypotheses about the Shroud and/or the Vatican, that would be a shame from someone like you… And concerning the blood, as Barrie Schwortz often said in interviews, that blood is so aged and degraded that it’s highly improbable that any complete DNA profile can be obtained from it. In this context, I just don’t see why the Vatican would be afraid of someone who could steel some particles of blood from the Shroud in order to play Dr. Frenkenstein… If this is the reason why the Vatican is so reluctant to allow a new series of direct researches on the Shroud, I don’t know what to say… I’m almost sure this is not the true reason. And if a complete DNA profile could ever be found from the blood on the Shroud, I don’t know what kind of genetic information could be regarded as being potentially “dangerous” for the Christian faith. Of course, there could be the problem of someone wanting to clone Jesus, but even this would not afraid me at all since the spychic and, more importantly, the soul of this person would never be the same as the one Jesus had while on Earth… In other words, it would never be the real Jesus, so who cares?.","date":"2013-08-09","mins":"3:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"id":"comment-41519","author":"yannick_clément","post":"But don’t you think that mingling the sample areas (as you said) would reduce a lot the risk of dating one single sample that could be more contaminated than normal (just like the C14 sample of 88 probably was)? I really think so! I think that sampling small pieces of threads from every parts of the cloth would be the very best sampling procedure to do, as long as a team of expert could make sure that every small pieces of fabric really come from the main body of the Shroud. Once you can be sure about that, then the dating result you got should be a very precise average age for the cloth, which come from the “cluster of samples” you had taken. The most important thing with my idea of sampling is to make sure that every small pieces of fabric you will date really comes from the main body of the Shroud, which is something that, I’m sure, can be done quite easily nowdays. Once you’re sure about that, I don’t see any problem with the idea of “mingling the sample areas”. On the contrary, since you would be sure that all the small samples you would get really comes from the same piece of cloth (the Shroud), I think this kind of “cluster sampling” would give a much more accurate result than any other sampling method that can be done, including the dating of the charred material. And concerning this particular method, even if I think there are some chances that Rogers can have been right about the idea that such material do not represent a high risk of contamination, I still have some doubts about that, mainly because of what Otlet told the participants at the protocol meeting in 1988 (see: https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support/#comment 41197).

And these 2 artworks (that had been lost at the time St Peter’s Basilica was rebuild during the 16th century) have very interesting similarities with the Shroud of Turin (like the fact that the body is lying in the same exact position than the frontal image on the Shroud with the hands crossed over each other and without the thumbs !), even if the only copy of one of these 2 epitaphios I’ve seen don’t seem to show the herringbone weave of the Shroud… See for yourself here: http://www.crc resurrection.org/878 histoire du saint suaire.html It is the first picture on that page… Note that these 2 earliest representations of the entire frontal body of Christ lying on his back for his burial were done during the time the Mandylion was still kept in Edessa… A time where, if we believe Ian Wilson, the Shroud was folded in 8 to show only the face and no one would have known about the image of the entire body !!!

It’s pure rational thinking but this kind of thinking is very often put aside when it comes to speculate wildly on supposed direct links between the Shroud and some Byzantine artworks. The solidus of Justinian II doesn’t show anything more than the Pantocrator image of Christ that look very Shroud like simply because the Pantocrator images (which dates from at least 500 A.D. Onwards) were most probably influenced in some way (direct or not) by the image on the Shroud. One last important comment to those who are tempted to defend at all cost the present hypothesis that makes a direct link between the nose from this very ancient Byzantine coin and the nose on the Shroud : Be certain that this speculative assumption would NEVER stand for more than 2 seconds in a court room, simply because the characteristic of the nose of this ancient coin could well be due to a bunch of different things that have nothing to do with the image on the Shroud (and no matter what Fanti can think, an deformation of the mold in which this coin was minted is truly a fair and rational possibility). Don’t you think this joke of a possible direct influence of the Shroud on this Pantocrator coin as last long enough ??? I really think so. If this reflect the state of today’s Shroud science, it’s easy to understand why most of the international scientific community has a tendency to see sindonology as a sick joke and to see most of the Shroud researchers (especially in the historical field) as having no credibility whatsoever.

The most probable date that the cloth appeared in Edessa is the second part of the 6th century and it is quite clear that this Abgar legend was modified at that time to include the cloth. Before that time, the Abgar legend didn’t make any mention of a miraculous cloth. There was only an exchange of letters between Abgar and Jesus ! All this seem to me like a “cover up” to make believe this cloth (probably a false relic) have a pedigree that goes all the way to Jesus and 1st century Palestine… Guscin in his book “The Image of Edessa” was quite prudent versus the origin of the image and state that it’s origin is unknown. It’s completely true. Those images from the catacombs are clues to me that the Shroud existed during those early days and it was the base for those frescos, but probably not directly. My feeling is that it happened something quite like it happened for the Pray Codex : During those days (3rd or 4th century) some people must have seen the authentic Shroud somewhere (probably in Palestine) and came to Rome where they describe the face of the Shroud to some artists who did the artwork based on their testimony. That could explain why the face is not an exact copy of the Shroud face but at the same time, is too close to it to be due simply to hasard. And I don’t think the Mandylion had anything to do with those frescos. Did you ever thought of another possibility for the Mandylion ? Here it is : Maybe it was a false relic created during the second half of the 6th century by an artist who was working in catimini with the Shroud as a model. At that time, the Shroud would have been kept secretly and the general public wasn’t aware of it. Then, the Mandylion became rapidly known (because mainly of his inclusion in the Abgar legend and his so called miraculous role in the defense of Edessa in 544) and since the general belief was that this was the real face of Jesus on that cloth (not made by human hands), this Mandylion surely became the principal model for every Jesus depictions after the second portion of the 6th century like the Pantocrator from the Saint Catherine’s monastary… What do you think of this scenario ?

But in the end, I think this actual debate was taken a bit off track by the skeptics like Collinsberry and David. The only question we have to ask ourselves is this : Is it probable that the artwork contain in the Pray Codex can have been influenced (directly or indirectly) by the Shroud of Turin. And to answer this important question (because if it’s yes, it push the dating of the shroud back to at least the 12th century), we cannot analyse one element alone and then, analyse another element alone. No, we have to look at the WHOLE PICTURE AT ONCE ! And what it the whole picture ? That the artwork in the Pray Codex show a series of L Shaped holes like we see on the Shroud, that it show Christ naked like we see on the Shroud, that it show the hands crossed over the pubis like we see on the Shroud, that it doesn’t show the thumbs like we see on the shroud and that it show a very particular weaving style like we see on the shroud. Now, you have to ask yourseltf one question : If the artist who did this artwork never saw the Shroud and never heard about it, how’s the chances that everyone of these very particular features (some of which, like the nudity of Christ, are, as I know, the most ancient features ever to appear in a religious artwork) could have been put in one single artwork during the 12th century ??? If someone is honest, he have no choice to answer this question by saying EXTREMELY LOW ! I don’t even know if the probability would be 0,1 % ! THAT’S THE ONLY QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES. Of course, there’s also a few differences but this doesn’t really matter if we think the Pray Codex was never intent to be an exact copy of the Shroud by the monk who probably did it. When you understand that the art style of the depiction of Christ is the same kind of depictions we see on the epitaphios, it is very probable that the artist who did the artwork had the intention to make some kind of epitaphios that would include some of the characteristics of the Shroud he knew (because he had previously seen the relic or because an eye witness gave him these particular details). In my mind, in the light of the answer I gave to the important question I asked in this comment, there’s not much room left open for another scenario… And if you don’t agree with me, then look everywhere and found me another religious artwork that predate the first known publich showing of the Shroud in Lirey, France, around 1350, and that show ALL of the features I mentioned in this comment !!!

If there’s no blood on this artwork, it is simply because it was done during the 12th century and up until that time, there was absolutely no depiction of a suffering Christ with bruises and bloodstains ! You must never forget the historical context !!! In fact, the very first depictions of Jesus with blood are dated of the 13th century and were done in Europe. We have to wait until the 14th century before seeing the byzantine artist having the guts to do the same. Why ? Because before the 13th century, showing a suffering Christ would have been considered scandalous and disgusting for the people ! And more than that, up until the 13th century, theologically speaking, a suffering Christ didn’t fit at all with the mainstream teaching of the Church (whether it was the European Church or the Orthodox Church). It was mainly the Christ in Glory that was showed before the 13th century (along with some depictions that shows kind of a sad Jesus). So, during the time the Pray Codex was made, it wasn’t “in the air” at all to depict a suffering Christ and that’s why this artwork don’t show any blood or bruises or injuries. And, because of this particular religious and artistic context of pre 13th century that was completely repulsive to any depiction of a suffering Christ, you can easily understand that the hypothesis of Ian Wilson concerning the Mandylion is VERY HIGHLY UNLIKELY ! In my mind, it’s even ridiculous when you understand well the context of the time the image first appeared in Edessa during the 5th or 6th century (the context that I just describe). At that time, if an image of a beaten and bloody Christ would have been publicly showed, it would have made a scandal ! And there would be a lot of textual reports (here, I don’t refer to one or two dissonant legendary text. I talk about eye witness accounts) that would clearly states that there was a very particular image of Christ in Edessa (and later on, in Constantinople) that was showing him suffering with lot of bloodstains. There’s absolutely no doubt about the fact that many copies of it showing the bloodstains and the beaten face would have been made and there’s also no doubt at all that an image of a suffering Christ the point directly to his Passion (the crown of thorns is easily discernible on the head of the man of the Shroud) would have had a MAJOR IMPACT on byzantine art, especially any form of art related to the Passion of Christ. The influence of an image of a suffering Christ would have been dramatic on byzantine art first and then, on all the Christian art everywhere. But the fact is this : The Mandylion had absolutely no influence like that whatsoever and there is absolutely no depiction of a suffering Christ showing bloodstains before the 13th century (some 7 or 8 centuries after the first apparition of the Mandylion) ! In itself, this important historical fact is enough to completely discard this relic as having been the Shroud folded 4 times to show only the face. Like I say, I don’t have any doubts that this image of Edessa was related, directly or indirectly, to the Shroud (just like the Pray Codex, the Pantocrator, the epitaphios and other artworks of the byzantine era), but believing that this image and the Shroud were one and the same cloth, I really think that this is ludicrous. In sum, this idea of Wilson just doesn’t fit at all with what we know about the byzantine art of the first 13 centuries A.D. !!! It’s as simple as that. But nevertheless, the image of Edessa is important because it is a good indicator that the Shroud was already known by some people in the Middle East around the 6th, possibly even the 5th century..","date":"2012-06-06","mins":"5:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/on-christ-naked-in-medieval-art-and-empty-vessels/","cat":"art","title":"On Christ Naked in Medieval Art and “Empty Vessels”"},{"id":"comment-11909","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Most of these scenes Chris were probably influenced by the byzantine art, especially the epitaphios.

This is really interesting but this cannot be taken as some kind of argument against the fact that the depiction of Christ in the Pray Codex is surely linked with the Shroud. In fact, in my mind, I think we can make the opposite reflection : Since those artworks were done in Europe during the 13th century, after the 4th crusade when some crusaders like Robert de Clari probably saw the body images on the Shroud of Turin, I think there’s a fairly good probability that those paintings of a nude Christ were influenced by the testimonies of these crusaders who had seen the Shroud in Constantinople in 1203, before the sack of the city. One other thing to note : the Pray Codex is still, as I know, the only artwork made during the 12th century (not the 13th folks, the 12th !!!) to show Jesus nude. Despite what the skeptics might say, this fact alone makes this artwork very unique in the history of art, since it is the only known depiction of Christ nude made during the time the Shroud was most probably kept in Constantinople (before 1204)… And there’s one more thing very important to understand : The nudity of Christ in the drawing of the Pray Codex, even if it is a very good clue that indicate a probable link with the Shroud, is not what I consider to be the most important feature. No, the feature that is even more important, because it indicate an almost sure connection between this artwork and the Shroud, is the L shaped holes. Nevermind what the skeptics can say, the fact that there’s such a series of holes in the drawing of the Pray Codex indicate clearly a close connection with the Shroud. If you use your logic, there’s no room for any other RATIONAL explanation… Of course, any skeptic (like Collinsberry) can come out and give us some explanation of his own using his imagination, but is it rational in the context of a religious artwork of the 12th century ?

If Jesus was a REAL HUMAN BEING like everyone, I don’t see ANY good reason the completely reject the possibility that his burial shroud could have been kept and could still be with us until this day !

It’s important to note that every one of these experts (well known for the majority of them) completely disagree with Wilson’s hypothesis. In fact, the only researchers I know who agree with Wilson (partially in some cases) are all self proclaimed pro Shroud people (like Guscin, Scavone, Dubarle, Pfeiffer, Markwardt, etc.), which is very telling… What is also very interesting is the fact that at least two of the experts I consulted during my research (namely Poulle and Legrand) were in favor of the authenticity of the Shroud, while being, at the same time, in complete disagreement with Wilson’s hypothesis, which is exacly what I think..","date":"2013-09-03","mins":"6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"id":"comment-42818","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If those are not all byzantine experts, you can be sure that they are (or were) all Professional historians, which is a very good start, on the contrary to Guscin (who is not a professional historian at all, but a professional translator, which is very different) or Wilson (who is a professional book writer and journalist). And concerning Guscin references, I can only repeat what I wrote in my first comment of the day, which is that “in order to do a real serious, professional and honest historical research, someone must avoid to base any conclusion on wild speculations and discordant facts (like the fact that there are two or three manuscripts that associate the Mandylion with a full length body image, while there are tons of other manuscripts that clearly speak of only a facial image, which is confirmed very well by all the known depictions of the relic), while, at the same time, always try to never “forget” or put aside all the most pertinent data. The few references found by Guscin NEVER associated the Mandylion with a burial shroud or with a cloth that was showing bloodstains or the boody stigmata of Christ, and they never state that there were 2 images on the cloth (one of the front, one of the back). In fact, beside the reference to the presence of an image of the complete body, all these texts seem to place the miraculous image formation in the same “before the Passion” context than all the other manuscript describing the Abgar legend. In fact, I don’t think any one of these few references are specifically saying that the miraculous imprint happened during the Passion or after, which would be the only logical times in which you can place the formation of the image we see on the Shroud… That’s one major point to note, which makes me feel that these few discordant references (2 or 3 among surely more than 100 versions of the Abgar legend) are due to some erroneous mixing of the Mandylion story and the body image that was present on the real Shroud of Turin, which happened at a time when both relics (note that these were 2 different relics: many lists of relics from Constantinople confirm this historical fact) were kept in Constantinople (probably in the same Pharos chapel, most of the time). In such a context of 2 relics of Christ that were showing his imprint and that were kept in the same location, it’s not very surprising to see a few ancient manuscripts telling the Abgar legend, while wrongly saying that the cloth given to the king was showing a full body imprint instead of just the face of Christ. The bottom line is this : We must judge such discordant pieces of evidence in the very same way than we do for the question of the authenticity of the Shroud. On this subject, consider this: there are maybe 99 pieces of evidence that support the idea that the Shroud is authentic, while there is probably only one piece of evidence that can be considered as truly problematic (the C14 dating of 1988). In such a context, any rational scientist would consider the discordant piece of evidence of the C14 dating as being probably erroneous. THIS SHOULD ALSO BE THE SAME KIND OF REASONNING WE MUST DO IN THE CASE OF ALL THE HISTORICAL AND ARTISTICAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT ARE RELATED TO WILSON’S HYPOTHESIS… And if we act like this, no doubt that we will found out that 99% of the available evidences are in favor of the idea that the Mandylion was a relic showing only the face of the living Christ, while acknowledging the fact that there are absolutely no piece of evidence (whether historic or artistic) that describe the Mandylion as a burial cloth that was showing a full length body imprint of Jesus with his bloody stigmata on it..","date":"2013-09-03","mins":"7:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"id":"comment-42819","author":"yannick_clément","post":"By the way, I highly recommand anyone’s interested in the Mandylion hypothesis to read Cesar Barta’s paper that was recently published on Barrie Schwortz’s website (link: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/bartaveng.pdf), which was originally presented at the Valencia conference last year. You’ll find the section dedicated on Wilson’s hypothesis in pages 6 through 9. In this section, Barta (who is not a professional historian but who is, in my mind, a very honest and intelligent researcher), after having analyzed some of the most pertinent facts (all contained in my own paper about the Mandylion hypothesis) came to the obvious conclusion that this hypothesis is most probably wrong and that the Shroud was probably a different cloth than the Mandylion. You’ll see that, at the end of the section, Barta (probably to please the pro Shroud clique) gave a personal hypothesis that could maybe (if you believe in miracle) explain the three most important objections he has found against Wilson’s hypothesis, thus giving some hope that his hypothesis could be true after all. It’s very impressive to note the very high degree of speculation on which Barta’s personal hypothesis is resting! The most incredible one (the word is correct!) is the ludicrous idea that Saint Louis, king of France, even though he took the precaution to send trusty men in Constantinople to make sure of the validity of each relic he wanted to buy, would have accepted to buy from the Latin emperor Baudouin II (a relative of the king) the reliquary in which the Mandylion would have been kept in Constantinople but without any relic inside!!! Now, if this is not a highly speculative idea, which is not supported by any solid fact, then I don’t know what it is! And in the case of the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson, people must understand that it’s always like this, i.e. In order to have any chance to work, this hypothesis must always rely mostly on wild spéculations like that, which is why it is not accepted by the vast majority of the professional scholars..","date":"2013-09-03","mins":"7:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"id":"comment-42833","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Concerning the etymology of the word Mandylion, forget it Matthias.

If your fantasy was true, how can you explain that we know only ONE type of artistic copie of the Image of Edessa, which CLEARLY and ALWAYS depict ONLY the face of the LIVING Christ on a SMALL towel WITHOUT any traces of BLOODSTAINS and/or INJURIES ??? You, Wilson, Scavone and anyone who have a good imagination can make say anything you want to a legendary kind of text BUT… You will never be able to change the known and SIMILAR aspect of these artistic copies which NEVER presents any great resemblance with the Shroud of Turin or any other kind of artistic depiction related to the Passion of the Christ. If you’re right, where can I found the artistic copies of the second cloth (Tetradiplon/Himation/Sindon) you always mention ??? The only way real Byzantine scholars could start looking at Wilson’s hypothesis with some interest is if one day a new discovery would be made in an ancient text which would make a clear description of the Image of Edessa as being a long burial cloth showing bloodstains (idealy mentioning that these bloodstains refers to the stigmata of Christ), along with a full size body image (idealy mentioning the presence of a ventral and a dorsal image). In all the ancient legendary text of the Abgar legend, in all the theological kind of text mentioning the Image of Edessa (like the discourse of Gregory Referendarius) and also in all the ancient list of relics coming from Edessa, there’s absolutely no single reference that can be clearly understood as being the kind of reference I just mentioned. And until a discovery like that could be made (that will most probably never happen folks !), the way to do good history is to consider this hypothesis of Wilson as being HIGHLY UNLIKELY because it rest mainly on speculation, extrapolations and special assumptions. And the truth is this : Science (and the Occam’s razor principle) REALLY HATES hypothesis that rest on that kind of imaginative stuff. I ask you the question : Using Occam’s razor and taking account of all the known data coming from historical and artistic sources concerning both the Shroud and the Mandylion, which one of these 2 hypothesis MUST be considered the most probable : 1 The one of Wilson which goes against ALL the known artistic copies of the Mandylion. 2 The one which pretend that the Mandylion was exactly what all these artistic copies are showing (i.e. A small cloth showing only the face of the living Christ without any injuries and/or bloodstains), what the totality of the known list of relics from Constantinople are saying and what the vast majority of the legendary text concerning the Abgar legend are also saying ? If someone here dare to answer #1, then I don’t know why I am wasting my time here !!! If you really dare to answer #1, that would be the best proof of your Pro Shroud complete bias, which is, by the way, as ugly as the ones who get an anti Shroud bias. Bias for Bias, they’re all as ugly in my book. Can we start talking seriously and honestly while leaving our preconceived ideas at the door please ? For all the good reasons I brought to you over and over again and one more time here in this comment, I’ll repeat it: The Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson MUST be considered as being HIGHLY UNLIKELY. PERIOD. It’s not that I like it or not, it has to do with rational thinking in face of all the known data, particularly facing all the known artistic copies of the Mandylion. I’ll repeat it : Max or Wilson or anyone else cannot change the fact that there is only one general kind of depiction associated with the Image of Edessa and it fits perfectly well with the vast majority of the known ancient sources, i.e. That this relic was an image of Christ resting on a small cloth and showing only his living face without any signs of injuries and/or bloodstains. Last note : Unlike what Max is saying, the Veronica is another relic that was created AFTER the Image of Edessa and it’s fair to describe it as the Western version of the Abgar legend. In other words, the Veronica IS NOT the Mandylion.

If this Shroud was really the Shroud of Turin (as I think it was), then the drastic change of trend in Christian art at the beginning of the 13th century (first in Europe) have some good chances to be due to this probable first public showing of the body image and bloodstains that are present in the inside part of the Shroud. If this was the very first time the Church of Constantinople agreed to make such an exhibition of such a gruesome and crude relic of a dead and suffering Christ (it’s truly possible that it was the case), then we can think that the Latin crusaders who saw this brought back in Europe this idea of a dead and suffering image of Christ (along with probably also the Shroud itself) and their testimonies could well have influenced the Christian art of that century, allowing the apparition of the first artistic trend that showed a dead and bloody Christ. Because prior to the testimony of Robert de Clari in 1204 we have absolutely no other written mention of another public showing of a Shroud of Christ that bears a full size body image on it and because this is precisely at that same era that art historians have noted an important change in the artistic trend regarding the depictions related to the Passion of the Christ, it is fair to assume that this public showing (every Friday in 1203 and 1204) of the Shroud in Constantinople (maybe the first ever official showing were people could see the inner part of the cloth with the body image and bloodstains) could well have been the starting point of this drastic change that took the main trend of the time (especially in Orient) which was called “the resigned Christ” (not a dead Christ but a sad one) to the next level that have been called “the suffering Christ” (showing a dead Christ with blood flowing from every stigmata). Personally, I really think there is a truly possible link (probably direct) between these 2 events… That would give a possible answer for the dead silence of ancient sources versus a Shroud of Christ that bears a body image on it: this image would have been conserved hidden from the eyes of the public for a long, long time by the Church of Constantinople (and probably also by the Church of Jerusalem at an earlier time). From all the historical data we know (we could also say: the lack of historical reference to a Shroud of Christ with an image), this hypothesis is certainly possible and the hdding would have been caused by the social, religious, theological and artistic context that was present in the Byzantine world up until ca. 1200. I have already said all this before but I think some people could learn one or two things by reading this and/or could start a reflection about the obscure years of the Shroud. Little note to finish : During the 5th and 6th centuries, which is the most probable era that saw the appearance of the Image of Edessa (and other supposedly miraculous image of the face of Christ), the main artistic trend of showing Christ during his Passion was called “the triumphant Christ” and some of the main characteristics associated with that trend (i.e. The head of Christ rised up, the eyes open and looking at us, the chest haughty, the face impassive, etc.) fits perfectly well with the known aspect of the Image of Edessa that we can see in every artistic copy that are still preserved today. In other words, the idea that the Image of Edessa was nothing more than a painting of the face of the living Christ on a small linen cloth is backed up by the social, religious, theological and above all, by the artistic context of the time where we saw, historically, the first public apparition of this relic of the living Christ (5th or 6th century). To be a good historian, I think the first quality someone MUST have is an ability to replace things in the RIGHT HISTORICAL CONTEXT !!! This include sometime to replace thing in the right theological context and/or in the right religious context and/or in the right social context and/or in the right artistic context. If someone pretending doing history don’t do this properly, how can he come up with a hypothesis that have some chance to be good ???

That speak very loud to me because that show how odd the image on the Shroud is for the era that goes before the sack of Constantinople and even long after that. Jacques Bara in France did a cool research and never found a naked Christ in a depiction related to his Passion, death or burial before the 15th century in Toscani !!! So, even after the Shroud of Turin was put in public display in France, artists were not willing to depict Christ naked in scenes related to his Passion and death ! Just a simple example to show that it is true : Look at all the Byzantine epithaphios you want and you’ll never see a naked Christ except in the particular drawing that we found in the Pray codex ! Elsewhere, Christ is always depicted with a modesty cloth or something like that… That’s a very good clue to say that the artist who did the drawing in the Pray codex knew about the Shroud (even if it’s truly possible that he never saw it personally but just get second hand info).

Freeman. I wasn’t aware of these ones. This part of the Shroud and sudarium remind me of the list written by Baudouin II for the big selling of relics he did with St Louis King of France. In this list too, there was an item called “part of the Shroud”. Is it possible to think these pieces of the Shroud could have been taken from the 2 missing panels we see on the Shroud of Turin ? No one can say for sure when these 2 missing parts of the Shroud were cut off and it’s truly possible to think that these missing panels were then cut out in many smaller pieces… Maybe it was during the time the Shroud possibly was kept in Constantinople to give away by the Byzantine emperor as gifts to other kings or Church leaders ? I think it’s an interesting possibility. And for the sudarium, I remind having read this term in some list of relics of Constantinople but what is not easy is the interpretation to give to this term. Effectively, many time it was used by ancient authors (like in the Arculfe testimony : The author of the text used the word “sudarium” to described a piece of cloth of 8 feet long!) to describe a long piece of linen cloth like the Shroud of Turin (in fact, it is truly possible that this term found in the Gospel of John effectively describe the Shroud of Christ and not a simple face cloth) and on other occasions, it was used to describe a much smaller cloth used by Eastern people to take away the sweat. So, this term “sudarium” we found in some list of relics from Constantinople could have described a long linen cloth (maybe the Shroud of Turin) or a smaller cloth… It’s not easy at all to be certain about that. Maybe it was used for the Shroud by some authors and for a smaller cloth by others. Hard to say. Nevertheless, I think it’s truly possible that at the same time, in Oviedo and in Constantinople, there were 2 different relics pretending to be the authentic sudarium of Christ, along with another long cloth that was also kept in Constantinople at the time (until the 13th century) and that was described as the authentic Shroud of Christ (this Shroud was sometimes described with some other smaller linen cloths and/or bands). All these cloths were thought to be genuine and to have been found by the disciples in the empty tomb. We know the size of the one in Oviedo but I really wonder if the one that was probably kept in Constantinople was as small….","date":"2012-09-11","mins":"2:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-16187","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Answer to M. Freeman : 1 A paten is certainly not a piece of a shroud nor a sudarium ! I think we should be VERY PRUDENT with this ancient reference saying that there was these cloths relics related to the Passion that were brought in the monastery at Halberstadt in 1205… If nobody can provide a solid evidence that these cloths ever where preserved at this monastery, I think we should not take this account as an historical fact. Prudence is certainly needed here and more research is also needed to see if some kind of physical and/or historical proofs can be found at this monastery to confirm this ancient reference. I think Michael Angold was correct when he looked at this particular reference with great prudence. As I said myself, it’s truly possible that these cloths mentioned by Conrad of Halberstadt never left Constantinople and the Pharos Chapel until much later when Baudouin II sell them to St Louis King of France. But I have to say that I’m not aware of a sudarium that would have been sold to St Louis in this mega transaction. Who knows what happened of this sudarium ? And who can say that it ever existed for sure in Constantinople and could not have been confused with the Shroud of Christ that was there also ? As I said, it’s not evident to interpret all these ancient reference when the authors were using words like “sudarium”, “lintheum”, “sindon”, etc. To often talked about a same piece of cloth ! Truly, ancient writers didn’t had the same crazyness than us concerning precision !!! 2 IF (note the “IF” because it’s the most important thing here) the inner part of the Shroud of Turin (where we can see the body image and most of the bloodstains) was showed publicly for the very first time in History during the time the Latin crusaders were at the gates of Constantinople in 1203 1204 and that many of these crusaders were able to see this completely unique, gruesome, crude and even scandalous image of a dead and suffering Christ, I’m totally convinced that this sighting would have had definitively a huge influence on the apparition of the Suffering Christ’s icons that first appeared in Europe (think about the Man of Sorrow icon for example that shows many similarities with the image we see on the Shroud!!!) once the crusaders returned home (with probably the Shroud itself with them in their “luggage”!!!!). Seriously, I can’t believe for one second that this incredible sight would not have left a huge impression on some of these crusaders who could have given testimonies (most probably not written but just oral) about that after their return from Constantinople… I think a lot of mysteries surrounding the Shroud’s obscure history would get rational answers IF (the “IF” is important again!) it was really the Shroud of Turin that was put in public display in 1203 1204 in Constantinople and IF this was the very first public showing of the inner part of this relic… This would also give a credible answer to the very good questioning of Art Science. It is true that the Shroud of Christ was not considered as the premiere relic of Christendom during the Byzantine period (the “True Cross” was) and that historical fact would be easily explained if almost nobody during that period of time was aware that there really was a body imprint of this Shroud with lots of bloodstains showing all the stigmata of Christ !!! Imagine that the inner part of the Shroud was constantly kept away from public eyes (most probably hidden inside a reliquary) during all these years until the public showing of 1203 1204… I really think this would explain many things….","date":"2012-09-12","mins":"11:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-16198","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Hello M. Freeman ! First of all, you don’t have to be sorry for disagreeing with me on one particular topic (i.e. The Shroud of Constantinople). I have no problem with people who disagree with me as long as (like you do) they do it with intellectual honesty and they can bring solid arguments (and not just weak speculations that come almost solely from their imagination) to defend their point of view. And I agree with you completely on the fact that Wilson’s arguments are very weak (I even prefer to use the term “partial” in every sense of this word !!!). I also see that we agree (unlike some Shroud scholars who are evidently biased in their judgement in order to make links between some ancient texts and the Sudarium of Oviedo) on the FACT that the word sudarium did not always mean a little cloth in ancient texts. It’s very important to understand that FACT… Point #1 : It would be effectively a very good thing if you or another scholar could verify the path of Halberstadt just to see if there are some “traces” that can be found concerning these cloths relics that are supposed to have been brought there. If you find something, please let us know ! Point #2 : It’s a very complex subject. I agree with you that the evidence is pretty thin in order to link the Shroud of Constantinople and the Shroud of Turin. Effectively, the testimony of de Clari is the only one that is clear enough to understand that he’s talking about a Shroud of Christ with a body image on it (and it’s important to note that he was not just talking about a face image). BUT… When you put this testimony alongside the testimony of Mesarites written just 3 or 4 years earlier that make a very strange (no matter what David Mo can think, this is an odd reference) to the nudity of Christ while talking about his burial Shroud and alongside the drawings of the Pray codex (which is a book that was manufactured under the King of Hungary Bela III who had spend a long time in Constantinople before being his reign (ref.: Emmanuel Poulle), I think that allow us to build a much stronger case in favor of this possible link. And concerning the fact that there was some suffering Christ icons before the beginning of the 13th century, I never doubt this reality but the FACT is that it WAS NOT an artistic trend at that time ! Artistic revolutions (any of them) never start from nothing and you can ALWAYS found some exceptions to the rule… But that doesn’t change the fact that the trend to show a suffering, bloody and dead Christ really came strong during the 13th century and before that time, these kind of gruesome icons of Christ were certainly not fitting well in the theological, religious and social context of the time (prior to the sack of Constantinople), particularly in the Eastern Church. This is another important aspect of the question to understand : the artistic trends were most probably linked tight with the theological, religious and social context of their time and I have no doubt that the possible first ever showing of the inner part of the Shroud just before the sack of Constantinople could have had a huge impact on starting (or more probably accelerating) a change of mentality inside the Church and also at a more global and social level that finally lead to the appearance of this artistic trend of showing a suffering Christ in religious art. Concerning the Venice France difference, I think it’s important to take good note of the letter written in August 1st, 1205 by Theodore Komnenos Doukas Angelos (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore Komnenos Doukas). This letter (I know it is contested but Poulle in one article mention a reference in which we can found a copy of the original letter) state that it was not the Venetians crusaders who have stolen the Shroud but the French crusaders. The letter states that the Venetians were more interested by the gold that could be found in Constantinople. I think that’s explains why the Shroud of Constantinople could have ended up in Lirey instead of Venice. Also, I think there are some references to the fact that it was French crusaders (in that group, there was supposedly Othon de la Roche who could have been the first European owner of the Shroud) who sacked the Church of Blachernes and not Venetians crusaders… I think that can give us a true rational explanation for the Shroud’s presence in France in the 14th century… Of course, this is pretty thin evidence but nevertheless, we cannot certainly exclude this possibility on that sole base. Don’t forget also that Jeanne de Vergy (Geoffroy I de Charny’s wife at the time of his death) was a relative of Othon and that’s certainly not a hasard IF (the IF is important) the Shroud of Lirey was really the Shroud of Constantinople..","date":"2012-09-12","mins":"1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-16362","author":"yannick_clément","post":"All I know Dave is : 1 de Clari’s account directly refers to a complete body image on the relic considered by the people of Constantinople as the true Shroud of Christ. You can’t deny this basic historical FACT. 2 Mesarites reference to the nudity of Christ in link with his burial shroud (which is most probably the same shroud that de Clari saw 3 years later) is VERY ODD in that context because we know for a FACT that absolutely no other artwork from that era showed a nude Christ in the scene of his burial (particularly true concerning the epitaphios) except for one drawing found in the Pray codex. This is another historical FACT that cannot be denied, even though when we analyze it alone, it cannot be taken as any kind of proof that there was a body image on the cloth. 3 There is one drawing in the Pray codex which is the only know artwork of that era to clearly depict some very particular characteristics that we see on the Shroud (like the famous burn holes and the nudity of Christ for his burial) while, at the same time, it should not be seen as a proper copy of the Shroud because the general style of the depiction is pretty much like any other images of the burial of Christ that we see on other epitaphios of that time. These are 3 important HISTORICAL FACTS that should be considered TOGETHER in order to make a proper historical interpretation (something that you seem to avoid doing desperately). And when we do this, we have no choice than to conclude that the probability that a Shroud of Christ that showed a complete body image of a nude Christ on it was present in Constantinople some time prior to the sack of the city in April 1204 is quite good, even though the 3 facts I report above are not enough to be considered as a real proof. That’s why any credible historian will conclude that the first sure date for the appearence of the Shroud is during the second half of the 14th century in Lirey, France and not around 1200 in Constantinople. But at the same time, it would be a terrible mistake for an historian not to consider seriously (or worse, to simply reject) the possibility for the Shroud to have been kept in Constantinople around 1200 I really think that’s the most honest way to analyze the situation. Concerning your first meditation that you wrote above, Bara was not wrong. You have to understand that he was referring mostly to paintings of Jesus on the cross !!! And the only depiction of Christ nude on the cross he could find was these artworks done in Toscani in the 15th century. And one last thing versus your recent comments : Do you need to be an astrophysicist to conclude that the Earth turn around the Sun ? No ! All you have to do is consult credible and reliable scientific sources ! That’s the same thing for any historical research done concerning the obscure years of the Shroud !!!

Don’t you think it would be logical? Of course, all this depend of whether or not the Shroud of Constantinople was the same as the one kept in Turin today. But when we consider also the testimony of Nicolas Mesarites written 3 or 4 years earlier (another eyewitness testimony) while he talked strangely about the nudity of Christ (which can be considered as a possible indirect reference to the nudity of the man of the Shroud) and also the piece of evidence we found in the Pray codex that the Shroud of Turin was most probably already present during the 12th century and it is probable that it was kept in Constantinople, I think all this build a pretty good case in favor of the hypothesis that the Shroud of Constantinople was effectively the one kept in Turin today. And if it was so and if the public showing of 1203 and 1204 was the very first time the inner part of the Shroud (with all the injuries, bloodstains and body image we can see) was publicly showed to the faithful, I don’t have any doubt at all about the fact that it probably had a huge influence on Christian art, even if other things could also have contributed for this change (like the epidemies that were going on in Europe during that era, the spirituality linked with the stigmata of St Francis of Assisi, etc.)..","date":"2012-09-09","mins":"6:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-16117","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I have 4 thing to say to David Mo : 1 It’s a big mistake to separate things like you do when it comes to do a good historical analysis about one particular period. You got to ANALYZE THE WHOLE PICTURE that can be built from all these historical data. And when you consider the testimony of de Clari, the testimony of Mesarites and the drawings found in the Pray codex, you must acknowledge with me that these data CAN be linked with the Shroud of Turin. I say CAN and not MUST BE. In the present state of our historical knowledge, there’s a very interesting possibility there that should be left open… One thing’s for sure : these 3 documents cannot be used by anyone to completely discard the possibility that the Shroud of Turin could have been in Constantinople between at least the middle of the 12th century and the sack of the city in 1204. 2 Mesarites talking about the nudity of Christ in relation with his Shroud his pretty strange because as I know, at the time Mesarites wrote his manuscript, the only depiction of Christ burial showing him naked could be found in the Pray codex !!! Don’t come saying it was something natural to associated the nudity of Christ and his burial Shroud !!! If I’m right, in normal Jewish or Christian burials from that era, it would have been completely odd to leave the dead naked… 3 Concerning the probable relation between the Pray codex and the Shroud, if the monk who did the artworks in the Pray codex never saw the Shroud but just incorporated one very particular and noticeable detail from the Shroud that he heard from another person (who was an eyewitness) into a more standard artwork that fit in the category of the Epithaphios, I don’t think it would be strange to see a result like we see in the Pray codex. Why necessarily thinking that the monk who did the artwork saw the Shroud with his own eyes ? Can’t that monk heard (or read) some partial information about the Shroud coming from another person ? I think it’s truly possible, especially when you consider the fact that this Pray codex has been manufactured far away from Constantinople… 4 The artistic change that occurred at the beginning of the 13th century maybe doesn’t need the Shroud of Turin (I say maybe because I’m not so sure about that), but IF the Shroud that the crusaders saw with their own eyes was the Shroud of Turin, I think it’s fair to assume that this vision had some influences on later depictions of Christ related to his Passion, death and burial. One thing’s for sure : an important change like that in religious art don’t come from nowhere. It must come from one or many things that have a profound effect on theology and art. It can be something else than the Shroud and his image of course, but I think it’s fair to consider the possible influence of the Shroud on this kind of change.

And concerning my second hypothesis (the artist would have wanted to represent the Shroud of Christ that was kept in Constantinople), it should be noted that such an idea is somewhat problematic in the light of the historical facts. Effectively, the first mention of a Shroud of Christ (here, I’m not talking about the Mandylion who arrived in that city in 944 and who was a small cloth showing only the face of the living Christ, which had nothing to do with a burial cloth of Christ) being kept as a relic of Jesus’ burial cloth in Constantinople only dates from the end of the 11th century and not from the very beginning of that century, like the painting you showed us. And it is also problematic in the light of the testimony of a monk that dates from around the same time of this painting (around 1000 A.D.) and who claimed having seen the Shroud of Christ while visiting the city of Jerusalem! But, nevertheless, even if around the year 1000 A.D., the Shroud was still kept in Jérusalem instead of Constantinople, it is still possible to think the artist who did the painting wanted to represent this great relic of Christ… But again, because there’s no bloodstain and no body image on it, it is impossible to know if this cloth is the same as the one kept now in Turin.

Ray Rogers is the most known example of that. As a non expert in ancient textile, he did a proper documentary research before and after the STURP investigation of 1978 (even though we learned recently that the sources he used concerning the ancient use of saponaria didn’t seem to have come from Pliny the Elder who wrote about another washing product made with olive oil and also used in ancient Egypt) and also he knock on the door of some ancient textile experts (like Anna Maria Donadoni who was the conservator at the Turin’s museum of Egyptology) to get proper answers to his questions. Armed with this new and proper knowledge, he was then able to build a strong case in favor of the authenticity of the Shroud (i.e. That it was a real burial shroud that has enveloped for a short period of time the body of a real crucified man that can well be the historical Jesus of Nazareth).

It’s completely pathetic… Here’s again the hypothesis of Paul Vignon and this one is much more credible than this Mandylion non sense that everyone’s in the Shroud world who’s not so sure about the authenticity of the Shroud want so bad to belive in ! Here’s the hypothesis of Vignon that doesn’t rely on a bunch of speculations and extrapolations and that is not base on legendary or theological stuff : A special feature of this iconographic evidence is the evident likeness of the isolated head of the Shroud to the Mandytions. With long hair, staring eyes and absence of neck, it almost seems to be their negative. Could this similarity, coupled with the anomalies common to both, give us the moral certainty that the Shroud was the unique acheiropoietos, kept, as Vignon believed, in some monastery easily accessible to the theologians and artists of Edessa? For centuries it was a holy, but mysterious and embarrassing relic; suddenly, under pressure from the Monophysites, the Orthodox Clergy realise the role that could be played by a copy of the Face of the Shroud, if turned into a living portrait of Christ. The climate was right in the sixth century with the decline of relics in favour of icons. The Abgar legend with Ananias5 role as painter was to hand. All that had to be done was to have a copy made on cloth, “process” it by incubation, give it a plausible miraculous origin and the desired weapon was there to confound the Monophysites (Note : this was an heretic group that was present in the Middle East from the 5th to the 7th century, and that doesn’t believe in the humanity of Christ. In fact, they just believe in his devine nature), put the Persians to flight and become in course of time the most holy Mandylion. Have we here then the unique source of all “true likenesses”, Veronicas, Epitaphioi and the “figured shrouds” of the West? Now, it’s up to you to show proof that Vignon’s was wrong ! And in the end, you believe what you want. But at least, understand that outside the Shroud world, the vast majority of real historians sees the Wilson hypothesis as a big joke..","date":"2012-02-15","mins":"4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"id":"comment-8321","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Scavone paper, sorry to say that, is the most full of bias paper on the subject that I’ve read in all my research.

This letter, on the contrary, is a proof that, during those days, there was a shroud AND the Mandylion being kept at the same place, namely Constantinople ! There is nothing in this letter, I repeat folks, nothing in this letter to suggest he was referring to the Mandylion !

I’ll say it again : Any good historian knows that the context and the style of an ancient text is what’s matter the most and that you cannot take as seriously a legendary or theological text as you can take seriously a list of relics for example… But, again, most people in the Shroud world, because of their own little agendas, don’t make this basic difference.

The context of the “Narratio” completely forbids us to see any direct link between the Mandylion and the Shroud of Turin.

People get so fooled about those text simply because they don’t make any difference between a descriptive kind of text (like a list of relics) and a theological or legendary kind of text !!! And this lead to every speculations and extrapolations we see in the Pro Shroud world about the Mandylion ! It’s pretty pathetic really… Making no diffence between a list of relics and a legendary text is not the way to do great history. What is really important to keep always in mind when you analyse those kind of texts is the CONTEXT and the NATURE of the text. If this is a text written to give a spritual or moral message and if this is a theological, poetic or legendary kind of text, no way you can take for granted the descriptions and informations contains in it… In fact, you have to be VERY PRUDENT versus the real historical value of those kind of text.

I think it’s just a “psychological suggestion” kind of thing that make some people say that the face on the Manoppello vail come from the same man than the one who was buried in the Shroud. That’s my personal reflection on the possibility that the vail and the Shroud can be related. Now, for the Veronica vail, I think it’s true that the authentic cloth is not in Rome no more because there’s some good clues to show that the one in Rome is a copy (and not even an exact copy) of the original. I also think it is possible that the Manoppello vail can be the authentic Veronica vail that was stolen from Rome. But, as I said earlier, I don’t think this relic is directly related to the Shroud of Turin. And since I believe the Shroud is authentic, I have to think this Manoppello vail (maybe the authentic Veronica vail) have to be a false relic (most probaly an artwork)..","date":"2012-01-08","mins":"8:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/08/the-veronica-is-not-in-st-peters/","cat":"art","title":"The Veronica is not in St. Peter’s"},{"id":"comment-6122","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Christmas must be consider has the Feast of the Incarnation of God into our humanity.
