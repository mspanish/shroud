The one in Argenteuil would have been the one piece tunic that Jesus wore on his way to the cross and that’s why we found blood traces on it, while this one from Trier doesn’t seem to have blood on it. So, it is said that the tunic of Argenteuil would have been the one that Jesus would have wear on his skin, while the other one in Trier would have been wear by Jesus over the one from Argenteuil. If this one from Trier is authentic (I seriously doubt it but if), then it would mean that Jesus would not have wear it from the moment of the scourging until his death, and that makes sense. I know that some researchers have studied the tunic of Argenteuil and it’s interesting that they also found AB blood type like the Shroud and the Sudarium and they said that the blood stains on it present a very good match with the blood stains on the back of the man of the Shroud. But I don’t think those studies have been published in a peer reviewed journal, so we have to be really prudent with those kind of claims. Nevertheless, it’s interesting. What is also interesting is the fact that there was such a tunic in the lot of relics that saint Louis king of France bought from the latin emperor of Constantinople in 1247. But the thing is this : The one from Argenteuil and the one from Trier seems to have been in those places during the 12th century on ! So, would that mean there was a 3rd tunic of Christ in the Sainte Chapelle of Paris ??? You see, all those other relic of Christ have not a great credibility. I have a great doubt about their possible authenticity. Nevermind the fact that I don’t see a Roman soldier giving a price that he won at the foot of the cross (for the one piece tunic) to the new christian community !!! Doesn’t sound logical at all. For the chalice of Valencia, I’ve heard of it here and there but I never study this one, so I really don’t have a real opinion about it. But what I found strange, is the fact that there is other supposed authentic chalice in other places in Europe and Middle East ! So, again, a great doubt still exist… I’ve heard of one chalice that was found during archaeological excavations at the site of a Church in Antioch. I don’t know much about this one too but the few things I’ve read about it seems interesting.

Nothing at all ! In my mind, if God was able to create the world from nothing, he is surely able to incarnate himself in the embrio issued from a normal sexual act ! I truly believe, like many scholars, that this part of Luke and Matthew is severily tint of Christian legendary tales and as no great value from a historical point of view (just like rising of the Saints reported only in Matthew after the death of Christ).

I also think it was in a way caused by a problem that the Church (greatly influenced by the pharisaic side of St Paul) had at the time concerning sexuality, which was always wrongly considered as something automatically bad, mean, bestial and dirty… So, for me, this dogma has nothing to do with the historical reality (there’s great clues to think this in the Gospels themselves) and as I say, I look at it with a smile, trying to only search the symbolic message of spiritual purity (instead of the “pharisaic” obsession for physical purity) in it. And in the end, for me, this dogma is not important at all because, true or false, it doesn’t change ANYTHING versus who Jesus was (the Son of God who possessed the 2 natures), what he accomplished (the definitive revelation of who God really is) and the great human and spiritual value of Mary of Nazareth. In fact, if this dogma would had never been present in the Credo of the Church, I really don’t think that would have change a thing concerning the heart of the Christian message which is supposed to be focussed around the revelation of who God really is (i.e., Love) by Jesus.

Redford, in your interesting comment, you talk much about the divinity of Jesus (and how your faith in this is not driven at all by the Shroud and the Sudarium) and you also talk much about the importance of the Shroud and the Sudarium if both relics are authentic. I agree with you to a certain point BUT… Did you stop asking yourself this question : And what if the Shroud and/or the Sudarium were talking to us much more about the humanity of Jesus Christ than his divinity ??? Almost every person (I’m not talking about you here) that is interested in the Shroud these days seem to always focus on the divine nature of Christ in relation with the body image on the Shroud to the detriment of the great proofs of his human nature (if these relics are authentic, as I believe they are) !!!! I think it would be a very good think for most Christians interested in these relics if they could start to focus more on the material proofs (there are many) of the human nature of Jesus that we can trace on these cloths instead of always seeking the marvelous and the supernatural. By doing this, I’m sure they would start to understand a bit more who Jesus really was and, by implication, who God really is !!! The Incarnation of God was not a joke and, for me, we can see some great proofs of that on the Shroud of Turin (and maybe also on the Sudarium, except for the fact that I’m not so sure about the authenticity of this other relic associated with Jesus). And if we push the reflection ever further, we can see the greatness of the love of God in these material proofs of his Incarnation. That a God accept to share the same humanity (a real humanity like anyone else that was not a semblance of humanity like some heretics thought over the centuries) than ours (with all the implications that goes with this), it tells you a lot about his love for us all !!! I think everyone interested in the Shroud should meditate on that for a while… Personally, the more I look at the Shroud and the more I study it, the more I see the human side of Jesus instead of his divinity (which doesn’t mean I don’t trust in his divine nature).

That statement can be backed up by almost every medical experts that have studied the body image and the blood and serum stains we can see on the cloth… Let’s never forget that most important information about Jesus that the Shroud of Turin has to say to everyone of us : Jesus was a real human being with a real body (and consequently a real corpse) that was not different than anyone else. I know this can sound “chocking” for some religious people, but that’s what the Shroud has to say and that’s exactly what the Church is teaching and that’s also exactly what we can interpret from the Gospel accounts of Jesus life and death. There’s a very good coherence between all this in order to understand that the Incarnation of God WAS NOT A JOKE, despite all the different heresies (like the Monophysites who were totally denying the human nature of Jesus) about that aspect of Christ that have constantly arised in every era since Jesus death and Resurrection happened. To me, the Shroud is a wonderful proof (I dare to used the word) of the humanity of Jesus Christ. In that respect, you can be sure that he had the same kind of chromosome than anyone else, just like it was proven that he had the same kind of blood than anyone else.

In it, there’s a very interesting note concerning a presentation done by Professor Giovanni Imbalzano in which he called attention to the 3 D effect of CHEMICAL THERMOGRAPHIC IMPRINTS, which could offer precious information about the Shroud image. If Dan could find the text of this presentation (it is possible that a review of it can be found in Sindon #30), I think it would be interesting to publish it on the blog. We constantly hear this false statement in the pro Shroud world: “The 3 D nature of the Shroud image is totally unique.” A long time ago, I point out that such a statement is completely wrong and, as a proof, I pointed out the experiment done with the VP 8 image analyzer done by John De Salvo in the 1980s with imprints of plants on paper that truly gave the same kind of 3 D results than the Shroud image with the VP 8 and, from this note concerning Prof. Imbalzano’s presentation in Bologna, it seems that other examples of natural imprints that contained 3 D information exists… All this is truly a bad thing for all those who defend the idea that the Shroud image can only be linked with the Resurrection of Christ and can, therefore, represent a physical proof of that supernatural event, because these people often used the wrong idea that there is no image in the world that was naturally formed and which contain 3 D information, in order to back up their religiously biased ideology. Because we now know for sure that this is a wrong argument, here’s what I have to say to those people: if other natural imprints can present the same kind of 3 D information than what we found in the Shroud image, then why this body imprint could not have been caused by a natural interaction between a crucified body and the surface of the cloth, as defended over the years by, among others, Vignon, Barbet, Legrand, Father Rinaldi, Baima Bollone, Pellicori, De Salvo, Mills, Rogers and recently by two Italian scientists named Fazio and Mandaglio (who conclude that the Shroud image is most probably the product of a low temperature chemical process like Maillard reactions and/or thermal radiation released after death by a corpse)? Using Occam’s razor, wouldn’t it be the most simple and rational explanation for the image on the Shroud? After all, this image is really showing a dead body in rigor mortis and not a glorious body… So Dan (or anyone else who will read this), if you can find a numeric copy of the presentation done in 1982 by Prof. Imbalzano (in English of course!), that would be great to share it with us on this blog! In fact, that would change from all the supernatural craziness that has completely polluted the pro Shroud world in recent years and, therefore, gives a bit of fresh air to this parallel world that desperately need it. And here’s another interesting note to conclude: In one of their recent paper about the Shroud, Fazio and Mandaglio have destroyed the wrong argument often used by those who think the Shroud image have been caused by the Resurrection of Christ, i.e. That the non homogeneous distribution of colored fibers in the image area (where we can often see a non colored fiber being immediately adjacent to a colored fiber) cannot, in any way, be due to a natural phenomenon. Effectively, not only we now know that the Shroud image is not the only imprint in the world that possess 3 D information, we also know (thanks to Fazio and Mandaglio, among others) that a very mild phenomenon like a low temperature chemical process and/or thermal radiation released after death by a corpse can cause an uneven (also called non homogeneous or stochastic) distribution of colored fibers in one single thread of a linen cloth. When we take seriously into account all these FACTS, we are forced to conclude that a possible complex and mild natural process (still undetermined yet) must rank very high among the most probable explanations regarding the presence of a body image on the Shroud. And if this hypothesis is correct, such a natural process could not have come from anything else than the very close proximity of a dead and tortured corpse with an ancient linen shroud for less than 72 hours (i.e. Before the release of the first liquids of putrefaction by the corpse)..","date":"2013-04-01","mins":"4:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/01/an-easter-meditation-on-the-shroud-as-a-sign/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An Easter Meditation on the Shroud as a Sign"},{"id":"comment-6654","author":"yannick_clément","post":"You understand it perfectly Ron.

Matthew (who was surely a completely different person than Matthew the apostle) add those elements in his gospel, probably to give some spiritual teachings. That’s why we always have to be prudent with the historicity of every parts of the bible and not take everything literally.

I just want to say that it is not because the journal have a good impact factor, a high degree of seriousness or a great deal of credibility that a paper published in this journal is necessary a good one ! One doesn’t necessarily go with the other. It is also important to remember this fact. That’s exactly like the New York Yankees in baseball ! It is not because you play for the Yankees that you’re necessarily an extraordinary player !!! It’s the same thing with a scientific journals versus a scientific article. Of course, this fact make things even more complex when it’s time to judge the pertinence or the importance of a scientific article, but this is the reality and we cannot change it. Personally, when it comes to judge an article, I focus mainly on the conclusions of the article and compare them with all the data and observations we know for sure (or with a high level of certainty) about the Shroud. After that, I have to reflect upon those conclusions (and often about the methology that was used to reach them) to see if it make sense versus all the Shroud data. It’s not an easy task !!! But in the end, I think there’s 2 very important principles that we must keep in mind when it comes to judge the pertinence of any scientific paper (I talked about it before) : 1 Never take for granted a paper JUST because it is published in a peer reviewd scientific journal (and this is true no matter what’s the prestige associated to this journal). 2 ALWAYS wait until there’s an INDEPENDENT confirmation of the findings reported in this paper before taking those conclusions for granted.

Yesterday evening, I watched again the entire presentation made by Maloney at the Columbus conference in 2008 and I can definitively say that he was truly a defender of the invisible repair hypothesis proposed by Benford and Marino and backed up later on by Ray Rogers and John Brown. In fact, Mr. Maloney’s critical view of Mc Crone’s conclusion that the Shroud must have been in an artist studio is nothing else than a supportin favor of Benford and Marino’s hypothesis. What Mr. Maloney said in reality is that it is truly possible that some particles of Madder rose, Gum Arabic and an aluminium mordant were scattered in other places of the Shroud (like in the two areas where Mc Crone discover them) and this could be due to a light contamination of these areas by a medieval reviewer. It’s important to note that this could also have been caused by the numerous manipulations and the numerous folding and unfolding of the cloth over the centuries… I’m surprise that Maloney did not talked about that possibility in his speech because, in my mind, this is the most probable one. But in the end, what’s important to understand is the fact that Maloney’s point of view on this question is truly a critical review of Mc Crone’s conclusion that the Shroud has spend some time in a medieval artist studio and also a critical review of Nitowski’s conclusion concerning a possible presence of aloes and myrrh on the cloth than anything else, as well as a support in favor in favor of Benford and Marino’s hypothesis. And when we consider the important fact that Ray Rogers himself never found traces of these substances elsewhere on the Shroud than in the C14 area, I have no difficulty to follow Maloney’s opinion… The only question that remains open is why Rogers never wrote about Mc Crone’s findings reported by Mr. Maloney when he published his own findings about the C14 threads he analyzed. It’s a bit strange and Giorgio was right to bring that on the table. But in the end, I think it’s fair to presume that if Rogers would have address that issue, his explanation would have been pretty much the same as the one proposed by Mr. Maloney, which is by far the most rational one in the light of the fact that Mc Crone have only reported having found these substances in only two samples over the whole batch collected by STURP all over the cloth..","date":"2013-05-22","mins":"8:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/18/because-it-needed-to-be-said-contaminated-in-the-weavers-workshop/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Because it Needed to be Said: Contaminated in the Weaver’s Workshop"},{"id":"comment-34327","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Correction for my previous comment: Mc Crone only stated he found the presence of trace of Madder rose in two samples from the Shroud and not Gum Arabic and/or an aluminium mordant, which was only found by Rogers in the threads coming from the C14 corner.

When I did those researches, I took some notes and last evening, I read again those notes and found a probably better explanation than the one proposed by Paul Maloney concerning the claim made by Nitowski that she was able to find traces of aloes and myrrh in a Shroud sample. Maloney believed that the material Nitowski took for traces of aloes and myrrh was in fact madder rose and gum Arabic that would have been used in the manufacture of the Shroud and would then be present everywhere on the cloth. I’m glad I retrace my notes on the subject because it can truly help to set the record straight. The other explanation comes from a paper written by Sue Benford and Joe Marino and presented at a Shroud conference in 2008 (in Columbus, Ohio). Here’s what the two authors wrote about the conclusion made by Nitowski: “An archaeologist, the late Dr. Eugenia Nitowski, who obtained numerous Shroud fibers from (Raymond) Rogers, conjectured that the red particle contaminates discovered by Kohlbeck were the burial spices Aloes and Myrrh. However, this assumption was based solely on her comparison of the debris with reference photos of the suspected substances and not via chemical analyses. She reported: “The study could go no further (beyond photo comparison), because of the inability to perform testing which would either remove or destroy materials from the tapes.” Along with the lack of any chemical characterization of the debris, the fact that the singular yarn (1 FH) with the impurities came from the ventral missing corner exposed medieval Holland cloth and not the main Shroud, argues strongly against Nitowski’s assumption that the debris was from burial spices. Based on the Quad Mosaic data and Roger’s findings, it is far more plausible that the 1 FH impurities were also red Madder and Gum Arabic as chemically verified by Rogers in multiple adjacent samples.” Note that this red Madder and Gum Arabic have only been found by Rogers in the corner of the Shroud where the C14 samples have been taken in 1988 and allowed him to conclude that the results of this radiocarbon dating are certainly not accurate because this particular corner of the Shroud is not representative at all of the main body of the cloth in term of chemical composition. Note also that this 1 FH sample of the exposed Holland backing cloth was collected by STURP in 1978 in a zone that is immediately adjacent to this C14 corner and it is highly probable that a portion of the alien substances found there by Rogers was able to moved over time and contaminated the whole area where this 1 FH sample had been taken. Effectively, it is a well established fact that the numerous folding and unfolding of the Shroud over the years have caused an important mechanical stress that has allowed the different particles present on the cloth to move away from their original locations. To summarize the situation correctly, we can say that unless new direct chemical and/or spectroscopic tests on the Shroud can confirm the presence of aloes and myrrh and/or madder rose and gum Arabic elsewhere on the cloth, it’s much better to consider Nitowski’s claim that there is aloes and myrrh on the Shroud and Maloney’s claim that madder rose and gum Arabic were used in the fabrication of the cloth as scientifically unfounded. So, in the end, instead of seeing Nitowski’s claim has an indication that there can be aloes and myrrh on the cloth or that there can be madder rose, gum Arabic and an aluminium mordant everywhere on the Shroud, we can see instead her finding as another potentially good confirmation of Rogers’ findings concerning the anomalous C14 corner. I also think that Paul Maloney’s conclusion that these substances were in fact used in the manufacture of the original Shroud is quite simply a pure extrapolation on his part, most probably done to contradict Mc Crone’s conclusion that the Shroud spend some times in an artist studio. Truly, such a highly speculative conclusion cannot be backed up scientifically since no other traces of the material discovered by Nitowski has been found in other Shroud samples taken from STURP in 1978 elsewhere on the cloth… In fact, such an extrapolation on the part of Maloney remind me a great deal of what many Shroud experts have done years ago when they took the discovery done by textile expert Raes who found cotton in the sample he took from the same corner where the C14 sample was later taken and they extrapolate that finding to the whole cloth. Based on the whole spectrum of data collected by the STURP team in 1978, it’s important to understand that these two very similar extrapolative conclusions concerning the cotton found by Raes and the other substances found by Nitowski near the C14 corner are most probably wrong and come from the same type of erroneous reasoning that we can summarize like this: “Because some specific substances have been found in one tiny area of the Shroud, we can conclude that these substances are most probably present everywhere on the cloth”. Such an extrapolative reasoning is not scientific at all and the two cases I just described are two very good examples of the great danger of making huge mistakes when you make this kind of extrapolation. Note that this is also true for the C14 dating that was done in 1988, which only dated one tiny part of the whole cloth… Here’s the complete reference for the paper written by Benford and Marino: Sue Benford and Joseph G.

Remember that the obligation for celibacy only came very late (during the Middle Ages) !!! All the Apostles were probably married… So, following my argumentation Andy, I ask you the question: Do you agree with me that it’s about time that the Church let the priest free to decide whether they want to get married or not ??? Jesus never ordained women simply because women in his patriarcal society were considered on the same level than a dog (and this is not a joke!). THIS IS THE HISTORIC TRUTH ! How in the world he could have taken a women in the group of the twelves ? Never ! As I said, he would have been stone to death in Galilea on the first day and would never have reached Jerusalem !!! This argument of yours Andy (which is the official argument of the Vatican that I have heard many times) is not fair at all for women because it does not take account of the historical context of Jesus time. Sad to say but it’s an argument of men FOR men. You would rarely see a free women agreeing with such an argument ! But the main thing to understand is that such a question only concern the discipline inside the Church. In the end, it’s not that important because this is not what’s at the heart of Jesus message, which is : 1 Love God and 2 Love every humans. Sticking too much on these disciplinary questions while not allowing any possibility of change can make people look like the Pharisees of Jesus time (i.e. Close minded people who preferred to follow the human tradition instead of God’s law, which is the law of LOVE and MERCY best described in the Sermon of the mount) and this closeness of mind is exactly what Christ has denonciate the most during his lifetime ! And the fact is this : all those questions of disciple are free to EVOLVE with the evolution of mentality (I prefer to say “with the evolution of our humanity”) !!! It’s wrong to think that all these questions are stuck in concrete and could never change !!!! Remember that contesting the authority and the discipline of his Jewish religion was at the heart of Jesus message… And here’s the most important thing: Once you put love into your reflection, things become very clear ! With the eyes of love, I think it becomes evident that there is no good reason why Women should not be ordained… And here’s my main argument in favor of such a thing: THERE ARE WOMEN WHO RECEIVE THE CALL FOR PRIESTHOOD !!!! Andy, don’t you understand that this is a sign from the Holy Spirit that it is about time that the Church allow the ordination of women ??? And this is the same thing with the marriage of priests. It is about time that the Church allow the freedom of choice ! This is untrue that all the priest are also called for celibacy… One don’t necessarily goes with the other. I’m truly confident that one day (maybe not far from us) a new Pope (certainly not Benedict !!!) will make a great reform in the Church concerning all those disciplinary question that are truly secondary versus what’s at the heart of Jesus message.

To me, this argument doesn’t include “the vision of Love” which should always be at the heart of any decision made by the Church (and we know very well from history that it has not been always the case and that’s an euphemism!!!). Once you put the eyes of love to take a decision concerning who can be priest and who can not, the truth impose rapidly to you : ANY BAPTISED PERSON (WHETHER A MALE OR A FEMALE) SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE PRIEST IF HE OR SHE RECEIVED THE CALL TO DO SO FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT !!!!! To me, it is as simple as that because as I said in my first comment on this topic, I truly believe that God never do any difference between a man and a women and for him, we’re just his children, period. And before being a guy and more importantly than this, Jesus of Nazareth was a HUMAN BEING !!!! And because he truly was a human being like anyone of us (the Shroud is the best “proof” of this), then why the Church stop half of his children (the women, who are by the way also human beings!!!!) to go into priesthood when some of them really receive a call from the Holy Spirit to do so ??? I think this is truly a bad decision and a way to put a hold on an important part of God’s plan for humanity. But as I also said : I truly believe that one day, a new liberal Pope will do the job that the others didn’t wanted to do concerning the welcome of women into priesthood. If the priest is supposed to be the official representative of Jesus on Earth during the Mass, I don’t see any good reason why that person could not be a women because the bottom line of this is that Jesus was a HUMAN BEING well before being a man… And as St Paul once wrote: There are no men and women no more, there are no slaves and free men no more, etc., etc. In the eyes of God, there are only sick and sinner’s children who need MERCY. And we’re lucky enough that God’s real name is LOVE AND MERCY !!! And that was fully revealed on the cross and the Shroud is the imprint of that great moment of APOCALYPSE (REVELATION) !!!

You can be sure of one thing: American Catholics are far from being alone to seek important changes! You should come here in Quebec and you would noticed how liberal it is. The same is also true in France and in many other places in Europe and I’m sure that one day (the sooner the better), this great “wind of change” (that I consider to be a wind blows by the Holy Spirit) will end up producing the changes the Church reallyneeds to be closer to Jesus Christ message of freedom, equality of sex, tolerance over every minority (including gays and lesbians), love and mercy!!! Andy is saying that because I’m a liberal, I’m not well catechized Catholic guy! I just wants him to know that I’m currently reading a very nice book written by a Quebecer Franciscan named Father Roger Poudrier (http://www.rogerpoudrier.ca/) in which he clearly defend the same liberal point of view as mine, never mind the fact that he always rely on the Catechism of the Catholic Church! And be sure that he’s not alone in his case here in Quebec, as well as in other parts of the world. He’s representing a very good example to understand that there are many ways to interpret the same document… Also, I think sometime, people (among them are many “good” Catholics) tend to forget the real meaning of “Catholic” which means “Universal”, which is not what we can see in many aspects of today’s Roman Church!!!.","date":"2013-03-09","mins":"8:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/09/but-they-didnt-ask-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"But they didn’t ask about the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-26945","author":"yannick_clément","post":"That’s your opinion Matthias and I respect it.

You should read again your posts… Forget the law for a time and please, listen to your conscience and your heart !

Do you realize that St Paul is writting 2000 years ago and that knowledge about sexuality have grown a lot since that tim??? If we believe all that St Paul has written about the way to live, then we would still live like in ancient times! And if you (or the official Church or anyone else) is denying the fact that 2 men or 2 women can really love one another, then good for you, but it’s completely off track versus the REALITY… It is a fact that a true loving relationship can be real between 2 men or 2 women and that an heterosexual marriage don’t necessarily produce a child ! Are you aware that 2 persons (whatever their gender) can love one another while they don’t want to have children ? And that surely doesn’t make them more sinner or bad than you and me ! The important thing to judge a relationship is love and only love. If there is true love in one place, why not accepting it ? And concerning your idea that I needed to be catechized, I think you should look at yourself in a mirror my friend because, as I clearly said to you, there are a lot of clergymen that rely on the Catechism of the Catholic Church and who are seeking the same changes inside the Church than me! Father Roger Poudrier in Quebec is a good example, but he’s surely not alone. And I can ensure you that me and Roger Poudrier are as Catholic as you… All along the history of the Church, there were Saints who lead it to some great changes. THAT WILL NOT STOP MY FRIEND ! The heart of Jesus message is the same than it was 2000 years ago, but the understanding of this revelation has never stop growing since… It did not stop at St Paul or St John, who were first century Jews that understood Jesus message with all their religious and cultural background, which is a way of understanding that is very old now and which cannot be seen no more as immutable truth, since they were just limited human beings like you and me. Their very Jewish and unfortunatelly wrong theology related to the so call “sacrificial aspect” of Jesus Passion (which give a portrait of the Father that is far from Love) is just one example that their understanding of Jesus’ revelation about his Father (which was greatly influenced by the sacrifices in the temple) his more and more put aside by many clergymen and faithful in the Church. Why ? Simply because the wind of the Holy Spirit has never stoped since 2000 years ago and the profound understanding of Jesus’ revelation continue to get more and more closer to the truth which can be describe in 3 words : GOD IS LOVE. I always add this : AND NOTHING ELSE ! From a liberal Catholic to a conservative Catholic, I salute you! You got your way of understanding and I got mine, and we will not change a thing about that. I can’t change your mind and you can’t change mine.

He was able to demonstrate that a pretty high resolution image (he talk about a resolution of 1cm !!!) was truly possible with his hypothesis. As Rogers said, the main factor for a good image is the temperature inside the tomb versus the temperature of the dead body. Of course, other factors are important, but this one is the most important. The difference must be close to none and, in the case of the Shroud, it is truly possible that this kind of good condition was present in the tomb… Again, as I said, I don’t think there’s anybody who have fully tested the hypothesis of Rogers. On that base, no one has the right to reject it. Let’s hope some more researches and experiments will be done in the future about that. One thing’s I can say right now : the 2 preliminary experiments of Rogers were sufficiently encouraging that more testing should be done to fully test his hypothesis ! If his 2 experiments would have give very bad results in comparison of the Shroud’s image, I would agree with you that Rogers hypothesis seem to be very problematic. But it was not the case at all !!! They were good enough to comfort him some more in his conviction that a gas diffusion reacting with a thin layer of impurities is probably responsible for a good part of the Shroud’s image. I think we must take good note of that ! Rogers, being the good scientist he was, would have been the first one to drop his hypothesis and start searching for another explanation if he would have judged that the results of his 2 preliminary experiments would have been too much different versus the reality of the Shroud’s image.

I truly believe that it’s one major key to understand the Shroud and his body image. Since the day I noticed that Adler was able to prove that there really are some deposits of pectin on the fibers of the Shroud, I thought that it was an important finding that was really underestimate by the sindonologists. In fact, bizarrely, I never read about that finding anywhere but in Adler’s book (even not in Rogers writings) ! And then, recently, I found in Rogers writings that he too, thought that part of the impurities (he talk about possible deposits of hemicellulose and flax wax) that would be present on the fibers could have come from this retting process. And what is the most interesting thing is that pectin and hemicellulose are 2 major components of the primary cell wall ! So, when Fanti, Di Lazarro, Heimburger and Al. Wrote their paper in 2010, pretending that this primary cell wall was the real image chromophore, I think they were off track a bit, but not that much ! Effectively, I now think that the hemicellulose and the pectin from the primary cell wall were really involved in the image formation but not directly. Instead, I think that the retting process did extract some hemicellulose and pectin from this primary cell wall and left these “impurities” on the fibers. And if Rogers is right, we have to think that some of these deposits were not completely “washed out” during the bleaching process (in a variable amounts, depending of the batch of thread that was bleached). This would explain, in good part, the banding effect on the Shroud and after that, other impurities were added to these “impurities” coming from the primary cell wall, during the fabrication and the washing of the cloth. Then, all these impurities were taken to the top surface of the cloth (on both sides) during his final drying, because of the evaporation concentration process. As Rogers said it well, IF this scenario is correct, then I really think we can forget any image formation process involving some kind of radiation or heat… And the FACT that some pectin and starch deposits have already been found on the fibers from the Shroud is a VERY GOOD INDICATOR that Rogers hypothesis concerning the banding effect and the image chromophore is probably correct… Of course, you’re free to believe something else, but the facts are the facts and I don’t invent them !

I think that can make a real difference in the results. Finally, you said that you still have serious difficulties regarding the motion of emitted gases. It’s understandable. Me too, I must admit that I have some doubts, especially concerning the formation of the back image with a gaseous diffusion process. But, since me and you, we are not expert in this field, I think we should avoid to make too much free assertions about that and let a real expert in chemistry do more testing on the base of Rogers work… And as I said : We must also remember that very special conditions could well have been present inside the tomb and/or inside the Shroud when the image formation process occurred. Remember that we’re not dealing with a normal corpse but a crucified body who was tortured for a long period of time prior to death. It’s my feeling that this very particular factor can well be critical for the image formation. Also, it’s truly possible that other chemical processes (like some molecular transfer done with the help of water vapors) could have been active, along with some amines diffusion… But again, that’s just my personal feeling !

I am open to the possibility that part of the Shroud’s image had been caused by a direct contact process that was natural (chemical), but not completely. Have you seen the result of an experiment made by Lavoie and Adler in the 80s about the blood in the hair on each sides of the face ? They found out that the most probable area where this blood was originally located is the sides of the face, not the hair. If Lavoie and Adler are right about that (and I think they are), that means that the blood transfer and the image formation process was not acting in the same way. If they’re right, blood transfer was only a direct contact process (I don’t think there’s too much doubt about this), but not the image (at least, not completely)… The image was more like a vertical projection from the body to the cloth and only the direct contact point between the body and the cloth would have been created by direct contact. All the rest would have come from a vertical projection, acting at a close distance. The absence of big distorsions is a very good indicator for that. So, maybe you’re partially right.

And what we have to understand is this : In normal conditions, we have to expect a blurred image from that kind of process. But the question is this : How do we know if there was not “special” conditions inside the Shroud and inside the tomb at the moment of image formation ? We can’t be sure of anything… But one thing seem to be very probable in my mind : there was a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on the top surface of the cloth and it is that layer that was colored. And there’s also one other thing that seem to be very probable in my mind : there was some reactive gas (ammoniac , water vapors and maybe some other heavy amines) coming from the crucified corpse. When you put these 2 things together, what is the outcome ? A superficial coloration on the fibers ! And what we have on the Shroud ? A superficial coloration of the fibers ! Because there is a very good probability that these 2 things were really present in the tomb, I have a very hard time to believe that absolutely no portion of the body image was caused by these probable reactive gas (whether they came from the lungs, the pores of the skin or from urea on the skin that was left after the drying of the sweat) !!! Of course, we can ask ourselves the question : Was it another process going on to complete the image and make it more precise ? Maybe ! Who knows ! Here, I think of a possible molecular transfer from the lactic acid that could have been left on the skin after the drying of the sweat (along with other possible product like urea) and that could have react with the surface of the cloth at some distance from the body because of some diffusion of water vapors. That’s another possibility. And I’m sure there are some other natural possibilities too… But again, since we don’t know the exact conditions that prevailed inside the tomb, I think we must be extremely prudent before throwing this hypothesis of Rogers into the garbage ! As Rogers said very well in his book : “When amines and reducing sugars come together, THEY WILL REACT. THEY WILL PRODUCE A COLOR.” LET’S NEVER FORGET THAT because, as Rogers said : THIS IS NOT AN HYPOTHESIS : THIS IS A FACT !!! So, for his hypothesis to be COMPLETELY WRONG, we must assume that there was not enough impurities on the fibers to be colored by a reactive gas and/or there was not enough amines that was coming from the dead body. Personally, I have a hard time to believe that… But in the end, I agree with you : More researches need to be done to fully test Rogers hypothesis in every possible condition we can think of. Remember folks that Rogers, before he died, had not enough time to fully test his hypothesis. He just did some preliminary experiments that gave him some interesting results… I really wonder if, one day, there will be another chemist (a biochemist would be great) who will take Rogers work on the Shroud and push it forward by testing it more deeply ?!?

In the light of Roger hypothesis, this is not a great mystery in my mind. Some anti Rogers person in the Shroud world have make believe that this was inconsistent with Rogers hypothesis, but I really don’t think it is the case. THIS IS A FACT THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE THE SAME AMOUNT OF IMPURITIES ON EACH THREAD. So, if there was not enough impurities on a thread to react with some reactive gas, but there was enough on the next one, I don’t see any mystery in the fact that some threads were colored while the next one was not !!! In the light of the impurities hypothesis, where is the mystery ??? And, to me, this is the same thing that can explain the fact that there is color on one fiber and not on the next one. Same principle… To me, the fact that there is a thread that was colored next to another one that was not (it’s the same thing at fiber level) can well be explain by the image chromophore, if this chromophore is the one postulate by Rogers, i.e. A unequal and non homogeneous layer of impurities on top of the fibers located on the top surface of the cloth (on each sides). There’s a very well known microphotograph of the Shroud that was taken by Mark Evans and where we can see that the coloration is found almost uniquely on the top crown of the thread, and disappear when this thread start to drop in order to pass under the next one in the weave of the cloth. To me, this is pretty consistent with the evaporation concentration process that, in all logic, would have concentrate more impurities on this portion of the thread (the top crown) than on the portion that is located more deeply into the weave… Remember that this evaporation concentration process was most probably active during the final drying of the cloth (after it was washed), at the very end of the fabrication process, while the weaving of the cloth was finish. So, I think this non homogeneous coloration fact first reported by Anoxie and mentioned again by Gabriel is not a mystery at all in the light of Rogers hypothesis and can well be another good indicator that his conclusion about the Shroud concerning the banding effect and the chromophore of the image is CORRECT. I really think the explanation for this fact can well be found first in the ancient bleaching process that would have leave a non homogeneous amount of impurities on the fibers and also (and maybe more) in the evaporation concentration process that was going on at the end of the fabrication of the cloth. Some experiments done with a linen cloth that would contain some carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers should be done in order to verify if my estimation is correct concerning the effect of the bleaching and the effect of the evaporation concentration process at thread level and also at fiber level… And Gabriel, when you answer “only partially” to the second question concerning the symetrical properties of the frontal and dorsal image, can you explain to me on what do you base your answer ? Since we don’t know the exact conditions that prevailed inside the tomb and inside the Shroud, I think it’s hard to answer properly to a question like that. Who knows if some very particular conditions could have caused the formation of these 2 images with the gas diffusion proposed by Rogers ? I agree that, at first sight, the dorsal image seem to be much more difficult to explain with the gas diffusion hypothesis of Rogers, but again, who knows if some very particular conditions could have played a facilitating role for the image formation of the back part of the body ? I think we should be extremely prudent here and leave the door open. I think Gabriel was able to do so, but I would like some precision about is used of the word “partially”… Thanks !.","date":"2012-06-16","mins":"6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"id":"comment-12619","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Thanks for this clarification Gabriel.

And I don’t think it is completely excluded that some diffusion of amines gas from the pores of the body, as proposed by Rogers, or from the surface of the skin, as proposed by Heimburger, could not have been the principal cause for the image of the back on the Shroud.

In the end, like the results that were obtained by Rogers with his 2 preliminary experiments, the important thing would be the interpretation that would be made of the results and this is where there is often problems in science. The problem is not so much in the results, it is often in the interpretation of these results ! In the case of Rogers experiments, if someone read his result while thinking this was a real attempt to obtain an image exactly like the Shroud, of course he will conclude that his hypothesis cannot be applied to the Shroud, but that would be a very bad lecture of the results. I think small scale experiments like you proposed would be cool but only if the scientists involved in it would not pretend to reproduce the Shroud’s image with these kind of tests… The best thing would be to make some textile tests to verify some particular aspects of Rogers hypothesis, especially those concerning the banding effect and the image chromophore.

A now there is a trend right now to think that way but I completely disagree with this kind of thinking. And please, take a VERY GOOD NOTE of what Ray Rogers said about this kind of thinking (you’ll find his quote near the middle of this comment). Everyone’s ready ??? OK, here we go : In many interviews he made, my friend Barrie Schwortz said that any hypothesis that is based on a supernatural event like the resurrection of Christ will forever be impossible to confirmed scientifically, for the unique reason that we can’t go into a laboratory and resurrect people to see what kind of images we can obtain on a linen cloth !!! Starting with this very true comment made by Barrie, I want to push the reflection one bit further… I would say this : It’s also true that no scientist on this planet right now can have access to a fresh crucified body that was beaten, tortured, scourged and crowned with thorns, prior to his death, go into a laboratory with that corpse, put it in a linen shroud made exactly with the ancient method described by Pliny the Elder and remove it after 36 hours to see what kind of images we can obtain !!! In the Shroud world, it’s like almost everybody have forgot this basic fact when it comes to talk about the formation of the body image on the cloth ! And I think it’s THE major reason why science cannot give us a real solid conclusion about the formation of the body image that we see on the Shroud of Turin. That’s also why nobody has ever been able to reproduce the Shroud of Turin ! Effectively, the only way to do this would be to make the kind of realistic experiment I just described and, of course, it’s totally impossible here and now ! Nevertheless, if one day someone can do the kind of realistic experiment I just described with the same “material” that was most probably present in a tomb of Jerusalem almost 2000 years ago, I really think that this person would obtain an image on the cloth. I don’t know if this image would be as good and precise as the Shroud of Turin, but I’m almost certain that we would obtain something and that this “something” could well be close to the Shroud image, physically and chemically. That’s my deep feeling. Of course, because of the non ethical and truly disgusting aspect of it, let’s pray that no doctor Frankeinstein will ever try this kind of realistic experiment ! But anyway, I truly believe it’s the only way someone could reproduce a complete frontal and dorsal body image, like we see on the Shroud, with any kind of success… And because of that, it’s very probable that this body image will never ever be reproduced successfully one day. Also, noticed that this kind of experiment was not done, obviously, by Jackson or any other member of the STURP team when they were testing a lot of different image formation hypothesis ! And I think that’s precisely why they come up empty !!! I often hear this argument : If the body image on the Shroud would have been caused by a natural phenomenon, we would have other examples of body images present on a burial cloth. But this argument is very weak in fact, for 2 major reasons : 1 The vast majority of the burial shroud that were used in ancient time have been corrupt along the dead body they covered. And 2 Even in the few cases were ancient burial garments (or just parts of burial cloths) have been excavated by archaeologists, absolutely none of these cloths can pretend to have been used to buried a crucified body that was beaten, tortured, scourged, crowned with thorns prior to his death. As I said in my last comment, it’s very important to understand that the corpse that was present in the Shroud for less than 36 hours or so was NOT a normal corpse ! It was a type of dead body that we don’t find since the time of the Roman emperor Constantin (first half of the 4th century) !!! Now, as I know, there is absolutely no other burial shroud that was used to buried a crucified man that have been found anywhere ! Because of all these facts, I think we can totally discard the weak (and almost fallacious) argument mentioned above. If, as I think, the type of body image that is on the Shroud can only occurred if there are very special factors present (the most important ones are, of course, the fresh body of a crucified man along with a linen shroud made the ancient way), then isn’t it normal that the Shroud of Turin is the only artefact of that kind in the world ? I really think so ! And that’s precisely why I’m not surprised at all that this burial cloth is the only one of his kind in the world… The only thing that surprise me is the high quality of the body image that is on the cloth, but even that should not lead us to automatically conclude that a miracle (in this case, a by product of the resurrection of Christ is the most popular claim) should have been involved during the image formation process in order to get the result we see on the Shroud ! Rogers talk about that kind of bad thinking in his book and it is important to read what he said about that : “In seeking an understanding of the Shroud, you will often see the statement “Science can not explain the image; therefore, it was produced by a miracle. The Greek recognized the fallacy of an “argumentative leap” (non seguitur) millenia ago. The fact that science has not YET found an explanation PROVES NOTHING. Science continually collects observations and information, and conclusions OFTEN CHANGE with time. Persons who believe in absolute will be unhappy with science. Scientists will be unhappy with persons who demand that they “make up your minds”. I have been called “frivolous” for modifying earlier ideas. It is just part of the job.” And then, Rogers quote Carl Sagan’s famous phrase that fits perfectly well with the situation of the Shroud of Turin : “Absence of evidence is not the same thing as evidence of absence.” What Rogers said is so true ! Personally, I call this thing “the God of the breach” and I think this kind of bad postulate has completely pollute sindonology since his early days at the beginning of the 20th century, but even more, it seem to me, since the STURP team said that they were not able to find a solid conclusion to explain the body image. As Rogers said, the fact that science has not YET found an explanation PROVES NOTHING at all folks ! But despite that reality, we have seen a great number of people, sometimes authentic scientists (who happen to be all Christians by the way), fall in this unscientific trap !!! That’s really sad, but that’s true and that’s the major reason why sindonology has lost a lot of his credibility today… Even if I know some people don’t like to hear this, I’ll say it again : In some cases, nature can really be surprising !!! And I really think that this could be the main reason why the body image on the Shroud looks so “perfect”, even if it’s not completely true (the fact that there’s some part of the body that are missing, like the back of the knees, confirm this). That’s my profound feeling, based on the data we know about the Shroud (that doesn’t necessarily contradict the idea that this image was produced naturally) and, also, based on Ray Rogers work (who offered a complete natural hypothesis that can really account, at least partially, for the image we see on the Shroud). To conclude this comment, I want to say this : Like I said before, it’s evident that the kind of realistic experiment (made with a real crucified corpse) that I mentioned above is impossible to do. But beside that, there’s one realistic experiment that could be done and that could help greatly to confirm or discard Rogers conclusion about the Shroud. The experiment I have in mind is this : It would be a very good thing is someone can recreate another shroud like the Shroud of Turin using the same exact method described by Pliny the Elder, in order to see if some banding effect would be present or not on the cloth !!! I’m sure there are some textile experts specialised in ancient textile that would be skilled enough to do this kind of experiment and I really think that a realistic reproduction like that could help a lot to shed light on the Shroud of Turin. I really wonder why no one has ever done this until this day… Personally, I don’t see any good reason that can prevent someone to do this ! Let’s hope some textile expert could do it one day. In my mind, the sooner, the better !!! While we all wait for the Vatican to allow a new series of direct researches on the relic (this can take a long time), I think this kind of textile experiment would be one of the best experiment to do right now, because it don’t need some sample from the actual Shroud and also, because, technically, I’m sure it would not be so hard to do for some expert in that matter… What do you think of my suggestion of textile experiment ? I have other interesting experiments in mind (most of them to test some biological products and the way they could react with ancient linen), but I think this one really should be done fast.

You’ll find this report here : https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/gas diffusion and the banding effect/#comment 12512 Can you read that again carefully please ? The results were well enough encouraging for him (in comparison with the physical and chemical properties of the Shroud’s image) that he never consider dropping this hypothesis to start searching elsewhere for a better explanation. Like I said, that says a lot to me, because if those experiments would have gave him results very different versus the known properties of the image on the Shroud, you can bet your house that he would have been the very first one to start looking for something else. On the contrary to many researchers in the Shroud world today, Rogers had absolutely no religious agenda to defend and promote. He was completely free to change his mind and history has showed us that he did change his mind about the Shroud on more than one occasion ! This fact talk very loud to me. Since it’s a reality that Rogers never feared to change his mind, why do you think he never changed his mind after he first come up with his gas diffusion hypothesis ? Because he considered that theoretically, this hypothesis could fit realistically with the vast majority of the properties of the Shroud and, more than that, his preliminary experiments gave him results that were good enough for him to continue his researches in that direction. Remember this because I’m convinced that it’s true : Rogers had absolutely no valid reason to defend his hypothesis if, in his mind, the probability that it could fit with the Shroud was low. In that case, he would have search for a better explanation. He did not. That doesn’t tell you something ? Rogers followed the scientific method and that’s where the facts and observations regarding the Shroud have led him… Meditate on that. I think we should wait for another chemist to do more testing concerning Rogers conclusions before even thinking about throwing it to the garbage. It would be a great mistake to do this. I know very well that this is what the members of the supernatural fringe really wants, but sorry for them, Rogers hypothesis rank among the very best hypothesis of image formation we have right now, so it’s not today or even tomorrow that Sindonology will have the right to forget it completely… More researches need to be done before anyone will have the right to do so.

That email from Rogers is like a complementary comment from him versus all the other quotes I’ve already wrote down recently in the long comment you can read at the top of this page and in other recent comments I’ve made on this blog. Here’s what Dan wrote : As most of you know, if you read the many threads of discussion in this forum, Yannick Clément is the strongest and most articulate proponent of Rogers imaging work. I won’t even try to summarize his views. Just go browsing. Rather, I still have a copy of an email I received from Rogers on January 4, 2004. It read, in part, in this version as posted to the Shroud Science Group : “Dear Dan and Researchers: Just to clear up a few items. . . . Fairly thin stagnant zones of gas form near fixed surfaces. Other gases that approach such zones must diffuse through the stagnant gas to reach the surface. Diffusion of gases through other gases is modeled with Graham’s Law of Diffusion. The rates of diffusion are inversely proportional to the square roots of the densities of the gases. Diffusion parallel to the surface of a cloth that covers a body can not be instantaneous, and it will be much slower for heavier molecules. The main products of body decomposition after a few hours are quite heavy molecules. In the context of image formation hypotheses that involve reactive gases, remember that cloth is porous. Gases diffusing to the surface can pass through the pores and be lost. [This fact is probably responsible for the image color on the back of the cloth in the area of the hair. Matted fibers inhibit the diffusion of gases.] This phenomenon will restrict vapor concentrations as a function of the distance from contact points where a body touches a cloth. Cloth surfaces are active and adsorb gases rapidly, a fact that further limits concentrations as a function of distance. John Jackson’s mathematical analysis of image resolution suggested that no single, simple molecular diffusion or radiation mechanism could produce the image observed. However, a combination of systems could offer an explanation, e.g., anisotropic heat flow by radiation from the body to the cloth, attenuated heat flow in the cloth, gaseous diffusion, convection, surface properties of cloth, and the dependence of chemical rates on temperature.” Now, it’s up to you to believe Rogers ideas or not !!!.","date":"2012-06-22","mins":"6:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"id":"comment-12974","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Note : this is a little complementary comment for the one I’ve posted just above… I just realized that I forgot completely to add one important paragraph writen by Dan, just before he wrote « As most of you know… », like you can read above. Here it is : “Ray Rogers was acutely aware of the resolution issue when he proposed a chemistry only solution, a Maillard reaction, as the cause of the image. His work (not in my mind yet a fully formed hypothesis) has since been improperly and unfairly characterized as merely a diffusion hypothesis (e.g. Totally and inappropriately misrepresented in Giulio Fanti’s most recent paper, “Hypotheses Regarding the Formation of the Body Image on the Turin Shroud. A Critical Compendium,” in The Journal of Imaging Science and Technology, (Vol. 55, No. 6 060507 1 060507 14, 2011)).” I have to say that I agree completely with Dan’s point of view, especially concerning the fact that Rogers hypothesis was just in his preliminary form when he published it, as he was still working on it, just before he died in 2005. As I said before, it would be so good to see another chemist expert taking over Rogers work and push it forward !!! A biochemist would be the best person in my mind to take over Rogers work and do more experiment to analyse this hypothesis further. Who knows, maybe this person could come up with an extended version of the hypothesis proposed by Rogers while adding some other chemical processes in it, like the one proposed by Thibault Heimburger involving urea on skin or the one proposed by John De Salvo involving a process pretty much like the Volckringer pattern, involving lactic acid. At the very least, this chemist should consider seriously these complementary hypotheses and look if they could not have acted simultaneously, along with the chemical process proposed by Rogers… And for the Anti Rogers crusade lead by Fanti, I don’t have much to say. It’s so evident that this guy was pissed off when Rogers crushed down his personal hypothesis involving a Corona discharge, that any person interested in the Shroud of Turin should never take what he write against Rogers seriously… One thing’s for sure, I don’t expect Fanti to change his mind soon !!! On the contrary to Ray Rogers, it seem an impossible mission for him to do so, even if all the evidences we now know about the Shroud go against his idea concerning the image formation process !!!.","date":"2012-06-23","mins":"4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"id":"comment-12512","author":"yannick_clément","post":"In order to talk intelligently about image resolution versus the hypothesis of diffusion defended by Rogers (because it’s a popular subject here and many people talk from their strict personal and not necessarily scientific point of view), let’s go in the chapter 12 of his book entitled “Kinetic theory of gases and image resolution and let’s read some important quotes from Rogers : “Graham’s LAW of diffusion follows directly from the fundamental theory (note : the Kinetic theory of gases). NO VALID CLAIM can be made about diffusion and image resolution without reference to the fundamental FACTS.” “Diffusion DOES NOT MEAN the same thing as “diffuse”. The mean free path of a molecule will determine his its diffusion properties. The mean free path is the distance the molecule will go between collisions with other molecules. Such calculations show that molecules can not go very far unimpeded at NORMAL temperatures and pressures. The potential for IMAGE RESOLUTION IS QUITE GOOD.” “The greater the mean free path, the more “diffuse” will be gas dispersion. But each gas have its own mean free path under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. It is NOT VALID TO “ASSUME” a large dispersion for a gas. Depending on its chemical and physical properties, IT MAY NOT DISPERSE VERY FAR.” “Also, if there can be a large change in concentration in a small distance, RESOLUTION CAN BE GOOD. It is NOT VALID TO ASSUME a diffuse image when gaseous diffusion is involved in the image formation mechanism.” “Heavy decomposition amines will have very steep concentration gradient as they diffuse into air. Their concentration in air will be greatly reduce as distance from the body increases. The DIFFUSION LIMITED CONCENTRATION GRADIENT will be a MAJOR FACTOR, but NOT THE ONLY ONE, in calculating the maximum resolution of an image formation mechanism that involves diffusion.” “Fibrous or particulate barriers can inhibit diffusion rates. POROUS BARRIERS INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION of heavy reactive gas on the up stream side of the barrier. This is the principle used in uranium isotope separation by gaseous diffusion, and it would affect concentration gradients during diffusion through hair.” (Note : Here, we have a good sign that Rogers, even if he wasn’t an expert in ancient tissues, knew very well what he was talking about when it comes to gaseous diffusion ! Pretending the contrary would be completely dishonest). “The important point to recognize is that blanket, qualitative statements about diffusion and resolution CAN NOT BE SUPPORTED BY SIMPLE ASSUMPTIONS.” That’s the most important quotes I’ve found in this chapter concerning the theoretical aspect of gas diffusion. We can easily see that what was reported here by Anoxie is not true at all. Rogers never thought that a gaseous diffusion in the Shroud would NECESSARILY produce a low resolution image on the cloth. This kind of assumptions, as Rogers said, must be rejected… And as I said myself, since we don’t know the real conditions that were presents in the tomb and in the Shroud at the time of image formation, how can we be so sure that any gas diffusion through the cloth would necessarily produced a blurred image ??? WE JUST CAN’T !!! As Rogers showed in the chapter 12 of his book, theoretically, it is possible to think that an high resolution image can be produced by a gas diffusion, depending on MANY FACTORS. But in the end, as I said previously in my long comment, even if Rogers scenario is not exactly what happened in the Shroud during the image formation process, it’s not the only possible hypothesis involving some kind of natural process (or processes) that could account for the image on the Shroud. Other scenarios are possible, like the one proposed by Thibault Heimburger in one of his paper (involving a diffusion of ammoniac from the skin) and/or a molecular transfer involving water vapors and/or something else… Also, please, let’s not forget this important aspect of the question : For Rogers, who knew one or two things about gaseous diffusion, it WAS NOT impossible, in theory, to obtain such a high resolution image with the hypothesis he proposed. Here, let’s not forget that, in science, we don’t have the right to completely reject a proposed hypothesis before it has been fully and properly tested in laboratory. For Rogers hypothesis, as well as the other natural hypotheses I just mentioned, I think it’s fair to say that they have not been fully tested yet. So, before completely rejecting Rogers scenario, I think much more experiments to test his ideas should be done in laboratory… I’m sure Gabriel will agree with me about that !!! ; ) On that subject, it’s interesting to note the result obtained by Rogers about 2 experiments he made before his death that we can read the report in the chapters 11 and 12 of his book. First of all, the most important thing to note is that his tests didn’t involve a real crucified corpse. Also, they didn’t involve the same sorts of amines coming from a corpse (he used DETA instead of cadaverine), nor the same kind of linen than the Shroud of Turin (he used a recent linen cloth and saturate it with dextrin solution and then, wash it in Saponaria Officinalis, in order to “simulate” the Shroud’s ancient style). Because of that, we can say that these experiments were just preliminary tests and nothing complete versus the reality of the Shroud. In fact, these tests made by Rogers were just done in order to verify some general principles versus his hypothesis. It’s so important to note this because, as expected, the detractors of Rogers have used his results to completely discredit Rogers hypothesis, even if, on that single base, it is scientifically impossible and completely dishonest to do so ! That tells a lot about the honesty of the anti Rogers clan who wants so much to buried Rogers hypothesis with him that they don’t respect the scientific method at all ! But, never mind the fact that those were just preliminary experiments, there was some interesting results that were reported by Rogers in his books and I thought it was interesting to report them here : 1 “When the temperature of the source (in the case of the Shroud, it would be the corpse) is too high, convection cells are too active, diffusing too widely for good resolution. Resolution IMPROVES AT LOWER TEMPERATURES.” (Note : Remember that one of Rogers conclusion versus the Shroud is that the body image was most probably formed at normal temperature). Let’s continue the report : “A body that had cooled for several hours but has not yet produced high concentrations of amines would give BETTER RESOLUTION than a hot body.” (Note : If we trust the conclusion of the Spanish team of sindonologists versus the sudarium of Oviedo, the corpse would have been put in the Shroud only 2 hours or so after death, leaving well enough time for the body to cool down and also, for the skin the get dry). 2 “The amines MUST BE RELEASED SLOWLY. Too much amine badly REDUCED RESOLUTION. A decaying body would give MUCH BETTER RESOLUTION than any object that had been painted with pure amines.” (Note : Rogers said that because, for his experiments, he painted some objects with amines, so that’s normal that the resolution he obtain was not as high as the Shroud’s image). Let’s keep on the report : “Too much amine would color the ENTIRE CLOTH, OBLITERATING THE IMAGE. A successful image that involved a real body would REQUIRE REMOVAL OF THE CLOTH before extensive decomposition.” (Note : That’s exactly what happen for the Shroud). 3 “The experimental assembly must be kept in a space that is cool and still.” (Note : This is exactly what is expect for a sealed tomb). 4 “An increase in the concentration of reducing saccharides (impurities) on the cloth IMPROVES RESOLUTION. (Note : Because of the evaporation concentration phenomenon that was going on during the drying of the final cloth, a concentration of reducing saccharides (possibly made partially of elements coming from the primary cell wall, like hemicellulose and pectin) would have been present on the top surface of the cloth, on both sides, exactly where the body images have been found). 5 “Modern linen that does not contain suitable impurities WILL NOT PRODUCE AN IMAGE.” (Note : When Rogers talk like that, he mean an image produced with some chemical process). 6 “The higher the cloth above the amine source, the more diffuse the shading. This illustrates the effect of diffusion. (Note : This phenomenon is, theoretically, compatible with the nature of the body image that is on the Shroud). 7 “…much of the background color on the Shroud could be a result of coloration in the SAME SURFACE IMPURITY that enabled image formation. The Shroud shows “ghosts” in NON IMAGE AREAS. The lighter color of the back of the Shroud is probably a result of impurity separation, front to back, during the drying of the new piece of linen (see Pliny the Elder).” (Note : These observations made by Rogers concerning the non image area and the back side of the cloth are totally consistent with his hypothesis regarding the image chromophore. And we have to take good note of the FACT that there were ghosts found in the sticky tapes coming from NON IMAGE FIBERS ! If this is not a clear indication that there are some impurities on top of the fibers and that they constitute not only the chromophore of the image, but also the chromophore for the color of the non image areas of the cloth, then I don’t know what it is ! Like Marcel Alonso said in one of his paper : “Probably this film (he talk about the impurities that are located on top of the non image fibers) could also be removed, revealing also the true original fiber color (white).”). 8 “Color density was HIGHER ON THE SURFACE where evaporation was most rapid, i.e., where the saccharides CONCENTRATED. All of the fibers have a VERY SIMILAR COLOR DENSITY, SIMILAR TO THE “HALF TONE EFFECT” OF THE SHROUD. (Note : This kind of result is quite consistent with what we know about the Shroud. Remember that the linen cloths and the reactive gas used by Rogers for his experiments were not made exactly the same as what he postulate for the Shroud. In the same way than what is most probable for the Shroud. In this context, it’s quite normal that he didn’t found color ONLY on the top fibers of the cloth like we see on the Shroud. But nevertheless, he was able to show that the general principle he proposed was correct. Effectively, the fact that he found more color were the saccharides concentrated is a good indicator that this is what happened for the Shroud during the image formation process). 9 “Color density VARIES WITH SOURCE CLOTH CLEARANCE. Diffusion of reactive gas into air produced a CONCENTRATION GRADIENT that affected the color density. Diffusion COULD EXPLAIN THE VARIATIONS IN COLOR DENSITY OF THE IMAGE. In conclusion, these preliminary results are very consistent with the data that were gathered for the Shroud. Remember that the purpose of Rogers experiments was NOT to reproduce exactly an image like the body image of the Shroud, but to test some general principles that are present in his global hypothesis for image formation. There’s a very big difference here and it’s sad that his detractors have not been honest enough to recognize this FACT and admit that these 2 experiments could NOT be taken as any proofs that Rogers hypothesis is incorrect versus the Shroud !!! The only important thing to note from those experiments, and it’s a big one, is the FACT that the most important aspects of Rogers hypothesis, especially the superficial coloration of a thin layer of impurities by a diffusion of reactive gas SEEMS, at first sight, to be consistent with the body image present on the Shroud. For Rogers, this was already true on a theoretical level, and the preliminary experiments he made were able to corroborate his thoughts quite successfully (on a preliminary base only). Of course, more researches need to be done to complete the experimental process that Rogers had started before his death, but nevertheless, those preliminary experiments done by Rogers cannot at all be used to reject his hypothesis. In fact, it’s precisely the opposite: They should encourage some other researchers to pursue Rogers work and push it forward..","date":"2012-06-15","mins":"8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"id":"comment-12975","author":"yannick_clément","post":"My pleasure Thibault !

A complete summary of this paper, along with the comment I would make, would produce a much too long comment ! ; ) Before doing so, I want to make a short summary of the main purpose of this paper : In fact, Thibault made a good documentary research in specialised papers, in order to learn if the heavy amines postulates by Rogers in his hypothesis could be produced by a fresh corpse in sufficient quantity and fast enough (before the apparition of the first liquids of putrefaction some 36 to 72 hours after death) to account for the body image we see on the Shroud. His research leads him to conclude that no amines (particularly the heavy amines named “putrescine” and “cadaverine” proposed by Rogers) could be produced IN a fresh corpse in sufficient quantity before the first liquids of putrefaction, in order to satisfy the time/space/amount necessary conditions for the formation of the body image. In other words, NORMALLY (this word is important), a fresh corpse is not supposed to emit a great quantity of these heavy amines from every pores of the skin during the first 36 to 72 hours after death. And, more than that, Thibault found that these amine gases should NORMALLY come out of the body almost exclusively by the natural orifices of the body (the nose, the mouth, the rectum, etc.) and should come mainly from the intestine and the lungs. That should produce a concentration of these gases in some specific places of the body. That lead Thibault to conclude that this normal production of amines from within the corpse is not compatible to what we see on the Shroud. In a second time, his research lead him to conclude that there was a second option concerning the Maillard reaction hypothesis of Rogers, that can account much better for what we see on the Shroud. He said that it is PROBABLE, but not demonstrate yet, that if the sweat of the man of the Shroud had contained a large quantity of concentrated urea (note : when we consider the high traumatic state of the body, this possibility is quite real), the drying of this sweat could have produce an important evaporation of ammonia from every part of the body (and the hair) that can theoretically satisfy the time/space/amount necessary conditions for the formation of the body image via a Maillard reaction. Thibault also state that if a chemical reaction like that had occurred at the surface of the cloth with a thin layer of impurities, the body image could have taken days, months or maybe even years before it reached his final form (i.e. That the color on the fibers would have developed progressively). Thibault wrote also a second paper for the SSG, in which he made another documentary research with one main goal : Learning if the laws of diffusion can account for the body image on the Shroud. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to read this second part and don’t know what was the conclusion reached by Thibault… Anyway, I don’t think Thibault”s research about that aspect of the question can really be enough to reject this Maillard reaction hypothesis. Here, we have to remember the preliminary results obtained by Rogers with his experiments that were good enough for him to pursue his researches about the gas diffusion and prevent him to start to look elsewhere for a better explanation. Personal notes : Thibault rejected the Maillard reaction hypothesis, in the form proposed by Rogers, mainly on the base of 2 assumptions : 1 That the production of heavy amines from a fresh corpse would have been too much concentrate in some place (where it would come out) and not enough in other places, in order to produced a full length body image of the front and back like we see on the Shroud. And 2 That the production of these heavy amines would not have been done in sufficient quantity to start a Maillard reaction at the surface of the cloth. Taking the first assumption, I think Thibault made one possible interpretation mistake when he conclude that, because these amine gases were mainly released by the natural orifices of the body, they would have been too much concentrate around these places and not enough in other places, in order to be able to produce a complete image of the back and front of the corpse on the cloth. But I’m not so sure about that !!! If we go back to what Rogers said about the release of amines from a corpse, we can read this : “Gaseous reactive amines can be lost by diffusion through the porous cloth, reducing concentrations and reaction rates inside the cloth. However, it has long been recognized that the images of the hair, moustache and beard are anomalous. The density of the image is greatest in those areas. That can easily be explained by the inhibition of vapor diffusion through a porous mat of hair. Ammonia is first evolved from the lungs. Therefore, its concentration would have been highest in the vicinity of the nose and mouth, and its diffusion would have been retarded by the moustache and beard. By the time heavy decomposition amines appear, the body will have cooled. The surface area of cloth is large and higher molecular weight decomposition amines absorb strongly. All of these phenomena would cause a RAPID REDUCTION IN AMINES CONCENTRATION AWAY FROM THE CONTACT POINTS AND THE NOSE MOUTH AREA”. If Rogers is correct, that means that the gases, even if they would have mainly come from the natural orifices of the body, instead of all the pores of the skin, could have been rapidly transferred laterally to other places over (and under) the body (with a possible global coverage of the entire body). They would not have been only concentrate around the natural orifices, where they would have first come out, expect maybe, as Rogers said, in the hair, the beard and moustache, where we can expect a more important concentration of these gases, because of the very particular nature of these body parts. If Rogers is correct, this can theoretically account for the kind of body image that is on the Shroud… And since we don’t know the exact conditions concerning the body and the Shroud and their interaction together, I don’t think we can reject Rogers hypothesis on the single base that heavy amines would only come out of the few natural orifices of the body before the apparition of the first liquids of putrefaction… Note about this : Who knows if a part of the amines produced by the dead body could not have come out by the ears ? This body part too is a natural orifice of the body ! And if it’s true, who knows if that’s not one of the main reasons why so much amines could have been trapped in the hair ! Of course, it’s only a thought of mine and I know the research of Thibault lead him to conclude that amines would principally come out from the nose, mouth and rectum, but I don’t see why some gases could not come out of the ears also… Who can be certain about that ? And if there really was some gases coming out of the ears, I think it’s fair to assume that most of it would have been trapped by the long hair and could have contribute (to what extent, I don’t know) for a more dense image of this body part versus the rest of the body image (and maybe also for the second body image of the hair we can see on the backside of the cloth). And concerning the second assumption made by Thibault, I really don’t think the documentary research he made concerning the production of amines by a dead body has covered all the possibilities that exist, especially when you consider that the dead body inside the Shroud WAS NOT a normal corpse, but was a crucified body that suffered a great deal (and for a long period of time) prior to his death. In this very odd condition, I’m not so sure that someone has the right to completely reject the possibility that heavy amines could have been produced by this very particular corpse in more quantity and in a faster time than a normal dead body… That’s why, personally, I’m not ready yet to reject this possibility, even if I have a tendency to believe that Thibault’s complementary (or parallel) hypotheses can well be close to the truth. In fact, I think it’s truly possible to think that these 2 hypotheses could have acted simultaneously inside the Shroud, i.e. That some reactive gas could have come from inside the body, along with some more gas that could have come from the skin. WHY NOT ? Again, we MUST remember the very particular nature of the corpse that was enveloped in the Shroud !!! That’s a crucial factor in order to evaluate properly the hypothesis proposed by Rogers ! And I think that’s precisely where there was a little “mistake” made by Thibault in his conclusion versus the documentary researches he made on the subject !!! Effectively, I think he has underestimated the particularity of this tortured and crucified corpse versus the known production of amines from a normal corpse… I really think it’s fair to assume that the few scientific studies he found on the subject never intended to characterise the production of amines (especially the amount and the speed of this production) coming from a beaten, scourged, crowned with thorns and crucified dead body that had suffered a very high rising of the bilirubin that was in his blood ! In this context, the fact that he based his conclusion on a “normal” production rate can really be irrelevant versus the reality of the Shroud… That’s really what I think. In that regard, I think we have to consider both hypotheses is “possible” regarding the formation of the Shroud’s image. And to conclude this message, let me share with you a little reflection that can help you understand that, in the present state of our medical knowledge, I don’t think we have the right to conclude that a tortured and crucified body would react in the same exact way than a normal corpse : We know for a fact that rigor mortis would come much faster in the case of a tortured body like the man of the Shroud. This is a fact and we can even see some clear signs of this in the Shroud’s image, i.e. The bending of the knees (one more than the other), the expended chest, the bending of the elbows, the bending of the head forward, etc.). In this particular context, let me leave you with this very good question : If the very particular nature of the corpse that was enveloped in the Shroud was responsible for the fast coming of a state of rigor mortis (that can have been also stronger, as much as faster), than who can really be certain if the production of amine gases from the body could not also have been accelerated (regarding not only the rapidity and the quantity of the gases released but also for the places of the body where those gases were released) ??? WHO CAN REALLY BE CERTAIN ABOUT THAT ??? If you do, please show me a published scientific paper that proves that being tortured for a long period of time and to die of crucifixion has really no effect on the production of heavy amine gases coming from the body after death !!! Even if I consider it to be very good, I’ve not found anything concerning this crucial aspect of the question in the paper written by Thibault… I think it’s fair to presume that, concerning this aspect of the question, MORE RESEARCHES ALSO NEED TO BE DONE in order to really know the truth !!! And I also think it’s fair to say that, in the Shroud world, a vast majority of people (whether it be authentic sindonologists or just interested people like we see here on the blog) have really paid attention to the very particular aspect of the body image on the cloth, but at the same time, those people have greatly neglect the simple FACT that the corpse that was most probably at the heart of this body image formation had a very particular nature too ! I think that’s a big mistake to underestimate, neglect or simply forget that important FACT when it comes to reflect upon the body image on the Shroud, because I really believe that one cannot go without the other ! In other words, I personally think that one (the nature of the corpse) can really help to explain the other (the body image on the cloth)… Reflect upon this folks !

I really don’t think these authors will claim that it is proven that a tortured and crucified body would act the same way. That’s VERY IMPORTANT to remember ! Who can be certain about that ? Quote from Anoxie : “May ammonia diffusion play a central role in image formation ? that was the second part of Thibault’s work. I’ll try to have a serious look on this hypothesis.” Comment from me : Here, I agree with Max. I think that’s truly possible, especially in the case of someone who had sweat a great deal prior to death and also who was severely scourged. Effectively, the scourging could have caused severe injuries to the kidneys and/or the liver and provoke a high rising of the urea in the blood. This kind of high rising of the urea (and also the lactic acid) in the blood is a proven thing in the case of severe internal injuries to these organs. Last quote from Anoxie : “By the way, wasn’t the body washed before being placed in the shroud ?” Comment from me : I don’t want to start this old debate over again, but I have very good reasons (mainly linked with the nature and the aspect of the bloodstains on the Shroud) to state that the body was not washed before being put in the Shroud. If I’m right, and believe me I have great confidence that I am, then the complementary hypothesis proposed by Thibault got much more chances to be relevant to the Shroud’s image… That’s why I truly found his hypothesis very interesting regarding the Shroud and I don’t see why his hypothesis and the one proposed by Rogers could not have acted together (simultaneously) in the Shroud to form the body image we see on the cloth. I really don’t see any good reason to reject this very interesting possibility..","date":"2012-06-23","mins":"4:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"id":"comment-32653","author":"yannick_clément","post":"But if a C14 test that would be properly done that would give a result around the first century A.D., along with other test that would give positive results for a geographical origin of the linen in the Middle East and maybe other good results like that (like a new positive chemical match between the dirt on the Shroud and the dirt found around Golgotha in Jerusalem), then I think any honest scientist would conclude that this relic is most certainly what tradition has always claim… A positive conclusion about the Shroud will always remain in the realm of probabilities, but if a new series of direct test could be allowed, I really think it would possible to come to a highly probable conclusion versus this cloth..","date":"2013-05-02","mins":"4:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/02/good-question-what-would-proving-shroud-do/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Good Question: What would ‘proving’ Shroud do?"},{"id":"comment-28750","author":"yannick_clément","post":"As a Catholic, here’s the most profound meaning of Good Friday to me: This is “the death of the judgement” and the greatest sign that God, unlike everyone of us, is Love and Mercy and nothing else!!!

This has been so badly interpreted over the years in the Church that it makes me sick. There’s a major difference between the dead corpse and the spiritual body that every one of us will have in Heaven. We’re talking about two completely different reality but many people Inside the Church have contributed over the years to make belief that it is really the material body who will enter in God’s kingdom, which is completely ludicrous because God’s kingdom, as Jesus saids it so well to Pilatus, is NOT OF THIS WORLD. That’s normal since it is a SPIRITUAL kingdom and not a MATERIAL kingdom. How can a material body which we see returning to dust (or to ashes) after death could end up in the spiritual world. This is ludicrous. God is a spirit and the body we’ll have after death will be a spiritual one. Now, don’t ask me how this will looks like cause I don’t have a damn idea ! ; ) What is the problem is the bad and very materialistic interpretation many Churchmen have given over the years versus Jesus bodily apparitions after his death (a wrong interpretation that came mostly from the Jewish materialistic idea of the resurrection of the dead at the end of times). These were material apparitions of Christ that he was almost forced to do if he wanted his disciple to believe he was really resurrected. But in truth, from the moment Jesus died on the cross, he was already resurrected in the spiritual world ! The disappearence of his physical body (as well as the few physical apparitions he did – with many body forms), the rolling of the rock at the entrance of the tomb, the rolling (or folding) of the Sudarium (which I’m convinced was the Shroud in reality), etc. Were all SIGNS of a SPIRITUAL REALITY that had already taken place at the moment Jesus died on the cross. If these signs were not done by God, no disciple of Jesus (except maybe his mother) would have believed that he was already resurrected in the spiritual world. They would have believed that he was dead and that he was going to resurrect only at the end of times, like any other good Jew. In sum, the material and physical apparition of the resurrected Christ were only there to convinced Jesus’ disciples of a SPIRITUAL reality which they were completely unable, as Jews of the first century, to understand ! Skin, blood and bones cannot enter God’s kingdom my friends. These things are bound to our material world and will end up as dust or ashes like any other material things in our space time universe. Only our soul (along with a spiritual body of course) will end up the spiritual kingdom of our loving and merciful father.

But God being love, he wanted his disciples to believed in the Resurrection of the Son, so he allowed Jesus to take some human forms (very different from the human form he had before his death – so much that his closest friends were not able to recognized him without signs like the holes in his wrist and side, the breaking of the bread or the tonality of his voice) in order to appear physically to them, so they would be able to really be convinced of the reality of his resurrection (which really is spiritual in essence) and which is of the same kind as the one we’ll all experiment after our own physical death.

If they don’t find anything, then there’s a good probability that their coloration is not the same than the Shroud (chemically speaking). If they do find ghosts of coloration, then the probability would be higher for a match. But since they didn’t used a linen sample done in the ancient way (with a impurity layer on the surface made of sugars), I seriously doubt that they could find any ghost of coloration in a sticky tape experiment.

I think many “agenda driven” people in the Shroud World who want us to believe the Shroud offer some kind of a physical proof of the resurrection would loved if that could happen more often. One thing is certain : by acting like that, they favored the development of this kind of heresy. Yes, I call it an heresy because God don’t want us to worship any material object but to develop a loving and true relationship with him instead ! Remember the gospel of John ? “God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.” The Shroud of Turin doesn’t fit into that category of a true worshiping. And for what Ron said about the scriptures being “historical”, I agree to a certain point. It’s true that a lot of parts of the bible contains real historical facts and events but it’s also true that many other part (like Genesis or the book of Revelation, for example) are more like parabols or legends used to tell a truth. With the contribution of many modern biblical scholars like Raymond Brown and many others, it is also evident that even some parts of the gospels are not totally historic. I don’t think I make a mistake here by saying that some stories or teaching of Jesus were rearranged by the writers to “fit” their theological belief or to “fit” the kind of teaching they wanted to proclaim to their community. Sometimes, those rearrangements were also influenced by the polemical context of the time in which they were written (it is particularly true for the gospel of Matthew). This is why it’s not easy to read the bible because we cannot take anything for granted like if everything was totally historic and true. Knowing the context in which those books were published help a lot to understand what have more chance to be historic and true, and what have more chance to be a personal addition from the writer of the book or what has to be considered a legend or a parabol and not an historic account.

But having said that, I also think such a team, in order to stay independent of mind versus every possible explanation for the image formation, and also in order to be seen by the scientific community as truly unbiased, should also exclude every researcher who already have proposed another form of image formation (whether it be based on a natural formation involving an interaction between the corpse and the cloth or a formation involving some form of artistic technique).

After this, such a draft should be presented at a future Shroud conference and, if it receive a nice welcome, then the next step should be to find other INDEPENDENT experts versus the Shroud who worked in other relevant scientific fields and ask them if they would be interested to join the team in order to refine the first draft of the test plan and eventually to propose it to the Turin authorities… By doing this, I’m truly convinced that Mr. Rolfe would have more chances to see things starting to move the way he wants, much more than by making a new movie about the Shroud.

For him, the transfer on the cloth occured because those dried blood clots get humidified again on their surface because of the aqueous environment in which the body was exposed inside the Shroud. I submit to your attention that this aqueous environment hypothesis can be linked to the image formation hypothesis of Rogers ! For Barbet, it is clear, a dead body can emit water vapors and that could have been enough to re humidified the blood clots that were over the scourge wounds, so that a mirror image of those wounds could occured. To this water vapor, I think we can also add the very probable ammoniac gas that could have come out of the body (maybe of every part of the skin, because of a deposit of urea coming from the dried sweat), along other possible amine gas coming from every pores of the skin. All those different gas could have been well enough to create the aqueous environment proposed by Barbet. When you look carefully at the nature of the blood stains on the Shroud (the fact that most of them don’t come from liquid blood and the fact that most of them have a serum halo present around them), I have to say that this is really, by far, the most logical and viable hypothesis (scientifically speaking) that I’ve ever read to explain the presence and the nature of the scourge marks on the Shroud..","date":"2012-03-24","mins":"6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-9547","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote : “The very same words could be used to describe Jesus’ resurrection, especially in light of the last studies of the Shroud of Turin.

I was on a little walk in the wood near my parent’s house in St Alexis des Monts, Québec, and during the walk, without even note it, I cut myself on the foreharm (probably with a tree branch). I only note this little cut when I was on my way back. The injury was pretty much like a scourge wound from the Shroud ! I’m serious. I wish I could have taken some pictures of it back then ! It had pretty much the same shape and the same size. First thing to note : there was absolutely no blood flow ! The blood that came out wasn’t important enough to flow. It only stayed inside the cut, filling the hole, if I can use this term. This prove to me that the scourging of Jesus could well have been pretty much like that and that there was not necessarily big blood flow from the scourging, like most commentators have always mention it. We have to remember that the metal dumbell at the end of the leather tongues wasn’t like the claws we see in the movie the Passion of the Christ ! I agree that, for the leather tongue injuries, it is another story. But, for the dumbell shape injury, I’m not convinced at all that they would have created big blood flow (or blood loss). Second and most important thing : I went to my parent’s house and forget about this little injury. Then, after maybe 6 hours, I had the genious flash to make a little scientific experiment ! I just put some saliva on top of the clotted wound and then, put a piece a kleenex on it and press it gently on the wound. Guess what happen ? I found a very clear mirror image of my wound !!!! EXACTLY WHAT BARBET WAS SAYING IN HIS BOOK ! Again, I wish I had the presence of mind to take some photos ! Too bad I didn’t do it because that was for me a proof that Barbet’s hypothesis was probably correct ! I was a proof that you don’t need a lot of humidity to re humidify a dried blood clot, even after many hours after the injury had occured ! Ron, you do what you want with my testimony but I just hope you’ll believe that I just say the truth here. I’m honnest and I don’t make this up ! This little adventure of mine prove to me that if there was some humidity present on the surface of the blood clots, even if they had dried up since a long time, it was enough to produce a mirror image of those clots on the Shroud. No washing of the wound is necessary to acheive that and my testimony is a proof of that.

Ask yourself; How many people were present to accomplish this ritual? And what did the Jewish laws state about ‘Eve of Sabbath’ burials’? Then tell us which is more likely.” I would answer : Most probably, a hasty partial burial because, Ron, you forget one important fact : the burial of Jesus wasn’t prepared at all !!!! First, nobody beside Judas knew that Jesus would be arrested on thurday night and at that time, nobody knew that he would be crucified. And when he was crucified, nobody knew that his body could be buried normally in a normal tomb and not thrown into a common grave with the other victims. When it was clear that the body could be buried in the tomb of Joseph, what time do you think it was ??? Much more than 3 o’clock of the afternoon for sure ! That doesn’t left many time to buy or found a decent shroud and buy or prepared aloes and myrrh (probably in some solid form) to put around the body to avoid bad odors on Sunday morning… And if we take into account the experiments and conclusions of the Spanish team of sindonologists on the Sudarium of Oviedo, they say that it took around 2 hours after death before the body could reach the tomb ! And if we take into account the Gospels, they say that the women did return on Sunday morning to finish the burial. All those clues point in one direction : a hasty partial burial. I don’t see why they would have do anything on Friday except putting the body into the Shroud and putting aloes and myrrh in bags all around the body (maybe inside the shroud) to avoid the bad odors on Sunday morning, and then rolling the great stone to close the entrance of the tomb.

But your assumptions that the body was full covered of blood clots is simply that : an assumption ! Who can be so sure about that ? Remember what I said the other day about my own little experiment I’ve made last summer ? The cut was deep enough that blood came out on the skin, but there was not enough blood to make some blood flow on my arm ! Why wouldn’t it be the same for Jesus scourging ? Remember that the metal balls of a Roman flagrum are not supposed to cut the skin that much, but to make deep bruises instead. I’ve once talked about that with Thibault Heimburger from France (a doctor who is also a sindonologist) and he agreed with me on this specific point. He also think that there is some possibility that the metal balls injuries didn’t provoke a great blood flow. And I can say that even if there was some minor flows, there’s a very great probability that those little flows were completely washed by the important sweating of the victim. Having say that, I have to say also that, for the leather tongues of the flagrum, it’s another story (I’ve already mention this in another comment). Most probably, those tongues would cut the skin and provoke some blood flows. But if you look closely at some Shroud photos, there is not that much leather tongues marks. Personally, I see them mostly around the thighs and not much in the back or elsewhere. Maybe it is due to the way the Romans were using the flagrum ? Maybe the leather tongues were not touching the skin that often, but the way they would use it gave the result that almost only the end of the tongues (with the metal balls) were touching the skin ? When I look at photos of the Shroud, that’s the impresion I have. I really don’t have the impression that, normally, there was a very long portion of the leather tongues that were touching the skin. The fact that the most evident leather tongues marks are located around the thighs is a sign that my feeling can be true, because this particular location seem to mean that the only times a good portion of the leather tongues were touching (and cutting) the skin, it was when there was a hit done from behind but that was done around the body in order to hurt the front of the body. Beside those hits on the front of the body (that would have been in minority versus the hits on the back part of the body), I think the marks we see on the Shroud seem to indicate that there was not a long portion of the tongues that were touching the body (again, I suppose this could be due to the particular way the Romans could have used the flagrum). Of course, all I just said is just my personnal interpretation of the blood marks on the Shroud and I can be totally wrong regarding the reality. But I think my point of view is interesting and deserve some thoughts. Now, I can answer your question by saying that my hypothesis can, at least partially, explain why the blood on the Shroud seem to be not enough versus what we assume of a Roman crucifixion. I think the very important sweating of a tortured victim could have washed a good portion of the blood on the skin that was not clotted yet. Also, we cannot forget the possibility that, during the crucifixion or shortly after, there could have been some rain that would surely have washed the body. And we also have to think of the possibility that, because of the traumatic state of the body, the blood that was present in injuries like the scourge marks could have taken more time to clot than the blood that would have been flowing on the skin. Maybe the traumatic state of the body would have produced some natural products in the blood (like bilirubin, urea, lactic acid, etc.) in greater quantity than normal and that those natural products would have retarded the clotting process, particularly in and near the injuries ? Barbet in his book also talk about the good probability that most injuries would have been infected in some way. If this was the case, I think there’s some chances that this also could have retarded the clotting process, especially for the blood in and near those injuries (like the scourge injuries). In this context, the blood marks we see on the Shroud would be only the blood that would have clotted during a time frame that would hallowed this clotted blood to be humidified again on their surface in order to be able to produce a mirror image. All the other blood clots (particularly the ones that would have came from blood flowing out of the injuries) would have dried too fast, with the result of producing clots that were too old when there was some kind of humidity around the body. In this context, those clots would have been too old to be able to leave any kind of mirror image. Those blood clots would have been present on the skin of the man on the Shroud, but would not have left any traces on the cloth. All this is my personal point of view and you can disagree with me of course. And please, don’t get so mad at me when I say something that doesn’t fit with what you believe. On the contrary, just ask yourself the question : Can Yannick’s idea can be right after all ? Who knows ? And, before finishing this long reply, I know one objection that you can say : if there was more blood clots on the skin, why we can see a body image on the Shroud while we know for a fact that the blood that was transferred on the cloth was able to prevent any image formation ? First I would say that the kind of blood that was able to prevent any image formation is some blood material in a liquid state that was able to produce a mirror image of some blood clots (mostly blood clots that came from injuries) on the cloth. Scientifically speaking, it is impossible to be sure if this would be the case for some blood, not in liquid form, but in a clotted and dried state. And more important, if the image formation process come from some natural and biologic products present on the skin (who came from the body and were left there by the drying sweat), how can we be sure that those products (that would have most probably been present also on the dried blood clots) would not have been able to produce a body image on the cloth ? Effectively, if this hypothesis is correct, those products would have been in direct contact (or close proximity) with the cloth, between the dried blood clots and the Shroud. There would have been no screen of any kind (on the contrary of the liquid blood screen of the mirror images) between those products and the cloth in order to prevent the formation of a body image !!! I’m sure you understand what I’m trying to say. If the scenario I’ve just develop is correct about the blood transfer on the Shroud, I think the fact that we mostly see blood images that come from injuries (and not much stains coming from blood flows) is very consistent with a natural and chemical image formation process that would have originated from some biological products present on the skin… That’s a scenario I like very much and that came into my brain while looking again and again at some Shroud photos while trying to keep in mind what Pierre Barbet said about the blood. Who knows ? Maybe I’m not so far from the truth. Or maybe I’m completely off track !!! ; ) But, in the end, I think my scenario deserve some clever thoughts.

In fact, the scourge marks that are the most evident ones are definately the dumbell shape marks coming from the metal balls (or bones) at the end of the tongues than long leather tongues marks that we are used to see in many artworks. Again, I think this is mainly due to the very particular way the Roman could have used the flagrum and that would have the effect that just the end of the tongues would normally hit the skin. Also, the fact that we see much more dumbell shape marks than leather tongues marks on the Shroud (unlike most Christian artiwork from any period of time) is another good indicator that go against any idea of a forger using any artwork method to create a false relic..","date":"2012-03-30","mins":"8:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-9552","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Good comment Gabriel. I agree that this aragonite finding is important for the inquiry of the real origin of the Shroud. And I agree that there it is not a subject often put forward. It’s kind of a “lost” clue. It’s important for the geographic localisation of the man of the Shroud and it is, of course, linked to the question of authenticity… And I can also see that this aragonite finding can also be taken as a clue that go against Zugibe’s hypothesis of a washing of the body ! This question is less important than the other but it still is important in my mind in order to really categorize and understand the blood transfer on the Shroud. I’ve read somewhere (I think it was on “the list” of facts concerning the Shroud that was published at the Dallas conference of 2005) that they found this aragonite dust on the knee area on the Shroud. If this could be confirmed, that can be a pretty interesting argument against Zugibe’s washing hypothesis (about this hypothesis, I remember everyone that Pierre Barbet would have been in total disagreement with Zugibe). Effectively, if there was really aragonite dirt on the knees, the chance that this area was washed is very low, in my mind. And, in Zugibe’s mind, this is one part of the body that should have been washed in order to clearly see the scourge marks that are present in this area. In my opinion, if there really is some dirt on the knees, Zugibe’s washing hypothesis have great chances to be incorrect and that could give more credit to Barbet’s opinion about the blood transfer on the Shroud. Again, that’s only my personal opinion. First of all, it would need a real scientific confirmation that there really is dirt in the knee area..","date":"2012-03-23","mins":"4:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-9607","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This explanation is very popular right now, I know.

That’s the corner stone of all the Shroud research. I think we can trust a lot of their work and conclusions. By the way, I’ve never seen a STURP team member being an advocate of those ghost images (coins, flowers, writtings, etc.). Maybe there’s a few of them who believe those things are there but I’ve never read a scientific paper signed by one of the STURP member that show any evidences to support those doubtful claims. The only scientist I know who really support those claims (especially for the coins issue) and who was there in Turin in 1978 is Baima Bollone… Since science isn’t able yet to PROVE that those images are really there, we deal with probabilities here. I think all the facts and arguments that I’ve bring here in the past few days shows that the probabilities that those images really exist are very low.

If we summarize this question : 1 There is no exact reference in ancient jewish litterature (Thora, Mishna, Talmud, etc.) about the fact that putting coins over the eyes was a normal procedure in ancient jewish burials. 2 The procedure of putting coins over the eyes (or into the mouth) was a pagan rite and this rite could have been taken as an act of idolatry by the pious jews like the Pharisees and surely also by the vast majority of the Jews who were following the law of Moses (it is fair to believe the family and followers of Jesus enter in this category). 3 The coins that are claimed to be on the shroud are Roman coins. Those coins were not hallowed in the Temple by the jewish authorities. 4 If there was some Jews who used the coins during their burial, it is fair to presume it was almost exclusively Hellenistic Jews. 4 Jesus and his followers (including his family) were all pious Jews who followed the law of Moses and they were not not hellenistic jews. 5 The burial rite after Jesus death was only partially done on friday and they had to come back on sunday to do an anointing of the body. Here is my addition : 6 the average Jew at the time of Christ believed that after death the person was going directly into the Sheol and was awaiting the general resurrection of the dead at the end of time. IN THIS CONTEXT, WHAT WOULD BE THE NEED FOR COINS ??? THE NORMAL JEW OF THE TIME OF CHRIST DIDN’T BELIEVED THAT HE NEEDED COINS TO GO TO THE SHEOL OR THAT HE NEEDED COINS FOR THE GENERAL RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD ! Only those with some Pagan beliefs thought that they needed coins to cross the Styx river ! If you do not trust me, just read the story of the raising of Lazarus. It’s the best part of the New Testament to read for a good understanding of the normal belief of the Jews and the normal Jewish burial practice during the time of Christ. Here’s an important part where we can understand the average belief of the Jews during the time of Christ : “Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” (Gospel of John (chapter 11, verses 23 and 24). Martha in his answer to Christ expressed the normal belief of a Jew during the time of Christ (except for the Saducees who didn’t believed in resurrection). NO NEED FOR ANY COIN IN THIS BELIEF OF THE AVERAGE JEW !!! So, if some Jews during the time of Christ believed they needed coins to cross the Styx river, it was Jews who could followed part of the law of Moses but, at the same time, had some heretic beliefs and, most likely, they were Hellenistic Jews (and some Saducees were surely among those). They were a bit like some modern Christian who belived in Reincarnation… So, again, when you take all these facts and put it all together to see the whole picture of the situation, HOW IN THE WORLD THE FOLLOWERS OF JESUS AND HIS FAMILY WOULD HAVE WANTED TO USE COINS OVER THE EYES DURING HIS PARTIALLY DONE BURIAL ???

Onwards did not contain any real and credible historical information whatsoever, he should also agree that the same interpretation must be applied to the Abgar legend !!! In fact, the original Abgar legend never contain the story of a miraculous imprint of Jesus face (or any other image of his face) and only contain the story of an exchange of letters between him and Abgar. During the 4th century, we know for sure that these letters were kept in Edessa as authentic relics. But during the 5th century, the Vatican declared these letters to be apocryphal and non historic. And any credible historian knows that Christianity never came to Edessa before the second century A.D. So, I think we can forget the idea that one of Jesus disciple could have convert king Abgar V right after the Ascension of Jesus in the Heaven !!! Nevertheless, in his last public presentation of his hypothesis in Valencia, Wilson still seems to take that legendary tale as an historical fact for his weak hypothesis while it has been obviously written much later by the new Christian Church of Edessa in an effort to show that their particular Church had very Orthodox roots that were going back directly to the time of Christ himself !!! Here’s what we can find in page 2 of Wilson’s presentation in Valencia (link for this paper: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/wilsonvtxt.pdf) : “To express the theory in its simplest form, the Image of Edessa cloth is broadly traceable from as early as AD.30, albeit that this phase of its history has to be gleaned from later sources. From the Jerusalem of Jesus’ time it was taken to Edessa (today Şanliurfa in eastern Turkey ) to help convert Edessa’s king Abgar V2 to Christianity. It seems to have been almost immediately to be hidden away, apparently due to persecution when one of Abgar’s successors reverted to paganism.” The fact that Wilson blindly buys this legendary stuff is completely ridiculous… Be sure that you would NEVER see a credible historian do this.

WHAT A BIASED POINT OF VIEW AND A TOTALLY PARTIAL TRUTH !!!!! INCREDIBLE !!!! Wilson should know that this term “sindon” in ancient Greek could mean a lot of thing from a burial shroud to a simple cloth (which could be small). It doesn’t always apply to a burial Shroud and it doesn’t always apply to a long cloth. To know the correct interpretation, YOU MUST CHECK OUT THE TEXTUAL CONTEXT ! Clearly, this is something Wilson has completely neglected or something that he choose to let aside, because when you read these ancient texts, you ALWAYS found the term “sindon” in a context that has NOTHING to do with a burial cloth !!!

And because the Shroud can truly be seen (as I do) like the relic of the Incarnation of God (even before the relic of Jesus’ Passion and way before the relic of his Resurrection), I think there’s a great link that can be made between Christmas and the Shroud… For me, these two moments (at the very beginning and at the very end of Jesus life on Earth), more than anything else, are the most revealing moments of who God really is and in both occasions, Jesus didn’t have to make a long speech! His face during these two events was more telling than any discourse that he could have done about God. So, in this blessed time of year, I think it would be a good idea to look at the Shroud for a moment and meditate on God’s Incarnation in our human nature, which was, already at the moment of Jesus birth, a hidden sign that we were already all saved because of the infinite greatness of his Love for us! Isn’t sad to noticed so many Christian who greatly neglect this most important aspect of the Christian faith (the Incarnation) while focussing almost only on Jesus’ teaching (many of them focussing much more on the scary parts of this teaching instead of the beautiful, tender and loving parts) and Resurrection ?!? When I see how people generally see the Shroud and his image here on the blog, I’m truly surprise to see that the focus is almost entirely put on the Resurrection at the expense of the great sign (we can even say “proof”) of God’s incarnation we can detect in the Shroud’s image and bloodstains… Each time I see the Shroud, I say to myself: The Incarnation of God is far from having been a joke like many Gnostic Christian have thought over the centuries !.","date":"2012-12-26","mins":"7:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/24/merry-christmas-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Merry Christmas Everyone"},{"id":"comment-23685","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Dan wrote: “…the paper was written by two good people with the best of intentions.” REALLY?

I think it’s just a question of choosing the right time and the right scientists to analysed those images. And I think this should not be done lightly.

Because this subject was the starting point of this “debate”, I just want to share a personal reflection with you about the possible images of coins, flowers and other objects found on the Shroud by some researchers. It is a logical argument that goes against all those possibilities. When it comes to analyse the Shroud, we always have to remember the context of the burial. It’s so important and, unfortunately, it’s an aspect of the question that is often forgotten ! We found a pretty good description of the burial of Jesus and the 2 days after in the 4 gospels. From this description, it is pretty clear that the burial rite was only partially done on friday because there was not enough time left to perform it completely (because the Sabbath and the Passover was at end and everyone had to be at home). From the gospel accounts, we know that the women had to go back to the tomb early Sunday morning to complete the burial rite with, among other things, an anointing with a perfume. On the other hand, we have to understand that the action of putting flowers, coins or other objects into the Shroud, if it ever was planned, was an action surely reserved for the conclusion of the burial rite. It’s just logical to think that way. You don’t put coins over the eyes or throw flowers on the body before doing all the task of the burial rite, like an anointing with a perfume ! So, in this context, HOW IN THE WORLD THE PEOPLE WHO PERFORMED THE PARTIAL RITE ON FRIDAY WOULD HAVE PUT THINGS LIKE COINS, FLOWERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON THE BODY OF JESUS (OR BESIDE THE BODY, IN THE SHROUD) WHILE THEY ALREADY KNEW THEY DIDN’T HAD TIME TO COMPLETE THE RITE AND THEY HAD TO COME BACK TO THE TOMB ON SUDAY MORNING TO FINISH THE JOB AND PERFORMED AN ANOINTING ON THE BODY ? When you use your logic, that make absolutely NO SENSE !!! If those objects were left in the Shroud on Friday, they would have to take them out of the shroud on Sunday morning, performed the ritual anointing, and then place again those objects in the Shroud at the very end of the ritual. It’s not logical at all ! If those objects were planned to be left on the body or beside it in the Shroud, it’s almost sure they would have waited until the very end of the burial rite to do it. In the context describe above of an evident lack of time on Friday, wouldn’t you have done the same and wait until the end of the ritual on Sunday morning to add those objects in the Shroud (if there was any object at all to be place there) ??? I really think so ! I think this little reflection is enough to understand that those objects are simply not there on the Shroud… Or, if there really is images of those objects (I really don’t think so), they were surely formed in a separated event that is not related at all to the body image formation and this other image formation process had to take place AFTER the body image formation process was completed, during another period of time that could have taken place decades, if not centuries later. One thing’s for sure, if there really is some images of those things on the Shroud, they are not related to the burial of Jesus Christ… One last comment : The practice of putting coins over the eyes was directly taken from a pagan rite of Egypt. In this rite, the family would put coins over the eyes of the dead because they thought he would need money to pay is right to cross the Styx river ! So, in the context of the dead of Jesus, don’t you think it would be VERY strange for his family and disciples to perform a pagan rite during his entombment ??? That makes no sense to me… If there was any Jews who performed this kind of ritual, they were surely Hellenistic Jews and not pious Jews who practice the laws and rules received from Moses… This portrait doesn’t seem to correspond to the family and the disciples of Jesus who was not at all an Hellenistic Jew !!!.","date":"2011-10-16","mins":"8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/13/more-on-freeing-the-hal-9000-yes-what-is-the-archdiocese-of-turin-afraid-of/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on Freeing the HAL 9000: Yes, what is the Archdiocese of Turin afraid of?"},{"id":"comment-4188","author":"yannick_clément","post":"It’s a very interesting point.

The pope first state that the problem of compatibility between the Shroud of Turin, the “linen cloths” mention in the gospel of John and the “shroud” mention in the Synoptic gospels cannot be discuss in the context of his book. But the pope add this interesting remark that says a lot in my mind (for someone who can read between the lines) : “In any case, the aspect of this relic (the Shroud of Turin) is, in principle, reconcilable with the two reports (the one from the gospel of John and the one from the Synoptic gospels). For the mommy way of burial, it’s not a jewish manner at all. I think any good historian can corroborate this fact. The best way (in my opinion) to understand the meaning of “linen cloths” from the gospel of John can be “linen strips” along with the Shroud to tied it to the body….","date":"2011-05-15","mins":"6:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/14/not-like-a-mummy-a-frequent-question/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Not Like a Mummy? A Frequent Question"},{"id":"comment-9840","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Today, I went to the mass of the Palm Sunday and we read all the Passion, death and burial of Jesus according to St Mark. Note : The majority of New Testament’s scholars have conclude that this gospel is the earliest gospel of the 4 and I truly belive it. And according to tradition, this one had been written by Mark, who served as the interpreter of St Peter while he was in Rome. So, if this is true, we can say that this narrative is most probably a pretty accurate account of the real events of the Passion, death and burial of Jesus. And, when it come to the burial of Jesus, what do we read ? A very simple account. Here’s the main lines (chapter 15, verses 45 46) : “…he (Pilate) granted the body to Joseph. Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. Why am I quoting this part of the gospel ? Simply because I want to ask Ron and Max (see our recent debate on this blog), why this could not be the reality ? This account is exactly how I see the burial of Christ : Very fast, simple and partial in comparison to normal Jewish burial custom. Except for the addition we found in John’s gospel about the aloes and myrrh, which I think can be historic, I don’t see why we would have to think that there was some other actions (like the washing of the body) during this partial rite on friday. I just want to remember those people that this very fast, simple and partial rite is supported by the gospels (this part of the gospel of St Mark particularly) and it is also supported by some evidences that were found on the Shroud, like the presence of dirt in the knee and the nose area (see “the list” of facts presented in Dallas in 2005) and the nature of the blood stains regarding the scourge marks (that cannot have been made by liquid blood, but that was made, instead, by some decals of humid blood clots). This last evidence is supported by Alan Adler in his book “The Orphaned Manuscript” and it is also supported by what Pierre Barbet said in his book “A Doctor at Calvary”. I said that because, in Zugibe’s hypothesis, if the body had been washed in the regions of the scourge marks, what would have stained the cloth would have been fresh liquid blood (post mortem of course !) that would have came out of the wounds and that would have stained the cloth when the body would have been laid in the Shroud shortly after the washing. Sorry but if this scenario would be true, no way the scourge marks would looks like we see them on the Shroud ! Particularly true for the perfect borders of the marks. If this would have been made by liquid blood coming out of the wounds after a washing of the body, the wound marks would have not been so perfectly bordered, particularly for the back portion of the Shroud, because of the high pressure exerted by the weight of the body. In fact, in scenario like that, the wounds would have look like a total mess, which is far from being the reality of the Shroud ! Also, think about that : Miller and Pellicori, in their important study of the UV photos of the Shroud, tell us that, around almost every scourge marks, there is a fluorescent halo made by the serum. This is totally consistent with Barbet and Adler point of view regarding the blood transfer on the Shroud. Effectively, if those blood marks came from dried blood clots that would have been humidified again on their surface, the humidity (whatever it was) would have also rehumidified the serum stains that are normally present around any dried blood stains and that came from a well known process in medicine named “blood retraction”, which is a normal part of the clotting process. In Zugibe’s scenario, do you really think we would find serum stains like that around the blood stains ? No way ! And, again, this is particularly true for the back region of the Shroud… On this particular point, isn’t it interesting to note that, in the article where he summarize is hypothesis (link for the article : http://www.shroud.com/zugibe2.htm), Zugibe don’t say a word about the presence of serum halos around almost every scourge marks ??? I think this is an aspect that was completely and sadly neglected by him. I think he should have take note more seriously of this FACT concerning the serum stains (a fact that can be found easily in the paper of Miller and Pellicori)… I’m sorry but this lone fact of the serum stains is enough to completely reject Zugibe’s hypothesis about the blood transfer, particularly concerning the scourge marks of the back. The most probable answer is to think that those scourge marks came from a rehumidification of some sort of the top surface of the blood clots that covered the scourge injuries. Even if those scourge injuries were dried for a long time (I don’t know the exact time range, but it’s at least several hours), I know it is possible to rehumidified them again in order to produce mirror images on cloth. And, as I said, we can also add the very well defined shapes of the scourge marks that can only be achieved (nevermind what Zugibe pretend) by a decal of humid blood clots instead of some fresh liquid blood… Like Barbet said in his book, when liquid blood stain a cloth, the stain ALWAYS follow the weave of the cloth. With the herringbone weave of the Shroud, the blood stains would show some preferred direction (coming from blood that would have follow the weave) and no doubt a very particular feature like that would have been easily noticed by Barbet, Adler or Miller and Pellicori or any other scientist from the STURP. This was not the case… Those 2 important facts regarding the scourge marks are totally consistent I really wonder how can an expert like Zugibe never noticed that important aspect of the question. P.S. : I know this is completely off topic, but since I’m pretty sure Ron and Max will read this, I would like to show one more evidence that go against the Mandylion hypothesis of Ian Wilson (Ron and Max are two defenders of this hypothesis). This week end, I’ve watched a very interesting DVD about the Shroud. It is called simply “Shroud” and it was published in 2005 by Nova T under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Turin. You can see infos about this dvd on Barrie’s website : http://www.shroud.com/obtain.htm#Video In this video, a big portion is dedicate to the 2002 restoration and we can see an interesting interview with Msgr Ghiberti from Turin. In this interview, he said that the Shroud was completely scanned with a special camera who can look at the cloth at microscopic level. All this scanning was recorded and conserved. And what is very interesting is the fact that Msgr Ghiberti specified that, with this particular technique, it was possible to find all traces of dirt that could have been present on the Shroud, trapped in the weave of the cloth. Remember what I said about the FACT that the STURP team didn’t noticed more dirt or dust in the region of the face versus anywhere else on the cloth ? You were kind of skeptic about that. I’m sorry but the video microscopic technique used in 2002 during the restoration would have been sensible enough to detect any noticeable variation in the dust or dirt content for the region of the face or anywhere else on the cloth (Ghiberti said that the whole cloth was scanned like that). Isn’t it strange that nobody from the restoration commission (whether it be Ghiberti, Flury Lemberg or anybody else) have report that there was more dirt or dust (or even a more important yellowing) in the region of the face ??? And don’t worry… You can bet your house that a fact like that, if it was real, would have been reported by them for sure !!! Sorry but I think you didn’t thought about this important PHYSICAL FACT my friends (and Wilson, Scavone or any other defender of the Mandylion hypothesis have not take this seriously enough too) !!! In reality, the absence of any comment from the commission about this question is a tacit confirmation of what can be deduced from the dead silence of STURP regarding any noticeable difference regarding the physical aspect of the region of the face. In fact, this absence of any noticeable difference between the region of the face and the rest of the Shroud is an authentic PHYSICAL FACT (not a speculation) that, alone, is enough to put VERY SERIOUSLY in doubt the hypothesis of Wilson regarding the Mandylion. If this cloth would have been the Shroud folded in 8 with only the region of the face exposed to air and light (this set up would have stayed that way for centuries !!!), there is NO WAY (I repeat, no way, scientifically speaking) that this would not have created some noticeable difference in the physical aspect of the Shroud in the region of the face (particularly in regard of the presence of more dust and/or dirt and also regarding the presence of a more important yellowing of the fibers). I’m sorry to broke the dream of those who believe Wilson’s hypothesis is true, but this is the physical reality of the Shroud my friends (again, I repeat that this is not any kind of speculation) and nobody can’t denied it, unless he his completely full of bias !!! And if this PHYSICAL REALITY tell us that the Shroud cannot have been folded in the way describe by Wilson in his hypothesis, why continue at all costs to defend his misconceptions ??? I repeat what I said before : If you believe that the Shroud is authentic, what is the big deal with the fact that his ancient history is still unknown and will probably remain unknown ? Personally, I don’t have any problem with that because I know that this unknown history do not mean that the relic is false… In fact, I think that simply mean that his horrific aspect didn’t fit with the sensibility of the early days of the Church and that forces the Clergy to hide it for a very long time, possibly until it was showed in the Blachernes Church in 1203, when the crusaders were at the gate of the city. I really think the Shroud was almost always kept inside a reliquary until that time and that’s why we don’t have much references to it in the first millenium of our era. I think the explanation is as simple as that….","date":"2012-04-01","mins":"7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/01/palm-sunday/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Palm Sunday"},{"id":"comment-9868","author":"yannick_clément","post":"There an incomplete phrase in my comment below.

Then, we’ll be fixed. Until that moment, all the bad comments are more “speculative” I think than anything. Let’s wait what a new team of scientists will tell when they’ll get access to all the material that was taken during the restoration. Ho, by the way, here’s a message to everyone who think the restoration was catastrophic : BLAME IT ON ALAN ADLER ! He he ! Effectively, this was him who urged the most the Turin authorities to do rapidly a restoration of the cloth. But, at the same time, I have to admit that Adler was already dead when the restoration took place, so I don’t think he is responsible for some questionnable actions that took place during this restoration. But one thing’s for sure : If it wasn’t for Adler, it’s not so sure that the resoration would have taken place. In the DVD I’ve mentioned, Msgr Ghiberti clearly said that it was Adler who urged the authorities to make a restoration of the cloth and we can find 2 or 3 papers on that particular topic in Adler’s book “The Orphaned Manuscript”. It’s funny to see how much people seem to avoid to address some critics to Adler regarding the restoration ! In my mind, all the critics always blamed the Turin authorities and never Adler. I think there’s a lot of “politics” and “agendas” being all this… I just hate to see that. Now, for your question about the HAL 9000 images, I can’t tell. I’m not an expert on the 2002 restoration. All I know (info taken from the DVD) is that the restoration team took a camera that can take microscopic views of the cloth and pass over every square inches of the cloth with it. And what is wonderful is the fact that all this operation was recorded ! Would be great if we could see this entire video ! One of the purpose of this operation was to find where there was some charred particles on the cloth (particles that came from the 1532 fire) in order to take them away (while, at the same time, keeping those particles in little glass bottles for future researches). So, if that camera was sensible enough to see microscopic charred particles, you can be sure that it was sensible enough to see all the dust and dirt that could be scattered everywhere on the cloth !!! And since the commission (or any of his members) never said a word about having found more dirt and/or dust in the region of the face, I think this physical fact alone is enough to really put the hypothesis of Wilson in jeopardy ! I really think this physical FACT has always been neglected by the defenders of Ian Wilson when it comes to judge the relevance of his Mandylion hypothesis.

While we wait for this day to come, I think the first intelligent step for the Church would be to put together an international team of credible and UNBIASED imagery experts in order to analyse properly the high resolution photos that were taken in 2000 and 2002 and publish a scientific report on that….","date":"2013-02-11","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/11/pope-benedict-xvi-to-resign-february-28/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Pope Benedict XVI to Resign February 28"},{"id":"comment-23991","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If they have done so as you said Gabriel, then why they never publish it anywhere?

Personally, I tend to think more and more that this gospel was written by another John than the apostle we know, probably the presbyter mentioned by Papias, because it seem really hard to believe that the son of Zebedee could have been well known by the leaders of the Sanhedrin. It really seem that the beloved disciple was someone that was not an apostle but simply a disciple of Christ (one of the 72 mentioned by Luke ? It’s possible !) who was living in Jerusalem instead of Galilee. Have you noticed that he never use the term “apostle” in his gospel ? That is very telling for me ! It’s probably because this guy never thought that the 12 had to be considered with more pride than the other disciples like him. That’s what I feel about that. And that’s where I disagree a bit with the idea that this gospel was written by a Johnannine school. Maybe some additions were done by some disciples of this presbyter John, near the end of the 1st century (or at the beginning of the second century), but I’m almost sure that most of the gospel was first written by an eye witness of Christ who knew Jesus and Jerusalem very well. And I think the Shroud is a very good confirmation of this idea. In fact, the observations and facts that come from the Shroud are a very good indicator that the story of the Passion, death, entombment and resurrection of Christ we can read in this book was really written by a direct disciple of Jesus (named John, a very common name at the time) ! He was really there and he saw almost everything ! And what he said is true. That’s why I tend to favored the day given by John for the crucifixion of Christ. For the question of when Jesus became the Son of God, if we follow the Catholic teaching, I think we have to agree with John’s vision : from all eternity ! But that doesn’t mean that Jesus was fully aware of his divine nature from the moment he was conscious. We have to understand that he was also fully human (he had both natures from the time he was conceived). That’s the mystery of the Incarnation of God and it’s not sometime I think we can fully understand in this life. It’s a bit like the mystery of the Holy Spirit ! Who can proclaim he totally understand this mystery ? Only when we will be in the Kingdom of God and that we will be plunged into the light that we will fully understand everything. That’s what I believe. Last thing I want you to realize and this is very telling ! Have you noticed that every scholars always focus on the question regarding the historical date of Jesus crucifixion and death and never about the question of the historical date of his resurrection (or, at least, of the finding of the empty tomb) ? I think it’s very interesting to note that they seem much more concern by his death than his resurrection, even if this later event is the corner stone of Christianity ! On the contrary, I think we should focus more our attention on the date of Jesus resurrection (maybe, theologically speaking, it is truer to talk about the day of the founding of the empty tomb). And for me, following John’s Gospel, I believe this event came on the morning of April 9, in the year 30….","date":"2012-05-27","mins":"5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"id":"comment-11731","author":"yannick_clément","post":"You know what I think Chris ? I think the 3 Synoptics are achieved forms of some little books of quotes and deeds of Jesus that were in circulation well before those Gospels were written down. I’m sure the 3 authors of the Synoptics used some kind of textual sources (now lost) to write their “history of Jesus”, along with oral tradition. The scholars talk about the lost source Q, but I’m pretty sure that there was more than just on written source that now is lost and that have been used by the authors of the Gospels (particularly for the authors of the Synoptics). If the scholars are correct and these books were published mostly after 70 AD, I just can’t believe that, in the 40 years gap between the resurrection of Jesus and their time, there was absolutely no written record of some sayings and deeds of Jesus !!! And one of those short books could have been written by the tax collector named Levi (or Matthew) !!! I have absolutely no difficulty to believe this. So, my feeling is this : No so long after the resurrection, and surely by the time Paul wrote his letters from the beginning of the 50s and on, there was some short written books of quotes and deeds of Jesus in circulation, probably written by some close followers of Jesus and mainly used as references (some help for their memory) for those who were preaching the good news. Then, after most of the those who knew Jesus personally were killed or died, around the time of the Jewish revolt of 70 AD, some disciples of these dead Apostles decided to wrote down more complete stories about Jesus to be sure that the doctrine preached by the Apostles would not die with them. And that’s when and why the Gospels we know now were born ! And some 10 or 20 years later, there was a close follower of Jesus who was still alive (whether it be John the Apostle, John the Presbyter or another person) and who decide to wrote the story of Jesus in his own word (hello Ray Rogers !!!) before he died. Maybe he felt that the first 3 Gospels didn’t go profound enough about Jesus ? Maybe he felt that he had go more deep into the heart of his message of love ? I don’t know why exactly but he did it nevertheless ! In summary, the way I see things is that there was some short texts of sayings and deeds of Jesus in circulation sometime after his resurrection and, for most of them, they were probably written by eye witnesses who were close followers of Jesus. Then, near the time of the Jewish revolt of 70 AD, the 3 Synoptics were written by some disciples of the Apostles, who based partially their work on oral tradition and partially on these short texts (that could well have been pretty much like the Gospel of Thomas, but without the Gnostic philosophy behind many quotes of Jesus). If my feeling is right, we can assume that the 4 Gospels we have all contain pretty solid eye witness accounts of Jesus deeds and sayings, but they also contain theological and spiritual aspects that were added over it in the pure writing tradition of the ancient Middle Eastern people..","date":"2012-05-30","mins":"4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"id":"comment-11665","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Nevermind who wrote the Gospel of John, the evidence point toward the fact that it was an eye witness of these events.

Personally, I think it is dangerous to always try to resolve the contradictions found in the Gospels because it is highly probable that those contradictions are real. The fact that, except for John, the other 3 Gospels have been written by men who WERE NOT close followers of Jesus is enough to understand why there is such contradictions. And generally, those contradictions are not very important versus the heart of the message those Gospels want to deliver. So, for me who is a Catholic, some minor contradictions like the date of the crucifixion of Christ is not something that prevents me from sleeping at night. In other words, I don’t think it is very important, since the heart of the message in all 4 Gospels is the same. And more than this, I even go further and say that those small contradictions are a type of evidence that shows that those 4 books were not part of an evil plan to fool us but, on the contrary, they are 4 different testimonies that are really reliable. In court, when all the witnesses always say the same thing, it is very suspect ! It’s the same thing here… As I say, the importance is the heart of the message those books want to deliver. The reality is this : Based on the gospels, it is impossible to know the truth since the Synoptics and the gospel of John gave 2 different dates that can well be April 3, in the year 33 for the Synoptics and April 7, in the year 30 for John. I said it before, personally, like the majority of the scholars, I favored the date given by John (that is most probably April 7, in the year 30), mostly because he is the sole author of the gospels we can be sure that he was there with Jesus during those events. It is possible that Mark was at the last supper and at Gethsemani, but it is far from being proven. And for Luke and Matthew, you can forget it. It is highly probable that those 2 persons became Christians a long time after Jesus resurrection and they never knew him personally. Important note : If we believe the majority of the scholars, Matthew is surely not the Matthew that was an apostle of Jesus since this author based a good portion of his book on the Gospel of Mark. If it was the apostle Matthew who had written this Gospel, no way he would have need an external source like Mark to finish the job ! In fact, we can bet that his personal Gospel would have been very different, just like the Gospel of John is very different than the others. But in the end, so what ??? I’m ready to accept either dates if someone brings me a solid proof… I really don’t care too much about that. As I say, things like that are far from being what’s at the heart of those Gospels !!!

And as a Shroudie Ron, I don’t understand how you can miss that !!! The Shroud of Turin is a proof that John was there and that he saw everything with his own eyes ! It’s particularly true for the violent scourging (done more violently than usual because Pilate thought that it would calm down the Jewish leaders and prevent Jesus from being crucified) and the lance stab done after death (only report in this gospel). And also, we should not neglect the fact that the author emphasize his testimony by the words : “The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.” (John 19, 35) Now, unless you think he’s a liar, I think this single statement is a proof that the writer of this Gospel (whether it was John the Apostle, John the Presbyter or another person) was there and that he really was a true disciple of Jesus. And if you don’t believe him when he clearly state that he was an eye witness of the Passion, death, entombment, the discovery of the empty tomb (and the empty Shroud !) and the apparitions of the risen Lord, then, I really wonder how can you believe in the resurrection of Jesus !!!!.","date":"2012-05-28","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"id":"comment-16813","author":"yannick_clément","post":"You will have to read my upcoming paper that will precisely analyzed the question of the identity of the Shroud man my friend !

I came out of my reflection for this paper with this conclusion : this last scenario is highly unlikely but NOT IMPOSSIBLE… And if a new series of C14 dating on the Shroud that would be done properly and which would give a dating result in that particular era (between 400 and 700 A.D. More or less), then I’m sorry but this particular scenario would gain much credibility. All this to say that : Science will never be able to give a 100% positive identification of the Shroud man as being Jesus of Nazareth. The best answer that science could give presently is a probability (that I judge very high) and never a certainty. In fact, the only 100% sure conclusion that science could give us one day regarding the Shroud would be to discard completely the possibility that this could be the authentic Shroud of Jesus (if new unquestionable data that goes against the authenticity would come to light). In other words, a positive identification by science will never be possible with a 100% degree of certainty while a negative identification by science with almost a 100% degree of certainty COULD BE POSSIBLE ONE DAY (if new data would come to light, like a new C14 dating in many locations of the cloth that would give a date far from the 1st century but that would be include in the range of possible date given by Rogers : 1300 3000).

How can you reconcile these 2 statements from you ? Maybe you are bipolar and you’re not aware of this ??? (this is a joke of course) I want to react also to what you say about Rogers alternative dating of the Shroud. May I suggest you to read again his results that you wrote down in your comment ??? He said that the Shroud could have been woven ANYTIME between 1000 B.C. And 700 A.D. !!! He NEVER states that the Shroud had been woven during the time of Christ as you seem to point out. Rogers results only give the possibility that effectively the Shroud COULD have been woven during the time of Christ, which is completely different. And in your other comment, you question the possibility (very thin by the way) that I raised that a forger could have created the Shroud between the 5th to beginning of the 8th century while using a real crucified body to do so. WHY ? This scenario (which is “scenario #1” in my first paper) enters into the range of dates given by Rogers and his compatible with the FACT that the Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man and also with the FACT that the body image comes from some form of interaction between the dead body and the cloth (2 FACTS that I point out stronghly in my first paper on the subject). Because of this, science today CANNOT completely discard this scenario (even if it appears highly unlikely to me and to you) and it’s truly important to recognize this as a FACT. Moral of this story : WE HAVE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ABOUT ALL THE 4 POSSIBLE SCENARIOS THAT ARE STILL ON THE TABLE AND THAT I DESCRIBED IN MY FIRST PAPER. And concerning the C14 dating, I’m sorry but right now, this method is still considered by the vast majority of the archaeologists on this planet as the best dating method for ancient artefact. That doesn’t mean it is a perfect method (the dating of 1988 is a great proof of this and Meacham talk about all the potential problems related to this method in his book and in the paper he wrote on the subject in the 80s). BUT we have to recognize that this method as been very useful in many occasions in the field of archaeology, so I’m not ready to dismiss it concerning the Shroud and I would certainly push hard on the Vatican for another series of C14 dating of the cloth but much more properly done this time….","date":"2012-09-24","mins":"10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/21/really-we-must-come-to-god-by-faith-not-by-sight/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Really?

In the Old Testament, we got another nice metaphor when the prophet Isaiah make God says this to all of us: “Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.” This is another way to express the same thing: that we’re all saved by his infinite mercy and we have all a place prepared for us “on the other side”, which is truly another universe, but which is spiritual and, therefore, got nothing to do with another material universe that would exist outside this one..","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/24/scientific-truth-is-a-pathway-to-god/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Scientific truth is a pathway to God"},{"id":"comment-165512","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Parallel world will never be something that could be proven anyway unless someone can create a window to see what goes on there, which will probably never happen.

My argument is this: Mostly because of the 2 spiritual experience of God I made in my life, I came to understand that our life here in this space time universe is not a test design by God to evaluate who merit to live forever in his Kingdom and who merit to live forever in hell (which is a false concept that has been completely discredited by Christ during his Passion), but simply a painful growing process (which growing process is not painful?) that will eventually lead to our spiritual birth in God’s spiritual “world”. I truly believe that our space time material universe was design by God to do the same job for every single one of his children as the maternal womb is doing for the feotus. So, if I’m right about God’s plan for everyone of us who live in this material universe, the question would be: Why creating several material universes (with probably different kinds of physical conditions)?

No one can be certain unless some archaeological or litterary discovery can confirm the historicity of what is described in that part of the Bible. But one thing’s for sure: it is a well acknowledge fact that in the Middle East during ancient time, the writers didn’t had the “journalistic” approach most modern writers have today. In such a context, we must be extremely careful not to take everything that his written at first degree. One good clue to think if a verse is using metaphorical images is to find the same kind of images used in the Ancient Testament. And themes like “light”, “white”, “fire”, etc. Are unquestionably found in many parts of the Ancient Testament. That’s why I tend to consider the images we found in the accounts of the transfiguration, of the Passion, death and resurrection in the Gospel of Matthew, of the conversion of St Paul and of the Pentecost (just to name a few) as probably metaphorical in good parts, even though, as I said, they still refers to TRUE REALITIES, but realities that are SPIRITUAL and not visible with our human eyes (only visible in fact with the EYES OF THE HEART).

Why does such an event could not have look like what Mel Gibson showed at the end of his movie (i.e. Just a cloth falling down slowly on the ground without any burst of light, radiation or something like that while the body suddently disappeared from inside of it)? I don’t know why this could not have happened that way. In fact, when we consider together all the data coming from the Shroud (including the fact that no bloodstain have been damaged or disturbed), this is the kind of scenario that can easily comes into your mind (if you believe in the resurrection of course)… Unfortunately, this is not spectacular and doesn’t help to sell many books. And finally, I must add this: if I’m wrong to dispise Fanti, Jackson and all the other faithful scientists who proposed supernatural hypotheses covered under the tag “scientific theory”, then it’s also true of the vast majority of the scientific community (especially those from outside the pro Shroud world)..","date":"2014-02-25","mins":"11:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"id":"comment-82361","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I must add that having faith in the resurrection is not necessarily the case for the hypothesis of a burst of radiation coming from an earthquake (which put it appart from the other), but it surely need a lot of imagination to believe such a thing could produce a good image of both sides of a human corpse (not only the side that was facing up but also the side that was facing down to the ground).

Most probably, Turin will never give those data to just one or two researchers, so they can use them for their own benefit and I agree perfectly with this vision. In order for the authorities to agree for a new series of direct researches and analyses (including the analysis of all the data and material taken during the restoration of 2002), I’m pretty sure this will take the same kind of team effort that was done by STURP back then. In other words, scientists interested by the Shroud should look at the building of the STURP team and the making of their test plan and try to follow their footsteps. Such a new test plan should, of course take into account all the findings and conclusions of STURP and try to design some tests to confirm or reject each of them, while trying also to push the analysis further than what STURP did concerning some important subjects like the question of the chromophore of the image (which is the most important thing that still need to be fully determine in order to understand the image, to judge the validity of each image formation hypothesis out there and maybe to build a new (rational) ones that will have more chance to fully explain it)..","date":"2014-02-26","mins":"11:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"id":"comment-82424","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What I cannot stand is to see some people using science to back up some ideology.

Your interesting comment deserves a reply from me. I’ll expose you my reflection on this question and I hope that will help your own reflection. Of course, I don’t pretend I have the Truth about all this but maybe I’m close… You wrote : “One of them (image formation) is natural, has never taken place again and is not reproducible”. This argument is often used by the pro supernatural people and it’s a bad argument from my point of view. They use it to make believe that since there’s only one cloth with a body image on it (by the way, this is false. Remember the Jospine matress ?), there’s only one possibility to explain the Shroud : a supernatural event. To me, that’s too simplistic. On this particular question, we have to consider as a fairly good possibility that those body images (with their proper chemical and physical properties) could not have been formed other than by a natural chemical interaction between A TORTURED AND CRUCIFIED BODY and A LINEN BURIAL SHROUD PREPARED IN THE ANCIENT WAY DESCRIBE BY PLINY THE ELDER. If this is correct, that would mean that it is logical to assume that there was other body images formed on linen burial shroud through history but those other cloths have not survived (on this topic, see this very good text : http://www.shroudstory.com/faq burial of caiaphas.htm). Why ? Simply because they were burial shroud and they all disappeared with the rotting of the corpse ! All that the archaeologists can find sometimes is only tiny remains of burial Shroud, so it’s normal that no body images can be seen on those samples… In that sense, we cannot talk about a “unique record” when it comes to the Shroud of Turin. I think it would be more realistic to talk about a very rare event, because we can assume that it took many “good conditions” for the beginning of this chemical reaction before the corpse started to decay. But “unique” ? I don’t think so. Not in the sense you mean. To me, the uniqueness of this cloth is the fact that it was preserved through history and that the corpse that was wrapped in it disappeared without any traces before the first signs of putrefaction ! And that’s where the resurrection of Jesus enter the portrait ! If the disciples were not convinced that Jesus was resurrected, you can bet your house that they would never have kept this impure burial cloth ! It’s only in the light of the resurrection as an historic event, that we can understand why some disciples would have kept this Shroud and why it is still here with us today ! And in that sense, the Shroud is really a “unique record” (and the resurrection event too, of course !). So, to me, the “unique record” is not to be found so much in the body images than in the fact that this authentic burial cloth (that has really contained a dead body) was preserved with great care !!! In this context, It is possible to believe that the Will of God is responsible for the Shroud images in the sense that the possible chemical reaction that was at work in the tomb to form those images was completely stopped at the right time when the body disappeared, without disturbing those images or the blood decals on the cloth. In that sense, the resurrection can be seen by the faithful as the big responsible for the high quality of the body images, because the disappearing of the corpse came at the best moment to stop the chemical reaction, so that it prevent a color saturation that would have destroyed the quality of the body images. In that sense, the Shroud with his body images of so high quality can be really seen as a miraculous event ! Of course, this is just my personal opinion and you can think otherwise.

The mystery is alive and well. But in my mind, this Shroud is the authentic burial Shroud of Christ and even if I don’t think the resurrection had a direct impact on the images (in the sense of a by product), I still think it those images were part of God’s plan nevertheless. I think God is wise enough so he could use the Wonders of his Creation to do what he wants. I really think the resurrection (dematerialization of Jesus body) happened at the best possible moment so the chemical reaction that was in place was stopped just as the body images were nearly perfects and just before the coloration could saturated the cloth. And in that sense, I think the resurrection had something to do with the images but not in the Hollywood like manner that many people think… I think God doesn’t need to use lasers or radiations or electric discharge to do what he want ! In my mind, God is much more subtle than that. That’s my profound belief. Look at the gospels. When they talk about Jesus miracles, you never read something like “There was a burst of light (or a burst of energy) coming out of him so the person was healed !”.

I’ll take it point by point : 1 I totally agree with you that the undisturbed blood stains are one of the most important aspects of the Shroud when it comes to talk about the possible effect of the resurrection on this piece of cloth. Maybe science one day will be able to explain this fact rationally, but for the moment, science is not able to fully explain this. It’s a mystery that can relate directly to the resurrection event. But to see a connection there, someone need faith first, even if science cannot explain it (at least, for the moment) ! In fact, the sign of the blood stains undisturbed was the only clear sign of the resurrection for the doctor Pierre Barbet and I think the same, personally. Contrary to most people, I always think that the sign of the resurrection is to be found in the blood stains and not directly in the body images. 2 For the Maillard reaction, I agree with you. Read again my recent posts ! I never claim that the hypothesis of Rogers, alone, could explain everything. But, at the same time, I really believe that this chemical reaction involving a gaseous diffusion is a part of the image formation process, and maybe a very big part. For the moment, my reflection leads me to search for a hybrid formation process involving a gaseous diffusion but also, something else. This something else can be many thing and more researches would be necessary to know more about that. I tend to favor some kind of molecular transfer from some biological product that could have been present on the skin (and maybe also in the derma of the skin). But what exactly ? I’m not sure yet, even if I have some ideas in mind… But I repeat it, just to be clear : the hypothesis of Rogers, alone, don’ t seem to be enough to fully explain the totality of the images. But, while I wrote that, I must admit that, since we don’t know for sure what caused the images, who knows ? Who knows if some rare conditions were present in the tomb during those 36 40 hours before the shroud was found empty and those conditions could have favored the image formation from a gaseous diffusion alone ? Who knows ? So, I’ll leave the door open for this possibility, even if it’s not the most probable answer in my mind. I think a combined and complex chemical process involving a gaseous and a molecular transfer can be closer to the truth… 3 Now, for the good questions you ask, I’ll give you my own answers (it’s just my personal opinion of neophyte) : a.Why is the image not MUCH denser on the dorsal side? It’s bizarre that you ask this question because, in my mind, if a gaseous diffusion would be the only responsible for the formation of the images, I would expect that the frontal side would be much more denser ! In normal condition, a gas go up and not down ! So, why both images doesn’t possess a big difference in color density ? I think it’s because the fact that it was generally just a thin layer of impurity that have been colored. If it would have been the linen fibers themselves that have been colored, in a gaseous diffusion context, I don’t see why there would not have been more color penetration in the frontal side since those gas goes up and not down. But since it’s not the case (except maybe for the image of the hair, the mustache and the beard), I think the answer is to be found in the real possibility that it was just a thin layer of impurity (more or less the same on the frontal and back side) that have been colored. I have to admit that this fact is one of the hardest for me when it comes to think that the hypothesis of Rogers, alone, can explain everything. Normally, if it was only a gaseous process, I would expect to see a denser image in the frontal part of the Shroud. That’s the way I see it. I agree that the dorsal image is harder to explain by a natural process than the frontal image. But it’s not because it seemed harder to explain it that I will start to look for some kind of miraculous process or some by product of the resurrection ! Nature can be surprising !!! b.How could vapours react to the same depth on the fibrels when touching a cloth and also too fibrels centimeters from it or color one fiber and not another immediately adjacent to it or most intriquing to reproduce a complete and perfectly defined body image from all points equally? I think a big part of the solution is again to be found on the good possibility that it was generally just a thin layer of impurity that has been colored on the surface of the cloth and to the fact that this layer of impurity was created by the evaporation concentration phenomenon. I’m not an expert in chemistry but I have a hard time to think that this natural phenomenon could leave a completely homogeneous layer on the surface. That’s why I think it’s normal that the STURP team has found some non colored fibers adjacent to some colored fibers in the body image region. That’s the only rational answer I’ve found to this day for this particular question. Here, I have to say that this layer of impurity is independent of the hypothesis of Rogers concerning a gaseous diffusion in the sense that it could well be another image formation process that could have colored the impurity layer (for example, we can think of some other products that could have created a chemical reactions). I really think a big part of the mystery is due to the possibility that it was just a thin layer of impurity that was colored during the image formation process. And if it’s true, then that mean that the image formation process was really mild because, generally, it wasn’t able to colored the linen fibers themselves. 4 You wrote : “This leaves one wondering would God just sit and wait for a natural chemical reaction to occur before removing the body alas to create these images?” The easy answer for me would be to say : Why not ? Why God could not have used the laws of his creation to leave an imprint on this cloth ? When I said that, for me, the body disappeared at the right time, I was only reporting a reality we can see (of course, in the context of a natural process of image formation). So, in that regard, it’s pretty evident that if the body would have left the Shroud much sooner or much later, we would not have those body imprints with very high resolution ! In other word, when the body left the Shroud, the timing seemed to be right ! And if it’s what really happened 2000 years ago, then we have to think it was part of God’s Will. Why it would have been that way ? I don’t know ! Maybe it’s simply because God wanted to leave us a sign of the resurrection (and a picture of himself !) and not a proof of this event, so that we can still be free to believe in it or not. This is my guess. In front of a proof, how can someone still be free ? And God wants his children to be free !!! How can you love if you’re not free ? He doesn’t want us to be forced to believe in him or not. I really think so ! So, I just can’t imagine why he would have left a proof of the resurrection on a piece of cloth… That just doesn’t fit. So, my answer to your question is this : if God used the laws of nature to create an imprint of his body, maybe it’s just because he didn’t wanted to leave a proof of this event so that we can still be free !!! Meditate on that… Talking about the bizarre Will of God, I can ask you : Why did God had to roll the bog stone in front of the tomb if his body simply disappeared ? My answer would be the same : the leave a sign (and not a proof) of his resurrection ! I think we should see the Shroud as a great sign of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and not try to find any proof of it. That’s what I think and it’s only my personal reflection on the subject. One thing’s for sure : I don’t need the Shroud to believe in the resurrection ! But I’m happy that he’s there for my personal meditation..","date":"2011-11-28","mins":"3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/24/the-belt-of-mary/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Belt of Mary"},{"id":"comment-5058","author":"yannick_clément","post":"We can discuss a long time on this debate.

Some close ups of the fibrils from Mark Evans of STURP seem to show exactly what the authors you cite conclude. And, by the way, this conclusion, for me, seem to go well with the hypothesis of Ray Rogers about the thin layer of sugar that would have been colored during the image formation process. Since this layer would have been put mainly on the surface of the Shroud by a natural phenomenon called “evaporation concentration”, I think it’s fair to assume that this layer of impurity would have been concentrated at the surface of the cloth in a random manner. To me the fact that the coloration is found in a random manner on the Shroud is another good clue (along with some other clues) that Rogers was right about his hypothesis that it was a thin layer of sugar that was colored.

Don’t you find their reaction bizarre in that circumstance ??? I do… But anyway, I still think the interpretation of Max (the same as Meacham, St Augustine and others) is the most probable because it fits well with the very next verse that would be very enigmatic if we accept the other interpretations that has been proposed over the years.

I will read this with great attention and, already, after having made a fast reading of the conclusion, I can say that Rogers was truly thinking that this discontinuous distribution could have been the result of a totally natural process, just like the two Italians scientists Fazio and Mandaglio who published some papers about the Shroud in the last few years. What is the most interesting thing to note is the fact that such a conclusion from Rogers is somewhat different than what he wrote in his book A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin: “However, identification of a probable chemical process does not explain one of the perplexing observation on the Shroud, the discontinuous distribution of the color on the topmost part of the weave.” In the end, I believe the most important thing to note is the fact that the conclusion from this “new” paper of Rogers fits perfectly well with what Fazio and Mandaglio’s wrote in the conclusion of their paper “Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image”, which was published in July 2011 in the scientific journal Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids. To me, the fact that these researchers agreed to say that the discontinuous distribution of the colored fibers in the image area IS NOT, theoretically speaking, an obstacle to the idea that the body image was formed naturally is important. Note 1: You can find this same quote from Rogers’ book at #141 in the paper I published about Rogers work, along with an important comment from me that makes a reference to Fazio and Mandaglio’s conclusion about the discontinuous distribution of the colored fibers): http://shroudnm.com/docs/2013 01 10 Yannick Clément Reflections on Ray Rogers Shroud Work.pdf With this publication of Rogers’ paper, I guess I will need to do a new update of this paper of mine in order to include his conclusion and maybe to also include some other interesting quotes that I will find… Now, the question that remains open is why the quote I just gave you from Rogers’ book seems to be so different than the conclusion he wrote in this 2001 paper? Do this means that Rogers changed his mind about this important question before his death or does it simply means that identifying one single chemical process (like the Maillard reaction for example) is not suffiscient to explain the discontinuous distribution of the colored fibers in the image area? I really think my second guess is the best one. And I think that this quote from Rogers paper strongly suggest that I’m right about that: “A partial explanation for the discontinuous and superficial nature of the image color and its chemistry might be found in the study of the technology of the production of the cloth. The technology coupled with Pellicori’s observations (of the body image fibers) might explain the nature and distribution of the color of the image.” This quote seem to suggest that, for Rogers, the discontinuous distribution of the image WAS NOT due solely on the nature of the chemical process that lead to the formation of the image but ALSO on the nature of the image chromophore, which is located, if we believe Rogers (and not Fanti or Jackson), only in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities on top of the cloth that were left there because of the type of technology (ancient) that was used to make the Shroud. On this subject, I can say that Rogers’ conclusion was somehow a bit different than the conclusion of Fazio and Mandaglio in the sense that, for those 2 Italian researchers, the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers was only due to the very mild nature of the (natural) process that formed the image. I think such a difference can be simply due to the fact that Fazio and Mandaglio didn’t agreed with Rogers’ conclusion about the impurities and remained convinced (like STURP was) that the chromophore is located in the structure of the linen fiber itself… But, as I said earlier, the most important thing to note is the fact that, for Rogers, as well as for Fazio and Mandaglio, a completely natural process IS NOT AT ALL in contradiction with the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area. This is what is the most important thing to remember… Note 2: In December 2011, Fazio and Mandaglio published a summary paper of their analysis concerning the stochastic (discontinuous) distribution of colored fibers in the image area on the Shroud in the BSTS Newsletter.

These three factors are: 1 The proximity of a fiber to the corpse (STURP estimation was that over a distance of 4 cm, no fiber were able to get colored, while Mario Latendresse estimated that over a distance of 2 cm, the image formation phenomenon had already lost around 80% of its coloring capacity). 2 The amount of “coloring agent” released in one particular spot of the dead body (for Rogers, this was related to the amount of amines, including amoniac gases, released by the dead body). 3 The amount of impurities present over one particular fiber. This is important because, a lot of time, the image formation process is not explained and understand like this. Effectively, the third factor is rarely considered, while it can well be one of the most important factor that lead to the coloration or not of a particular fiber of the Shroud! In sum, if Rogers was correct about the whole issue, we can conclude this: 1 If one particular fiber was located at more than 4 cm away from the body, no dehydration (coloration) process could occurred, even if this fiber was sumbit to a suffiscient amount of “coloring agent” (amines in Rogers mind) and/or there was a suffiscient amount of carbohydrate impurities over it. 2 If one particular fiber wasn’t submit to a high level of “coloring agent” (amines in Rogers mind), no dehydration (coloration) process could occurred, even if this particular fiber was located at less than 4 cm from the body and/or there was a suffiscient amount of carbohydrate impurities over it. 3 If one particular fiber did not had a certain amount of carbohydrate impurities over it, no dehydration (coloration) process could occurred, even if this particular fiber was located at less than 4 cm from the body and/or was submit to a suffiscient amount of “coloring agent” – amines in Rogers mind. With this comment of mine, I think it’s pretty easy to understand how complicated the image formation process that produced the body image on the Shroud really was!!! In other words, the fact that one particular fiber became colored or not was not simply due to one single factor but to a combination of many factors that could interacted together (if Rogers was right, there were at least three main factors). Taking note of this very important fact, we can now understand better what Rogers wrote in his book: “If image color is not simply a result of color formation in the cellulose of the linen fibers, image formation must be a MUCH MORE COMPLEX PROCESS than we originally thought (note: here, Rogers is referring to the STURP work).” I hope this summary of Rogers thinking versus the image formation issue will help some of you to understand how complicated this image formation process must have been. A lot of times, when I hear an interview or when I watch a TV documentary about the image formation process that occurred on the Shroud, only one of these three “facilitating” factor (two when we are lucky) is mentioned and it’s a shame because this do not help the public to understand correctly the most probable high complexity of the image formation phenomenon that occurred on the Shroud..","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/update-to-shroud-com-2/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Update to Shroud.com"},{"id":"comment-42543","author":"yannick_clément","post":"One last comment from me for today: First I want to write more properly my list of three “facilitating” factors with a precision for factor #2: 1 The proximity of a fiber to the corpse (STURP estimation was that over a distance of 4 cm, no fiber were able to get colored, while Mario Latendresse estimated that over a distance of 2 cm, the image formation phenomenon had already lost around 80% of its coloring capacity). 2 The amount of “coloring agent” THAT WAS PRESENT OR released in one particular spot of the dead body (for Rogers, this was related to the amount of amines, including amoniac gases, released by the dead body). 3 The amount of impurities present over one particular fiber. Note: I prefer to add “that was present or” before “released” because it is still possible (even if it’s improbable) to think that the image formation process that occurred on the Shroud was caused solely by a direct contact interraction between the surface of the linen cloth and a biologicial or burial or another kind of substance that was present (maybe in liquid form) on top of the skin (and maybe also on top of the dried blood clots). In such a case, the expression “released” would be somewhat misleading because it fits much better with energetic radiations, post mortem gases, biological molecules, etc. That could have been “liberated” from the dead body… That’s why I chosed to add the expression “that was present or” before the word “released”. Secondly, I just want to say that, if Rogers was correct about the image formation that occurred on the Shroud, it’s not only imperative to talk about a VERY COMPLEX image formation process involving many facilitating factors (see the list above) but it is also imperative to talk about a VERY MILD process. Effectively, look closely at the three factors I talked about in my previous comment (and in this one) and note how a very slight change in one of the three facilitating factors could have had a huge impact on the final aspect of a particular fiber (i.e. Whether the fiber would be colored or not). All this lead me to conclude that I’m certainly not dumb to favored the idea that it was a completely natural process that lead to the formation of the image on the Shroud (because this idea fits very well with the probable nature of the image formation process, i.e. Very complex and very mild)… And it also lead me to conclude that it’s not surprising, in such a context of a very complex and mild process, to note that no one has been able yet to reproduce the image we see on the Shroud with all the same chemical and physical characteristics. Imagine the amount of luck someone must have to reunite all those facilitating factors in the same form than what was present on the Shroud and on the body (and/or inside it) 2000 years ago! As I said before, in my mind, someone must need a highly tortured body to have some chance to reunite all those factors in the same form than what was present 2000 years ago, so I don’t expect we will see this hapening in a near future!.","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"9:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/update-to-shroud-com-2/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Update to Shroud.com"},{"id":"comment-42544","author":"yannick_clément","post":"And you also need most certainly a linen shroud that would be made with a very specific (and ancient) form of manufacturing technology.

Breault about his point of view of the ENEA experiments ! : ) I especially disagree completely with this statement that I think is completely false : “But it at least establishes with scientific plausibility that light was somehow involved with the image.” THIS MANNER OF THINKING IS ONLY TRUE IF YOU DO EXTRAPOLATIONS, SUPPOSITIONS AND SPECULATIONS. I have explain my point of view enough on that question, so if you want to know more about what I think, check out my other posts on this topic !!! All I know is this : In order to link directly the experiments made by ENEA with the Shroud, you need extrapolations. And who will do that ? Of course, those who believe the resurrection is directly responsible for the body images (in the sense of a by product causing the images) will be the ones who will do those kind of extrapolations… We can easily understand that, but at the same time, it is far from being a “correct” way to see those results, scientifically speaking. Here I use the term “correct” with great care in the sense that, of course, anyone can think like that, but please don’t pretend it is a real scientific point of view.

He express the point of view that I defend here from the very moment I started to write on this blog. People must understand one important thing about faith : science cannot enter in this field. It just can’t. Why ? Simply because science is restricted to the MATERIAL world and faith goes beyond that into the SPIRITUAL world ! It’s pretty amazing to see the high number of people who can’t make the difference. The spiritual world is not something that can be analyzed and proved with a microscope. It’s more of a heart thing than a brain thing… That’s it. But I love the way M. Stanford put it when he say : “But nevertheless, it is (the Shroud) a powerful focus for our thoughts on the subject.” EXACTLY ! And would add this : For some other people, a beautiful icon of Christ or of the virgin Mary or some crucifix or other religious object like that can do the same job. And I also know that one other object do even a greatest job for most christian and this book is the new testament ! As a catholic, everyday, I read the readings of the day proposed by the Church and today, it is special because it’s the feast of St John. And just before the reading of the gospel part where St John talk about the finding of the empty tomb (with St Peter), here’s what the Church said : “Alleluia. Alleluia. John, the beloved disciple, has borne witness to the Word of life, and we know that his testimony is true. Alleluia.” Once you REALLY BELIEVE in this, you don’t NEED the Shroud for your faith….","date":"2011-12-27","mins":"5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/26/whether-it-is-genuine-or-not-its-miraculous/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whether it is genuine or not, it’s miraculous"},{"id":"comment-29800","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Concerning the question of the importance for a scientist to get his work published in a peer reviewed journal, I think you should read this recent comment of mine: https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/05/a committee far removed from padua/#comment 29504 Even if this is a MUST for any credible and profesionnal scientist to get his work published in a CREDIBLE peer reviewed journal, the only thing that can give us some insurrance about the validity of his work is if another scientist, working completely independently from the first scientist, came to the same conclusions. And, in my mind, if this second scientist used a different protocol and/or methodology and came nevertheless to the same conclusions than the first scientist, this has even more value. The same is true if a third scientist, working also completely independently from the first two scientists, came also to the same conclusion. The best example of this kind of insurance factor regarding the Shroud can be found in the conclusions reached independently by Adler and Heller in the US and Baima Bollone in Italy versus the question of the nature of what appeared to be bloodstains on the Shroud. Both came to the same conclusion (i.e. That the blood on the Shroud is really blood and that it mostly came from exudates of humid blood clots instead of coming from complete blood), even though they sometimes used different methods and protocols.

All he care is what you are : his beloved children. The God of Jesus don’t make any category like we always do! It is the disciples of Jesus (including the ones who wrote the Gospels) who wanted to make believe that, to be saved, you had to believe in Jesus. This can be understood easily if you replace things in the proper historical context of the communities to which these texts were written. The first purpose of the Gospels was not to convert people but to encourage the new convert to keep their faith in Christ, no matter the difficulties they add to endure. In that context, it is understandable that the Gospel writers put words in Jesus mouth (like in the chapter 3 of St John) and made him say things like : to be saved, you must believe in the Son of Man and things like that. The purpose of this was to encourage the Christians to keep their faith at all cost because the first disciples of Jesus knew that this was the best way for hapiness! But if the God of Jesus would really act like that and only wanted to save those who believe in him or in his son, he would not be Love at all and, in truth, he would just be like anyone of us, i.e. A poor human being. Not great! I believe in a God who is a God of love and who don’t think and act like us (i.e. Who don’t make any category of humans and who only care about the fact that we all are his beloved children). To me, that’s the real God of Jesus. And to be saved, the only thing you must have is the will to be happy, because God is hapiness in person and love everyone of us. Don’t you believe that we all have the same father in heaven whos is love and we’re all brothers and sisters? If that’s true, then that mean that God will never accept to lose one single of his beloved children and will do anything he can to save us all. Read carefully the parable of the lost sheep in St Luke and you’ll understand what I mean.

At that moment, be certain that all our liberty will shoot : YES!!! Don’t worry my friend… Those who reject God here on Earth are only doing this because they don’t know him. In fact, most of them only reject the God of fear that you describe and they are right to do so! Seriously, you really want to live an eternal life with a monster? Not me! You can be sure that if God is anything else than pure love and mercy, I will go into darkness with a big smile on my face because I would not be able to live happy in his Kingdom while knowing that, at the same time, some of my brothers and sisters would suffer eternal pains or would be in total darkness! And the bottom line is this: Because he is Love, God would never had dared to create this world if he wasn’t sure that everyone of his beloved children would end up in his Kingdom of love and happiness at the end of time.

Because it is the only way to be totally happy and free here on Earth and that’s why Jesus urge us to do so (I should say to try so because, as sinners, it’s evident that we cannot do that all the time). If we love God who is love, I think the best way to show this is by trying (at least trying) to be good the best we can. And if we failed, be sure that God will still love us because he’s love and not human. We can’t merit heaven by our good deeds. It is a pure and free gift of our merciful Father in Heaven. Just by understading that, it is enough, I think, to at least try hard to act like him in our life. No need for fear to do so.

The profound meaning of this prophetic deed of Christ is exactly that : We cannot do trade with God because he is love and not human ! We cannot buy his love. We cannot merit his love. IT IS A FREE GIFT. And here on Earth, I think the best example of that is the pure love of a mother or a father for his child. The parent who act with love versus his child is not doing this to merit something or to get something out of a trade. He only do this because he love his child. That’s exactly the same thing with God versus all of us.

And, since 1988, they would admit that the work of Rogers and Adler (particularly) seriously put the dating in question ! One thing is scientifically proven now (and if you don’t trust this it’s because you don’t trust the honesty of Rogers and Adler) : The only sample they took to date the Shroud was not representative of the main cloth. Now, for the question of how can that be, there’s many hypothesis. The one I favored the most is the invisible reweaving but there can be some other possibilities. The important thing is that the C14 sample was chemically different, period.
