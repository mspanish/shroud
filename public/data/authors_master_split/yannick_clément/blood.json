In fact, I know by experience that this is a false problem! Effectively, some years ago, I cut myself on the forearm with a tree branch and the wound looked pretty much like on the scourge wounds on the Shroud for the shape and the dimension. I let it dry completely without putting any bandage on it. Then, I forgot about it for approximately 5 hours. And then, I had the nice idea to verify Barbet’s hypothesis concerning the transfer of the blood on the Shroud, i.e. Coming in many cases from exudates of dried blood clots, whom surfaces had become humid again, most probably because of the water vapor released by the corpse. For such an experiment, I simulated the moistening action of the water vapor on the dried clots by putting some saliva on top of the dry wound and then, I placed a kleenex over it and applied a weak pressure on the wound. Guess what? I obtained a nice mirror imprint of my wound on the kleenex with absolutely no smudge, very much like the scourge marks we can see on the Shroud! From that day on, I knew that Barbet was right on everything that is related to the blood transfer that occurred on the Shroud. Then, I knew that every bloodstains on the Shroud were not caused by some post mortem bleeding in liquid form after a vigorous washing, as proposed by Zugibe, but by exudates of still humid blood clots or exudates of dried blood clots that were able to get moistened again, probably because of the water vapor released by the dead body (except maybe, as Barbet told us, for a probable post mortem bleeding in the feet area because there was probably an oozing of blood from the holes in the feet that never closed on a dead body – and not because of a washing of the feet)..","date":"2013-05-31","mins":"11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35461","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Most important conclusion to draw from my personal experiment: It is still possible to produce a nice mirror imprint of a dry wound on a fabric, even more than 5 hours after the drying has been completed, as long as there is enough moistening at the surface of the wound.

And the fact is that Adler’s findings are totally consistent with Barbet’s hypothesis. 2 Barbet though he could seen some very pale halos of serum with his own eyes but cannot prove this. But in his mind, this was totally logical in the context of the Shroud man, since halos of that nature were normally formed around dried blood clots during what is called the clot retraction process that happen during the drying of the clot with expulsion of serum around the clot. Pellicori and Miller of STURP have showed that Barbet was right about the presence of these serum halos and Adler also confirmed this with his analyses. 3 Barbet was very specific about the FACT that the bloodstains on the Shroud, because of their particularly precise shapes, could not have been formed by liquid blood, except maybe for some stains in the region of the feet. He said that any drop of liquid blood inside the Shroud would have produced preferential direction in the new formed stain that would have been easy to noticed on a linen cloth with an herringbone weave like the Shroud, while there are none. It’s also easy to assume that many smudges of blood would have been formed. There’s no doubt that this is what would have happened if Zugibe’s hypothesis was correct. For all these reasons, I think we can forget the idea of Zugibe and understand that Barbet’s hypothesis concerning the particular form of blood transfer on the Shroud is most probably right. In the end, is it possible that there was a gentle washing of the corpse that didn’t removed the blood clots and help these clots to get re moistened so they could be able to left mirror images of themselves on the Shroud?

I also think you should read carefully the part of Barbet’s book in which he described the particular kind of blood transfer that, in his mind, occurred on the Shroud in order to cause the vast majority of the bloodstains we see on the cloth. Note that, for Barbet, there are only some bloodstains in the feet area that could have been formed by a drop of post mortem blood in liquid form inside the cloth after the body had been placed there. For Barbet, all other bloodstains came from the same particular transfer mechanism, i.e. From exudates of still moistened or, in other cases, of re moistened blood clots.

I think I have been able to demonstrate a certain number of facts. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN SUCH BEAUTIFUL IMAGES, WITH BORDERS AS PRECISE AS THOSE ON THE SHROUD, WITH ANY COLORING LIQUID, NOT EVEN LIQUID BLOOD.” Note: I think Zugibe should have read this part of Barbet’s book more carefully. By doing so, he would never have proposed the hypothesis of a vigorous washing of the corpse being able to remove the clots in order to produce an oozing of fresh post mortem blood in liquid form that would have caused the formation of the scourge marks on the cloth. Ok, here’s the rest of Barbet’s quote: “There are on the Shroud almost no images of blood flows, like it is represented by painters. On the other hand, there’s no need to think that the corpse, emptied during the transfer of the body (note: from the place of execution to the tomb), could have emitted notable quantities (of blood) in the Shroud. Every bloody images of the Shroud are then decals of fresh clots (note: like the most recent blood flows from the feet and wrists and the post mortem blood flow from the side wound) or clots that have been softened by the water vapor (note: like all the scourge marks, which were most probably completely dried for a long time when the Shroud man died), which is normally released by a corpse during a pretty long period of time. These portraits of clots are very natural, of a startling truth, up to their most tiny details (note: the UV fluorescence analysis done by Miller and Pellicori of STURP proved that Barbet was right about that when they noticed the very precise details, invisible to the naked eye, present in the scourge marks). These can only have been caused by nature, which has formed them on the skin and then, transferred them on the sheet. These are perfect reprints of natural clots. No artist could have been able to imagine them in all their meticulousness, before back off in front of insurmountable difficulties of execution.” Comment from me: I can say honestly that I’m more convinced than ever that what Barbet said in this part of his book is right on the target versus the reality of the bloodstains on the Shroud. And why do I am so much convinced that Barbet was right? Simply because this come from an honest medical expert who knew what he was talking about and, more importantly, because most of his most crucial conclusions about the bloodstains (especially the conclusion that the vast majority of these stains have not been formed by liquid blood but by exudates of moistened or re moistened blood clots) have later been scientifically and independently confirmed by Adler and Baima Bollone. On this subject, here’s a very important quote from Adler’s book “The Orphaned Manuscript”: “Although they sometimes differ on certain matters, all of the medical forensic examinations of the blood images are in agreement that they were EXUDATES FROM CLOTTED WOUNDS transferred to the cloth by contact with a wounded human male body consistent with the historic descriptions given for the Crucifixion of Christ. This conclusion is also consistent with the computer imaging evidence (note: from a study done by Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline of STURP)… Enzymatic removal of the blood from a blood coated fiber reveals that the blood got on the cloth first and therefore protected the blood covered areas of the cloth from the image forming process. ALL THE MICROSCOPIC, CHEMICAL, SPECTROSCOPIC, AND IMMUNOLOGICAL EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THESE IMAGES, NOT ONLY BEING EXUDATES FROM CLOTTED WOUNDS, BUT THOSE OF A MAN WHO SUFFERED SEVERE TRAUMA PRIOR TO DEATH, EXPLAINING THE RED COLOR OF THE BLOOD AT THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL.” Note: Again, if Zugibe could have taken good note of this part of Adler’s book, he would never have proposed his hypothesis about a vigorous washing of the body that have removed the dried clots on the skin of the Shroud man producing an oozing of post mortem liquid blood… The sum of scientific evidences reported here by Adler (along with the fact that it is impossible for liquid blood to produce the very precise shape of the bloodstains we see on the Shroud) is not at all consistent with Zugibe’s hypothesis. Now, let’s get back to Adler’s quote: “Proposed mineral compositions simulating blood are not consistent with these various measured chemical and physical parameters. That these are CLOTTED WOUND EXUDATES is clearly seen in the ultraviolet photographs where every single blood wound SHOWS A DISTINCT SERUM CLOT RETRACTION RING (note: this is not at all the same thing as an oozing of post mortem liquid blood and serum from an open wound) agreeing with the earlier observations of the pioneers (note: Adler talks about Vignon and Barbet) on the major blood wounds as seen directly on the cloth. It is clear that we can explain the presence of the blood images on the cloth consistent with their alleged origin.” I hope everyone is able to realize now that Barbet and Adler’s conclusion concerning the bloodstains are different and irreconcilable versus Zugibe’s hypothesis of a vigorous washing of the corpse that would have been the primary cause of the formation of the scourge marks on the cloth! It’s one or the other. We cannot hold both conclusions together… Personally, I am totally convinced that Zugibe’s idea was incorrect and that it is Barbet and Adler who were right about the particular kind of blood transfer that lead to the formation of most of the bloodstains we can see on the Shroud, including the numerous scourge marks. I’m also more and more convinced that Adler’s explanation for the reddish aspect of the bloodstains is the most probable that exist. And as jesterof said the other day (and I agree with him): the only question that remains unanswered for the moment concerning the particular color of those stains is why the bilirubin, which is normally an unstable compound, have been preserved inside the bloodstains for so long, up until now, thus producing a redder (brighter) color than normal, especially these stains are seen in sunlight. Concerning this question, as jesterof also said on the blog, there are tons of natural causes that can be potentially good to explain the preservation of the bilirubin until this day, starting with the simple fact that the bloodstains on the cloth are dry and that they were caused by exudates of humid blood clots instead of liquid blood, along with the possible presence of saponaria residues on the cloth that could also have played an important role in this preservation of the bilirubin, etc., etc… I hope this will help some people around here to see more clearly what is the real truth concerning the blood on the Shroud! And please, don’t forget my own little experiment of blood transfer, which proved that it is very easy to produce a mirror image of a wound that has been dry for several hours on a piece of fabric, as long as enough moisture is present on its surface and a small pressure is put on the fabric. I really hope this observation of mine (I which I could have taken pictures of this, but I swear to God I only tell the truth) can help some people to understand that there is nothing strange or supernatural about the fact that the scourge marks are those of wounds that were probably dried for a pretty long time when the Shroud man died on the cross….","date":"2013-06-02","mins":"4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35799","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Complementary comment: In the case of ancient wounds like the scourge wounds, my own experience proved that such ancient clotted wounds could easily produced mirror imprints on a piece of fabric as long as there is enough moistening over them.

Can you ask it again in more clear terms please? I thought you were pretending that there was no différences between an halo of serum caused by the clot retraction process of blood clotting and an halo of serum caused by an oozing of post mortem bleeding. In the case of the Shroud, Adler and Barbet were precise about the fact that the halo of serum (which were first described by Barbet and later confirmed by Miller and Pellicori as also by Adler) were caused by the phenomenon known as clot retraction when the clot is in his drying phase on the skin.

Adler and Barbet were very clear about the fact that these stains (not only the scourge marks but most of every other bloodstains as well) came from exudates of humid blood clots, which is totally different than bloodstains made of liquid blood. Quote: “when you are talking about the description of ht stains by Barbet/Adler and telling that those contradict what Zugibe is writing – are you talking about the same stains?” Answer: Of course I am talking about the very same stains, which are the scourge marks. Zugibe thought that they were caused by an oozing of liquid post mortem blood after the removal of the dried clots by a vigorous washing while Barbet (and also Adler) conclude that these stains were made of exudates of blood clots that were still humid enough (Adler) or that became re moistened thanks to the release of water vapor by the corpse (Barbet), so they could leave the kind of precise mirror imprints of themselves on the cloth. Both hypotheses are incompatible. It’s one or the other… We cannot hold both together, sorry. One must be wrong here: Zugibe or the Barbet Adler tandem. Quote: “But there could be – the body could have been washed not in a way you expect – to wash away all the clots, but it could have been just moistening them, not washing away.” Answer: This idea sound very irrealistic to me for many reasons. The main argument against that is the fact that there is absolutely no smudge of blood that would have been caused by an oozing of post mortem blood in liquid form, particularly in the region of the back, which would certainly have happened if only a few clots would have been removed thanks to the washing (which, in my mind, would have certainly happened in a few places, even if the washing would have been done very mildly). Also, the simple fact that dirt have been found in the region of the heels and knees is another strong argument agains the idea of a washing (whether it be a gentle or a vigorous washing). Effectively, I don’t see the Jews of Jesus time (who were very meticulous normally) leaving evident traces of dirt on very exposed body parts like the knees… Finally, if the Shroud is the genuine shroud of Jesus, the idea of a washing has to be seen in contradiction with the Gospel accounts of an hasty and incomplete burial because of the arrival of the Sabbath and Passover feast. Along with these strong arguments, I’m sure that if I think about it for some time, I will come up with some more arguments… But the 3 I just bring you are solid enough to understand that a gentle washing of the body is unlikely….","date":"2013-06-02","mins":"7:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35911","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This is one of the most pretentious message I ever get… I could say many bad things here but I prefer to shut my mouth.

This picture show the result of a transfer on cloth, which Zugibe pretend is exactly how the scourge marks where formed on the Shroud, following a washing (vigorous enough to remove the dried clot – is it good enough for you now?) of the body. After your reading of the quote I give you and the watching of Figure 1, I dare you to say once again things like “(Zugibe) did not write about “oozing of the liquid blood.” The reality is this: Zugibe’s hypothesis rely on a washing of the body that would removed the dried blood clots, and this would produced an oozing of post mortem blood in liquid form which would be responsible for the scourge marks on the Shroud. Look again at Figure 1 and I dare you to say to me that this is not liquid blood that come out of the wound right after the washing.

If this is what you think (honestly, I can’t see anything else), then I’m affraid you’re wrong. Why the Jews who did the burial in haste (if it’s really Jesus) would have lose time (maybe 15 to 30 minutes) before placing the body inside the Shroud after his washing?

If a ritual washing occurred, no doubt that they would have placed the body inside the cloth right after and, in such a context, the oozing described by Zugibe would have been one in liquid that would have produced indistinct bloodstains with a number of evident smudge, especially in the back region because of the weight of the body… I’ll wait for your explanation.

They are carmin, a little bit mauve. More or less intense and dark depending of the wounds…” I think this particular quote proves that Barbet was well aware of the fact that the blood on the Shroud showed a somewhat unusual color (particularly in daylight or under another source of UV light) but, at the same time, this particular color did not seemed to have bothered him at all when he saw it in sunlight in Turin and immediately conclude that these stains could not have been made by anything else than real blood! I think this is enough to conclude that, for Barbet, this particular color (when the blood is seen in sunlight or under another form of UV lighting) did not represented any problem at all regarding the question of the authenticity of the blood on the Shroud, which seems to indicate that he probably had a perfectly natural explanation for it. Effectively, even though he was a real devout Catholic and he cleverly noted that the bloodstains and the body image do not seemed to have been disturbed by the extraction of the body before he could decay inside the cloth (which he saw as a great sign of the Resurrection on the Shroud), Barbet always thought that the bloodstains and the body image had been formed on the cloth by totally natural mechanisms… So, concerning the “special coloration” (Barbet’s words) of the blood, what was the natural explanation of Barbet? No one knows since he never, as I known, talked publicly about that. But one thing’s for sure: The simple fact that he didn’t talked about that in his writings is a good clue that this color never was an issue for him. Or else, it is evident that he would have described the problem in his book and, knowing Barbet, he would have tried to give it a proper scientific explanation. Personally, I think the most rational explanation for this carmin mauve (other authors said carmin red) color of the blood (when it is seen in sunlight or under another form of UV lighting) remains the one described by Alan Alder concerning the presence of a level of bilirubin much higher than normal in the traumatised blood of the Shroud man, because, as jesterof told us recently on this blog, it is a proven fact that bilirubin in blood act like a “brightening agent” when it is put under sunlight or another source of UV light. Note that if this explanation for the color of the blood is the correct one, it fits perfectly in the context of the Shroud of Turin, which is the real burial cloth of a highly traumatized and crucified man (note: this is the main scientific conclusion of the STURP team)….","date":"2013-05-29","mins":"8:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35376","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Nothing.

At least, I think we can already make this logical deduction: If the reddish aspect of the blood on the Shroud is mainly due to the high level of bilirubin that was in the Shroud man’s blood at the time of his death, then the Sudarium was most probably not used to covered the same head than the Shroud. And here’s another one: If, on the other hand, the reddish aspect of the blood on the Shroud is due to the presence of saponaria residues, then it is truly possible that the Sudarium was used on the same head than the Shroud but was never washed with saponaria, which would explain why the blood on it doesn’t appear reddish like the blood on the Shroud but appear much more normal for a very ancient blood (at least concerning the tonality of the blood’s color).

THIS IS PURE RATIONAL THINKING! The answer must reside in the extreme tortured state of the Shroud man and/or in the ancient technique of manufacturing linen cloth that was used.

Presently, we have two very interesting proposal of a natural explanation for the reddish aspect of the blood on the Shroud (the one of Adler concerning bilirubin and the one of Rogers concerning saponaria), so I think the focus of experts should be set on these 2 potential explanations and, truly, more researches under good laboratory control should be done to verify these 2 hypotheses properly. I don’t see why, at this stage of Shroud science, any credible and honest scientist would have to look for some supernatural explanation concerning this reddish aspect of the blood. If one day, all the natural explanations are proven wrong concerning the Shroud, then maybe we could go looking for more extravagant explanations, but not now. Why looking for some extraordinary explanations when the solution is most probably related to the extreme tortured state of the Shroud man’s body during the time he was on the cross or to the ancient method of making linen cloths like the Shroud?

The answer to your question is very simple : In Jerusalem, at the time of Christ, there were many rich families of Jews (often associated with the Saducees) who were hellenised (i.e. Living in the Greak way). The Pagan coins you mentioned that were found in Jewish tombs of that period must have been found in Hellenistic Jewish tombs. Having said that, I just want to add : Jesus was NOT an hellenistic Jew. He was a Galilean Jew from the crowd. Because of this (including the fact that his preaching was completely opposed to the Saducees philosophy), it is highly unlikely that Pagan coins were used during his hasty burial. Of course, some (like you probably) could think that Joseph of Arimatea and/or Nicodemus could have been hellenistic Jews and, therefore, could have used Pagan coins for the burial of Jesus, but this is a pretty wild assumption that, to me, should not considered as probable. We must remember that other people were present at Jesus’ burial (like John and his mother) and those people were NOT hellenistic Jews.

Now, for the particular problem of the gap between the 2 head images, as I said, I think the most likely explanations that we got for the moment are: – There was a gap (which could have been maybe smaller than 4 cm) between the top of the head of the Shroud man and the Shroud, which was enough to prevent the formation of this lateral part of the body, – There was a small cloth (or some other thin object) that was placed between the top of the head and the Shroud, which acted like a shield and prevent the formation of this lateral part of the body. Some people talk also about the possibility of a Jaw band brought around the top of the head and tied in order to keep the mouth close, but it is very difficult for me to agree with such a hypothesis because of what we see on the Shroud and especially the image of the side of the face (there is an image there but very faint) and the loose hair. I don’t think there would have been an image of both sides of the face that would have been formed if a jaw band would have been placed in those areas.

Note: In my opinion, I don’t think if that was the case, this would necessarily discard any natural process for image formation, especially if the energy transfer was not 100% radial.” Summary of what I said: We still don’t know the exact image formation mechanism and because of this, we still don’t know if such process was able to work laterally, especially in areas where there were no direct cloth body contact. And if this unknown mechanism was not able to produce an image when the cloth was located away from the lateral parts of the body (even by just maybe 1 cm or less – who knows?), then the hypothesis of Mr. Latendresse is still plausible in regard of the dimension of the gap that exist between the 2 head images on the Shroud. I would like to comment this quote: “The absence of an image at the top of the head can only be explained by an intervening cloth such as a type of cap – check Cap of Cahors!” Comment: This is a conclusion way too drastic in the present case… We’re dealing here with a complex question and, because of what I said about the fact that we still don’t know for sure what was the mechanism that formed the image, there’s still some possibilities left open, such as the one proposed by Mario Latendresse that I exposed in my post (who studied that question much more in deep than me or you and, unlike you and me, is qualified to do so).

I have my own suspicions as to the reason but shan’t mention them here.” Comment: I think our friend Carlos is thinking, like you do (without expressing it) that this would mean the image was created by a burst of intense energy at the time of the Resurrection. But there’s one problem with this assumption and that’s where the most probable bending of the Shroud man’s head toward his chest become important! Effectively, if this was the way the image was formed (i.e. A totally vertical burst of energy acting only straight up and down), we should expect to see an image of the frontal head that would be much longer than the image of the back of the head because of this most probable bending of the head toward the chest, which would have forced the frontal side of the cloth (the one that was located over the Shroud man’s body) to be in direct contact with not only the whole upper part of the face but also most of the frontal part of the top of the head because of gravity (which would not have been the case for a good portion of the back part of the top of the head). THIS IS NOT WHAT WE SEE ON THE SHROUD where both images of the head have more or less the same dimension… I hope people will understand the reasoning I just expressed here. This is, for me, another good clue to believe the image was not created by a sudden burst of energetic radiation, and so, no matter if there was a smaller cloth placed over the head or not. In other words, because of the most probable bending of the head toward the chest (this kind of bending as been described by experts like Barbet), if the image was caused by a burst of energy from the Resurrection that would have acted straight up and down, we should expect to see a longer portion of the head on the front part of the Shroud and an image of the backside of the head much smaller in length and so, no matter if there was a small cloth over the head or not.

Effectively, this probable bending is very important because, if it is the case and the Shroud man had his head bent forward in direction of his chest when his body was placed inside the Shroud, it is much harder to accept the idea of Mario Latendresse that the cloth would not have been in direct with a very good portion of the top of his head (especially the “frontal” portion) because of gravity UNLESS the cloth was somewhat stiff as it was considered by some members of STURP as a true possibility. With this explanation, I hope you understand now the potentially huge implication a possible stiffness of the cloth could have had on the absence of an image between the 2 heads on the Shroud. In sum, if (the “if” is important here) no small cloth was present on top of the head of the Shroud when his body was placed inside the Shroud, the most likely explanation that would remain to explain the absence of an image between the 2 heads on the Shroud would be to think like Mr. Latendresse that the cloth was not in direct contact with the top of the Shroud man’s head after his enshrouded body was laid in his final resting place inside the tomb. But because of the most probable bending of his head toward his chest linked with the law of gravity, we have to assume that the Shroud would have been somewhat stiff, which would have made it possible for the cloth to remain at some distance (maybe less than 4 cm, who knows?) from the major portion of the top of the Shroud man’s head (the part of the head that has not produced any image on the Shroud). In other words, what I say is this: If Mario Latendresse’s hypothesis (the one he described here on the blog recently) is correct, then we must assume that the cloth was somewhat stiff, because if not, the bending of the head would have force it to come down in direct contact with the top of the head because of gravity. Important note: The hypothesis of Mr. Latendresse (which is the one I still consider as the most probable but only if we think the cloth was somewhat stiff at the time of the burial of the Shroud man) can also be apply for the absence of an image of the other lateral parts of the Shroud man’s body and, once again, the possible stiffness of the cloth would certainly make such a hypothesis more realistic. And finally, if it’s true that the original Shroud was somewhat stiff, this must have been due to a remain of starch on the threads after the washing of the final cloth (most probably concentrated on the top surface of the cloth because of the final drying in open air), which would have certainly been the major substance that would have composed the thin layer of impurities proposed by Ray Rogers that would have coated most of the top surface fibers, making it possible for those fibers (and only those) to get colored by the very mild image formation process (most probably natural). In other words, the confirmation of a certain stiffness of the Shroud at the time of the image formation (I don’t know if this will ever happen) would certainly represent a good reason to think Rogers was right concerning the image chromophore Final note: All I’ve said here is of course only hypothetical and theoretical. More researches need to be done, not only by experts like Mr. Latendresse to evaluate the most probable configuration of the Shroud at the time of the image formation, but also eventually by a chemist who could be allowed to analyze properly some non image fibers of the Shroud in order to confirm or reject the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the image chromophore (i.e. The image would be located only in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities mainly composed of starch, which would be concentrated on the topmost fibers of the cloth and, because of this, the entire structure of the linen fibers (including the primary cell wall of the fibers) would be free of any image color).

In other words, because the head was most probably bent a little bit toward the chest, the only rational way the cloth could have stayed away of the frontal part of the top of the head is to assume it was somewhat stiff. 2 Carlos assume that both image are due to a burst of energy coming from the Resurrection that only acted straight up and down and that the Shroud was in direct contact with most of the head (including the top of the head). But if this scenario was true, I think we should expect to see an image of frontal head that would be longer than the dorsal one because of the most probable bending of the head toward the chest, which would have forced the frontal part of the Shroud to cover a major portion of the top of the head. Also, because of this probable bending of the head toward the chest, I think the gap between the 2 head images would have been much thinner than what we see on the Shroud, if Carlos scenario was right.

And as I said in my guess post, other solutions (like the presence of a small cloth on top of the head) is still another possible solution, but presently, I still think the one proposed by Mr. Latendresse is the most logical because we don’t have any ancient reference for the use, in Jewish burials, of that kind of cloth that would just cover the top of the head. The cap of Cahors is far from being proven genuine and I don’t think there is any ancient reference in old Jewish texts to confirm the use of that kind of cloth during a Jewish burial… I can’t be wrong here but I don’t remember having seen any credible reference (or archaeological finding) that would support the use of that kind of cloth (which is different from a simple strip of linen that could have been used to keep the mouth of the dead closed)..","date":"2014-03-05","mins":"5:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"id":"comment-85985","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “We must all be extremely grateful to Mario Latendresse for his wonderful Shroudscope on the web, but I feel sure that if Mario checked the measurements described he would also see that there can be no gap. The separation of ventral and dorsal images needs to be extended by at least an additional 6cm to produce the 4cm gap required for a lack of top of head image.” I would like to hear Mario’s opinion about that. He studied this question in dept over the years. Do you really believe he never did some measurements? Seriously… So, if he did some and came out with the idea that a gap was possible, I tend to listen. And one thing you seem to neglect: The Shroud image has no definite borders and his located on a linen cloth that can move a bit depending of many factors! How can we be certain of the real length of any parts of the Shroud man? Another thing we must keep in mind: From what I see on the Shroud, it’s pretty evident that a portion of the top of the head have been able to get on the cloth (what I call the upper frontal part of the head and the upper dorsal part of the head, which were imprinted on the Shroud, even though they were possibly not in direct contact with the cloth). To me, the only part that is totally missing is the extreme top of the head, which certainly do not measure a long distance (and which is most probably less than the gap that exist between the two head images). Because of this, I still think the absence of an image of the extreme top of the head can be explain by the possible configuration of the Shroud that would have caused a certain gap between the cloth and that part of the head, but ONLY IF THE CLOTH WAS SOMEWHAT STIFF.

I’m talking about Mario Latendresse of course. Here’s what he wrote on this blog on January 16, 2014: “I would also add that the lack of side images do not need a complex explanation. IT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISTANCE OF THE CLOTH TO THE SIDES OF THE BODY. That is, from the assumption that the imprinted image has recorded the cloth/body distance, and the body is loosely covered by the cloth, the distance of the sides of the body are too far away to be recorded at all on the Shroud. This does not preclude the possible existence of a cap (Cahors?) to be on the head, but THAT WOULD NOT BE NEEDED TO EXPLAIN THE LACK OF IMAGE COMING FROM THE TOP OF THE HEAD.” (link: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top of head puzzle/#comment 73414) And here’s another comment he wrote the same day: “Why would the cloth be necessarily in contact with the top of the head? The cloth could simply have extended a few cms away because the distance of about 23cms between the back and front images would allow it. We would need to have a very accurate knowledge of the size of the head to conclude otherwise.” (link: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top of head puzzle/#comment 73420) Note: Can’t you see that my conclusion is pretty much the same as the one expressed by Mr. Latendresse, who is an expert in mathematics who analyzed the question of the configuration of the Shroud in deep since many years. Consequently, does this mean he’s also a “dogmatic” person? This is ludicrous… By the way, I think people didn’t read my guess posting carefully because if they would have done so, they would not consider me “dogmatic” as Matthias, Daveb and others think. Read again my guess posting: “Of course, other potentially good solutions other than the one proposed by Mr. Latendresse the other day exists to explain this absence of an image there (like the idea of a second smaller cloth that could have been placed on top of the head of the Shroud man and inside the main Shroud during the burial procedure), but I still prefer the hypothesis of Mr. Latendresse, at least for the moment.” Sometimes, the most dogmatic people are not the one who are accused by the one who accused… Please look at yourself in the mirror guys! Take Daveb’s post for example: I’ve never seen him agree to let the door open for other possible solutions than his own! Not once! Come on! This is a complex problem and sure enough, there are more than one possible solution… It’s the same thing concerning the question of the image formation process. People think I consider only the hypotheses involving a natural phenomenon but it’s completely wrong. Read again my paper about the bloodstains evidence (link: http://shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf) and you’ll see that I present 4 very different scenarios to explain the image formation and only one of those 4 scenarios involve some kind of natural phenomenon! Of course, this is the one I favored the most (in face of all the known data coming from the Shroud) but, nevertheless, I am honest enough to let the door open to other possibilities.

Effectively, because those who did the burial procedure on Friday knew perfectly well they had to come back on Sunday (after the Jewish Sabbath) to finish the job (which included probably a washing and an ointment of the corpse), there was no need to tied up the cloth around the body, since they knew they had to remove the corpse from inside the Shroud on Sunday to wash it and anoint it. This use of linen strips to tied up the cloth around the body was probably in their plan, but only after the completion of the whole burial procedure on Sunday. Note: the bloodstains in the feet region can suggest that maybe some form of strapping (probably with a linen strip) have been used in that region to maintain the cloth in place around the body. 4 The absence of an image of the back of the knees on the dorsal part of the Shroud (which was confirmed by Miller and Pellicori’s analysis of their UV fluorescent photos and most probably caused by the distance existing between the still bended knees of the Shroud man and the dorsal part of the Shroud) is another data that, along with the two I just mentioned, should be enough to conclude beyond any reasonable doubt that no linen strips were used to tied up the cloth firmly around the body (with the possible exception of the feet region),that the Shroud was simply placed in a pretty loose way over the corpse and that the dorsal part of the cloth was most probably simply resting horizontally on top of the place were the enshrouded corpse was placed (probably a stone bench), which means the cloth was not in direct contact with many parts of the backside of the Shroud man’s body. Note: the presence of an image of a good portion of the backside of the head (including a portion of the upper part of the top of the head) strongly suggest that, for this particular region of the body, the Shroud was not resting on the ground (i.e. Stone bench) after the burial procedure and at the time of the image formation, but that it was most probably following more or less the contours of the backside of the head, which is natural in the sense that it is there that the second half of the Shroud was folded in order to cover also the frontal part of the corpse. Note: the absence of scourge marks in the upper region of the thighs in the dorsal image can also be taken as another good clue to back up the conclusion that no linen strips were used to tied up the cloth firmly around the body (with the possible exception of the feet region),that the Shroud was simply placed in a pretty loose way over the corpse and that the dorsal part of the cloth was most probably simply resting horizontally on top of the place were the enshrouded corpse was placed. 5 Because of the most probable bending of the head of the Shroud toward his chest (which is, sadly, a data that doesn’t appear to have been considered by Mario Latendresse in his paper about the most probable configuration of the frontal part of the Shroud at the time of image formation), which would normally have caused the Shroud, because of gravity, to fall directly on top of a good portion of the extreme part of the top of the head, thus causing the formation of an image (which would have logically produced a longer image of the frontal head versus the image of the back of the head), we can assume (like German of STURP, who’s idea was accepted by Rogers and Schwalbe as a real possibility) that the cloth was somewhat stiff at the time of the image formation. 6 This stiffness would have been the primary reason why there was still a certain gap between the extreme part of the top of the head and the Shroud after the burial procedure and at the time of the image formation and we can also assume the same thing concerning the probable gap that was existing between the lateral parts of the Shroud man’s body and the cloth at that moment. Those are my personal conclusions on this subject, which came from a long reflection and lots of reading. Of course, if other data come in my way and/or if some experts on the subject show me some good clue that suggests something else, I’ll be willing to reconsider some of my conclusions. I see this as a work in progress… Also, I acknowledge of course that other hypotheses and conclusions can be (and have been) put forward by other people and I still left the door open to some of those (like the presence of a possible very small cap or, more probably, very small cloth resting on the extreme part of the top of the head), even though such opening is not very wide for the moment. I just wanted to summarize my own conclusions here, so that it can maybe start a new reflection in some people’s heads.

Those temporary direct contacts between the bloodstained corpse and some parts of the Shroud would have caused the transfer of some bloodstains on the cloth (because most if not all blood clots were humid enough to transfer on the cloth when the body reached the tomb). Finally, when the body was placed in his final resting place at the end of the burial procedure, the Shroud was probably replaced in a looser way with the result of taking the cloth away from the corpse in many places, including the back of the knees and the lateral part of the elbows, among other places like both sides of the face (i.e. Removal of some manual compression that was applied during the short transfer of the enshrouded body). In those particular areas (i.e. Back of the knees and the lateral part of the elbows), we can assume that the cloth was enough far of the body (possibly at 4 or more cm of distance) to prevent any image formation. Note: Most people who studied the Shroud over the years have seemed to assume the body was placed inside the cloth directly in his final resting place, but that doesn’t make much sense since the kind of resting places that were existing inside 1st Century tombs in Jerusalem were not big enough to allow this kind of enshrouding. In all logic, the corpse must have been placed inside this long shroud elsewhere, in a place where there was enough room to operate, which can well have been a central place inside the tomb or even a clean place outside the tomb. Consequently, it is most probable that they moved this enshrouded body afterward to laid him in his final resting place, which was probably a stone bench carved inside one of the tomb walls. Such a transfer of the body, even if the distance was short, surely caused some manual compression in many places and it’s logical that some of those were later removed at the end of the burial procedure….","date":"2014-03-10","mins":"10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"id":"comment-87366","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “What a grumpy old man…” I hope people can understand now why I reacted so hard the other day versus one comment made by Daveb… The problem with the Shroud is that, very often, it doesn’t only imply a scientific quest but a mix of scientific quest and very personal emotions (often religious emotions related to the fear that this relic could be the work of a forger and not the real burial cloth of Christ and/or the fear that the image could have been caused by a natural process, even though this is the real burial cloth of Christ)… By the way, I would like to hear our friend Daveb about the pretty good argument I put forward against the hypothesis of a small cap or small cloth on top of the head, which is that there seem to be way too much hair on the Shroud image (on the front as well as on the back image, including hair that appear to be located on the upper parts of the head on both images) to believe there would have been such a cap or cloth resting between the top of the Shroud man’s head and the inner part of the Shroud (which would have prevent the formation of an image of this area).

Here’s again what Adler said about the absence of a body image under the blood : “The protease was only active against the serum coated fibers and as in the previous study, revealed SMOOTH, NON CORRODED FIBER SURFACES.” It’s very interesting to note that these words from Adler that I just wrote in capital letters are almost the same (word for word) that were used by Ray Rogers to describe the state of the resulting linen fibers after the used of diimide to reduce the body image coloration and also to describe the state of the resulting linen fibers after a ghost of coloration was left stuck in the sticky tape !!! AM I THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE NOTE THIS VERY INTERESTING SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE BLOOD AND SERUM STAINS AND THE BODY IMAGE ON THE SHROUD ??? I have now a strong tendency to believe that both the blood and serum stains AND the body image are both “foreign” substances to the linen fiber (including the famous PCW) because both are probably resting on top of the fibers (both are probably coating substances) without having a direct oxydizing and/or dehydrating effect on those fibers, which remained white, smooth and clean under both sorts of coating. Interesting postulate don’t you think ??? If Rogers is right, that’s exactly the outcome of both the blood transfer and the body image formation… I have a feeling that one day, science will be able to confirm this postulate..","date":"2012-08-03","mins":"3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/03/did-the-bloodstains-really-precede-image-formation-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Did the bloodstains really precede image formation on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-14460","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Concerning what I said in my previous comment about the probable fact that both the blood and serum stains AND the body image are coating substances residing on top of the linen fibers on the Shroud, I want to share this little reflection with all of you. It’s a reflection that, if it’s right, can help to understand that Adler’s finding about the absence of a body image under the blood is most probably correct. Here it is : If we believe Ray Rogers opinion concerning the image formation process that caused the body image on the cloth, this process was very mild and was only able to colored the thin layer of impurities residing on top of the fibers while, at the same time, being completely unable to react directly with the linen fibers underneath this coating. If he’s right about the fact that the body image formation was very mild, wouldn’t be normal then that this process (most probably chemical in nature) was also unable to react with the fibers located underneath the blood and serum stains ??? I really think so ! To me, this is a very good argument in favor of Rogers conclusion concerning the chemical and mild nature of the image formation process that happened on the top surface of the Shroud !!! Effectively, if the image formation process was stronger than a chemical reaction (let’s think about a burst of some sort of energy for example), in Rogers mind, this would have affected not only the thin layer of impurities but also the linen fibers. In this context, don’t you think that if the Shroud’s image was caused by an energetic process like that, it would have also affected in some way the linen fibers located underneath the very thin layer of serum ? I think this reflection of mine deserve some thoughts ! It would be nice, for example, if M. Di Lazzaro could be able to do an experiment with his UV laser on a linen sample where a thin layer of dried serum would be present and see if the linen fibers located underneath the serum would be affected by the UV light in some way. Of course, for this experiment, he would have no other choice except to use the UV laser shots with the very same characteristics (the same number of shots, the same intensity, etc.) than what he used before to obtain a thin coloration of the primary cell wall of the linen fibers. A similar experiment could be done also to analyzed the effect of a corona discharge on a linen sample where a thin layer of dried serum would be present. If the result would caused any kind of noticeable effect on the linen fibers located underneath the serum stain, then we would have a very clear indicator it is not that way that the body image on the Shroud was produced. I would be the first one to encourage M. Di Lazzaro and other scientists to do this kind of experiment… Of course, it’s interesting to claim that you have obtain a coloration pretty much like the Shroud’s image (and you might honestly think it is true), but if you really want to be scientifically rigorous in such a claim, your results MUST match every aspect that we know concerning the body image that is on the Shroud and not just the tone and the thickness of the coloration !!! You must be able to show proofs that your process will not affect at all the linen fibers that would be located underneath a thin stain of blood or serum !!! And presently, the fact is that we don’t know what would be the result of UV laser or corona discharge on samples like that… Of course, all this demand of whether or not Rogers hypothesis concerning the image chromophore is correct. But anyway, I still think my proposition of testing should be done to see more clearly to probable degree of similitude in the result of UV lasers and corona discharge (and also other energetic radiations) versus the body image on the Shroud… What do you think of this research proposal ?.","date":"2012-08-03","mins":"7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/03/did-the-bloodstains-really-precede-image-formation-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Did the bloodstains really precede image formation on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-38836","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote from Dan : “I don’t know if anyone said this before Goldblatt but it has been said in countless ways since.” Info from me : To my knowledge, the first who ever noticed this bizarre feature about the bloodstains (which comes from exudates of clotted blood clots) is the French surgeon Pierre Barbet (probably in the 1930s). I’m pretty sure Vignon also noted this fact but I never had the chance to read his books about the Shroud, so I can’t tell for sure. Comment from me : I was struck by the comment made by Phillip H. Wiebe during the Orvieto conference of 2000 because, without ever reading it, I came to the VERY SAME CONCLUSION with my personal reflection. If it’s true that there is no sign of disturbed bloodstains (which really seems to be the case if you look at HD close ups from the Shroud), then the ONLY rational explanation for it is to think that the bloodstained corpse only stayed in direct contact with the cloth for a very short period of time; short enough that most of the blood was still not completely dry when the body was taken out of the Shroud. But, as Wiebe cleverly noticed, in such a context, it seems very improbable that an image like the one on the Shroud could have been formed on the cloth in a so short time frame (most certainly one hour or so), especially if the image formation process only involved a natural phenomenon. Nevertheless, I still wonder if the presence of a lot of burial anointing oils on the Shroud man’s body and/or on the Shroud itself and/or the presence of a lot of humidity inside the cloth could have been enough facilitating factors that could have allowed the manual extraction of a body from inside the cloth many hours (and even many days) after it had been placed there without disturbing too much the bloodstains and the underlying fibers ??? I guess this question has never been analysed properly under good lab control. And since no one was present during the burial of the Shroud man, I think honesty forces us to leave the door open for a natural and rational explanation for this very particular feature noted by Barbet and others… But as I often said here on the blog, in the end, it doesn’t matter to me if this feature is or is not a real sign of the Resurrection of Christ. It doesn’t matter because that’s not there that, in my mind, we can find the most important sign of this Supernatural event… No! The most stricking sign of the Resurrection of Jesus versus the Shroud is the fact that such a gruesome and morbid burial cloth that didn’t stayed in contact with a crucified corpse long enough for the arrival of the first liquid of putrefaction had been kept and well preserved until this day! Effectively, as the mother of Barrie Schwortz cleverly said to him one day: If this burial cloth would belong to another person, no one would have thought to kept and preserved it! Truly, in order for some first century Jews to keep such a cloth, they must have been totally convinced that Jesus was resurrected ! Or else, they would never have dared (or even thought) to keep it! But here again, we must be prudent with this sign because it will never be a proof of anything else than this: it is only a proof that some followers of Jesus where convinced that he was alive again.

Read again: “Nevertheless, as I said the other day, of course I encourage real experts like Mr. Kearse to ask for more testing on those stains and to perform those tests if its one day possible.” Read also again: “In sum, when it comes to the blood and serum stains, we can conclude this: Do we have all the possible data concerning those stains? No! Will it be a good thing to gather those missing data? Of course!” And concerning the idea that Adler could have had some doubts if the blood and serum stains could be something else than the blood and serum stains of the Shroud man, the answer is a definitive NO. In his scientific reports, he couldn’t pretend the blood was surely human, but in his later writings, he made it clear that it cannot, in all logic, be something else. In the case of Baima? SAME THING. Read again their books! I should have note what Adler said in the intro of his book when he saw the Shroud in person. It was something like: Look! It’s blood! If it’s not the words used by someone who was totally convinced of the “authenticity” of those stains, then I don’t know what it is. For Adler, seeing those stains with his own eyes was enough to confirm his conviction that this was the real blood and serum stains of the man depicted in the body image. And it’s the same thing for a wide range of experts on the subject like Pierre Barbet, Rudolf W. Hynek, Giovanni Battista Judica Cordiglia, Sebastiano Rodante, John Heller, Robert Bucklin, Frederick Zugibe, Gilbert Lavoie, Pierre Merat, etc. You only have to read all their writings to understand they were all totally convinced of the real nature of those stains. And if it’s so, it can only mean one thing: for all of those specialists, those stains were so obviously coming from a crucified man that they couldn’t thought for one second that they could have come from someone else than the Shroud man himself. Or else, they would never had showed a so great confidence in their conclusion that what appear to be real human blood and serum on the Shroud cannot be anything else than real human blood and serum and, even more than this, that those stains must have come from the Shroud man’s corpse who once was enveloped in that cloth. Last note: This message of yours prove to me that you’re exactly like a modern astrophysicist who would still cast doubts over the existence of exoplanets because we still have some data to gather in order to get a full profile of those planets or just like a modern historian who would still have doubts concerning the reality of Jesus’ existence because there are still a bunch of unknown data concerning this issue. The question is not if we have the full profile of those stains today (of course no!), but if we have enough data to conclude those stains cannot have come from anything else than the Shroud man himself? The answer of Adler, Baima Bollone, Zugibe, Barbet, Lavoie and a bunch of other experts is a definitive YES. Their confidence on this question is good enough for me and I don’t need to wait for the supplementary data because I know those stains couldn’t come from anything or anyone else than the Shroud man, especially when we consider the FACT they most of those stains comes from moistened blood clots. It’s funny to see that you never talked about this FACT and it’s implications… Adler and Baima knew what this imply..","date":"2014-06-22","mins":"7:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/20/everyones-own-facts/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Everyone’s Own Facts"},{"id":"comment-131835","author":"yannick_clément","post":"[I have removed this paragraph at Yannick’s request.

If you read this book, no doubt you’ll understand that Adler was 100% convinced that the blood and serum stains on the Shroud were made of the real blood of the Shroud man (he was even more convinced of this fact when he had the chance to see the Shroud up, close and personal in Turin at the end of the 1990s and he talk about that experience in the intro of his book. This is evident when you read this book, just like it is also evident when you read Baima’s book called in French “101 questions sur le Saint Suaire” (101 question on the Holy Shroud): http://books.google.ca/books/about/101 questions sur le Saint Suaire.html?id=XO8 Av Kv Ww X4 C&redir esc=y.","date":"2014-06-20","mins":"5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/20/everyones-own-facts/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Everyone’s Own Facts"},{"id":"comment-132368","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I would like to complete my thoughts on the subject raised by Mr. Kearse in the summary of the upcoming presentation he will make in St Louis… Let’s take the courtroom analogy for a second: After having read almost everything published by Adler and after having read the most important things published by Baima Bollone on the issue of the blood and serum stains and remembering that those are the only two specialists who did legit testing on real samples taken from the Shroud during the 1978 investigation that were recognized by both the Church authorities and the vast majority of the scientific community, I’m totally convinced that if they would have been called in a trial about the nature of the stains supposedly made of human blood and serum, both of them would have swear to God and their professional reputations that those stains are definitely made of real human blood and serum. I have absolutely no doubt about that and I dare anyone who has read what these 2 experts have written on the subject to contradict me about that. This is a fact: Both Adler and Baima Bollone were true experts in determining if a particular stain is made of real blood or not or if it’s made of real serum or not. Both of them were totally convinced that what appear to be real human blood and serum on the Shroud cannot be anything else than real human blood and serum and, even more than this, that those stains must have come from the Shroud man’s corpse who once was enveloped for less than 72 hours in that cloth (i.e. Before the apparition of the first liquids of putrefaction), especially when we take into account the FACT that most of those stains came from moistened blood clots and not from fresh blood in liquid form. On the other hand, I agree with Mr. Kearse about the fact that there still data that needed to be gathered in order to get a full and complete profile of those stains and I’m sure both Adler and Baima Bollone would have recognized that fact. In sum, if the judge during the trial would have ask them a question about that, I’m sure they would have said something like: “It’s true that there are still some missing data, especially when it comes to DNA studies, BUT we already have well enough data to conclude, beyond any reasonable doubts, that what appear as real human blood and serum on the Shroud is exactly this. And, as complementary experts, if the judge would have call for other experts who have analysed the Shroud over the years (like Pierre Barbet, Rudolf W. Hynek, Giovanni Battista Judica Cordiglia, Sebastiano Rodante, John Heller, Robert Bucklin, Frederick Zugibe, Gilbert Lavoie, Pierre Merat, etc.), I’m also totally convinced that the vast majority of them would have backed up the testimonies of Alder and Baima Bollone completely, saying that those stains cannot be made of anything else than real human blood and serum and that those stains must have come from the Shroud man’s corpse who once was enveloped for less than 72 hours in that cloth. Of course, like any other scientific inquiry, some (like Mr. Freeman did on this blog the other day) will always find one or two experts to contradict all those positive testimonies, but the sum of the positive testimonies is so huge that no honest and intelligent man will listen to those contradictor at all. Here’s a parallel example: Even if the vast majority of the real historian would be willing to testify in court that Jesus of Nazareth really existed and that he was a real Jew who lived in Galilee at the beginning of the 1st Century of our era, there will always be one or two historians to stand up and claim the contrary, but no honest and intelligent man will ever listen to them at all. In other words, even if it would be great to get more proofs of his existence, we have now enough data to consider a sure fact the reality of Jesus of Nazareth as a Galilean Jew of the 1st Century. One more analogy that is a very good one that can be link with the issue of the blood and serum stains on the Shroud: Even if no credible and professional astrophysicist on this planet would ever testify in court that we already have all the data to get a full and complete proof of the existence of exoplanets in our Universe, we still have well enough data already to claim beyond any reasonable doubts that those planets are real. I firmly believe it is the very same situation with the question of the authenticity of the blood and serum stains on the Shroud. Of course it would be great to have a full profile of those planets when it comes to the kind of revolution they make around their star, their diameters, their time of rotation, the kind of atmosphere they have, etc., and to get high definition images and of course it would be great to make a complete DNA study of the stains on the Shroud and to make back up testing on new samples to verify the reliability of Adler and Baima Bollone’s results, but in both cases, the truth is this: We don’t need those additional data to be totally convinced, beyond any reasonable doubts, that what appear as real human blood and serum on the Shroud is exactly this and, in all logic, cannot have come from anything else than the tortured corpse of the man who once was enveloped in that cloth for less than 72 hours. I say this mainly because of the fact that both Adler and Baima Bollone, while they worked totally independent of each other, ended up with the same positive conviction concerning those stains, but also because of all the complementary analyses of Shroud images made by credible experts like Zugibe, Barbet, Bucklin, Rodante, Lavoie and many others who also ended up with the same positive conviction as Adler and Baima Bollone. Here, it’s interesting to also note that some great scientists of STURP like Ray Rogers, who are not willing to call something a fact without enough data to back up such a claim, never expressed any doubt in their scientific writings about the conclusion that what appear as real human blood and serum on the Shroud is exactly this. In sum, when it comes to the blood and serum stains, we can conclude this: Do we have all the possible data concerning those stains? No! Will it be a good thing to gather those missing data? Of course! But do we have enough data to be certain that those are made of real human blood and serum? Yes! Nevertheless, as I said the other day, of course I encourage real experts like Mr. Kearse to ask for more testing on those stains and to perform those tests if its one day possible, but when I got to bed at night, if there is one thing that I’m 100% sure in this world, it is the presence of real human blood and serum on the Shroud of Turin, which cannot have come logically from anything else than the tortured corpse of the Shroud man and which imply that this cloth is a real burial cloth that once contain the remains of a real beaten, scourged and crucified man who look exactly like the Jesus of the Gospels. And what gives me that great confidence is the fact that both Adler and Baima Bollone had the very same positive and strong conviction after having analysed their samples from the Shroud and having seen the relic up close and personal in Turin. THAT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE CONVINCED OF THE REAL NATURE OF THOSE STAINS AND WHAT SUCH A CONCLUSION IMPLY (for details, read my paper on the subject: http://shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf). And I believe this should be the case for anyone interested by the Shroud… That’s precisely why I believe that the paper an expert like Mr. Kearse will present in St Louis possess the potential to open (re open would be more accurate) a Pandora’s box versus the blood issue IF (that word is important) such a paper end up with the conclusion that there is still some doubts over the fact that what appear to be real human blood and serum on the Shroud can well be something else than this and/or if such a paper conclude that the real human blood and serum on the Shroud can come from someone else than the Shroud man himself… If that’s the case, this would leave the door wide open once again for all the sceptics out there (like Colin Berry for example) to say that, because of the opinion of this DNA expert, we are right to consider the so called evidence coming from those stains (which, in fact, represent the strongest reason to discard every possible human forgery hypothesis) as highly doubtful and, therefore, we are right to consider those stains as being unable to prove the hypothesis that the Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man who look like Jesus of the Gospels. Therefore, we are right to still claim that this relic can well be a human fake! Personally, I believe that such a thing would be wrong… Completely wrong. But that’s what can happen if the paper of Mr. Kearse still cast strong doubts over the strong and positive conviction showed by both Adler and Baima Bollone after their analyses of Shroud samples. Conclusion: If we could all (this include the sceptics) start on the base that the Shroud is a real burial cloth that enveloped a real crucified man for less than 72 hours (precisely because of the strong evidence coming from the blood and serum stains), then I’m sure the exchanges here would reach a much higher degree of rationality, credibility and honesty about any issue regarding this relic… Note that such a base of discussion doesn’t mean necessarily that the Shroud can offer a strong scientific piece of evidence for the reality of Jesus Christ’s Resurrection or that it must be seen as a complete proof that it is really his authentic burial cloth. This is important to understand, especially for all the sceptics out there. It just means that, in no way now, we can reject the possibility of the Shroud being the authentic burial cloth of Jesus, because the blood and serum stains on the Shroud are telling us that this cloth is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man who had been tortured in the same way as Jesus of the Gospels. In fact, I believe such a hypothesis must be seen as very strong, precisely because of that. Sorry for the length of this comment, but this issue is the one I have studied the most and which I consider the strongest piece of evidence in favor of the authenticity of the Shroud that came out of the whole 1978 investigation and I had to express in details my fears that a paper like the one Mr. Kearse will present in St Louis will re open a debate that should be consider as something that has been already “classified” since a very long time… In the end, my hope is that those fears of mine can end up being unfounded. And if you don’t agree with this term “classified”, please read carefully the books written by Adler and Baima Bollone. And if you still have some doubts, then read what Barbet and Zugibe said on the question of the bloodstains in their own books….","date":"2014-06-22","mins":"5:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/20/everyones-own-facts/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Everyone’s Own Facts"},{"id":"comment-131816","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Keep on analysing Mr. Kearse.

Adler made it clear in his book that he was convinced of this. Baima did the same thing. I repeat that it’s good enough for me because both did their analyses totally independent of each other and both were true experts in detecting if a stain is made of blood or not. And as Adler said it so well in his book: if the Shroud’s blood comes from a baboon (or some other primate), this would mean a forger would have need to wait until the blood of such an ape would have got time to clot! This is pure fantasy… To me, the evidence coming from the bloodstains is the most solid piece of evidence that comes from the 1978 scientific investigation.

Please read the long comment I just posted at the bottom of this page (without ever reading your last comment because I wasn’t aware of it) and you’ll see that we got pretty much the same general idea regarding the whole affair, except that I tend to look at more than just the scientific tests and results obtained by Adler and Baima Bollone, which is probably why I have a stronger conviction than you (at least, as it seem to me) concerning the fact that what appear to be real human blood and serum on the Shroud cannot be anything else than real human blood and serum and, even more than this, that those stains must have come from the Shroud man’s corpse who once was enveloped for less than 72 hours in that cloth. In sum, I consider not only the data but the very strong and positive personal convictions of both Adler and Baima Bollone after having done their tests and after having seen the Shroud up close and personal in Turin, as well as the fact that a vast majority of the medical and forensic experts who have studied the images of those stains came out, just like Adler and Baima Bollone, with the strong and positive conviction that what appear to be real human blood and serum on the Shroud cannot be anything else than real human blood and serum and, even more than this, that those stains must have come from the Shroud man’s corpse who once was enveloped for less than 72 hours in that cloth.

I truly appreciate his use of Barbet’s book. Dave accurately reported that, for Barbet, the water described in John 19:34 was pericardial fluid which would have accumulated in a great amount from the trauma of crucifixion but even if I agree with Barbet’s point of view, I think it would be fair to report the conclusion of Zugibe and Bucklin who both thought that the water was coming from a pleural effusion instead. But, as Barbet said, for this to happen, we must assume that this pleural effusion would have been massive because normally, such liquid would be located in the lowest part of the lungs, which is placed UNDER the location of the side wound… Nevertheless, I thought it was interesting to note this alternative possibility. One thing’s for sure: Even if the water John reported having seen was understood by many theologian as non historical and only as an image of baptism and new life, the medical examination of the Shroud’s image and bloodstains is a scientific proof that in fact, it is probable that John really saw water coming out of Jesus side, along with blood. In such a case, we can have a better understanding of John brilliant way to write his Gospel! Effectively, it’s very probable that most if not all the events reported by him in his book were based on true historical events, but he was able to create some extraordinary theological images and teaching out of those events. Brilliant way to teach Jesus’ message! That’s why John is, by far, my favorite Evangelist.

Do you have an example of an image of the hair of a person left on linen by a corona discharge ? That’s just an example of the problems related to this hypothesis. And that doesn’t come from me but from Ray Rogers himself. Here’s what he said on that subject : “The lower density of the hair makes it UNLIKELY that large amounts of either HEAT OR RADIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN THE HAIR. This suggests that vapor diffusion was involved in image formation, because any fibrous mat, INCLUDING HAIR, reduces the rate of diffusion of gases. Fiber mats are used for insulation, because they reduce gas diffusion and heat transfer by convection.”.","date":"2012-08-05","mins":"5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/05/giulio-fanti-responds-are-you-listening-yannick-and-colin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds. Are you listening Yannick and Colin?"},{"id":"comment-14849","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here, I want to express in detail my opinion versus the samples used by Gérard Lucotte for his researches about the Shroud. Part of his study and findings has been published in a new article included in this “special edition” about the Shroud. I must also say that this opinion is valid also for any other researches that could have been made with the same kind of samples that were used by Lucotte. Lucotte state in his article that the samples he used for his study came from the dust that was vacuum by prof. Riggi in 1978 (and also in 1988 if I’m right) on the BACK OF THE SHROUD. If this is really true, these kind of samples are much more subject to “false positive” results than the sticky tapes samples lifted from the internal surface (the one where we see the image) of the Shroud by STURP because for the vacuum dust, there is absolutely no way to learn the exact original position of any particles on the back of the Shroud. And even more problematic : We have no way to know if some parts of this material was originally on or in the Shroud or if it come from the Holland backing cloth that was in direct contact with the back of the Shroud !!! And it is also possible to think that some particles collected by Riggi were in fact external intrusive stuff that were deposited between the Shroud and the Holland cloth at some unknown dates after 1534, when the Holland cloth was sewn behind the Shroud to solidify the relic after the fire of 1532. So, taking all these things into account, I hope everyone will see the big problem that exist concerning the real scientific validity (and value) of such samples of dust… And last but not least, there’s another great danger regarding these particles : The time gap that exist between when Riggi took them and today. The last time he collect dust samples with his vacuum was probably in 1988 !!! It’s been 24 years now !!! And if we considered only the dust particles he took in 1978, that’s 34 years from now… The fact is this : During all these years, there is absolutely NO WAY to be certain if Riggi preserved these dust particles properly, without giving any chances for an external contamination from other dust particles coming from elsewhere than the back of the Shroud, i.e. From all the places he kept his samples during all those years. This is a MAJOR problem concerning this kind of very fine dust particles and that’s just add to the interrogations I’ve raised above concerning the real scientific validity (and value) of such samples. How can we be sure if Riggi preserved his dust samples the correct way to avoid any external contamination ? The truth is this : There’s no way to be sure about that !!! In his book The Rape of the Turin Shroud, William Meacham gives a very fine example of such a problem concerning samples that were separated from their original resting place for a long period of time. He report that in 2000, Jacques Evin and Robert Otlet made a proposal for further testing in order to confirm or not the C14 result of 1988. Part of their proposal included some tests to be carried out on the reserve piece that was cut out from the original C14 sample and kept in Turin. Here’s what Meacham wrote about that : “There are several basic PROBLEMS with this approach, notably the fact that the so called “reserve” has been SEPARATED from the Shroud FOR SO MANY YEARS, that is has been in VARIOUS HANDS and STORAGE CONDITIONS, and cannot be said any longer to REPRESENT even the samples that were dated.” I really think the same caution principle should be applied to the dust samples that were taken from the back of the Shroud by Riggi so many years ago. Scientifically speaking, it is simply impossible now to state without any doubt that these particles offers an authentic representation of the original dust that was present on the back surface of the Shroud at the time Riggi collect them… There’s just too much unknown related to these ancient samples (after 24 to 34 years, I think it’s fair to call them “ancient samples”) to put a blind confidence in them. That’s what I think. Because of all these potential problems exposed above, a GREAT DOUBT exists and it will never be possible to erase it completely. So, be very cautious before putting your faith in the finding claims made by Lucotte and anyone else who have studied these dust particles. It is far from being sure that they really come from the Shroud and/or that they were originally present when the body was removes (or disappeared) from the cloth. Rogers said this in his book : “Such evidence would never hold up in court.” He was talking about the real validity of the few red particles that were found outside the inner wrapping that contained the Zina thread, but the same line of thinking can be also applied (even more maybe !) to these dust particles collected by Riggi. In the particular case of Lucotte’s study, to be more precise, we should say “these mineral particles found in the dust collected by Riggi. The truth is this : All these kind of loose particles could have come really from anytime, anywhere… Since it is IMPOSSIBLE to be sure that all this material was originally on the Shroud, all the claims that can be made from their study should be taken as containing a HIGH RISK OF ERRORS DUE TO BAD INTERPRETATIONS AND CONTAMINATION. Of course, you can trust what you want but, personally, I would not put my confidence in any finding made only from these dust particles (whether it come from Lucotte or any other researcher) and I prefer to wait for an independent confirmation of these findings from what was find by the STURP team with their sticky tape samples and also from a future direct sampling on the Shroud’s surface (hypothetical for the moment) that could be performed more properly, scientifically speaking, i.e. With much more precision and professionalism than what was done by Riggi. To accomplish that, a direct lifting of particles (with a sticky tape like STURP did in 1978 or maybe with another more modern method) should be preferred over another vacuuming of the cloth (that should be avoid completely). I really think that any finding that come from these dust particles should be considered with a great prudence !!! That’s what I think. Carlos the other day states that the problem in Shroud science (or any other kind of science) could come from the methodology that is used. Even if I agree with him, it’s obvious that there are other types of problems that could pollute Shroud science. In the particular case of Lucotte, I think there’s 2 major problems not related to his methodology : 1 The highly questionable validity of his samples and 2 His own questionable credibility and integrity versus the Shroud. These are two important problems that we can detect (or at least suspect) in this particular case and you can be sure that it’s not the only problematic case of that nature in all the history of Shroud science !!!.","date":"2012-08-12","mins":"6:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/05/giulio-fanti-responds-are-you-listening-yannick-and-colin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds.

That’s what happen when you read too fast a document that his written in another language than your native tongue !!! The sample Lucotte analyzed didn’t came from the dust from the reverse side of the Shroud that was collected by Riggi with a vacuum but from a small sticky tape sample applied by Riggi in 1978 in the region of the face where there was a bloodstain. Nevertheless, the caution principle I exposed is still good to some extend, especially for the part where I talked about the possible problems of contamination and representativity of such an old sample that surely endured different storage conditions and that was probably handled by many persons. In other words, we must still be very prudent versus the claims made by Lucotte concerning the particles he found in this very little sticky tape sample ! So, don’t be too fast to reach prematured conclusions about that and I’ve noted in Piero’s last comment that his personal prudent interpretation of the results cannot surely be called “prematured” or “inconscious” ! Bravo Piero for being prudent like that. That’s the right way to see these results obtained by Lucotte. And remember that Adler and Heller in the US and Baima Bollone in Italy, even if they have done many analyses of blood particles from the Shroud NEVER found anything of that nature in their samples (at least, to my knowledge). This is one fact that seem to favored the option #1 of Piero, which deals with the idea of a surface contamination of the sample. In face of all the data collected by STURP and Baima Bollone, I really think there’s a pretty good chance that these mineral particles came from a contamination… Again, we must remember the old age of this particular sample and the fact that we don’t know the exact conditions (and the number of different conditions) of storage, along with the fact that we don’t know how many hands have touched this sticky tape sample over the years. Last comment : This caution principle versus any ancient sample from the Shroud is also true for any sample that was collected by STURP in 1978… I think Shroud science should avoid making analyses like that on such questionable samples and instead, wait patiently for another series of direct researches and sampling from the Shroud that will surely be accepted one day.

On the second part of the question, i.e. The identity of the man of the Shroud, I am currently writting a follow up paper that will analyze the question in deep. Personally, I have no doubt at all that this is the Shroud of Jesus of Nazareth, since the Shroud is a real burial shroud of someone who bears all his stigmatas.

As Mr. Freeman said in one comment : “Among mainstream historians, Wilson’s hypothesis, call it what you will, has little or no standing.” By the way, I would like you to also refute the very interesting two parts paper that was published by Davor Aslanovski in 2012.

This is far from being a banal discovery. Rogers himself was able to scientifically confirm the presence of this starch on the Shroud, which help to understand that it is a cloth that was most probably made with an antique technique of manufacturing linen cloths and also, this can help to support Rogers hypothesis about the chromophore of the image, which would be located ONLY in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities. And if it is really the case, then we could absolutely forget once and for all every pseudo scientific hypothesis involving some kind of energetic radiation. Here’s again the most important quote of Rogers on this subject: “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source : the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was no more defective than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” With this statement (which can be found in a paper published by Manny Carreira), Rogers made it very clear that it is almost impossible (we can guess something near absolute zero in probability) to ONLY colored a layer of impurities so thin on top of a linen fiber without causing evident defects in the structure of the linen fiber itself… Evident defects that are simply not present on the surface of colored fibers, if we believe Rogers expertise. So, like it or not, I hope you can now understand that Mc Crone truly made an important contribution to our knowledge about the Shroud of Turin.

The heart of the first few messages I post on top of this page has not been understood well, so it seem. People, once again, have only placed the focus on my hard critics against Wilson’s hypothesis, while my intention was not at all to start another public trial against Wilson’s antics and ideas. I want people to realize this: it’s not so much the man that I hate than the way he supposedly do his “scientific” research about the Shroud’s ancient history and, as I know, I’m far from being the only one who thinks like this (see the posts of Mr. Freeman above and you’ll see that even professional historians thinks the same). And, to me, it is also the same thing for a bunch of other Shroud researchers that I don’t need to mention the name here but who are evidently doing Shroud “science” with dishonesty and for a wrong purpose. Having said that, here’s what is the most important message I wanted to deliver to the pro Shroud world: You constantly spit in the face of guys like Mc Crone, Nickell and some others and you got the right to do so since it’s evident that those people are or were dishonest versus the scientific reality of the Shroud and wanted to make money and/or to get fame “on the back” of this prestigious relic. But, why do I never see the same kind of reactions when someone is publishing ludicrous and unscientific pro authenticity hypotheses? In other words, why is it always all black (so it seem) for those who do not believe in the authenticity of the Shroud and is it all white (so it seem) for those who are defenders of its authenticity? To me, there is a very bad politically correctness that pollute the Shroud world since the days of STURP, which is doing a very bad damage for the credibility of Shroud science because it really gives the impression, for people from the outside like me and like most of the scientific community, that every pro authenticity researchers defend each other’s conclusions AT ALL COST, even when they are aware that some of them are truly dishonest in their way to do their “science” and to build their “theories”. In such cases, instead of seeing well deserve and strong critics from those who are pro Shroud researchers, all I see versus the bad antics of some others pro Shroud researchers is big pats on their backs, like saying : Keep on my friend ! You deeds are truly helping to discredit Shroud science some more, but that doesn’t matter to me, since you are convincing people of the authenticity of the Shroud with your pseudo scientific conclusions and “theories”! So, here’s my advice to all the pro authenticity researchers out there: If you want to keep on seeing very good and scientific papers like the one written by Kelly Kearse in 2012 about the AB blood type being rejected by every serious scientific journal because of the subject matter, which they considered as a big joke that should be placed in the same category as UFO “science” and ghosts “science”, then KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU DO WITH GREAT TALENT AND PASSION (i.e. Giving a total blank check to every Shroud researcher who is considered a pro authenticity researcher, no matter how poor he is doing his “scientific” research)!!! And if you disagree with me (I’m sure many will do), then I ask you to answer to this simple question: Why do you think Shroud science is considered as a joke by a good portion of the scientific community and by most serious scientific journals if it’s not because of all the “Dan Brown” kind of researchers like Wilson and many others (I’m sure you know who they are as well as me) that are at the forefront of modern Shroud research? To conclude this comment, I would like to say that I truly believe that the great political correctness and the great chauvinism that goes on and on and on inside a certain pro Shroud clique, which lead to a fear of strongly critiquer the researchers who are obviously doing Shroud research with dishonesty is what did the most important damage over the years to the credibility of sindonology, which is seen nowdays as a sick joke by most of the scientific community… And it’s a shame to see that there’s not seem to be any hopes of change coming about this in a near future. That’s why it’s not hard for me to presume that the example of Kelly Kearse’s paper rejection from any credible scientific journal just because of its subject matter is going to happen again and again in the future… Unless the real scientists inside the Shroud world will stand up and dissociate themselves publicly from all the “Dan Browns” of sindonology (who are numerous), I’m sure sindonology will still be classified in the same unscientific category than UF Os and ghosts 20 or 30 years from now. Again, this is a total shame because I know that there are some real professional and honest scientists in the Shroud world (even if I’m truly convinced that they are in minority)! I think my opinion about the pro Shroud clique and the damages it is causing for the Shroud and the credibility of sindonology is clear! In the end, I hope people on this blog will realize that what bugs me the most is not Ian Wilson’s antics and “theories” or some other person like that but the way the pro Shroud world is reacting to this.

And this is one of the worst outcome of the more than very enthusiastic welcome of Wilson’s hypotheses by the pro Shroud world since 1978 up until this day! Because almost every pro Shroud researcher (most of them being non expert in the field of history) bought many ideas of Wilson without taking time to check it out in deep (which contributed to give Wilson a credit he did not deserve and contributed also to sold them even more to the general public), it produce something like a syndrom in the Shroud world where the Mandylion hypothesis became so well accepted that it was considered as a real proven “theory” and, consequently, lead the vast majority of Shroud researchers to stop investigate other potentially interesting paths, like if there was only the “Mandylion” poor trail that was left as a real possibility to explain the dead silence of ancient manuscripts versus a shroud of Christ showing a complete body image with all the bloody stigmata of the Passion… I repeat, this is one, if not the worst tragedy of the whole Mandylion affair..","date":"2013-08-29","mins":"4:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"id":"comment-42161","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “The reasons why Academia and the Scientific Community refuse to take the Shroud seriously has less to do with the work of Ian Wilson than the stiff neckedness of their ivory towered residents. It was thus always so.” My reply: What do you do of the scientific work of Vignon, of Barbet, of the Pellegrino’s commission and, some years later, of the STURP work (along with some others scientists work like Baima Bollone and Riggi)? All these analyses of the Shroud were performed by true experts in their field… I don’t see any “stiff neckedness” scientists in this group (which count a good amount of true experts)! All these analyses were done with profesionalism and were considered valid (or at least credible) by many persons around the world (not just Christians). Because of this, I seriously think that things started to go off track right around the time the STURP team went to Turin, because at the same time, the most obvious and well known “Dan Brown” of sindonology (named Ian Wilson) was publishing is first book (a popular book and not a scientific publication in a serious history journal) about the Shroud, which exposed some of his most infamous crazyness (often called “theories” by pro Shroud folks). To me, historically speaking, this is right then that sindonology really started to lose its credibility among the scientific community and things got even worst since that time, mainly because of the very good reception and diffusion of Wilson’s idea by the pro Shroud clique (which highly contributed to the commercial and popular success of Wilson’s book), which encouraged many other little “Dan Brown” to follow the same path, thus damaging even more the little credibility that was left since the STURP days..","date":"2013-08-27","mins":"6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"id":"comment-41967","author":"yannick_clément","post":"AMEN.

The reality is this: STURP NEVER said something like that, nor that its final report can be understood as possibly meaning anything close to such a supernatural and religious extrapolation. This unscientific notion was push forward mainly by popular book writers like Wilson and a bunch of others, particularly after the publication of the final report of STURP and, to me, this is exactly where things really went off track for the credibility of sindonology. And then, another event highly contributed to broke down even more the credibility of Shroud science and this was probably cause at least partially by the C14 dating result of 88 (published in 89), i.e. The publication, around 1991, of John Jackson’s “body of light” hypothesis to explain the image. Up until that time, the supernatural and religious extrapolation that the failure of STURP to find a natural explanation for the image meant that it was NECESSARILY related directly with the Resurrection of Christ was mainly publicized by popular authors, but now, this new supernatural and religiously based hypothesis proposed by Jackson (which was one of the two leaders of the STURP team) was giving much more credibility to those who were pushing this supernatural and religious issue forward… Since that time, I think it’s fair to say that Shroud science never was able to regain the credibility it had back when STURP, Frei and the Italian team of scientists analyzed the cloth in 1978 and in the following years, despite the fact that some truly professional scientists have accepted to enter the picture. In the end, I really think that the most damaging thing that ever happened to the credibility of Shroud science is the failure of STURP to find a natural cause for the image, which lead many people (including many book writers and even many scientists) to imagine any possible supernatural scenario they could think and sold them to the world… Having said that, I think the only thing that could be done to help sindonology regain some credibility would be to see true professional and honest scientists form a new group of research regarding the Shroud that would clearly disassociate themselves with anything related with any supernatural or religious hypothesis regarding the relic. And I seriously believe that if a group like that form one day, that could be the signal the Vatican is waiting to finally allow a new series of direct research on the cloth….","date":"2013-08-29","mins":"5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"id":"comment-42370","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “But I am saying that if you are a Christian and belive in a literal rather than metaphorical resurrection, then it is at least a possibility that should not be rubbished.” My answer: In my mind, as well as in the mind of millions of Christians (even Mel Gibson see it like this in his movie about the Passion), Jesus corpse just disappeared (dematerialized) suddenly from inside the Shroud. Then, later on, he physically appeared a few times to his disciples, while always disappearing suddenly at the end without any release of energy whatsoever (so it seem). In this context, I don’t see why the dead body of Christ should have released any kind of energy whatsoever at the moment of his disappearance. On the contrary, it seem to me highly probable that his dead body released some post mortem gases (along with maybe some other biological molécules) that could have caused some form of chemical reaction at the surface of the linen cloth with the thin layer of impurities that was probably present there (whether it is a Maillard reaction in the way described by Rogers or some other natural interraction between the body and the impurities).

But the main thing is this and I have said it many times on this blog: On the contrary to what most supernatual fans thinks and try to make believe, science is still very far from having fully tested every possible natural phenomenons that could possibly account for the image and the reason is very simple: to test most of the most interesting hypothesis, you would need a fresh (and even better, a beaten and tortured) corpse!!! In such a context, it is highly unlikely that the most promising hypotheses involving natural phenomenons will be successfully tested in a near future… Anyway, since it is a fact that science has not come full circle yet versus every possible natural phenomenons that can account for the image, it is scientifically absurd to look at supernatural explanations for the image for the moment and I firmly believe that every scientist who push this issue forward (you know who they are!) are doing each time a bit more damage to the credibility of sindonology..","date":"2013-08-29","mins":"7:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"id":"comment-42375","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Matthias, if you read well my paper about the evidence of the bloodstains, you will note that I keep a supernatural process as part of my 4 scenarios list!

And what could explain that only some of it get on the Shroud (including the scourge marks) : Probably because the only dried blood clots that were able to become re moistened again were the last ones that get dried on the skin of the Shroud man. For all the others dried blood clots that we can assume where still present on the skin and on the hair, we must assume that they became completely dried much too soon, so they were dried for too long when the moisture came on the clots and, because they were dried for too long, these clots never were able to leave a noticeable Mirror image on the cloth. 2 NOT AT ALL. A washing of the body would have produce oozing of liquid post mortem blood (see again Zugibe’s pictures 1 and 2 in his paper: http://www.shroud.com/zugibe2.htm; the oozing are clearly no blood clots but oozing of liquid blood material). Barbet was clear about the fact that such a liquid blood would tend to follow the weave pattern of the cloth (which is not what happened on the Shroud) and, for the back region, because of the high pressure due to the body weight, there would surely have been many smudges of blood produced on the cloth (there are none on the Shroud). And by the way, Barbet was clear about the fact that all the pre mortem bloodstains on the Shroud are clear Mirror images of the real blood clots that was present on the skin of the Shroud man when his body was placed Inside the Shroud (as I said in point #1, these stains probably concern only the blood that was last to dry on the skin of the Shroud man) and such bloodstains can only come from exudates of still moistened or, more probably, re moistened blood clots, and not from some oozing of liquid post mortem blood material that would have be produced by the removal of these clots by a washing of the body, as proposed by Zugibe.

But, in the end, the real question regarding the “natural or supernatural” issue is not the probability we can assign to both hypotheses, but the question of whether or not a real professional scientist should start to look for a process that would involve some form of supernatural burst of energy of some kind BEFORE science could have the opportunity to properly and totally discard every possible natural mechanism that could theoretically have produced such an image? Personally, I would answer a big “NO” to this question and I hope most scientists involved in Shroud research these days could answered the same.

Here’s a medical definition I have found: “A skin wound that FAILS TO HEAL, HEALS SLOWLY or heals but tends to recur is known as a chronic wound. Some of the MANY CAUSES of chronic skin wounds CAN INCLUDE TRAUMA, burns, skin cancers or underlying medical conditions such as diabetes. Chronic wounds need special care.” I’m not a medical expert but, in my mind, this kind of biological problem concerning the natural healing of skin wounds (and, in all logic, their clotting process) seem to be truly possible in the case of someone like the Shroud man who was punched in the face and then scourged, crowned with thorns, and finally crucified… Can this kind of biological problem could have been the main cause of an important delay in the clotting process of most of the scourge wounds, which could account for the fact that these wounds have been able to get re moistened enough after the Shroud man’s death, so that they could leave a precise mirror imprint on the cloth later on? I wonder what jesterof think about this possibility… And in the end, I say to myself that if someone as profesional and careful as Doctor Pierre Barbet specifically refers in his book to the possibility that the wounds of the Shroud man could have become infected during his Passion, with the result of delayed their clotting, it is surely because he knew that this kind of problem was truly possible in the traumatic context of the Shroud man… Seriously, I just don’t see Barbet writting something of that nature and importance in his book (which could have been a major factor in the imprint of the scourge wounds later on) without making sure that this kind of problem was totally possible for someone like the Shroud man.

In the context of a probable hasty burial like the one of the Shroud man, this scenario is far from being probable… As I said before (maybe you didn’t read it?), the most logical thing they would have done with the corpse right after the washing would have been to place it in the cloth immediately after or to rub his washed body with some burial substances and then, place it in the cloth. In both cases, there would have been no way for the liquid oozing of blood material to clot well in order to leave a precise Mirror imprint. On the contrary, in both cases, you should expect the resulting bloodstains to have a strong tendency to follow the weave pattern of the cloth and to see some smudges on the cloth, which are two things that are not present at all on the Shroud. Also, if Zugibe was right, there would not be a lot of serum halos around the scourge wounds that are easy to distinguish from the blood under UV light (as it was described by Miller and Pellicori). By the way, nevermind what you can think, the serum halos that have been found around most of the scourge marks (as well as around all the other pre mortem bloodstains) are truly a sign that all these particular stains came from exudates of blood clots that had become in their clotted form for long enough so that the clot retraction phenomenon had time to come up. Barbet, Adler and Lavoie talked about that but you don’t seem to understand at all what they had to say about that. And that’s very telling because this is the most important clue that exist on the Shroud to understand that your own personal hypothesis involving intradermal hematomas (as you call them) is most probably wrong. I’m sorry for you but the halos of serum which are clearly distinct from the bloodstains, never mind the fact that they are all located in the immediate vicinity of these stains, are clearly coming from moistened blood clots (external blood clots located on the skin) that were clotted for enough time so that the blood retraction phenomenon could become active and left some serum stains around the retracting blood clot. That’s not me who said that, that’s Barbet, Lavoie, Adler, Baima Bollone, etc. Sorry but I seriously doubt that your hypothesis or the one proposed by Zugibe (in which by the way he never address the question of the serum halos found around most of the scourge marks) can account for the presence of these serum stains that are clearly distincts and easy to distinguish for the central bloodstains. On the contrary, in your hypothesis or in the one proposed by Zugibe, we should expect this serum to get mixed up with the bloodstains on the cloth, because there would not have been enough time for the clot retraction phenomenon to become active while the blood was on the skin… Make the experiment of placing some drops of liquid blood on a linen cloth with an herringbone pattern and let it dry completely. I ensure you that the resulting bloodstain you would get would NOT show any distinct serum stain around the central bloodstain in the way it was seen by Miller and Pellicori of STURP on their UV photos. In all logic, all you would get on the cloth is a bloodstain, period. And this is proven by the fact that the post mortem blood flows in the lower back region on the Shroud are one of the few bloodstains on the cloth that doesn’t show any distinct serum stains around them (this is a proven fact that come from the STURP investigation and you can find it in Ray Rogers’ paper for STURP). In their case (as it would also be the case for the bloodstains produced with jesterof or Zugibe’s hypothèses), it’s normal to not show any distinct serum stain around them because these post mortem blood flows were probably still in a liquid form or in a very early clotted form (that’s what Barbet was thinking in their case), which would have been very humid and would not have been clotted for enough time to allow the start of the blood retraction phenomenon… Note that would also be like this for the oozing of blood material proposed by jesterof or Zugibe). And that means that the post mortem blood that stained the cloth in the lower back region was a blood that had no time to see his serum get separated from it. That’s why absolutely no serum ring have been seen by Miller and Pellicori in their UV photos for this particular area of the cloth. So, in all logic, if the scourge marks would also have been produced by some liquid oozing of post mortem blood, as proposed by jesterof or Zugibe (in 2 distincts hypotheses), these marks would never have shown any distinct serum halos around them, unlike what was observed by STURP concerning a majority of scourge marks (on the dorsal side of the body image as well as on the frontal side). Sorry jesterof but the very distinct serum halos that are located around most of the scouge wounds and around all the other pre mortem wounds and blood flows on the cloth are the most compelling piece of evidence that your own hypothesis is probably incorrect, as well as the one proposed by Zugibe cause in both cases, we should not expect to see the presence of these distinct serum stains around most of the blood marks. And if you think I’m wrong here (that would mean you also think Barbet, Lavoie and Adler were wrong), then show me a proof that your own hypothesis or the one proposed by Zugibe can produced on a piece of linen cloth like the Shroud, a clear and distinct serum stains (under UV light) that would surround the central bloodstains. Show me some pictures of this please because Zugibe never address this important issue in his paper and thus, never showed the bloodstains he got during his transfer experiments under UV light! I can bet my house that if he did this, absolutely no distinct serum stain would have been present around his resulting bloodstains… Again, if I’m wrong here, please show me some pictures to prove that I’m wrong! Show me some pictures of bloodstains produced on linen with your method of transfer or with Zugibe’s method that would show clear and distinct serum halos around them under UV light.

In order that you understand better the use of catastrophic terms in the Bible (in the Old Testament as well as the New), I made a little research in two biblical dictionary I have at home. I the most recent one that was written by Father Xavier Léon Dufour, a well known Jesuit from France, here’s a portion of what he wrote concerning the use of the word “earthquake” in the bible (personal translation): “The Bible see in earthquakes an eschatological manifestation of the almighty power of the Creator who come to help or to judge his people.” You can see that his definition is pretty close to what I said to you in last few days!!! Of course, that doesn’t mean it is 100% sure that all the references in the Bible to an earthquake are only symbolic, but that mean that this kind of “imagery” is very common throughout the Bible (in the Old as well as in the New Testament) and, because of its very strong symbolical power, it’s pretty evident that all these references about an earthquake (including the ones we can found at the time of Jesus’ death and Resurrection) cannot be taken for granted as being a sure and real historical event that really happened at the time it is describe by these authors… In fact, I think any good and honest biblical scholar will agree that it’s much more probable that the use of such a strong and “biblical” imagery at the precise moment of the death and Resurrection of Jesus has to be seen as a “literary construction” of the Gospel writers who wanted to materially “translate” the great and spiritual intervention of God for all humanity that was happening then. By the way, on the subject of earthquakes, you always seems to think that because earthquakes are more frequent in New Zealand than here in Quebec (that’s a chance for us!!!), that makes you an expert on the subject and, because of this, your opinion that there really had been, historically speaking, a real earthquake in Jerusalem around the time of the death and Resurrection of Christ must be the best that exist! Sorry but this is completely ludicrous. I have no problem admitting that you know more than me about earthquakes my friend, but that doesn’t mean for one second that your idea about a real earthquake in Jerusalem around the year 30 or 33 must be understand as very solid and that it is shared by a vast majority of biblical scholars. In fact, the reality is precisely the opposite concerning the vast majority of those experts who are aware of the fact that the “earthquake imagery” (if I can use this term) is often used by Bible writers (again, in the Old as well as in the New Testament) as a metaphoric way to materially describe a spiritual intervention of God in our universe. I don’t see any good reason to think otherwise when it comes to the earthquakes that supposedly came at the time of Jesus death and Resurrection. In fact, this was most probably a literary tool used by the Gospel writers to make a link with the well known imagery of the Old Testament in order to describe in strong terms that God was truly “at work” for all humanity at the time of Jesus’ death and Resurrection… No matter what you can think, this is by far the most probable explanation that exists for the presence of these supposed earthquakes at that particular time in the Gospels. And concerning the use of the term “darkness” in the Bible, I got a pretty good explanation for it in an old “Universal Biblical dictionary” that was written in 1984 by two biblical scholars from France (one was a Sulpician and the other was a Dominican). Here’s a portion of what they wrote concerning the word “darkness” that we can find throughout the Bible (in the Old Testament as well as in the New): “(In the Bible) the darkness are the IMAGE of men’s ignorance; God send his light to enlighten them (Jb 29,3) and, for the prophets of the Old Testament, the Messiah would come to change them into light (Is 9,1; 29,18; 60,2)… The fourth Gospel considers Jesus and his action throughout the IMAGERY of light and darkness, engaged in a fight… A sizing image of God’s action, the light tells also what we can perceive of God though this action. There is in Him no darkness because He is light. Getting away from Him, by acting differently than he acts, for example by rejecting love (God is love), it is walking in darkness, it is also being associated with the powers of darkness and it is falling into external darkness. The theme of the opposition light/darkness that we find in the fourth Gospel can also be found in the later letters written by Paul.” This definition of the term “darkness”, which shows with great evidence how this imagery was often used in the Bible to express an opposition to God’s action, should be enough for anyone to understand that its use during the Passion and death of Christ (which is called by Jesus “the hour of darkness” when he encounters Judas in the Garden of Gethsemane) is most certainly symbolic ratter than being historical and is very useful to the Gospel writers to express with a strong image how the most of Israël rejected his Son during his Passion. With this in mind, how can we claim that there really was for sure a total darkness (which can be understand as a big storm by some) in Jerusalem in the middle of the day during Jesus’ Passion and death? In other words, knowing that this imagery of darkness was very often used throughout the whole Bible in a symbolical way, how can someone dare to base a hypothesis concerning the Shroud on such a fragile ground (historically speaking)? The probability that the darkness imagery during Jesus’ Passion and death was only symbolic is much too high to do so… Note that this is the same thing for the earthquake imagery concerning Jesus’ death and Resurrection. Now it’s up to you to continue to base some of your hypotheses versus the Shroud on such a fragile historical ground… Personally, I would certainly not do that. In sum, I’m too much aware of the fact that these catastrophic things were very often used in a symbolical way throughout the Bible instead of being truly based on real historical events. It’s important to be aware of the fact that this was very common for people of the Middle East to create and use some strong images to materially described a spiritual reality. Unfortunately, such a reality has been lost and/or forgotten by many modern Christians who tend to take for granted and at the very first level everything that is written in the Bible and, truly, that’s a very big mistake and a shame. Last useful note for all of you: If you want to know what were the most common IMAGES used by the authors of the Bible to describe God or his action for his people, just read the well known part of the First book of Kings in the Old Testament, in which Elijah is standing on the Horeb, while waiting to see God. In this part of the text, all the most common images concerning God are used, i.e. The hurricane, the earthquake and the fire (and along with these images, we can also had the light). All these symbolical images are very often used throughout the Bible (including the New Testament: remember what supposedly happened at the Pentecost after the Resurrection?)… It’s very important to understand this biblical reality (we can even say that it is an ancient Middle Eastern reality) because, if you did, you will never dare to use again such symbolic images to back up a hypothesis versus the Shroud of Turin (note that this include the very improbable idea that Jesus’ dead body really emitted a burst of light at the time of his Resurrection, which would have been the primary cause for the body image on the cloth). When you got a true scientific and rational mind (one always goes with the other!), you understand that the probability of being off track versus the true historical facts is simply too high to take such a risk… That’s my opinion, which is certainly shared by most biblical scholars and good historians..","date":"2013-08-03","mins":"5:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40502","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Hugh, by definition, an oozing refers to a liquid!

In fact, what Barbet meant was that, in his mind, it is truly possible that all the wounds and all the excoriations of the skin (this certainly include the scourge wounds), even though they clotted normally (that include the clot retraction phenomenon that leave a distinct serum stain around the central bloodstain), have keep on oozing a lymph that was more or less infected BEFORE AND EVEN AFTER the Shroud man’s death, which contributed, in his mind, to keep all these clotted wounds more or less humid, at least at their surfaces. So, I admit having misread Barbet about that… On the contrary to what I thought and said on this blog, in Barbet’s mind, the wounds (including the scourge wounds) didn’t really get infected, so that their clotting process was delayed for a long time, but instead, the normal blood clots were maintained more or less humid because of a more or less constant oozing of lymph that kept on even after death, thus making it possible for them to eventually leave a good mirror imprint on the cloth later on. Along with this possible oozing of lymph in the vicinity of the clotted wounds, Barbet estimated that there was most probably a release of water vapor by the corpse (and we can also think of a possible release of post mortem gases such a ammonia), which could also have played a huge role in the mirror imprints of all the wounds (including the scourge wounds) and all the pre mortem blood flows (such as the ones in the head and forearms regions) that we can see on the Shroud. So, I admit having partially misread what Barbet thought concerning a release of lymph from the wounds: it wasn’t the wounds that got infected in his mind, but the lymph that was probably oozing from these clotted wounds… But even then, I was nevertheless correct about the fact that he thought that an oozing of lymph was at least partially responsible for the presence of all those precise imprints of dumbbell shaped scourge wounds on the cloth. And if Barbet’s idea about the oozing of lymph is correct, it should be noted that this phenomenon could have played a very huge role in the fact that a lot of scourge wounds have been able to leave a mirror imprint of themselves on the Shroud, while at the same time, not even one of the ancient blood flows coming from the scourging were not able to do the same, even though it is very probable that many of these clotted blood flows were still stuck on the skin of the Shroud man at the time of his burial. If Barbet is correct on this issue, this absence of presumed blood flows that were caused by the scourging was due to the fact that they would not have been kept humid for a long time by this possible oozing of lymph that came from the scourge wounds. In other words, this kind of small oozing of lymph would have been pretty much restricted to the area of the clots that were formed over these wounds and also possibly to their immediate vicinity (with no effect on the clotted blood flows). I think this kind of more or less constant oozing of lymph from the wounds and excoriations (even after death) can really offer a good, simple and rational explanation for why all the scourge wounds (which all produced, in Barbet, Lavoie, Adler and also in Zugibe’s mind, an external blood clot coming from a superficial cutting or excoriation of the skin) were able to stay moistened enough to leave a good mirror imprint of themselves on the cloth later on, while the ancient blood flows that also came from the same scourging were not able to do so, even though it’s very probable that most of them were still present (but in a completely dried state) on the skin of the Shroud man when his body was laid in the Shroud. The very probable fact that these ancient blood flows had been completely dried for a long time prior to the Shroud man’s death (on the contrary to the scourge wounds, if Barbet’s oozing of lymph hypothesis is correct) can really explain why all these particular blood flows were not able to get re moistened enough to leave a visible imprint of themselves on the cloth… Even if some moisture could have covered them inside the Shroud (coming from a probable release of water vapor and post mortem gases from the corpse), these ancient blood flows would have been simply dry for too long, on the contrary to all the clotted wounds (including the scourge wounds), which were able to stay more or less humid during all the crucifixion and even after the death of the Shroud man. I honestly think that this is the most probable explanation for the presence of all the scourge wounds on the Shroud and the absence of all the assumed blood flows that most probably came from the leather tongues of the flagrum, along with maybe some help coming from a re opening of many scourge wounds when the tunic would have been removed from Jesus body at the foot of the cross and with also some help from the very intense sweating, which was certainly present on the body and hair of the Shroud man, especially just before he died. Also, we cannot exclude that the natural clotting of these wounds could have been delayed by some biological syndrom or disorder that could have been caused by the highly traumatic state of the Shroud man after his scourging. On this subject, even jesterof seem to agree that a delay in the clotting process of all the wounds could have really happened due to the traumatic state of the Shroud man… Personally, I would leave this possibility as a possible secondary cause for the imprint of the scourge wounds and prefer to favored Barbet’s hypothesis concerning a more or less constant oozing of lymph from all the wounds (including the scourge wounds) before and even after death that would have greatly helped all of them to leave a mirror imprint on the Shroud when the body was laid in it later on. One thing’s for sure: there really are many rational possibilities that can explain the presence of these scourge wounds on the cloth, along with the absence of the ancient blood flows coming from the same scourging, but a partial washing of the body is most probably not among them… And if you still want to ask me why the idea of Zugibe is most probably not relevant here, just read my guess posting on top of this page, along with all the post I wrote after that and you will find tons of good reasons to reject such an idea (or at the very least, consider it as being highly improbable in the context of the hasty burial of a crucified criminal like the Shroud man). Among those reasons, the most important remains in my mind the presence of clear and distinct serum stains around most of the scourge marks, which is a very solid clue to think that these marks really came from exudates of moistened blood clots (external blood clots I might add) that had been clotted for a pretty long period of time, so that the clot retraction phenomenon (which cause an expulsion of serum from the clot) could become active (just like Barbet, Adler, Lavoie, Baima Bollone and others specialists thought). And along with this solid argument, you can also consider seriously the fact that, on the Shroud, there is absolutely no smudge or smear of blood and absolutely no pre mortem bloodstain have a tendency to follow the weave pattern of the cloth, which is a very strong indicator that all these bloodstains (including all the scourge marks) came not from an oozing of liquid post mortem blood that would follow a partial washing of the body that would have removed all the dried blood clots, as proposed by Zugibe, but from exudates of moistened blood clots, as proposed by Barbet, Lavoie, Adler, etc., which exclude any idea of washing of the body. On this point, you must absolutely note that this absence of smudges and smears of blood and this absence of bloodstains that tend to follow the weave pattern of the cloth are even real on the back region of the Shroud, where there was for sure a very intense pressure present on the cloth due to the weight of the body. This simple fact has to be seen as a very solid piece of evidence against the hypothesis of an oozing of liquid post mortem blood that would have caused all the scourge wounds after a partial washing of the body, as proposed by Zugibe. Also, there is also the very strong argument I gave you in my guess posting concerning the presence of precise scourge marks in the immediate vicinity (as close as 1.3 cm!) of a post mortem blood flow in the lower back region, which could not be disturb at all by any washing. The idea that this particular area (which would not have been so easy to reach) could have been washed in such a surgical manner is quite simply ludicrous in the context of the hasty burial of a crucified criminal like the Shroud man. Also, the fact that the forearms and head regions have been able to produce a good body image on the cloth, while they have clearly not been washed at all prior to the enshrouding of the body is another circumstantial evidence that support the idea that even if there were still many dried blood flows that would have been present on the skin of the Shroud man in the regions affected by the scourging because the body would have remained unwashed, this would not have been a factor that could have prevent the formation of a body image in these areas. Also, we must consider the historical research done by Lavoie et al. In the 1980s, in which they found out that washing the dead body was a normal part (along with anointing and dressing the body, among other things) of the whole Jewish burial procedure, at the exception of one case: when the dead body in question suffered a violent death that would have caused some bleeding at the time of death. In such a particular case, Lavoie et al. Informs us that no washing would have been done in order to respect the Jewish Law (and I might add that such a rule was most probably even more respected when the dead body in question was the one of someone who died on the cross as a legally condemned criminal). Also, another pretty strong argument against Zugibe’s hypothesis of a partial washing of the body comes from the finding of evident traces of dirt in the knee area on the Shroud, which is a place where there are some scourge marks. Finally, here’s another possible evidence against the washing hypothesis that would have produced an oozing of liquid post mortem blood, as proposed by Zugibe: the possible absence of potassium in the scourge marks (I say “possible” because I’m still unsure if Adler really found no potassium in the particular case of the scourge marks or if this absence was only detected for other bloodstains). Anyway, if there really is no potassium whatsoever in these bloody marks, it would be another important clue to think that these marks were really made of exudates of moistened blood clots (that shouldn’t contain potassium if we believe Adler) that would have still been present on the skin of the Shroud man because his body would not have been washed prior to his deposit in the Shroud, instead of being made of liquid post mortem blood (a kind of blood that should contain potassium) that would have oozed from the re opened wounds (filling them of post mortem blood in liquid form) after that a washing of the body would have removed the dried clots over these closed and dried wounds (as proposed by Zugibe). Question to conclude: Isn’t that enough pieces of evidence for you (jesterof and anyone else) to open your mind enough on this subject that you could start to consider other possible avenues than an improbable partial washing of the body, followed by an oozing of liquid post mortem blood, as proposed by Zugibe? I just hope all my reflection on this subject (with all the strong arguments I bring you; suggestion: try to consider them as a whole) could at least open your mind a bit on the possibility (not a certainty) that Barbet was right after all with his hypothesis that all the scourge marks on the cloth (as well as all the other pre mortem bloodstains) would have been produced by exudates of moistened blood clots, without the help of a partial washing of the body. I hope some of you will start to get more critical against Zugibe’s hypothesis, as well as becoming critical also against jesterof’ own hypothesis, which seem to be unable to rationally explain the presence of very distinct serum halos around most of the scourge marks on the cloth, on the contrary to Barbet’s hypothesis… Final and important note: The only way I can change my mind on this whole issue would be for jesterof (or anyone else) to show me (not tell me, but show me with the help of some pictures) a clear proof that the kind of blood transfer he proposed and/or the kind of blood transfer proposed by Zugibe can contradict all the strong arguments I gave you in this long post, especially the presence on the Shroud of distinct halos of serum around most of the pre mortem bloodstains (including most of the scourge wounds) that are clearly visible and very easy to distinguish from the blood under UV light. Note also that, for Barbet, Adler, Lavoie, Baima Bollone and other specialists, these serum stains that are located right outside the central bloodstains are a clear sign that a blood retraction phenomenon had time to operate on external blood clots that were in a drying mode… And it’s also important to note that Zugibe, in his paper, never say a word about this important question of the presence of serum halos around most of the pre mortem bloodstains, which has to be seen as a great mistake on his part. In all logic, the only way he could have produced a bloodstain surrounded by a very distinct serum stains on its edges would have been to let his oozing of liquid post mortem blood alone for a while, so that the clotting process could enter in the clot retraction phase, which takes a pretty long time that is not at all rational in the context of the hasty burial of Jesus on Good Friday. Finally, I would like to hear jesterof or others on the question of the possible lack of potassium in the scourge marks. If such a lack of potassium could be be scientifically confirmed for these scourge marks, I really wonder how his own hypothesis of blood transfer or the one proposed by Zugibe could account for it… Note that Adler had a pretty reasonable answer for this lack of potassium, which was related to the probable fact that all the pre mortem bloodstains (including the scourge wounds) were formed on the cloth not by complete blood (as it would have been the case if Zugibe was right; it’s probably also true for jesterof’s hypothesis), but by exudates of moistened blood clots, as described by Barbet in his book..","date":"2013-08-04","mins":"6:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40520","author":"yannick_clément","post":"In ancient times Max, particularly in the Middle East, using metaphors and/or symbols in order to described a SPIRITUAL REALITY was not considered at all as a « lie » or as a « literary forgery » like you seem to suggest.

This image of darkness at the time Jesus was on the cross is nothing else than a symbolical manner for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers and that God was about to begin a brand new creation (or a re creation if you prefer), just as we see in Genesis when it is said: “Now the earth was formless and empty, DARKNESS was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.” This image of darkness (as well as the reference to an earthquake) is most probably only symbolic and not really historical (this is not a certainty, but this is highly probable, in the light of the ancient Middle Eastern way to speak and write, especially for the Jews).

Brown, in which he gives his opinion about the darkness that supposedly came when Jesus was on the cross (personal translation of the French edition of this book): “When we read the surprising description of the darkness that covered all the Earth from noon to 3 o’clock (from the sixth to the ninth hour), many possible interpretations come in mind. This can be a factual report, implying possibly a natural phenomenon (eclipse, thunderstorm, etc.) or a miracle without any previous; or this can be a purely metaphoric description related to the eschatological language of the Old Testament or the Hellenistic imagery associated with the death of famous man or even both.” After this introduction, Brown wrote this: “We have no way to know if, for the Gospel writers, Mark and Matthew, a physical darkness was present at noon at Golgotha. Anyway, this is very probable because they give a schedule like they do for events they report as real. But we know that both writers have a symbolical and theological orientation.” After this, Brown gives a lot of possible parallels that can be made between these darkness and various texts of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Jeremiah, Sophonias, Joel, Second book of Enoch, etc.), which can well have had a huge influence on the reference to the darkness in the Gospel accounts of the Passion of Christ. In a footnote, Brown also wrote this: “While resuming the history of the interpretation of these darkness, Grandez bring attention on the influence of the Pseudo Areopagite (around 500 A.D.), who underline the analogy with the great miraculous interventions of God in the Old Testament, particularly in Exodus.” And concerning the reference to an earthquake that we found in Matthiew, Brown reports again many examples of possible parallels that can be made with various texts of the Old Testament and say that the reference to an earthquake (sometimes associated with the darkness!) in the Old Testament is often a sign of God’s judgement or of the last times. I think this is a pretty good summary of Brown’s book concerning these “catastrophic” events described in the Gospels and I think you don’t have to be a genius to understand that these kinds of references can well be symbolic instead of being really historic. Of course, as Brown said, it is impossible to be sure about that. But nevertheless, the fact that the imagery of the earthquake and the darkness is often found in the Old Testament to describe an intervention of God in this world should be enough to put serious doubts over the possibility that these events really happened at the time of Jesus’ death. One thing’s for sure: Personally, I would NEVER base a hypothesis concerning the Shroud (whether it be the image formation or the blood transfer) on things like that because the possibility is way too high that these references can only be symbolic. Along with these quotes from Brown’s book, I encourage anyone to also read another comment I wrote yesterday about the same topic. Here’s the link: https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest posting challenging frederick zugibe on washing of the body/#comment 40379 Now it’s up to you to take all these things for granted as true historical facts… Note that Brown himself don’t take position. He presents the facts, give some possible explanations and let his readers decide if they think these things really happened or not. But in the end, it should be noted that the simple fact that he presents a lot of parallels with the Old Testament should be enough for anyone to become at least a bit suspicious about the possibility that these events can really be historic. Of course, some of you (like Max for sure) will bring back this quote from Brown : “Anyway, this is very probable because they give a schedule like they do for events they report as real.” But this is far from being a sure proof of anything… In fact, Brown himself knew that as he immediately said : “But we know that both writers have a symbolical and theological orientation.” So, again, there’s absolutely no way to be certain if these events really happened on Golgotha or if they were just literary creations used for a symbolical and/or theological purpose. And because of that, the prudence here would be to keep things like that off of any hypothesis concerning the Shroud. The risk of error is simply too high. To conclude, I would ask you two good questions: Do you seriously believe that Jesus was the only Jewish (or even Middle Eastern) man of his time who have used symbolic images to described spiritual realities (like he did with all his parables)? Don’t you think the Gospel writers could also have been tempted to introduce very strong events like an earthquake and/or darkness that were very telling for their readers in order to symbolically describe a divine intervention and/or the power of darkness forces at the time of the Passion, death and Resurrection of Christ? I hope you will at least leave the door open for this possibility….","date":"2013-08-06","mins":"8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40572","author":"yannick_clément","post":"And if I really said “this is NOTHING ELSE THAN a symbolical manner for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers…”, then it has to be read like this instead : “In the probable case where the Gospel writers have used the darkness in a purely metaphoric sense, this is NOTHING ELSE THAN a symbolical manner for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers.”.","date":"2013-08-06","mins":"10:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40571","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I’ll just repeat what I said at the end of my last comment Max: Of course, some of you (like Max for sure) will bring back this quote from Brown : “Anyway, this is very probable because they give a schedule like they do for events they report as real.” But this is far from being a sure proof of anything… In fact, Brown himself knew that as he immediately said : “But we know that both writers have a symbolical and theological orientation.” So, again, there’s absolutely no way to be certain if these events really happened on Golgotha or if they were just literary creations used for a symbolical and/or theological purpose.

I post it earlier directly to Dan Porter via his email address and, finally, I thought that it could be a good thing also to post it here: I know the value of my hypothesis, I know the strength of my arguments against Zugibe, and unlike what jesterof can think, I know that Zugibe’s hypothesis cannot fit with Barbet’s own hypothesis for the good and simple reason that, in Zugibe’s scenario, the outcome of a washing of the body would be a removal of the dried blood clots over the scourge wounds, which would produce an oozing of post mortem blood in a LIQUID FORM (you just have to read carefully Zugibe’s paper on the subject and to watch closely the pictures of an experiment he did, especially the one called “figure 2”, to understand this) and that’s completely different than the kind of transfer described by Barbet from exudates of re moistened blood clots. In Zugibe’s mind, after the supposed washing, there would have been no more blood clots over the wounds and this would have caused an oozing of post mortem blood in liquid form. It’s only in the case they would not have placed the body Inside the Shroud right or soon after the washing that the oozing of post mortem blood would have started to produce a blood clot again that could eventually have stained the cloth in the way described by Barbet in his book, but seriously, such an idea is not rational at all, especially in the context of an hasty burial… Just think about it: What would have been the most rational thing to do after the washing? To place the body Inside the Shroud of course! Or to rub the body with some burial products and then, placed it Inside the Shroud. And in both scenarios, it is liquid blood that would have stained the cloth in all the places where there were scourge wounds because, in both cases, there is no way the oozing of liquid post mortem blood could have had the opportunity to produce a blood clot that would have been “solid” enough to cause a very good mirror imprint on the fabric… Nevertheless, Zugibe thinks such a liquid transfer from an oozing of post mortem blood (see “figure 1” in his paper to see the result of a transfer experiment he did and see “figure 2” to be convinced the oozing in question would be in LIQUID FORM) can produce a pretty good and precise imprint of the wound. I agree with him that if the oozing of liquid post mortem blood is not too huge and if it stays in the vicinity of the wound and if the piece of fabric is not pressed hard at all on it (very gently in fact), then yes, you can obtain a pretty good imprint of the wound in question. But nevertheless, as Barbet said very clearly in his book, for any blood transfer that happen in a liquid form on a piece of fabric, inevitably, you will see some preferential directions in the blood stain that will tend to follow the weaving of the fabric that has been stained. And if you check closely “figure 1” in Zugibe’s paper, it’s pretty easy to notice just that: there are some little lines of blood that are going away from the central stain because they the oozing of blood from the wound had a tendency to follow the pattern of the paper towel used by Zugibe for his experiment… As Barbet said: this is what always happen when a blood transfer on a fabric is done with a blood in a liquid form. Zugibe’s experiment proved that Barbet was right about that and sorry but it is not what we see on the Shroud concerning the scourge marks, which have no tendency at all to follow the direction of the weave herringbone pattern. This is a clear indication that these stains were produced by exudates of humid blood clots and not from a transfer that would have been made with liquid blood (like it was the case in Zugibe’s experiment). And even if I agree with Zugibe that, in the context of a very gentle contact between the oozing of blood and the fabric, you can obtain a pretty good imprint, I ask you the question: what would have been the result if his experiment would have been done to simulate the high body weight pressure that would have been present on the back side of the corpse when it was laid into the Shroud??? The answer is easy to determine: SMUDGES ALL OVER THE PLACE ! And there is absolutely none on the Shroud, not even on the back region! This is a sure proof that the scourge wounds came from exudates of humid blood clots as described by Barbet, Adler, Lavoie and others and not from a transfer from an oozing of liquid post mortem blood as described by Zugibe. Again, you must remember that the body should have stayed untouched for several minutes if you want to believe that the oozing of liquid post mortem blood had enough time to produce a humid clot prior to the deposit of the corpse inside the Shroud and such a scenario seem pretty ridiculous in the case of an hasty AND INCOMPLETE burial, while those who were there knew full well they had to come back anyway on Sunday morning to complete the burial rite correctly. All this just don’t sound right to me. It much easier for me to believe the scourge wounds get infected while the Shroud man was still alive on the cross, thus producing some oozing of lymph with maybe other bloody material, which would have kept these wounds (and probably others like some puncture wounds in the scalp) humid enough for a long time, and this would have cause a great delay in the clotting process, with the result that when the body was laid Inside the Shroud, these particular blood clots were 1 still humid enough to stain the cloth at the very moment the body was laid Inside it or 2 dried after death but they became re moistened before or, more probably, after the body had been laid Inside the Shroud. Such a scenario, on the contrary to the one proposed by Zugibe, would have no problem at all to explain the presence of precise scourge marks located less than 2cm away from a post mortem blood flow, which could not have been washed. On this subject, it’s fun to note that Hugh, who desperately wants to defend at all cost Zugibe’s hypothesis, don’t seem to have any problem believing such an irrational scenario, while, in the very same comment, he dare to state this truth: “…that in fact it (the body) was washed, but not very thoroughly.” Sorry Hugh but if the washing was not done very thoroughly (note: this is by far the most rational scenario in the case of the Shroud man), how in the world such a rapid washing was able to completely remove the blood clot of some scourge marks located at less than 2 cm from a post mortem blood flow in order to produce an oozing of post mortem blood in a liquid form (such an oozing was necessary to produce the scouge marks on the cloth if we believe Zugibe), while at the same time not touching at all the nearby post mortem blood flow! Imagine the precision that would have been necessary to accomplish such a feat very rapidly!!!

But nevertheless, I don’t understand why you come up in favor of Zugibe! Answer these four questions for me please (jesterof, you can too) : 1 If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain the absence of any smudge on the Shroud, especially in the back region where there was obviously an intense body weight pressure that was active on the cloth? 2 If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain that there appeared to be no scourge stain that tend to follow the herringbone weave pattern of the cloth? 3 If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain the presence of distinct halos of serum around much of the scourge marks? 4 If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain the presence of some precise scourge marks at less than 2 cm of an evident post mortem blood flow, while you know that it was against Jewish law to remove or disturb such a post mortem blood and while you also know that if there was a washing, it would have been done rapidly (you even mention in a previous post that the washing was most probably “not done very thoroughly”)? To answer these questions correctly, it’s truly important to note that, if Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, the oozing of post mortem blood would certainly have been in a liquid form, unless, as I said in my previous post, that they would have left the body alone and untouched for several minutes after the washing, which is very improbable in the context of an hasty burial (Hugh, you agree with me on this). And if you want to be convinced that the removal of a dried blood clot over a wound will produce an oozing of post mortem blood in a liquid form, please check again “figure 2” in Zugibe’s paper… Even a close look at “figure 1” is enough to see that this kind of post mortem oozing is in liquid form because this picture surely don’t present a solid blood clot!!! It’s also truly important to note that Zugibe developed his hypothesis on a probable false premise, which is that if there was a lot of dried blood flows on the body of the Shroud man when he was placed in the Shroud, there would not have been any body image formed on the cloth because it is a fact that the bloodstains on the cloth were able to prevent the formation of a body image on the cloth. I already addressed that point in a previous post (https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen jones newest addition to his shroud of turin series/#comment 39120) and I said that if the body image was caused (at least partially) by the natural released of post mortem gases and molecules that were left on the skin, the hair and the dried blood clots after the drying of the sweat, there would be no reason at all to think that the presence of such dried blood flows on the skin of the Shroud man would have been enough to prevent the formation of a body image in these areas, since the « active agent » (i.e. The biological products left on top of these dried clots by the drying sweat) would have been present OVER these blood clots and not UNDER them, with the result of being able to react directly with the surface of the cloth without the dried clots being able to act as a shield between these biological products and the cloth. In such a truly possible context (sorry for those who are members of the supernatural fringe), there is no way to categorically state something like Zugibe said, i.e. That the presence of dried blood flows on the skin of the Shroud man would have surely prevent the formation of a body image.

If you look at the back region on the Shroud, you will noticed that there are many precise scourge marks that never tend to follow the weave pattern of the cloth, along with absolutely no smudges of blood… Nevertheless, Zugibe never tried to reproduced the conditions in which these scourge marks would have been formed on the cloth (i.e. While a high pressure would have been present on the cloth because of the body weight).

It is a post mortem blood in LIQUID FORM and that’s what Zugibe thinks was responsible for the scourge marks on the cloth. See is picture 1 and you will clearly see that it is not at all a solid blood clot from an oozing of liquid blood but that it is truly an oozing of liquid post mortem blood. It is from this oozing that Zugibe tried to reproduce the scourge marks on the Shroud by very gently touching this liquid blood with a paper towel. As I said, that produce a pretty good imprint in this context but what would have been the result if he would have reproduced the high pressure in the back region due to the body weight? Of course, there would have been evident smudges with no precise serum halo around the stain and the main stain would have had a clear tendency to follow the pattern of his paper towel. Look, even with the gently touch he used for his experiment, you can see some tiny parts of the stain that tend to follow the pattern of the paper towel! And that’s exactly what Barbet said in his book versus a blood transfer that would imply liquid blood… You said: “The more or less exact markings of the scourge wounds on the back actually are the proof that the body was washed, otherwise the edges would be smeared.” Read my hypothesis again (based on Barbet’s ideas) and you will see that the blood transfer I proposed, that would come from exudates of re moistened blood clots, would not produce any smudges on the cloth, but on the contrary, would produce a very precise Mirror imprint just like we see on the Shroud. And I know this by experience! Remember the experience I’ve done with a dried blood clot that had formed on my arms about 5 hours before? I just had to put some saliva over it and it was enough to produce a very precise Mirror imprint of the wound on a paper without any smear or smudge! This is a good proof that the kind of blood transfer proposed by Barbet (which is totally different than the one proposed by Zugibe, unless they would have leave the body alone for several minutes after the washing) is able to explain the precise scourge wounds on the Shroud. I think your opinion on the subject is somewhat biased by the idea that the metal balls or the bones at the end of the flagrum would not have produced any superfical cuts on the skin, which I think it’s false, just by looking at the scourge marks. If there would have not been any superficial cutting of the skin there, there would not have been any blood clots over the contusions wounds and consequently, there would not have been any blood markings on the cloth. I think it’s fair to conclude that some superficial cuttings in the form of a dumbbell must have been produced by the flagrum, which would have caused some bleeding and eventually many blood clots over these wounds later on… If we don’t agree on this, it’s evident that we would never be able to agree on the kind of blood transfer that occurred on the cloth..","date":"2013-07-30","mins":"8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40119","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Last note to jesterof: I hope you can agree with me that the idea that the body would have been left alone without anyone touching it for several minutes after a potential washing is far from being probable in the context of the hasty burial of Jesus… That’s important because, if Zugibe was right, this is the only way the after washing oozing of post mortem blood he proposed could have produced a precise mirror imprint on the cloth. Effectively, it’s only if the body would have been left alone for a quite long time (left completely alone… not rub with burial products or any other action that would have produced some touching of the body) that the liquid oozing of blood could have clot enough to become enough “solid” to produce the kind of mirror imprints we see for the scourge marks.

Ok, but here’s the truth: the body WAS moved! It had to! Seriously, do you think they placed the body inside the Shroud right on the little stone bench that was carved in the rock of the tomb? Of course not! First, they must have placed the body inside the Shroud in a central place in the tomb where there was enough space to do that (especially the covering of the frontal part of body) and then, they must have moved the enshrouded body to his final resting place, which was most probably, as I said, a stone bench carved inside one of the wall of the tomb. That’s you first bad understanding of the burial context. Just with this moving of the enshrouded body, if the scourge marks would have been caused by an oozing of bloody material in liquid form instead of exudates of moistened blood clots, it’s evident that some smears and smudges would have been produced on the cloth. There is absolutely none on the Shroud! Using Occam’s razor, the most probable way for this to happen is still the kind of transfer described by Barbet, Adler, Lavoie, etc., which is a transfer coming from still moistened or, more probably, from re moistened blood clots. Also, in your comment, you completely disregard how Zugibe did his transfer experiment, i.e. With only a gentle touch of the oozing of bloody material in liquid form (look again at figure 1 in his paper and you’ll clearly see that the bloody oozing was not solid and was not looking like a blood clot, but instead, was looking like an small oozing of liquid post mortem blood). As I said, of course, with that kind of gentle touch that exclude high pressure, you can obtain a pretty good imprint on a piece of fabric! BUT… That’s not at all the situation that would have been present on the back region when they would have placed the body that would have been recently washed on one part of the Shroud! NOT AT ALL! Zugibe completely failed to reproduce this very particular condition and that’s one of the biggest mistake he made. You just can’t pretend having obtain a very good result that look like the scourge wounds on the Shroud if your transfer experiment doesn’t account for the high pressure that was present on all the back region, due to the body weight! Sorry but only exudates from moistened blood clots can produce a precise mirror imprint with no smears or smudges in such a context. This fact, alone, should be enough for you to rethink your conclusion and start thinking that Barbet et al. Were maybe right after all… 2 Barbet never pretend that the bloodstains made from pre mortem blood clots were obtained with some liquid blood but with an exudates of re moistened blood clots, probably due to the damp atmosphere inside the tomb and inside the Shroud, as well as a very probable released of water vapor by the dead body. This is the only way, in my mind, you can obtain such precise mirror imprints, especially in areas like the buttocks and the back region, where there was a high pressure due to the body weight. Concerning the Lavoie experiment, the simple fact that some moisture was needed on the clots in order to produce a good imprint is a good confirmation of the validity and the strength of Barbet’s hypothesis (which is pretty much the same as mine). Again, if Zugibe was correct about the oozing of liquid post mortem blood, it’s evident that there would have been a tendency for the scourge marks to follow the weave pattern of the cloth, while we don’t see that on the Shroud. And again, let me ask you to check another look at the result of Zugibe with a paper towel… Don’t you see some clear lines going off the central stain because the blood material had some tendency to follow the pattern of the paper towel, even though he touched it very gently? I see it easily and you must see it also… The stain look a bit like a little star with those small lines of blood going away from the central stain. We don’t see that on the Shroud concerning the scourge wounds (and also concerning any other bloodstains coming from pre mortem blood, like the blood flows in the hair or on the forearms).

Look… It’s evident that, in the case of tiny blood clots such as the dumbbell shape scourge wounds, you have evidently more chance that not a lot of the serum was able to transfer and stain the cloth around the stains of blood exudates. So, if it’s true (I don’t know for sure about that but I assume you’re right) that, around many scourge marks, you cannot see a perfectly rounded serum halo, that surely not mean that these stains do not come from exudates of still moistened or re moistened blood clots.

This is so evident that thinking otherwise is ludicrous, except if you think that the washed body was left alone for several minutes after the washing in order for the oozing of liquid blood to clot enough, so it could avoid to produce evident smudges when a big pressure would be applied on them… That’s the only rational scenario to avoid big smudges with Zugibe’s transfer mode but, in the context of the Shroud, IF WE USE OCCAM’S RAZOR CORRECTLY, it’s evident that such a scenario is very improbable.

But that’s where Occam’s razor takes all his value! Just by trying to put yourself in this Jew’s shoes (or sandals if you prefer) and you will surely come up with the conclusion that it was a very dangerous and quite unnecessary move to make, especially when you try to beat the clock before the coming of the Sabbath and you do this while you were totally unprepared to do so, because prior to the night before (less than 24 hours), nobody (except Jesus himself and maybe Judas) knew that Jesus would end up on a cross! Seriously and honestly, in such an hasty and unprepared burial context, it’s truly improbable that this anonymous person would have dare to make such a precise washing… This just doesn’t fit right with the context! And I’m not even talking about the true possibility that such a partial washing was not even allowed by the Jewish Law when it come to the dead body of a crucified criminal or the other true possibility reported by Lavoie in a paper he wrote years ago (in 1982 exactly) about the fact (he did a pretty good historical research in order to write down this conclusion) that “if a man dies a violent death and blood his shed, the blood is not washed from the body.” Seriously, the presence of some precise scourge marks in the immediate vicinity of one evident post mortem blood flow should be enough to understand that the body of the Shroud man, if he was Jesus of course, was most probably not washed at all… It’s true that it is possible to make such a precise washing, but it is simply not rational in the particular context of Jesus’ burial, especially when you consider that he had been condemned to the cross as a public criminal. Note that this is precisely the kind of problem that can be better resolved with the use of Occam’s razor and in this case, Occam say that a surgical type of washing could have been performed in the vicinity of the post mortem blood flows in the lower back region is far from being the most rational and probable scenario in the context of Jesus’ burial… Finally, here’s another problematic fact for Zugibe’s hypothesis that we must consider: The surgical washing that would have been needed to remove the dried blood clots over the 2 scourge wounds that are located at 1.7 and 1.3 cm from an evident post mortem blood flow would have been performed in the lower back region of a man of 5’10” and 175 pounds (more or less), which is an area that would not have been easy to reach! This fact is often forgotten when people discuss the probability level of such a precise washing in this particular place! Obviously, when we consider this additional problem, it’s easy to conclude that such a surgical washing in this zone is very far from being probable..","date":"2013-07-31","mins":"8:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40155","author":"yannick_clément","post":"“They started oozing to the cloth only when the pressure was applied – in the tomb, after the body was already buried. Scourge marks are the blunt wounds, which means that they have mostly bruising , or hematomas inside the skin – the scratches and rips are there, too, but it is sub epidermal, sub dermal or intradermal hematomas which resemble the shape of the flagrum, not the rips or cuts. The rips and cuts are the outflow route for the hematomas to sip out when pressure is applied while laying the body. The more or less uniform shapes of the scourge marks are the exact proof of this, not the other mechanism. Plus this can happen only if the body is washed, otherwise there would not be any similar shapes but one bloody/dirty cloth.” My answer: What you described is not at all related to the hypothesis developed by Zugibe. Let’s consider this as a third one ok? Here’s the sure proof of this: Zugibe state this in his paper: “However, if the body was washed, the DRIED BLOOD around the wounds would be removed causing an oozing of bloody material within the wounds resulting in the production of relatively good impressions of the wound.” That’s the heart of Zugibe’s hypothesis. This IS NOT at all the same scenario as the one you described because Zugibe is clear about the fact that he believed there was already DRIED BLOOD (blood clots in sum) on the skin of the Shroud man when his body was carried to the tomb. Barbet, Lavoie and Adler thought the same but had a completely different hypothesis for this transfer of blood material from the skin to the cloth… And it was also different than your own scenario that seem to involved a sort of superficial bleeding UNDER the skin without any cuts made by the metal balls or the skin bones at the end of the leather tongues of the flagrum.

When you’re aware of this, it is not difficult to assume that Matthew add such a thing in his Passion account as a pictorial way to state that the death of Jesus was another kind of manifestation of God… Seriously, I doubt that the storm was truly an historical fact, mainly because of the literrary context of the Gospel account in which we found this mention. Now, concerning my idea of an intense sweating being able to “wash” the zones where the dumbbel shape wounds were located, I have to say that by doing that, I was playing the game of jesterof (very willingly I must admit, because I think his hypothesis for blood transfer is interesting). But here’s the fact: Barbet in his book reports that, in the concentration camp of Dashau during WWII, the Nazi tortured and killed some prisonners by strapping their hands with cords and by lifting them off the ground. He said that near the moment of death by suffocation (which is the most probable cause of death for the Shroud man), a very intense sweating occurred which was so intense that it was very much like a shower and was able to cause a small puddle of water on the ground! Look, even myself, I almost experimented this when I had some form of a shock after having receive a vaccination when I was Young. I remember that I almost get unconscious and while I was seeing dark, a very intense sweating occurred that wet my cloths in an incredible manner. So, I have no problem to believe Barbet on this point… So, along with the true possibility that the body was much less dirty after the crucifixion than many persons think, I believe this kind of “shower of sweat” that could well have occurred at the time of death could have been enough to “wash” the regions where the scourge marks are located, thus contributing to help these wounds to stained the Shroud later on (and I believe this even in the case jesterof’s hypothesis would be correct instead of mine). In sum: I don’t think a partial washing was essential for the transfer of the scourge wounds, no matter if the best hypothesis is the one proposed by jesterof or mine..","date":"2013-07-31","mins":"11:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40188","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here, I would like to give my thoughts concerning the 2 major arguments that are constantly brought in to support Zugibe’s hypothesis of a partial washing of the body: Argument #1: Logically, we must assume that there was much more clotted blood on the skin of the Shroud man when he died than what is seen on the Shroud (especially in the regions where there were some scourge hits that should have cause some important blood flows coming from the leather tongues) and because we know for a fact that the blood that is on the cloth was able to prevent the formation of a body image on its surface, we have to conclude that if the Shroud man’s body would not have been washed, in a lot of places, no body image would have been imprinted on the cloth because of all the assumed dried blood clots on the skin. My answer: I already wrote about that, saying that the idea that clotted blood on the skin could act like a shield during the image formation process, just like the bloodstains on the cloth did, is a shaky premise that is far from being proven, for the simple and good reason that we still don’t know what was the exact image formation mechanism. As I said, if this mechanism involved (even just partially) the released of post mortem gases (like ammonia) and/or reactive molecules (like lactic acid) that would have come from the presence of some reactive biological substances that would have been left over the skin, the hair and the drying of the intense sweat of the crucified man, then we must conclude that such a mechanism would NOT have been disturbed by the presence of a lot of dried blood clots on the skin. In such a scenario, the release of post mortem gases and/or reactive molecules would not have encountered any obstacle (except where there would have been already some bloodstains on the cloth) between the surface of the skin, hair or dried blood clots and the surface of the cloth. The outcome of this would have been the formation of a body image even in the places where there would have been some dried blood clots. Logically, in such an image formation process, there would have been no noticeable difference between the coloration of the linen fibers in areas where the skin was free from any blood clots and in areas where there would have been some, since the reactive substances would have been exactly the same. That would explain that we see the entire body of the Shroud man on the cloth, despite the probable fact that there was much more blood (clotted and dry) on his skin than what appears on the Shroud. Also, we must consider this other true possibility: In the kind of image formation process I just described (completely natural by the way), it is truly possible that a portion (hard to quantify) of the assumed post mortem gases and/or reactive molecules could have come directly from these clots of dry blood that would have been present on the skin of the Shroud man and that would have stayed that way (dry) all along, thus preventing any noticeable bloody imprints on the cloth in these areas, but contributing (a lot?) to the formation of a body image in all these places where they were still stuck to the skin (or the hair). Last note on the subject: If it would be true that any clotted blood present on the body would have acted like a shield during the image formation process, thus preventing the formation of a body image in these areas, then you must explain to me why most of the hair of the Shroud man was able to “produce” an image on the cloth, while it is pretty evident that there was much more blood (dry) that was present there than what appeared on the Shroud and while it is also pretty evident that the hair WAS NOT WASHED since all the bloodstains in the area of the head (both on the frontal and on the dorsal side of the cloth) are showing all the characteristics of blood that was shed while the Shroud man was still in a vertical position of crucifixion!!! The simple fact that the image of the hair was able to be imprinted on the Shroud while it’s evident that no washing of the hair occurred prior the deposit of the body inside the Shroud should be enough for you to understand that the argument #1 is most certainly wrong. Note that the same exact reflection is also true for the region of the forearms where we can also see pre mortem blood flows, even though it’s evident that no washing was performed there, because of the direction of these blood flows that are all consistent with a vertical position of crucifixion… But despite these very strong arguments that are going against the argument #1, it is mainly on this particular premise that Zugibe based his whole partial washing hypothesis!!! I hope now you will understand better why this argument and the whole partial washing hypothesis doesn’t satisfy me at all… Argument #2: There was surely a lot of dirt covering a good portion of the body of the Shroud man when he get to the tomb and this would have prevent any precise blood transfer on the cloth if no washing of the body would have been done. My answer: Again, to contradict this argument, we can firstly reflect upon the blood transfer that occurred in the regions of the head and the forearms! Since it’s evident that no washing was performed there (for the reason I gave you in the previous point), we must then assume that there were most probably not a lot of dirt stains in these whole areas when the body was laid in the Shroud. Or else, it’s evident that a lot of dirt would have prevents a major part (if not all) of the blood transfer that occurred there. So, if we can conclude with some insurance that the head and the forearms were probably mostly free from dirt stains, why would we have to think otherwise for the rest of the body? I truly think that the assumption that the body would have been covered with dirt stains all over it when the corpse would have reached the tomb is a very special assumption that can be logically contradict (or at least challenged) by these historical and archaeological facts related to the Passion of Jesus: 1 Jesus was probably scourged and beaten in the Roman Antonia fortress or in the palace of Pilate, and it’s fair to assume that this was not done in a dirty and sandy place but on a stone paving. Then, Jesus had to carried his cross all the way to the place of crucifixion and probably felt to the ground a few times. That’s when many people assume that his body could have become very dirty… But these people forget one important historical fact: Jesus’ body was covered during this walk to Golgotha by a long tunic! Because of this, it is not so sure that his body could have become very dirty during this walk, even if we consider as very probable that he could have fall to the ground a few times. And even if we still think that his body would have become dirty anyway during that walk, we must consider another very probable medical fact: Especially in the minutes prior to his death on the cross, the body of a crucified man produced a very intense sweating that was literally like a shower! Such an intense sweating would certainly have been enough to remove a good portion of the supposed dirt stains that could have been left on the body after the walk to Golgotha. Of course, we must assume that no important dirt staining occurred while the crucified man was on the cross, since all his body was placed over the ground. Finally, some persons think that a new dirt staining occurred when the body was removed from the cross and probably laid on the ground. But again, these persons forget another important archaeological fact: The place of execution known as the Golgotha was not a hill of sand but a rocky elevation outside the walls of Jerusalem! We know this from the archaeological finding of this place, which is located nearby the Holy Sepulchre Basilica in Jerusalem. So, even if the body would really have been placed on the ground for some time before it was carried to the tomb, we must assume that this ground was in fact a rock! On such a rocky surface, it’s not very hard to presume that no important dirt staining of the body would have occurred. Then, for the moving of the body to the tomb, it’s not hard to believe that this was done by a few men and maybe with the help of a cloth that would have been twisted under the lower back region in order to facilité le déplacement of the body. Again, in such a context, we must assume that no important dirt staining of the corpse would have been done prior to its arrival to the rock tomb. So, if this reflection of mine is correct (note: this reflection is mainly based on historical and archaeological facts and not just my imagination), then we can conclude that the corpse that reached the tomb was not very dirty, except for the 3 areas where STURP have found some evident traces of dirt, i.e. The region of the ankle, the region of the left knee and the nose areas. This kind of minor dirt staining would not have been enough to prevent most of the blood transfer and most of the image formation process that eventually occurred on the Shroud. Final note: if you don’t agree with this reflection, that’s ok. But I still hope you will seriously consider the first argument I gave you at the beginning of this point, which shows that there was most probably not a great quantity of dirt in the regions of the forearms and on the head… Concerning this argument of mine, let me ask you again this crucial question: Since it’s very probable that the areas of the head and the forearms were mostly free of dirt stains when the body was laid in the Shroud, even though it’s evident that no washing was done there, then why thinking that it was different for the rest of the body? Important note: Even though I’m still truly convinced that there was no partial washing performed on the body of the Shroud man before he was placed in the Shroud (because of the probable fact that it was an hasty burial, the probable fact that it was against Jewish Law to wash even partially the blood stained body of someone who died a violent death, and also the fact that there are some scourge marks in the immediate vicinity of an evident post mortem blood flow in the lower back region), I have to admit that after reflecting upon jesterof comment of yesterday, the hypothesis of blood transfer he described is truly interesting! And I wonder if there would be a way that we could make an unwashed body fit with that kind of transfer… For example, is it possible that the most probable intense sweating of the Shroud man just before his death on the cross could have been enough to “wash” the areas where these contusion wounds were located, so that an oozing of blood could have occurred later on, while the body was placed inside the Shroud, and cause, with the help of some natural and/or manual pressure, the very precise dumbbel shape imprints we can see? Nevertheless, because it’s very hard for me to believe that a contusion that would have only provoke some under the skin bleeding with no superficial cutting and bleeding of the skin could have eventually caused an oozing of blood on the skin, along with an oozing of clear serum on its fringes, I still think the hypothesis proposed by Barbet and me concerning the scourge marks on the Shroud is the most rational and probable… Having said this, I still admit that jesterof’ hypothesis is truly interesting but he would need to show me some proofs of this by making (or showing me) a blood transfer experiment that would give the same result has we see on the Shroud, INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF A SERUM HALO around most of the scourge wounds. I can believe quite easily that the transfer process he described could eventually cause a precise bloody imprint on a cloth if there is enough pressure put on the contusion and on the cloth, but, as I said, I doubt that such a transfer could also cause some oozing of clear serum almost each time and that this serum would not be mixed with the oozing of blood, thus making it impossible to distinguish from the bloodstain on the cloth. It’s very important to understand that Pellicori and Miller had no problem to distinguish these two very different stains on their UV fluorescence photos… Honestly, the observation reported by Miller and Pellicori that “many scourges have fluorescing bordering areas” (this was reported for the back region) is seen by me (and also by Lavoie and Adler) as a clear sign of a blood transfer done with exudates of moistened blood clots because such an evident separation of the blood and the serum on the cloth must have come from the clot retraction process that could only have been active on the skin. Even though it is maybe possible that there could be a separation of blood and serum for a bleeding under the skin, I seriously doubt that an oozing of these two substances could form the kind of stains observed by Miller and Pellicori, which shows a bloodstain surrounded by a serum stain that is easy to distinguish from the bloodstain… If I’m wrong about that, then jesterof must show me some images where we can see a bloodstain on a piece of fabric that would have been formed the way he described and that would show a clear serum stain on its fringes (a stain that we can easily distinguish from the central bloodstains). Last thing: The absence of potassium in the blood from the Shroud could be seen, as Adler said, as another good clue to think the bloodstains on the cloth came from exudates of moistened blood clots and not from the kind of transfer proposed by jesterof. But having said this, I still wonder if this absence of potassium is a proven fact for the blood that caused the scourge marks or if it is just a proven fact for some other bloodstains (like the pre mortem blood flows of the arms or the post mortem blood flows in the lower back region)… I would like to get a precise information about that. On that question, it would be nice to know where exactly came the blood sample (or samples) that was (were) analyzed by Adler. If someone got the answer, please share it with us! One thing’s for sure: I hope jesterof will answer this previous question of mine: I wonder if there would be a way that we could make an unwashed body fit with that kind of transfer… For example, is it possible that the most probable intense sweating of the Shroud man just before his death on the cross could have been enough to “wash” the areas where these contusion wounds were located, so that an oozing of blood could have occurred later on, while the body was placed inside the Shroud, and cause, with the help of some natural and/or manual pressure, the very precise dumbbel shape imprints we can see?.","date":"2013-07-31","mins":"8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40200","author":"yannick_clément","post":"After more reflection, I must admit that, because I’m pretty sure there was no partial washing of the body (for the numerous good reasons I already exposed), I have to admit that my own hypothesis seem to be more probable than the one proposed by jesterof for one good reason: Even if there was an intense sweating before the death of the Shroud man, we have to think that there were still some ancient blood flows stuck to the skin of the man after death (coming from the leather tongues of the previous scourging) and, if that’s really the case, it would have most probably been much easier for these ancient blood flows to covered many wounds in the form of a dumbbell if these wounds would only have been contusion without any cutting of the skin.

I’m pretty sure all these dirt stains only happened when the Shroud man felt on his way to Golgotha and no other important staining came after that. 3 I’m more convinced than ever that the whole hypothesis described by Zugibe is incorrect. 4 I’m still unsure about who is correct between me and jesterof, but I tend to still favored mine, mainly because of the presence of serum halos around many scourge marks (on the back region as well as on the frontal region, if we trust Pellicori and Miller observations), which are very characteristic of external blood clots that had time to become solid enough through a clot retraction process. Reminder: jesterof’ hypothesis involved a post mortem oozing of blood material through a skin that would have only been contused (and not cut) by the metal balls or animal bones located at the end of the leather tongues of the flagrum. In such a context that would not have involved a clot retraction process, it is hard for me to believe that a transfer through the skin like that could have produce the same kind of very distinguishable serum stains on the Shroud that are located at the vicinity of the bloodstains instead of being mixed within the blood. On the contrary, I have no difficulty to believe such a transfer process could produce very precise blood imprints… But I have a strong tendency to believe such bloodstains would not show the same kind of very distinguishable serum stains around the scourge marks like it is visible on the UV photos. And if I’m wrong about that, then please show me some pictures of that kind of blood transfer that would show the same kind of resulting imprint as we see on the Shroud. Note that Lavoie et al. Have been able to reproduce with good success some bloodstains very similar to what we can see on the Shroud with an exudates of moistened blood clots and also made one very important finding: it is much easier to produce a bloodstains with some distinguishable serum stains on their borders while the clot retraction process occurred in a vertical position (which is very coherent with the idea that most (if not all) of the clotting of pre mortem blood on the Shroud man (including the scourge wounds) occurred while he was still in a vertical position of crucifixion (and this could have happened before death for some stains as well as after death for others, because it’s truly possible that the dead body was kept on the cross for some time after the death of the Shroud man). This finding is another fact that tends to support my hypothesis (which is mainly based on Barbet’s hypothesis). 5 Since it’s probable that there was no washing, I still wonder what exactly have caused the imprint of most of these scourge wounds on the cloth, even though they were inflicted several hours before the enshrouding of the Shroud man’s body. On this enigma, I still favored the idea of Barbet, who conclude that these wounds could well have stayed somewhat humid a very long time after the scourging because they probably get infected, which would have caused an oozing of lymph (along with maybe other liquids) in the vicinity of these wounds. If Barbet was right about that, there is still one question to resolve: Why the assumed blood flows resulting from the cuttings made by the leather tongues of the flagrum have not been able to completely covered the dumbbell shape wounds after the scourging? Note that if this would have happened and if part of this free blood would have clotted over these wounds, it’s highly probable that none of them would have been able to leave a distinguishable mark on the cloth… I think the most rational way to explain this “mystery” is to think that the probable very intense sweating of the Shroud man prior death was able to wash enough these areas, thus leaving these wounds free of blood flows over them. And if they remained infected for some time after that, I think it’s truly possible that the eventually clotting of these wounds only concerned the wounds and their immediate vicinity, thus producing blood clots over most of them in the shape of a dumbbell. Then, later on, when the body was placed inside the Shroud, these clotted dumbbell shape wounds were able to get re moistened again on their surfaces and then left a good mirror imprint on the cloth. I still think this is the more probable scenario in the case of the scourge marks, but it’s evident that this represent only a possible explanation, which could only be confirmed one day if an expert could do some more blood transfer experiments, while pushing the work of Lavoie et al. Even further… On this subject, I have to say that I found it very sad to note that no one these days seem to care about making such interesting experiments under proper lab control. I’m sure we could get some surprise out of an experiment like that, if it could be done the right way versus the most probable context in which the burial of the Shroud man occurred. Finally, it’s also important to note, as David pointed out the other day, that, along with the 2 probable factors I just described (infection of the wounds with a release of lymph for a long time and a very intense sweating of the Shroud man during his crucifixion that was related to his state of slow and gradual asphyxia, which acted like a shower on his body and his hair), there can be some other unknown factors (not related at all with an improbable partial washing of the body) that could have played an huge part in the fact that these scourge wounds were able to leave a distinct mirror imprint on the cloth… Again, to find them, this would need some experiments under proper lab control done by a CSI or a medical expert. If had to summarize my thoughts in one sentence, I would say: I’m still not completely sure what was the most important factor that lead to the bloody imprint of the scourge wounds on the Shroud, but one thing’s for sure: I know it wasn’t due to a partial washing of the body… Of course, this is only my ideas on the subject and every one can think otherwise..","date":"2013-08-01","mins":"8:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40259","author":"yannick_clément","post":"That’s your opinion… You always stuck to your preconcieved notions while I was open minded enough to let the door open to jesterof’ hypothesis, nevermind the fact that there was most certainly no washing.

In such a context of a high Sabbath that is coming fast, why would they have wanted to lose precious time in order to do a surgical washing of the body (see the picture again on top of this page to be convinced) while they knew full well they had to come back on Sunday morning anyway (i.e. After the Sabbath that they didn’t break by the way, proving that yes, they were all pious Jews who were following the Jewish Law)? Since they knew they had to come back and since they wanted to get home before the coming of the high Sabbath (Sabbath during Passover), the most logical move for them would have been to simply laid down the crucified body that was still covered with blood clots (dried and moistened) and some dirt (not much) in the Shroud without tying the cloth with linen strips (because they knew they had to open it again on Sunday morning) and leave it there still naked Inside the Shroud. That’s the most logical scenario in the context of Jesus hasty burial. You can think what you want but that will never change anything about this truth.

But I think the best explanation remains the one I already described on this blog: First, they probably did a compression of the burial cloth on the corpse (for whatever reason; maybe because they had put some burial product on the cloth and wanted to make sure these products touched the body; who knows?). Such a direct contact of the cloth on the corpse would account for the transfer of all the bloodstains we see on the cloth (including the scourge marks). And then, after the transfer of the enshrouded corpse from a central place Inside the tomb to a stone bench carved Inside one of the walls of the tomb, they probably manually replaced the cloth much more loosely over the body (but not in a very taut configuration like you seem to think). The reason for this was most probably because they knew they had to come back on Sunday morning to finish the burial rite, so there was no reason to tight up the enshrouded body with linen strips or just to keep the cloth very compressed around the body. Note that my hypothesis is good to explain the few bloodstains that are located outside the body image (like the one outside the right elbow or the few scourge marks that are located outside the dorsal image of the legs) and can account also for the slight lateral distortion in some parts of the image (especially in the regions of the head and the thighs, as it was find out by STURP), as well as the fact that there is no important distortion of the image anywhere….","date":"2013-08-03","mins":"5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-26648","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What is funny in the question of M. Klotz is the fact that I ended up my recent paper concerning the evidence of the bloodstains (http://shroud.com/pdfs/n76part5.pdf) with almost the same words! If you read again my paper, you’ll noticed that I described 4 different scenarios that I think are still plausible to explain the Shroud and 2 of them imply that another crucified corpse had been covered with that cloth. After an honest and long reflection on the subject, I came out of this convinced that it is most probably the Shroud of Jesus of Nazareth with a 99% confidence. In fact, I completely reject the second scenario involving an accidental resemblance between an unknown crucified man and the Jesus of the Gospel for a number of good reasons that would be too long to describe here. But I can at least mention the most important reason in my mind, which is the conjecture created by the fact that this man was very severely scourged (most certainly much more harder than what was done prior to a standard Roman crucifixion), that he was forced to wear a sort of cap of thorny objects, that he was stab to the side after death, that he didn’t had his legs broken, that his corpse was only in contact with the cloth for less than 72 hours and that his bloodstained burial cloth was kept and preserved to this day. And concerning the first scenario involving a “natural” forgery that would have been done with the use of a real crucified corpse, even though such a scenario seems to offer a better probability than the previous one, it still end up very far from the other 2 scenarios I described that involved the real Shroud of Jesus. Why? Among other things, because of the very heavy scourging that was done to the victim that would have been used by the forger to create his false relic of the Passion of Christ. Almost every medical experts who have studied the Shroud agree to say that the scourging endured by the Shroud man was so intense that it could have kill him before he could reach the place of crucifixion. Once you understand this most important medical fact, you have to conclude that no forger in the world would have dared to perform such a severe scourging that could have killed his victim before he could nail him on the cross. This is pure logical thinking! After all, nowhere in the Gospels, there is a description of the severity of the scourging and most evidently, the main focus of the forger would have been elsewhere, i.e. To reproduce the stigmata of the crucifixion of Christ. Because of this and because of some other things, I personally evaluate the chances for such a natural forgery scenario to really be able to explain the Shroud at less than 1%. And that’s it! Beside these 2 alternative scenarios I described in my paper, I honestly don’t see any other plausible scenario that can explain the Shroud and that would involve another person than Jesus of Nazareth. Remember that no matter what Colin Berry or Joe Nickell can thing, all the artistic forgery scenarios have been completely discarded by science since a very long time now….","date":"2013-03-06","mins":"4:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/06/john-klotz-if-not-him-who/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"John Klotz:  If not HIM, who?"},{"id":"comment-17218","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Thanks for the comment Gabriel but you got to understand that Andy at shroudnm.com did his best to finish the translation even though is not perfect in Spanish… At least, like you said, it can be followed !!!

On the question of whether the cloth was very tight around the body or loose at the moment of the image formation, I think science have a pretty good idea of the correct answer, after the work of Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline of STURP that was independently confirmed quite well by Mario Latendresse in 2005. After having read these papers and reflect a long time on the subject, I think the most reasonable and rational way to answer the question is to say that unlike the blood and serum stains (that are a complete produce of a direct contact transfer process between the corpse and the cloth, which indicate that at some point, the Shroud MUST have been tightly wrapped or compressed over most parts of the body), the body image process operate in a different way and was most probably active only when the cloth had changed his configuration and wasn’t so tight around the body anymore. It’s only with a cloth loosely draped over the corpse that it is possible to obtain (with the help of a process of projection of the image) a body image like we see on the Shroud that don’t possess big distorsion (but that possess some minor distorsions nevertheless). In fact, to summarize my opinion, I would say that the blood and serum stains were caused uniquely by a direct contact process when the cloth was, during a time (that could have been short) in direct contact with most parts of the corpse, while the body image was caused by a process acting in direct contact AND at short distance (that could be 4 cm but that could well be less than that in reality). I think this is the most rational way to explain both the blood and serum stains and the body image on the Shroud. Now, for the eternal question of the image formation process, you already know my answer : All the data coming from the Shroud cannot discard the possibility of a natural process (chemical in nature) and I think science should keep looking in that direction to find a definitive answer. Rogers (and Vignon before him) has carved the road and I think others should follow this path… And here’s a note for anyone who want to know more about me : If you click on the first link provided by Dan entitled “The Holy Shroud Guild”, you’ll be able to read my little autobiography entirely. Dan wrote that it is another paper but in fact, this is the same paper I published here and on the website of Pete Schumacher (shroudnm.com) last month. I’m just glad Giorgio of the Holy Shroud Guild loved so much my paper that he decided to put it online on his website ! I have to say a big thank you to him for his help to diffuse this paper to the world. I have put so much effort and so many hours (in the writting but more on the thinking) that it’s fun to know that I didn’t do all this for nothing… Have a good reading (if it’s not already done) !!!.","date":"2012-08-29","mins":"5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”"},{"id":"comment-15587","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Max you wrote : “YC wrote “at some point, the Shroud MUST have been tightly wrapped or compressed over most parts of the body”. I am glad he finally started buying in some of my ideas…as if it were his own! (see his first exegis of Yeshua’s burial).” I didn’t changed my mind about that… The fact that the Shroud was tightly wrapped against the body is easy to note when you understand that the bloodstains on the cloth all MUST have come from a direct contact !!! In fact, they mostly come from exudates of blood clots and this kind of exudate can only be transferred to a cloth by direct contact (with some pressure applied on it). So, there’s no question that the Shroud MUST have been compressed or tighly wrapped over the body for a time. BUT… The studies of STURP and Latendresse showed that it was probably NOT the same configuration when the body image formation started to be active inside the Shroud. At the moment, if the Shroud would still have been tightly wrapped or compressed over the body, we would have get big distorsions, especially in more rounded parts of the body, like the face, the arms, the legs, etc. Conclusion : the configuration of the Shroud MUST have changed between the time of the blood transfer and the time of the image formation process. And unlike Gilbert Lavoie, I don’t think we should call for any miraculous event to explain this probable change of configuration ! I think the participants of the burial rite were good enough to do this kind of change of configuration MANUALLY (with a great care not to disturb too much the fresh bloodstains). By the way, this probably great care not to disturb anything is truly consistent with the meticulous way pious Jews of that era were acting during a burial (Lavoie talked about this particular aspect in one of his paper on the subject that he published for Shroud Spectrum International)..","date":"2012-08-29","mins":"8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/28/mr-prolifics-latest-an-exceptional-article-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Mr. Prolific’s Latest: “An exceptional article by Yannick Clément”"},{"id":"comment-15658","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I think Dave that if it ever happen the way Rogers describe it, the image formation MUST have benefit from some extraordinary and special conditions inside the tomb and inside the Shroud (and probably also because of the particular state of the tortured corpse).

As Rogers said, he was not aware of even one single energetic radiation (remember that it’s a true expert who speak and not just an engeneer like Fanti) that could uniquely colored a very thin layer of impurities without producing any easily visible defects (at least easy to detect for an expert like him) on the primary cell wall of the linen fiber that is present under the impurities.

This kind of precise study is waiting to be done and I don’t understand that nobody ever done it since 1978 !!! One thing’s for sure: this dorsal image on the Shroud never seem to pose problem for Rogers versus his hypothesis of image formation !!! Here’s what he said about that (found in the recent paper published by Thibault) : “Evaporation concentration at the surface of a cloth limits the depth of penetration of reactions into the cloth: The dorsal image is NOT a problem.” I think what Rogers mean by that is that his own hypothesis concerning the chromophore of the image can easily explain why the dorsal image as roughly the same characteristics than the frontal (especially concerning the fact that it didn’t penetrate the cloth more deeply than the frontal image). Of course, explaining the formation of this dorsal image is ANOTHER STORY !!!! He he ! It’s not at all evident and personally, this is the most problematic aspect of the Shroud’s image versus the idea of a natural image formation process. I don’t say that science will never be able to find a natural process that can explain this dorsal image (note : a dorsal image that we know was not caused only by a direct contact process, no matter what John Jackson might think about that) but I’m very curious to learn what natural process can act at some distance from the dorsal part of a body.

Someone just have to know a little bit of history to understand that this tale was introduced in the Gospels to makes counterweights to other similar tales from Pagan religions, whether it be in Egypt, in Mesopotamia or elsewhere during Antiquity. And then, the Byzantine Church got really over their head by making Mary (who was certainly a Saint Lady) the Christian version of the Greco Roman Goddesses, evidently in the goal to convert the Pagans more easily… All this is pretty evident for someone who knows history just a bit. Jesus was a real man and the Incarnation is not a joke as we can see on the Shroud and as a Catholic, I have absolutely no problem at all to accept that Mary and Joseph (the great forgotten man of the bible) conceived Jesus just like any other human being, even though he really had a divine nature too. This fairy tale concerning the virginal birth and the perpetual virginity of Mary had a desastrous impact on how Christians over the history have seen the sexuality… Desastrous.

They add these legendary stories (pretty much of the same kind that we found in many apocryphal gospels by the way) because it was a way for them to “proclaim Jesus as Christ and Jesus as Son of God” much more easily in the cultural and religious context they were in. My interpretation of the Gospels is this : Most of it is probably based on real historical events and were written in a very Middle Eastern writting style that used a lot of images, but some little parts (like the birth stories in Luke and Matthew’s gospels and part of Matthew’s account of the Passion) were most likely popular Christian legends that were added in their Gospels and that have no historical base whatsoever.

In my mind, if a sample of blood should be taken one day for a proper DNA analysis, it would be much better to take it from the reverse side, where many bloodstains are also present, since the blood material has been able to soak through the entire cloth in many places. I would like to get your thoughts on that. Thanks! And here’s a little reflection of mine on the subject that was brought here by Andy: If we could find a complete DNA profile of Jesus, I would bet my house that, virginal birth or natural birth, his DNA would be as normal as the DNA of me or you! The Incarnation was not a joke and Jesus was a completely human like you and me (except that he had also a divine nature inside of him, which was not visible with the eyes of the flesh). The way the man of the Shroud suffered and died like any other crucified man is a very good sign that what I just said is true. Also, we can find a very good sign of this in the Gospel and particularly in St John’s Gospel when it is clear that one of the most important accusation of the Jews against Jesus that eventually send him on the cross was that he claimed to be the Son of God or, in other words, equal to God. For the ancient Jews, God was one! That’s why it was totally unconceivable for a pious Jew of the first century to believe that Jesus could be the Son of God and that’s the main reason why the vast majority of the Jews never turned Christian after the Resurrection. In sum, the Incarnation of God in Jesus was the main problematic thing for them to become Christians and most of them stayed in Judaism instead of becoming Christians. From all these very good clues that we can found in the study of the Gospels and in the study of the Shroud, we have a very good sense that Jesus, as a material human being, was like anyone of us. No different for anyone’s eyes. Because of that, I truly believe that his DNA must have been as completely normal as your DNA or mine, no matter if he was born of a virgin or not..","date":"2012-12-13","mins":"2:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/12/on-genetic-codes-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"On Genetic Codes and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-20390","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Thank you M. Kearse. And between you and me, as we both are believers in Jesus Christ, does that really makes a big difference if Jesus conception would have been done through a sexual act between Mary and Joseph? Seriously, I don’t think so. I have already said on this blog that, for numerous reasons related as much as the Jews religious conceptions as the Pagan legendary culture, it was easier for Luke and Matthew to persuade people (both Jews and Pagans) to believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, if this real human being was born of a virgin. The vast majority of historians and bible scholars agree with my point of view. The religious and cultural context in which these 2 Gospels were written is most probably the reason why both came up with this story of a virginal conception of Jesus. Most historians also agree that the narrative style of the stories of the nativity of Jesus that we found in these 2 Gospels are truly legendary and could well have originated from the popular Christian legends of the second half of the first century. It’s the very same thing with a portion of Matthew’s story of the Passion and death of Christ (the part that speaks of the Resurrection of the Saints and the darkness and all this stuff). Clearly, here again, Matthew add some popular Christian legends to his story. Note that it’s truly possible that both Matthew and Luke believed these legends were true and they reported them honestly, but in the end, that doesn’t change a thing versus the fact that these stories are most probably non historical in reality. And we have to understand one important point versus this virginal question: If Mary conceived Jesus through a natural way, THAT WOULDN’T REMOVED ANYTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE WAS MOST PROBABLY ONE IF NOT THE ONLY HUMAN BEING TO HAVE REALLY UNDERSTAND JESUS MISSION (i.e. To reveal the TRUE face of God which is Love and Mercy for all mankind) BEFORE HIS DEATH and that’s truly in his honor..","date":"2012-12-13","mins":"5:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/12/on-genetic-codes-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"On Genetic Codes and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-10691","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Don’t say 4 options !

And, as far as I know, science is not able to clearly state which one is the right one. I’m sorry but nothing in the STURP data can permit to discard the first or the second option… And if I listen to what Ray Rogers had to say, number 3 is HIGHLY UNLIKELY !!! But I’ll say it again : In the present state of our knowledge on the Shroud, nothing can discard one of those 3 options. So, the door is open to personal opinions and preferences, but just remember that any of those 3 options can be considered as an accepted theory for the moment. They are just general hypothesis and we’re still left with one big question : When you understand that the body images on the Shroud came from a real corpse, then you ask yourself : Is it due to some natural or to some supernatural phenomenon(s) ???

It is the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains. In his book A doctor at calvary, Pierre Barbet talk about this very particular and unusual aspect of the bloodstains and, for him (and for me !), it is the great sign (not a proof) of the resurrection that can be found on the cloth ! For Barbet (who knew very well what he was talking about), this aspect of the bloodstains could not be explained by science (in the state of the knowledge of his time). I don’t think anyone (whether he come from the pro or the anti shroud side) have ever been able to offer a clear and scientifically sound explanation for the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains. But, at the same time, I’m not ready to discard the option #1 and #2 (if this is another person than Jesus), simply because I really don’t think that there was enough experiments done in laboratories to verify the claim of Barbet. For the moment, I don’t think anyone can say with a 100% degree of confidence that Barbet didn’t made an error of interpretation (even if this seem highly unlikely). I think more research should be done to fully understand all the physical effects (or absence of effect) that could happen when there’s a separation between a bloody corpse and a shroud that envelop him. Who knows if, in a very particular scenario involving very particular conditions (for example : a very limited time of contact between the corpse and the shroud), the bloodstains could not come out just like those on the Shroud ? So, to summarize this point, we can say that the aspect of the bloodstains seem to put the options #1 and #2 (if this is another person than Jesus) in geopardy. If the assumption of Barbet about that can be shown experimentaly, then I think we could say that the chances for the cloth to be the real burial Shroud of Christ would be very high ! Regarding the question of the bloodstains on the Shroud, I’m amazed to note that there was, to my knowledge, absolutely no serious experiments done to evaluate the assumption of Barbet and evaluate if there is not a “natural” way that exist to extract a bloody corpse from a linen shroud while leaving the bloodstains undisturbed… Would be nice if a real medical expert could investigate this particular question by making a series of test in laboratory. If the conclusion would be that there is absolutely no way to obtain the same result that we see on the Shroud, then I think the case for a Shroud of Christ would be even better than it is right now.

I’ll take your comments one by one and answer it : 1 Quote from John Klotz : “I believe that as our knowledge expands, that image maybe explained, perhaps by some quantum process.” My answer : I could answer this by simply saying to you : Don’t you think a process like that wouldn’t fit into my second option as some kind of “undetermined natural phenomenon” ? But I prefer to say this to you : We can extrapolate and speculate all we want about quantum process and things like that. Personally, I believe what science can demonstrate ! So, until science can demonstrate that some natural “energy” like that (or some other kind of “naturally produced” energy) could have create the Shroud “naturally”, I will stay on my position and think that we are only left with 3 different possibilities and nothing else regarding the body images on the Shroud. When it comes to think that the Shroud body images were formed by a “natural” process, in the present state of our knowledge, I just see some kind of complex chemical phenomenon(s) as a plausible answer. I know some people have talked about a recent article in which the author state that during an earthquake, an electromagnetic energy could theoritically created some kind of an image on a linen Shroud, but personally, this seem to be so unlikely that I simply discard that possibility. 2 Quote from Gabriel : “Yannick, don`t you consider a 4th option? It is the real burial shroud of Jesus Christ and a natural mechanism (Millard reaction , defended by Rogers or mercerization defended by Kohlbeck) took place in image formaton. From previous posts, I understood that you were for Roger hypothesis.” My answer : Read again my letter Gabriel ! I have, of course, consider that option (which I think his the best we have so far) and you can find it in my second option !!! In fact, this second option include all the “natural” hypothesis like the one of Rogers, but also, to be honest, I left the door open to the very slim possibility that the body images on the Shroud could be those of someone else than Christ. Effectively, if we think they were produced by some “natural” phenomenon(s), scientifically speaking, no one can be 100% sure that the corpse was the one of Jesus of Nazareth, even if a very big amount of evidence point in that direction. Personally, because of the vast amount of evidence I just mention, of course I believe that this Shroud is the one of Jesus. But to stay scientifically honest, I had to left the door open to the possibility that it could be the one of another crucified person… 3 Comments by Max. My answer : Read what I said to Gabriel and my answer fits also very well with your comments Max. Your hypothesis also fits perfectly into my second option ! 4 Comment from Daveb. My answer : I think your comment is more speculative versus the probability of each of my option to be the right one than a real questionning of the relevance of those 3 possibilities. In that sense, I don’t have much to say. I leave you answer which one of the 3 option is the most likely in your opinion. Since it is your personal opinion, I don’t have much to say, except than saying that it is possible that I favored another option than yours ! But in the end, if someone favored #1, another person favored #2 (like I do) or if someone else favored #3 (like you do), it’s okay for me in the sense that everyone of those possibilities have some chances to be true, on the contrary to any scorch or rubbing hypothesis !!! But I also want to say this : we have to remember that, in the present state of our knowledge, it is impossible to estimate precisely what is the correct level of probability for each one of the 3 options I’ve written, so the door is open for all of them. But I also want to say that, in my opinion, if I use the Ockham razor principle, I easily come up with #2. But that’s just my own analysis and you can, of course, believe what you want… As long as it is not some kind of artistic hypothesis !.","date":"2012-04-21","mins":"5:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/21/please-dont-forget-the-evidence-of-the-bloodstains/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Please, don’t forget the evidence of the bloodstains !!!"},{"id":"comment-10725","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Dave you say : “Check posting #2 from Gabriel – “Yannick, don`t you consider a 4th option?

Here it is : “Read again my letter Gabriel ! I have, of course, consider that option (which I think his the best we have so far) and you can find it in my second option !!!

In fact, I realize that I should have done 2 subcategories for my second option ! I should have wrote this : 2 A It is a real burial shroud of someone else than Jesus who suffered the same tortures than him and was produced by some undetermined natural phenomenon(s). 2 B It is a real burial shroud of Jesus and was produced by some undetermined natural phenomenon(s). Those 2 subcategories concern both some undetermined natural phenomenon(s) as the cause of the body image and that’s why I put them together in one single category in my letter. But now, I realise that it wasn’t enough clear… I should have wrote 4 options after all… And personally, in face of all the STURP data, I still think (this is just my personal opinion) that if we use Ockham razor, the most likely option regarding the Shroud images should be “option 2 B”. And you also said : “The dorsal image shows no sign of body deformation” I’m sorry but that’s not exactly true. In their great paper for STURP, Miller and Pellicori analysed the UV photos of the Shroud and conclude that the back image is generally a bit more distinct than the front image and Barrie Schwortz once confirmed to me that there is some slight signs of compressions found in the scapular region of the back. In the UV photos paper, the 2 authors wrote that the difference between the back and the front image was much lower than they would expect, but since the body image formation is still unknown and all the conditions that prevailed inside the tomb are also unknown, I don’t think we have to go into extreme thoughts like there was a levitation of the body during the image formation ! Maybe that can be naturally explained someday. I really think that people often make the mistake of thinking that the STURP investigation was the end of the world and that they check everything ! It’s not true at all and the best proof of that is the fact that, during the mid 80s, the STURP team planned to do a second round of direct examination of the cloth !!! That’s the best proof that more researches need to be done before we can proclaim that science have come full circle about the Shroud ! In reality, we’re still very far from that point ! In this context, I don’t think it’s time to go into extreme hypothesis because we still don’t know if there’s not some natural explanation for the Shroud… And if you can read the book of Rogers (it is a must read), I don’t think he reject the possibility that a Maillard reaction can create some real 3 D images, in some very particular conditions. But in the end, if you prefer option #3, that’s your freedom and I respect that..","date":"2012-04-22","mins":"6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/21/please-dont-forget-the-evidence-of-the-bloodstains/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Please, don’t forget the evidence of the bloodstains !!!"},{"id":"comment-10686","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I would like to make a little addendum to my open letter : Firstly, I want to give you the complete name of the medical expert I quote at the beginning of my letter : His full name was James Malcolm Cameron.

Secondly, I want to give you the title of the documentary I talk about in the intro : it’s called “The Wonder of the Shroud” and it feature a conference done by Fr. Martin Haigh, a Dominican. I truly recommend it to anyone interested by the Shroud, especially those of you who are already Christians, because this presentation make a very good link between the Shroud and our Christian faith ! It’s the kind of document that help to elevate the faith of someone who fight with doubt (i.e. : every honest believer !). And what is great is the fact that Fr. Haigh speech is in straight line with what I said in this open letter… He too point out the fact that the Shroud cannot be a human artistic forgery and he used mainly the image itself to prove his case, which he did brilliantly !

And, of course, I could add more names to this important list of forensic experts, but I’ll stop there because I think the actual list I gave is well enough for you to understand that this statement from professor Cameron is completely true and lead to only one scientific conclusion about the Shroud : It is not a human artistic forgery !

Reading Matt’s comment yesterday made me realized that there’s one MAJOR SCIENTIFIC TRUTH that I should have emphasized in my paper concerning the authenticity of the Shroud, but that I did not (or not enough). Here is this truth that is SO OFTEN FORGOTTEN : In order to explain the Shroud, one MUST take account of all the known and accepted data about the relic, AND THAT INCLUDE THE BLOOD AND SERUM STAINS PRESENT ON THE CLOTH !!! Too often I see people proposing all sorts of artistic techniques to explain the body image but, AT THE SAME TIME, these people don’t offer any rational explanation whatsoever concerning the blood and serum stains !!! From a scientific point of view, this kind of acting represents a total lack of credibility and professionalism. In fact, this is purely unscientific to act like that… I’m sorry but the Shroud IS NOT just a body image !!! People tend to always forget that essential FACT. It is ALSO, AT THE SAME TIME, a blood and serum stained cloth !!! You can’t proposed an explanation that would only account for the body image without even considering the blood and serum stains… But unfortunately, almost all the skeptics out there do exactly what I just describe !!! I thought I made it clear enough in pages 9 and 10 of the English version of my paper, but I realized that it’s probably not the case. So, I repeat it to make sure that anyone who’ll read this will remember it until the end of his life : Any image formation proposition SHOULD, AT THE SAME TIME, be able to explain rationally the blood and serum stains that are present on the cloth as well as the body image !!! It is scientifically forgiven to make a proposition for just one of these 2 main aspects of the Shroud of Turin ! You simply cannot separate one from the other. Both are linked together. In other words, every person who tries to explain the Shroud, SHOULD come up with a global explanation that would account rationally for EVERY ASPECTS of the cloth, including the blood and serum stains and not just the body image. And please, don’t come talking to me about the “fact” that the blood and serum on the cloth don’t really come from a real tortured and crucified man, because this conclusion is one, if not the most solid that exist concerning this relic !!! And this aspect of the Shroud is well enough to understand that this cloth is a real burial shroud of someone who bled a great deal prior to his death (and even after death). In these conditions, I think that we should completely forget every proposal based on any kind of artistic technique and concentrate the debate on the 4 possible scenarios I proposed in pages 6, 7 and 8 of my paper. If we can do this, I firmly believe that the Shroud authenticity debate would gain much credibility and valor ! Why constantly losing our precious time in sterile debate about some kind of artistic forgery, while these options were set aside long ago. The STURP team drove the last nail in that coffin at the beginning of the 80s and even before, thanks to the work of Barbet and Vignon, among others, these options were already judged inadequate regarding the real nature of the Shroud (that include the blood and serum stains and not only the body image) !!! And to be even more punchy, I leave the place to William Meacham ! Here’s what he wrote in page 47 of his book The Rape of the Turin Shroud : “These conclusions (note: Meacham talk about the FACT that the Shroud is not some artistic forgery and, on the contrary, that it is an authentic burial shroud of someone who was tortured and crucified) should now be considered WELL DOCUMENTED ARCHAEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENTS, approaching the level of certainty if normal standards are applied, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY AGREE EXACTLY WITH THE EVIDENCE FROM MEDICAL STUDIES.” Once you realize that the Shroud is a real burial cloth of someone who suffered the same tortures than Jesus of Nazareth, as reported by the Gospels, there’s not too much options that is left on the table. In fact, I truly believe that there is just four and none of them involved some kind of artistic technique, even if one still involve a forger (see my recent paper, pages 6 to 8) !!! It would be nice if this eternal debate about the authenticity of the relic could focus ONLY on these 4 options and disregard completely all the rest, especially those involving an artistic technique. If we really want to find the TRUTH (and not just our little truth), I don’t think we should lose one minute searching in a direction that was set aside by science long ago… To conclude, I would like to give you a very clever quote from John Heller and Alan Adler that we can find in page 50 of Meacham’s book and that fits perfectly with my comment : “The multidisciplinary nature of these publications (note : they talk here about all the STURP papers), ranging from mathematics, physics and chemistry through biology and medicine, is part of the complex Shroud problem and MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR AN EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE.” I think they could have add “and for an evaluation of any hypothesis of image formation.” !!!

And I think you forget one important facts: the Roman flagrum were made of dumbell metal balls and were not used to caused an important bleeding (like the common flogging instruments used by other people) but to inflict a maximum pain in order to remove the strength of the victim so that he cannot offered any resistance to his crucifixion. Since my experience, I’m more convinced than ever that the scourging of the Shroud man did not produced a lot of bleeding but instead, they produced a lot of contused wounds with some superficial bleeding (pretty much like the wound I get from the tree branch) and this superficial bleeding eventually clotted and dried. Then these clots were re moistened and left a Mirror imprint on the cloth. That’s Barbet’s conclusion and I agree totally with him.

All other hits that only produced a bruise did not left any traces on the Shroud. EVERY WOUNDS HAVE THE SAME SHAPE, which is like a little dumbbell of 3 centimeters. The two circles represent the tin balls; the intermediary bar is the trace of the tongue.” Here’s another one about the bloodstains: “On the Shroud, there is no blood flow; there are only imprints of clots; these clots represent the portion of the blood that clotted on the skin…” And another one: “Every blood images of the Shroud are imprints of fresh clots or clots that have been soften by the water vapor that is normally released by a corpse for a pretty long time.” I think these short quotes from Barbet’s book, along with the observation reported by Miller and Pellicori that the scourge marks shows very fine scratch like marks that are not visible to the naked eye and that almost every scourge marks are surrounded by a halo of serum (which, in the mind of Barbet, cannot have been caused by anything else than a clot retraction), gave us some clues about the way many scourge wounds have been able to left a mirror imprint on the cloth… Effectively, all these observations and conclusions show that, in order to leave the kind of very precise imprints we see on the Shroud, the scourge wounds must have been filled with clotted blood which became humid again well after their drying (or, less probably, which were able to stay humid all along the crucifixion). I think there are two very compelling pieces of evidence that exist on the cloth which strongly suggest that Barbet was correct about the fact that the scourge marks on the Shroud were all caused by exudates of humid blood clots. Here they are: 1 ALL the imprints show the SAME PRECISE SHAPE. 2 Almost every scourge wounds are SURROUNDED BY A HALO OF SERUM. Conclusion: These wounds must have been formed by the same process (it’s impossible that two different processes could have produced stains with the same very precise shape) and, in order to left an imprint on the cloth, some blood must have come at the surface of these wounds and must have clotted there. All this strongly suggest that the process known as a transfer from exudates of blood clots, as described by Barbet and confirmed by Adler, is the one that can explain the best the presence of the scourge marks on the cloth. It’s pretty evident that any other transfer process (like the one described by Zugibe of an oozing of post morten liquid blood or the other one described by jesterof related to hematomas) would never have been able to form bloodstains with the same kind of very precise shape and borders as we can see on the Shroud and Miller and Pellicori would not have been able to detect the kind of halos of serum on their UV fluorescence photos. Question: What have caused bloody wounds like that? Did a round metal ball the way we assume there was at the end of the tongue could have caused such wounds? Or is it due to the fact that the surface of these tin balls was somewhat irregular? Or is it due to the fact that there were no metal balls at all at the end of the leather tongues of the flagrum but only animal bones (this is an historical fact that such animal bones could have been used at the end of these tongues)? It’s hard to say, but one thing’s for sure: A lot of scourge hits have been able to cause an abrasion of the skin that was important enough that small portions of the skin were surely cut open and filled with blood. Or else, as Barbet said, there would only be some kind of bruises on the skin that would not have been able to leave any imprint on the cloth… In the abstract of the paper about injuries by blunt objects that was given by jesterof yesterday, there is one forensic term in there that, I think, is the best to describe the kind of wounds that were present on the skin of the Shroud man when his corpse was placed inside the Shroud and this term is “Contused lacerated wounds”. I really think this kind of wound is what was present on the skin of the Shroud man after his scourging and such a bloody wound was showing the same kind of precise dumbbell shape that we can see on the Shroud… The small bloody wounds have eventually clotted and, because of a re moistening of their surface, they were able to leave a very good mirror imprint on the cloth. I really think Barbet and Adler would think the same….","date":"2013-06-03","mins":"8:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood"},{"id":"comment-35892","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Just a correction for my previous comment: I used the term “tin balls” two times while you should read “lead balls” instead.

You buy it online here : http://holyshroudguild.org/orphaned manuscript.html In it, you’ll find a very good description of Adler’s work and analyses concerning the blood and the serum stains. To answer your question, Adler was able to show that when the blood and even the serum stains were removed from the surface of a fiber coming from the body image area (with the help of strong reducing chemical agents), it left a nice fiber free of any body image coloration, showing that the most probable explanation for this observation was that the blood and serum stained the cloth first and only after that, the body image formation begins to be active and this coloring process (I should say oxydizing and/or dehydrating process) was completely blocked by these biological stains on the fibers. When we consider the profesionnalism of Adler concerning the question of the blood on the Shroud, it’s pretty easy to think that this conclusion is solid (scientifically speaking), but it’s sure that it would be a very good thing if another independent researcher could do the same kind of analysis and come up with the same result….","date":"2012-07-29","mins":"4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper"},{"id":"comment-14311","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I also want to say 2 observations about this discovery made by Adler concerning the absence of a body image coloration under the blood and serum stains : 1 As Ray Rogers said, this observation is one good indicator of a mild process that is responsible for the image formation on the Shroud (because even a very thin layer of serum seem to have been enough to prevent any image formation on the cloth). 2 The fact that Adler found a clean linen fiber free of any body image color after the used of a strong reducing chemical agent to remove the blood and serum on the fiber remembered me of the fact that the same Adler also found a clean linen fiber free of any body image color after the used of a strong reducing chemical agent (the diimide is the most known but there’s a few other agents capable of a similar result) to remove the body image color on the fiber. My personal feeling about this similarity in the results obstained by Adler is this : I think this point toward the fact that both the blood and serum stains AND the body image on the Shroud are “coating” substances that rest OVER the linen fibers and that has no direct effect on the linen fiber itself (including the primary cell wall). In the case of the blood and serum stains, the coating is biological (no doubt about that) and it affected the fibers all over the cloth (whether it be a top most fiber or a fiber present deep inside the cloth), and in the case of the body image, the coating is made of carbohydrates impurities (if we believe Rogers opinion) that have been deposited only on the top most fibers of the cloth during his manufacture (with probably a very ancient method of making linen cloths).

But anyway, the sweat itself (without blood in it, just normal sweat) has been proven by Pellicori of STURP to produce a coloration on a linen cloth that is very close to the body image on the Shroud. But one big problem with this hypothesis is the fact that the sweat should normally have been completely dried at the moment the corpse was put in the Shroud.

Thanks for your comment ! Concerning your comment about the quote of mine, I’m not aware of any recent lab experiments either that would have been made to analyze this most intriguing aspect of the bloodstains on the Shroud. I know Vignon made extensive tests of blood transfer during the first half of the 20th century and never was able to reproduce this aspect of the stains. I’m also aware of another experiment done during the 80s by Gilbert Lavoie concerning the question of the transfer of the blood from the body to the cloth, but his purpose was not to analyze this particular and bizarre aspect of the bloodstains but to see the maximum range of time that was available after the cloting of blood on the skin in order to produce a good quality of stain on a linen cloth. Depending on many conditions and factors, Lavoie came to the conclusion that the maximum rang was no more than 2 hours and most probably 1 hour in normal condition. To me, this is a very good clue that the bloodstains on the Shroud were transferred on the cloth by a re humidification of their surface instead of being transferred before they were completely dry, because in all logic, if this is really the Shroud of Jesus, we know that the body was probably not put in the Shroud before 2 or more hours after death (we can estimate this easily from the Gospel accounts and also, if the Sudarium was really in contact with the same head, we know that this cloth was in contact with the head during 2 hours or so before being removed for the deposit of the body in the Shroud). If my estimation about that is good, that would mean that Pierre Barbet’s hypothesis of a re humidification of the blood clots once the body was trapped INSIDE the Shroud is also correct. And concerning your comment about the quote from Matt, I should say that I don’t remember any experiment done by Adler, Baima Bollone or other experts that would have been done to “scrapped away” the bloodstains on small samples. Can you give me the reference of this experiment ? Does it come from the book of Adler or elsewhere ? Adler said that someone on the STURP team (I think it was Pellicori) used very delicately a probing needle while in Turin in order to see if there was some material (blood of body image or something else) trapped inside the weave of the cloth and inside the threads in order to determine if there was clear signs of fibers cemented together and/or signs of capillarity and/or signs of abrasion, but I’m not sure at all (in fact, I don’t think so) if that’s what you mean. For the record, with this on site experiment, the STURP team was able to determine that these signs were only present for the “blood” material and not for the body image coloration, which clearly show that these 2 features on the Shroud are very different in nature..","date":"2012-07-29","mins":"5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper"},{"id":"comment-14490","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I never read that paper from Upinsky.

And acting like that, the Church prove that she is bright. I’m sure you have noticed how Pius XI had 2 different languages when he was talking about the Shroud personally and as the Pope ? This is a very good example of how it goes for many people inside the Church, and I think it’s the right way to act. Imagine one second if the actual Pope would declare the Shroud to be genuine and then, 10 years from now, some scientist could prove without any doubt that the cloth is not the one of Jesus ! That would be a disaster for the credibility of the Church and that’s the main reason why the Vatican will never claim something else than what science can conclude about the Shroud. And right now, science is able to conclude that 1 The Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man who suffered the same exact tortures than Jesus of Nazareth, as reported by the Gospel. And 2 The body image on the Shroud come from an interaction between the cloth and the corpse it covered. That’s all what science can claim for the moment about the Shroud (without any reasonnable doubt) and that’s all the Church can also proclaim (for the moment of course). And the outcome of these 2 very solid conclusions is the fact that, in front of the Shroud, we are only left with the 4 scenarios I described in my paper (and nothing else). So, make your bets people !!! Which one of the 4 do you think it is ??? I say that correctly because right now, there is no certainties on that questions. On the contrary, there’s only probabilities.

The way I personally understand this concept (that goes way beyond our material understanding of the Universe), it is more of a disappearing of the material body of Christ from our material world (space time) that went directly, instantaneously and without leaving any material traces into the Spiritual world (which is a completely different reality than ours here on Earth). And I really don’t think this line of thinking isn’t at all against the “glorified body” image used by St. Paul. For me, the body of Christ is now Spiritual and that’s why we don’t see him with out material eyes (with the exception of some mystics over the years to whom Jesus WANTED to be visible, just like it happened for the disciples after the resurrection) !!!
