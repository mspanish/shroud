And here’s another truth: The Jews of Jesus time (including those who were specialists of the Scriptures) had a very different portrait in mind concerning the Messiah, which was million miles away from the portrait of a suffering Messiah like Jesus! Some were thinking about a new king. Some about a new high priest. Some about a new prophet like Moses. But no one was thinking of the kind of Messiah Jesus was… Again, this smell truth!

If the words of the prophets would have been understood by most Jews as talking about a suffering Messiah, there would have been no scandal at all for a Jew to admit Jesus was really the Messiah. The fact that it was a scandal for any normal Jew of Paul’s time truly indicates that no one had ever thought about a suffering Messiah prior to the Resurrection of Jesus. On Good Friday, you can bet your house that even Jesus’ closest friends were thinking he was not the true Messiah of Israel since it was a SCANDAL for any Jew of that time to think the Messiah could end up like that (dying on a cross like a criminal)!

By meditating of what this mean, you should come to the same conclusion as me, i.e. That, up until the Resurrection, no Jew (including all the prophets) had any idea about a suffering Messiah! And even after the death and Resurrection of Jesus, most Jews stayed in their closed minded set, which did not allow them to come to the truth about Jesus and his mission, which was to reveal the true face of God who is merficul love and nothing else and his plan of universal salvation for, not only all mankind, but all the other living creatures he created with love. The simple fact that this idea of a suffering Messiah who died on the cross was a scandal for any normal Jew of St Paul’s time should give you a great clue about the fact that I’m right about that: no ancient prophet had Jesus in mind when they wrote. Most of them (if not all of them) had the suffering of the Jewish people in mind, which was not a suffering that would happen in the future, but that happened in the past and that was still present at the time they wrote their books! All these texts were meant to give hope to the people and, a lot of time, also to lead them to repentance… This doesn’t mean we can’t read these texts and associate the suffering of the Jewish people with the suffering of Christ, but that’s not something obligatory. Many Christians (and I include myself in that group) do not need these ancient texts for their faith and their hope. The New Testament is enough for them..","date":"2015-07-23","mins":"9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah"},{"id":"comment-206099","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Isaiah’ suffering servant is a good example of what I told in my previous comment, which is that the “prophet” was in fact talking about an event that already had happened before he wrote his text, which is the suffering of the Jewish people deported from Palestine to Babylon! In Isaiah’s mind, you can be sure that never he was referring to a Messiah named Jesus who would come many centuries later to take the suffering of the world on his shoulders. It is the first Christian communities who desperately wanted to link Jesus with some texts of the Old Testament to comnfort their belief that he was truly the Messiah. Nevertheless, as I also said, that doesn’t mean that, as Christians, we cannot used those ancient texts for our meditation about the sacrifice of Christ. Note: I use the word “sacrifice” in the sense of someone who’s ready, like Jesus was, to sacrifice his life in order to remain faithful to the truth he wanted to reveal to all people, i.e. That God is merciful love and nothing else… I will NEVER used that word like many Christian do (wrongly and sadly in my opinion) in the pure sacrificial sense, like the sacrifice of animals in the Temple by the Jews. Never because if Jesus’ sacrifice would have been like this, that would mean he would have make a deal with God in our place for our salvation, which would have been a purely commercial deal that would be totally contrary to real love! By the way, I believe that this is the true and profound meaning of Jesus’ chasing of the money changers in the Temple: God is pure love and nothing else and, therefore, he don’t do any kind of commercial deal with anyone! His love and mercy are FREE! No more sacrifice (in the sacrificial sense) is needed no more! The only thing that is truly necessary on our part is to simply recognize our state or poor sinner and, at the same time (one must go with the other), to recognize our deep need to be unconditionally loved and saved by God! Jesus’ “sacrifice” on the cross is the guaranty of this unconditional love and salvation that God reserve for everyone of his beloved children!.","date":"2015-07-18","mins":"4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah"},{"id":"comment-206043","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What is very important to understand is the fact that many of the Old Testament quotes Andy gave us in his paper did not concerns originally the Messiah but the whole Jewish people who had been deported in Babylon! Even though these lines seem to refer to only one individual, they were just images that refer to all the Jews who had been deported and who were suffering from this event. It’s pretty much like all the parables of Jesus who talks about one single character, while in truth, this anonymous character was referring to every human being that ever lived on this planet! In reality, it is the first Christian communities who stretched these lines from the Old Testament in order to link them directly to Jesus; all this in a great effort to make believe that all that was concerning Jesus of Nazareth (especially his Passion, death and Resurrection, along with things like his birth) had already been described by the ancient Jewish prophets of the Old Testament… Every biblical expert who is not biased will tell you this is a FACT. Important note: That doesn’t mean these lines from the Old Testament cannot be linked with Jesus and his actions in a symbolical way, but it’s important to understand that every Jews from Jesus time (starting with all the Jewish religious leaders and all the specialist of the Jewish scripture) never understood these lines as referring to him personally, because they knew perfectly that they were first and foremost talking about the suffering of the Jewish people who had been deported in Babylon a long time before Jesus’ birth. Believing that all these lines were originally intent to describe the Messiah is simply wrong… Last comment: In his paper, Andy talks about the nailing of the wrist of the Shroud man and made an error… He describe the nailing in the way Zugibe believed it to have been done, which would have started from the bottom of the palm and ended in the wrist area, through a space between the bones that Zugibe called as the “Z” space and not the Destot space. The nailing through Destot space was originally described by Doctor Barbet (and not Zugibe who was against this idea) and this would involve a nailing that would be done solely and completely through the wrist area without involving any nailing at the bottom of the palm like Zugibe described it in his hypothesis (which I do not believe for one second).

Some believed he would be a new King David. Some believed he would be a new Moses. Some believed he would be a sort of “super” high priest. But no one ever thought he would be a humble carpenter from Galilee who would be rejected by the Jewish leaders, who would died at the hands of the Romans (what a shame for a Jew!) and who would resurrect later on to only appear to his closest friends! To me, this historical fact that Jesus was very different from any Messiah the Jews of the Old Testament (including the prophets) and even the Jews of his time had in mind is one of the strongest argument against the idea that some people could have build up a story like that during the First Century. We just have to note another historical fact to be convinced: the majority of the Jews did not accept Jesus Christ as the true Messiah and never became Christians! All these facts tell me that the story of Jesus of Nazareth is not a fairy tale invented by some Jews during the First Century because they were tired to wait for the Messiah! Of course, that doesn’t mean they really saw Jesus alive after his death, but to me, that means that they didn’t invent anything and that they were truly and honestly convinced to have seen him again after his death, even though he was looking different. Could there have been a sort of “error on the person” on their part at that moment? Possible, but for me, this hypothesis is far less credible than to think that the whole story of Jesus Passion, death and Resurrection is really true and was reported by people who were the first ones surprised by these events! In sum, the story of Jesus Passion, death and Resurrection that is at the heart of every book in the New Testament is not the kind of story that could have been made up by some Jews of the First Century because no one at that time had ever thought about a Messiah like that, even those who knew the scriptures real well, including all the books of the prophets!.","date":"2015-07-20","mins":"7:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah"},{"id":"comment-163573","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Even if I highly respect Mr. Freeman for his professional contribution in debunking of the Mandylion propaganda of Wilson, Scavone and cie., I think he miss the target concerning the authenticity of the Shroud.

The most obvious and important is this: From the Acts of Thaddeus, the very text in which we found the “tetradiplon” word (6th Century), up until the 12th Century (including Robert de Clari’s eyewitness testimony), there are numerous texts that make a clear distinction between the Image of Edessa (or Mandylion) and the burial cloth(s) of Christ and I’m not aware of any ancient text (not one!) that refers to the Image of Edessa (or Mandylion) as being a burial cloth that would have been used for Jesus entombment. And if this isn’t enough for you, I suggest you to read once again my paper about this topic: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/clc3a9ment questions about the mandylion hypothesis of wilson 2012 06 28.pdf I also suggest you to read carefully the long personal note I have written concerning quote #70 of my paper about Rogers’ work: http://www.holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/2014 06 29 yannick clement reflections on ray rogers shroud work.pdf Make no mistake about it: I would like the Mandylion to be the Shroud folded in 8, because that would answer a lot of questions concerning the Shroud’s obscure past, but in face of all the known data available for anyone’s interested by the topic, I simply cannot accept such a wrong hypothesis. And here’s what I said in another place: I want to conclude this comment by saying that, nevertheless, to me, and based on the surviving copies of the Mandylion, I think that this false relic (which was certainly a painted portrait of the face of the living Christ) that appeared sometimes during the Fifth Century A.D. In Edessa (and which was considered and presented as a painted portrait of the face of the living Christ back then) is another interesting piece of evidence, along with the Pantocrator icons (which started to appear at the very beginning of the Sixth Century A.D.), to think that, at that time (probably during the second half of the Fifth Century A.D.), there were at least some members of the Byzantine Church who were aware of the presence in the Middle East of a Shroud of Christ bearing his body image, which leads them to produce some religious artworks of the face of the living Christ based on the facial image of that Shroud (like the Mandylion, the Pantocrator icons and most probably some others artworks like the Image of Kamouliana) in order to consolidate their power over the crowds and also to help them to fight against what they considered to be heretical movements in that region (which were numerous and flourishing at that time). When I say this, there are always some skeptics (mostly partisans of Wilson’s ludicrous ideas) to ask me why then there is no artworks from that period showing a bloody and beaten Christ like we see on the Shroud if that Shroud was at the origin of all these religious artworks. My answer is always the same : it’s simply due to the fact that, at that time and in that part of the world, it would have been a total scandal for the crowds to venerate that kind of suffering Christ… Effectively, it is a known historical fact that the first depictions of a suffering Christ only appeared many centuries after that time, at a moment in history when these kinds of artworks had become slowly « acceptable » for the Christians. That’s probably the main reason why there is no solid testimony of any public exhibition of a body image of Christ that would have been present on his burial shroud prior to the one given by Robert de Clari who, in 1203 in Constantinople (some months before the sack of the city), saw with his own eyes not only this particular Shroud, but also the body image that was on it in a public exhibition done at the Church of Our Lady of Blachernes. De Clari said that this Shroud was shown there every Friday (most probably in reference to Holy Friday) in that Church. Personally, I would not be surprise at all if that weekly public exhibition of that particular Shroud was the very first one in history. If that’s true, this would help understanding why there are no ancient sources that makes a direct and clear reference to the presence of a Shroud of Christ bearing a body image and/or bloodstains on it prior to the testimony of Robert de Clari… The inner part of the Shroud of Turin (which shows his body image and bloodstains that are much more evident) would simply haven’t been publicly showed before that era, which was a time of great trouble in Constantinople, with the Latin crusaders surrounding and threatening the imperial city. It’s interesting to note that it’s also around that time that we see appearing the first known depictions of a suffering Christ like, for example, the Man of Sorrows or the epitaphios icons. Of course, this last statement of mine is a simple assumption, but an assumption based on solid historical facts (i.e. The fact that, prior to Robert de Clari’s testimony, there is absolutely none who talks specifically of a Shroud of Christ bearing a body image and/or bloodstains on it, along with the fact that this is around that same time that we see appearing some artworks showing a suffering Christ). Because of this, that kind of assumption is not what we can call « wild » assumption, on the contrary to a bunch of others that we find in the « Tomb of Christ » documentary or many others that have been made in recent years in order to make believe the Shroud was present in some particular cities of the Middle East (like Antioch for example) or that it was truly the Mandylion folded in 8 parts… These are assumptions that do not rest on serious archaeological findings or serious ancient testimonies, but much more on the wild imagination of those who publicly propose them. Taking this into account, it’s not at all surprising to note that none of these proposals have been accepted by the vast majority of the international scientific community….","date":"2014-10-28","mins":"10:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/28/dan-scavone-responds-to-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"Dan Scavone Responds to an Earlier Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"id":"comment-166601","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Message to O.K. : focussing on that kind of religious sermon (which was obviously full of theological imageries instead of being a close physical description of the relic), while putting aside all the very solid pieces of evidence showing that the Mandylion was not a burial cloth used during the emtombment of Jesus is the same bad way to analyze a subject than focussing only on the highly questionable C14 dating of 88, while leaving aside all the good pieces of evidence showing that the Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified man looking like Christ of the Gospels….","date":"2014-10-29","mins":"1:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/28/dan-scavone-responds-to-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"Dan Scavone Responds to an Earlier Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"id":"comment-206469","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “Furthermore we have never seen a piece of linen cloth had an printed image similar to the Shroud of Turin, from a wrapped body of a living person.” Personal comment: That’s precisely why me and some other researchers suspect the body image to have been formed by “something” that was in direct link with the dead nature of the Shroud man’s body. And I go further by thinking the link was not just with the dead nature of the body, but also (and maybe far more) with the highly traumatized nature of that body… If the Shroud is authentic (I believe so), then I agree that this would be the first scientific proof we got that Jesus really died on the cross.

In fact, since he used alternative methods of dating instead of the well accepted C14 method, it’s fair to say that his results are even more suspicious than the C14 test of 88 in regard of their potential accuracy. And I think it’s time for a short summary of the situation regarding his claims that he was able to prove that the Shroud really dates back to the time of Christ and, consequently, that it is truly the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth: 1 The tiny fragments of broken fibers he used as samples for his dating tests are highly questionable regarding the possibility that they can really be representative of the main body of the cloth (and so, no matter if they really came from the Shroud itself or from another linen fabric). 2 The 3 alternative method of dating he used are highly questionable regarding their potential of given a very accurate result for the age of the Shroud. 3 The fact that he “adjust” the result concerning the first method he used while not doing the same adjustment for the other 2 methods he also used is highly questionable and show some evidence of bias in favor of the authenticity of the Shroud. 4 On a more general point of view, Fanti’s own credibility as an unbiased scientist free of any preconceived notions regarding Shroud research is highly questionable since the day he enter into the Shroud world (and the highly questionable aspect of his integrity as just grown and grown bigger along the years). Now folks, it’s up to you to freely decide if you want to trust the claims he made in his book or not.

In fact, I just had to take good note of the kind of “science” contained in one of his first papers about the Shroud (entitled “Does the Shroud body image show any physical evidence of Resurrection” that he wrote with Kevin Moran) to know all about him! From that day until now, I knew I couldn’t trust any conclusion that was coming from that guy. Look, after a long personal reflection, I became convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud (for various reasons put together as a whole), but I will never back up my belief on any claim coming from someone like Fanti.

Since these fibers were not part of the Shroud anymore when Riggi collect them (or if they did, they were the most fragile and altered fibers at the surface of the cloth), it is evident that such a questionable material cannot be taken as representative of the main body of the Shroud! We’re dealing here with the same kind of important problem related to the C14 dating of 1988, never mind the fact that Fanti’s alternative methods are much more questionable concerning their level of accuracy than the C14 dating method, which is still considered today as THE dating method for this kind of task. In the end, I think it’s safe to say that Fanti’s claims regarding the dating of the Shroud will forever stay in the roam of anecdotal evidences regarding this relic (these kind of evidences surely need a proper scientific confirmation in order to be taken as authentic “facts” and right now, that kind of confirmation is still waiting). So, until a real solid confirmation can come to back up these claims, I’m afraid Fanti’s conclusions will never be taken very seriously by the International scientific community… Finally, I was glad to learn the manipulation made by Fanti for the first series of dating he made, which first came out much too old for the Shroud to be the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ. The simple fact that he corrected this result on the questionable base that the fire of 1532 had a deep impact on the fibers, while leaving the other two results obtained by his 2 other methods says a lot about the poor quality of Fanti’s science, the evident religious bias that drive his work (he wanted the Shroud to date from the first century A.D. Even before he begin his analyses of Riggi’s samples) and, consequently, the highly questionable aspect of his professional integrity regarding this relic. Truly, Shroud science don’t need guys like Fanti, who only contribute, as the years goes by, to discredit even more its integrity and validity in the eyes of the International scientific community, who generally look at it as a sick joke.

So, we must be really prudent with all these potential images and never claim that their presence is a FACT and/or a proof of the authenticity of the Shroud… I think there’s many other real proven facts that exist and who are better proofs of the authenticity of the relic… In my opinion, when it comes to analysing the Shroud, we must focus on these facts way before the potential images on the cloth. And, to finish, here’s what Ray Rogers wrote on this subject, in his book “A chemist’s perspective on the Shroud of Turin” : “Lateral neutral inhibition : Many observers look at the image for such a long time that they begin to see things that others do not. They attempt to use these observations to prove the resurrection of Jesus or some other belief. The ability to see structure in amorphous bodies is responsible for our ability to see figures in the clouds. Physiologically, the effect is explained in terms of lateral neutral inhibition : the human eye enhances edge contrasts. The mind plays games with what we think we see. Some devoted observers see images of flowers, teeth, bones, etc. On the Shroud. A statement like “I think I see” is totally unacceptable in a scientific discussion. These images are sometimes best seen after multiple contrast enhancements reduce the image to a pattern of dots.” As I say, until chemical tests will be done on theses parts of the Shroud where there is potential images, let’s focus our attention on the many proven facts that are well accepted today. The main one for me is the fact that there is really human blood on the Shroud and, more than this, it is bloody material coming from the clothed wounds of someone who’ve been tortured and who died… Putting this piece of evidence (a proven fact !) along with the body images we see on the cloth and there’s a good probability that this cloth is really a real Shroud of someone who’ve been tortured and died exactly like what is reported about Christ in the Gospels ! And this good probability don’t need supposed images of flowers or anything else to exist ! That’s what I think….","date":"2011-07-19","mins":"8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/06/13/david-rolfe-interview-with-avinoam-danin-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"David Rolfe Interview with Avinoam Danin on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-3363","author":"yannick_clément","post":"My last comment was more directed toward M.

I think the evidence of the bloodstains is always forgotten, every time someone proposed the idea that the Shroud was created by a medieval forger using some kind of artistic technique… It’s sad because that prove one thing : those people didn’t make a full and proper research on the subject before talking. Here, of course, I’m not talking about Kirsten who simply asked the question. I talk about all the Craig, Breese, Allen, Nickell and Garlaschelli of this world, along with those who support their work !!! And what’s important to note about my comment is that I just used the most evident proof (the evidence of the bloodstains) that the Shroud was not created by an artist ! Effectively, I could add many other facts about the body images themselves or about the fact that all the bloodstains acted in a proper forensic way for someone who died in an upward position, but I think it’s unnecessary… The lone fact that the blood on the Shroud is real blood and that this blood come from exudates of traumatic blood clots is well enough to understand that this relic is a real burial shroud of a real crucified man. Simply look at EVERY attempt of reproducing the Shroud with some kind of artistic technique and look at the blood they created ! The fact is that there is none of them who created the bloodstains with any kind of forensic credibility and none of them can proclaim their bloodstains are a perfect match with the bloodstains on the Shroud ! In reality, history tell us that the bloodstains on the Shroud are even harder to recreated than the body images ! Yes, in the sense that some artistic technique (i.e. The rubbing technique used by Garlaschelli) can produce a body image with some kind of resemblance with the Shroud body images, what I just said is true. Of course, nobody has been able to recreate perfectly the body image on the Shroud but this is even more true regarding the bloodstains !!! Why ? Simply because of the fact that those stains came from a direct contact between a linen shroud and a beaten, scourged and crucified body (who had wear a cap of thorns shortly before being put in the shroud). Now, for the question of authenticity versus Jesus of Nazareth, it’s another story, but even then, the odds are overwhelming in favor of the authenticity of the cloth. But in this case (i.e, the question of whether or not this is Jesus burial cloth), unlike the question of whether or not this is an authentic burial shroud of someone (science can say a definitive yes to that question), I have to honestly admit that science is not able (and I think science will never be able) to state categorically (without any doubt whatsoever) that this burial shroud was the real burial shroud of Jesus. It will always be a question of probabilities. In fact, the only thing science could proclaim one day is that this cloth was not the one of Jesus. And this could only happen if, one day in the future, new and solid evidence really prove that this cloth is not at least 2000 years old. But personally, having read all the important facts regarding this burial shroud, I think the chances for that to happen are EXTREMELY low (I would guess something below 1%). So, I’ll say it again : You can forget any hypothesis that involved some kind of artistic technique. This is not the road to follow if you really seek the truth. After all the evidence in support of the fact that the Shroud is a real burial shroud of someone, I just can’t believe that there is still people who believe it is some kind of artwork ! Incredible… That’s the word !!! P.S. : In addition to all the arguments I bring forward in my open letter about the bloodstains, there’s 2 important facts I should have mentioned : 1 Around most bloodstains on the Shroud, there is a clear liquid stain that had been proved to be made of serum coming from a blood clot. How in the world an artist could have created those stains that are only visible under UV light ? You can forget about that nonsense right now !!! 2 Under the bloodstains and even under the serum stains, there is NO body image, proving that the blood and the serum come first on the cloth and only after that, the body image was formed. In any case involving some kind of artistic technique, it’s precisely the opposite that happens. Yes, EVERYTIME, the artist would put the body image first, and then he would add the bloodstains. The opposite of that (like we see on the Shroud) goes against any known artistic method that could have been used to created a relic of the same nature than the Shroud..","date":"2012-05-05","mins":"6:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/18/did-a-medieval-artist-use-emily-craigs-technique-to-create-the-shrouds-image/","cat":"books","title":"Did a medieval artist use Emily Craig’s technique to create the Shroud’s image?"},{"id":"comment-16981","author":"yannick_clément","post":"It’s NEVER all white or all black in the life of any human being.

Thanks for you good words versus my comment. You wrote that you still disagree with my conclusion. In fact, it is not my own little conclusion but the one written in 1969 by the historian Maurus Green !!! Here it is again : “Until Wilson can PROVE his case, it seems PRUDENT to think of the Edessan Image and the Shroud as TWO DISTINCT THINGS, while noting the close connection between them.” Personally, after a very long and extensive research of every ancient sources that talks about the Mandylion, the Abgar legend and/or the Shroud of Christ, I firmly believe that this conclusion is still 100% correct ! After all those years, I think it’s fair to say that Wilson has never been able to PROVE his hypothesis in a correct scientific way. Sorry but you cannot consider some speculative arguments as being real scientific PROOFS. So, since Wilson have failed to prove his case, I say (with Maurus Green and many other historians) : Please, in regard of all the ancient sources, if we want to stay scientificaly correct, we must consider the Mandylion and the Shroud like 2 different objects with a probable connection that exist between them. But it’s one thing to think there’s a relation between the 2 objects (the Vignon’s markings are a good evidence of that connection) and it’s another thing to believe they are one and the same !!! The reality is this : There’s not a single authentic and solid fact that can prove this assertion from Wilson… Until he can find one solid FACT to really prove his case (and not just some extrapolations or speculations), I think it’s scientificaly right to consider the Mandylion as a different relic than the Shroud. And here’s my good question again : If this was really the case, WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL WITH THIS ??? That doesn’t mean the Shroud isn’t authentic at all !!! I really think that nobody here should fear that Wilson hypothesis have some good chances to be wrong… I don’t see any problem with that possibility versus the authenticity of the Shroud. In fact, other hypothesis (like the one by Vignon) can be more viable in regard of the historical and religious context of the time….","date":"2012-03-08","mins":"12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/even-more-on-archaeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Even more on Archaeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"id":"comment-9045","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote from Ron : “that the Mariamne ossuary is that of Mary Magdelane…pure conjecture!” Here’s what I want to say about that : This is exactly like the idea that the word “tetradiplon” MUST mean a burial shroud of more than 4 meters long !!! : ) THIS IS PURE CONJECTURE TOO !!! Unfortunately, unlike the lost tomb of Jesus hypothesis, since this hypothesis made by Wilson is pro authenticity, everyone here seems to put aside his critical judgment when it comes the time to analyze it… The best conclusion I’ve ever read about the Mandylion hypothesis was written in 1969 by Maurus Green, an historian and a Benedictine monk. Here it is : “The difficulty of Wilson’s thesis is the question whether the Image was of the head only, as it appears in art, or whether it did indeed bear a full length, though secret, image of the whole body of Christ, a secret that escaped somehow to form the “full length” tradition we have just examined. If Wilson CAN prove his case, we will not only have solved the mystery of the Turin Shroud’s whereabouts during the first millennium, we will also have a most remarkable account of its by no means inconsiderable place in Byzantine history. Until he can do so, it seems PRUDENT to think of the Edessan Image and the Shroud as TWO DISTINCT THINGS, while noting the close connection between them.” Sorry folks but if you’re honest like me, you must say that the last part of Green’s conclusion is still true !!! Effectively, Wilson hasn’t been able to show us a clear proof to scientifically comfort his hypothesis. All he has been able to do until this day is to bring many highly speculative (and partial) arguments that come mainly from theological and legendary sources. And the problem is this : there will ALWAYS be some serious doubts about the reliability of those kind of sources when it comes to find a real physical description of a relic. Sorry but those things that were put forward by Wilson (like the “tetradiplon” term) are not what we can call “scientific proofs”… A real solid scientific proof would be to find an ancient text, ideally written by an eye witness, that makes a clear link between the Mandylion of Edessa and/or the Abgar legend and a burial Shroud of Christ (or, at least, with some burial cloth). It’s maybe sad for some people, but the there is absolutely no such thing in any ancient sources that exist. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ! In fact, the reality is precisely the opposite ! Effectively, there exist a whole bunch of evidences coming from many ancient documentary and artistic sources (often written or done by some eye witnesses) that just goes completely AGAINST the hypothesis of Wilson ! Here’s just an example of that : Dating from the 11th or the 12th century, there is a liturgical book of the Byzantine Church named “Synaxarion”. This was a book that told the story of the life of many Saints and Martyrs. Remind that this was written many years after the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople, at a time when, according to Wilson, the real burial aspect of the cloth had already been discovered. In this book, we find a version of the Abgar legend that is mainly traditional, i.e. That tell the story of the formation of the image of ONLY the face of Christ BEFORE his Passion, during his minister. In other word, in this book, there is absolutely no chance that the author could refer to the Mandylion as a burial shroud and there’s absolutely no chance that he refer to a full body image ! And the most important thing about this Synaxarion book, is the intro of the part where the author talk about the Abgar legend. Here’s what we can read : “In life, you wiped your form onto a linen cloth. In death, you were placed in the final linen shroud. A manmade tile bears your form, not made by human hands, my Christ, creator of all.” You see ??? The author of this official document from the Byzantine Church makes a clear distinction between the Mandylion and the Shroud as two separate objects. Even more, he makes a clear distinction between the Mandylion, the Shroud and also the Keramion, which is a tile that, according to the “Narratio de Edessena” version of the Abgar legend, showed the same image than the Mandylion (i.e. Only the face of Christ). And clear distinctions like that between the Mandylion, the Shroud and the Keramion exists in many other ancient documents, like the manuscript of Nicolas Mesarites, who was, in 1201, the guardian of the relics of Christ in the Pharos chapel and the manuscript of Robert de Clari, who visited the Pharos chapel in 1203. Note folks that those 2 manuscripts came from eye witnesses and have not a legendary or theological style ! In summary, since Wilson hasn’t been able to find one real solid scientific proof for his hypothesis (this is the reality and I don’t make this up), we should conclude the same thing than Green, i.e. That the Mandylion and the Shroud were two distinct things, even if a close connection surely exist between them. This conclusion come from a real historian and his “grounded” and “prudent” as it should be. This is a perfect example of what I call “good science” !!! Even if Green, in his 1969 article, was interested by the hypothesis of Wilson, he was professional enough not to give him a blank check !!! On the contrary to many pro Shroud people, we cannot say that Green was “blinded” by Wilson and, on this point, I can add : AS IT SHOULD BE in regard of all the ancient documentary and artistic sources we have !!! Unfortunately, this was not the case with some other historians later on… And, for the close connection that surely exist between the Mandylion and the Shroud, I think the hypothesis of Paul Vignon is, by far, the best we have to explain it, i.e. That the Mandylion was a false relic of a living Christ (without any injuries) made during the 6th century by the Byzantine Church in order to fight the Monophysitism heresy. In this scenario, the Shroud image would have been the primary source for the creation of the Mandylion and the Church would have act like that, simply because the Shroud, with a naked Christ and all the blood on it, would have been considered as scandalous by most faithful of that time (I think the best term would be “religiously incorrect” for that period of time). Of course, this is only an hypothesis, but, in regard of all the ancient sources and in regard of the historical and religious context of that time, I really think it is the most likely hypothesis we have that can explain both the connection of the Mandylion and the Shroud AND also the fact that there is not much record of a burial Shroud of Christ in ancient sources before the 11th century in Constantinople… I have nothing more to say about that !!!.","date":"2012-03-07","mins":"4:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/even-more-on-archaeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Even more on Archaeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"id":"comment-8898","author":"yannick_clément","post":"It’s interesting to note how much everyone here is ready to condemn the hypothesis of the lost tomb of Jesus and, at the same time, is willing to do anything he can to defend the hypothesis of Wilson versus the Mandylion !

But we must say that there is some powerful evidence for a very ancient origin for the Shroud and a Palestinian root. First, there was the estimation made by Roger with the Vanilin level and he came to an estimate age for the cloth between 1300 and 3000 years old. In other word, for Rogers, the cloth was much more older than the C14 result and it could well be old enough for a 1st century age. And secondly, there was this interesting finding made by Mechtild Flury Lemberg of a very particular kind of seam that link the main part of the Shroud with the side strip. As an ancient textile expert, Madam Flury Lemberg state that she never saw this kind of seam before, except once in some remains of jewish cloths from the Massada Fortress. Those pieces of cloth were dated from the 1st century and since they were jewish cloths, we can see a great clue there with the kind of seam that was used. In the context of the Shroud, since there is also a seam like that and that this kind of seam is very unusual, we can use this clue to say that seam on the Shroud was probably made in Palestine around the 1st century. And since it was proven by the STURP team that the side strip and the main part of the Shroud came from the same manufactured cloth and the 2 pieces were probably sewing together shortly after they were cut (for an unknown reason), we can deduced that cloth manufactured period is roughly the same as the age of the seam. For me, it’s one important clue that link the Shroud with a 1st century Palestinian origin. So, those 2 clues are well enough to at least guess that the Shroud is a cloth from the 1st century, probably made in Palestine. Of course, another C14 test properly done would be needed to confirm this possibility… Unfortunatelly, I don’t think we will have a definitive answer on that soon..","date":"2011-12-14","mins":"11:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/14/forensic-chemistry-handbook-an-embarrassingly-unscientific-chapter/","cat":"books","title":"Forensic Chemistry Handbook: An Embarrassingly Unscientific Chapter"},{"id":"comment-5587","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I respect what you believe Ron but I disagree completely with you on that point.

If you read again the gospel of the doubting Thomas, the profound message of this story is not to congratulate Thomas for is lack of faith ! It was writen to congratulate and encourage those who believe without seeing Jesus. Jesus said that to Thomas (blessed are those who believe without seeing) because he knew that he wouldn’t stay on earth no more to be seen by people and that we, the faithful, would need to believe without really seeing him. That’s what we call faith. The Shroud, as a sign of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus is a sign that point to him and his message of salvation and nothing else. But I repeat, we need faith to see the sign… For someone who doesn’t believe in Christ, the Shroud is a fake, or maybe the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth and nothing else. They’re not able to see the sign that we can see as believers.

God doesn’t want his children to be forced to believe in him because of some kind of proofs. God want his children to be FREE, even if that meant many of them will reject him (on earth).

Of course, it is true only from a faithful perspective but, nevertheless, I think we should try to capture the very essence of the message that the Shroud have to tell. And this message, to me, is simply this : God is love. Since the Shroud confirm the gospel accounts for the Passion and death of Christ, I don’t see why it cannot confirm, at least to a certain point, the heart of the message of Christ which is that God is love and God loves everyone of his children. When you look at the images on the Shroud, it’s hard to accuse God of being insensible to the suffering of his children or to see him like a big judge of the universe who just wait to throw every infidels in hell ! I think the message of the Shroud is far more important for mankind than to know what really was the image formation process. But, of course, I don’t deny that this question should be explore more and more… But, I think we, the christians, have more to gain by searching the profound message of love hidden in those bloody and body images than just to focus on the image formation process.

And concerning your objection, I think you forgot Rogers’ hypothesis for the chromophore… In the case of the Shroud image and unlike what have been seen in images of flowers and leaves, the non penetration of the color deep into the cloth or deep into the fiber structure is maybe due only to the fact that the image formation phenomenon was very mild and, for this reason, was only able to affect the thin layer of carbohydrate impurities proposed by Rogers, without ever affecting the fibers themselves. And concerning Mike’s objection, let me remind you that De Salvo have proposed that, in the case of the Shroud, the image formation process could have acted by both direct contacts and also transfer of lactic acid molecules at short distance (maybe transferred to the cloth’s surface with the possible water vapor released by the corpse?)… Of course, this is only a theoretical supposition that would need to be tested one day under good lab control. Talking about that, here’s a response I just get from John De Salvo himself, after I send him an email asking him why he never had the chance to verify his hypothesis properly under good lab control despite the fact that he was planning to do so shortly after having published his article (concerning this, please look at this comment of mine: https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/26/giulio fantis book launched/#comment 83449).

In other words, even if the Shroud is really the one of Jesus and if Jesus is really resurrected, these 2 facts should not lead anyone to assume that the image must automatically have been directly caused by this supernatural event. This is the kind of direct link that we must avoid to do if we want to stay honest and scientifically sound. But having said that, I also want to say that it is possible to think that the disappearance (maybe supernatural) of the body from Inside the Shroud before the apparition of the first liquid of putrefaction have been an important factor for the image formation, in the sense that it prevent the complete destruction of the image by those liquids and it maybe prevent a total blur of the image by stopping the release of a low amount of energy “at the right time”. In other words, maybe if the corpse would have stayed in contact with the Shroud for 12 or 24 more hours than it really did, maybe the resulting image would not have been visible at all or would have been completely saturated with no contrast.

It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” It’s not me who said these words, it is an expert in radiation who is also one of the only chemist in the world to have studied the Shroud first hand….","date":"2012-12-25","mins":"11:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is-it-absurd-to-think-that-the-shroud-can-show-a-physical-trace-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","title":"Is it absurd to think that the Shroud can show a physical trace of the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-20913","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Just to make sure everyone understand me well, here’s my updated statement: I would agree with this statement if it would be change for this: “the Turin Shroud is the single most badly studied artifact in RECENT history, in fact, since the last paper that was published by STURP in the 1980s.”.","date":"2012-12-21","mins":"11:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is-it-absurd-to-think-that-the-shroud-can-show-a-physical-trace-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","title":"Is it absurd to think that the Shroud can show a physical trace of the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-21113","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Paul, I think you should be interested to read this comment of mine: https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is it absurd to think that the shroud can show a physical trace of the resurrection/#comment 21112 Don’t forget that the Shroud is most probably much more a relic of the Incarnation and of the Passion than a relic of the Resurrection. This is my feeling and this was also the feeling of Father Rinaldi, of Ray Rogers, of Paul Vignon, of Pierre Barbet, of Antoine Legrand, of Frederick Zugibe, of Pierluigi Baima Bollone, etc., etc… Of course, you’re free to believe otherwise. The idea that the body was not unwrapped comes mainly from the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains and the apparent lack of broken fibers in the bloodstained regions. This is only a sign of the Resurrection that can be seen with the eyes of faith and this can never be considered as a physical proof of that spiritual event. It’s important to understand that difference. But, as I often say, the only fact that such a bloodstained and gruesome burial cloth has been kept and well preserved until this day is the most compelling sign of Jesus Resurrection regarding the Shroud… It shows that if this cloth is really the authentic burial cloth of Jesus, someone was so convinced that he was resurrected that he dared to kept and preserved this disguting piece of cloth, even if it was against the Jewish law to touch anything that was in contact with a dead body.

In fact, you’ll see in this book that the image of the hair is in fact much more problematic in the context of an image formation process that would involved any kind of energetic radiation!

Last year, I know he published a controversial paper in which he tried to bring together the hypothesis of the Maillard reaction, the hypothesis of Jackson concerning the suddent disappearence of the body and the hypothesis of Fanti concerning Corona discharge. And his idea is that at the moment of the spiritualization of Jesus body, the disappearence of his body caused something like an electrostatic discharge that could have been part of the image formation, along with the Maillard reaction. BUT there’s a big problem with this particular hypothesis… If Rogers is right about the chromophore (and as I said, I don’t see any good reason to doubt that), it is almost impossible for such a discharge to color ONLY the layer of impurities like it is (most probably) on the Shroud. And that’s the same thing for any other sort of energetic radiation. So, personally, I really think Carreira’s idea is incorrect versus the Shroud and in the end, incorrect also versus the official theology of the Church because if his idea was good, that would mean there really is a trace of the Resurrection on the Shroud and that doesn’t fit with the official teaching of the Church. Think about it ! Why the Resurrected Christ will make a big reproach to the lack of faith of Thomas and was, during his lifetime, constantly amazed by the faith of those who had such faith in God (without proof) and at the same time, left us some kind of physical proof of his Resurrection (which was a spiritual event involving the entrence of his physical body into the spiritual world) on a linen cloth?

I think it’s the only way someone could reproduced the Shroud image with some high level of concordance and even then, I’m not so sure the image you would get on the cloth would be very close to what’s on the Shroud. Maybe yes, maybe not. There’s so many unknown factors regarding the suffering, death and burial of the Shroud man that it would need an incredible luck to reproduced them all. But I’m sure of one thing: After 36 40 hours, you would get an image on the cloth and at least part of this image would have been caused by a Maillard reaction coming from post mortem gases (especially ammoniac)… And Dave (and anyone else who will read this), I think you should read again this great quote from Father Rinaldi’s 1934 paper, which says it all: “We will observe with Doctor Barnes that to reproduce the conditions of the crucifixion is OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE.” This is so true ! People around here don’t seem to understand this BASIC FACT that explain why no one has ever been able to reproduced the Shroud image with a very good level of concordance. And as Ray Rogers wrote in his book: “If image color is not simply a result of color formation in the cellulose of the linen fibers, image formation must be a much more complex process than we originally thought.” That’s another very good reason why no one have succeed to reproduced the Shroud image with a high level of concordance. But as I also said the other day, if the chromophore of the image is really what Rogers postulated, then he has at least succeed to reproduced the same kind of coloration on a small piece of linen that had been made with the ancient technique of making linen cloths.

By saying this, you prove you don’t understand the great scientific importance of this fact or you don’t want to see it. In reality, this is the most crucial aspect of all the experiments ever made with energetic radiation regarding the Shroud’s image! If Rogers conclusion is correct versus the image chromophore, and right now, I don’t see any good reason to doubt it, that mean all the hypotheses involving any sort of radiation (even those related to earthquakes) are INCONSISTENT with the Shroud’s image! We must look at these hypotheses as being unable to explain the Shroud’s image, in pretty much the same manner than all the artistic hypotheses (paint, scorch, rubbing, medieval photograph, etc.), EXCEPT for one thing: the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the image chromophore (i.e. Only located in a thin layer of impurities and NOTHING ELSE) still wait for a scientific confirmation. But as I said, right now, we must consider this hypothesis as being probably right, especially in the light of the observations made by Adler and later confirmed by Rogers concerning the reduction of the color with diimide and the ghosts of color which both strongly suggest that the linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) WAS NOT AFFECTED OR COLORED AT ALL DURING THE IMAGE FORMATION PROCESS. If you prefer to put your head into the sand and not consider this highly probable scientific fact regarding the Shroud’s image in order to save your preconceive notion of what the Shroud’s image should be, it is your right but I will never follow your footsteps. If one day, Rogers hypothesis concerning the chromophore would be proven wrong by science and I would be sure that the primary cell wall of the linen fiber itself was colored, I would have no choice than to reconsider the whole issue but right now, in the present state of our knowledge, the facts don’t point into that direction. And that’s the main point I wanted to make with my letter, i.e. That all the experiments made with radiation had failed to reproduce a coloration that would reside only in a layer of impurities, which is the most probable hypothesis for image chromophore right now.

Remember the quote from Odile Celier (a French theologian in Paris) that you find in my open letter? Here it is again: ”Since science became involved (note: it is even truer since the failure of STURP to totally explain the image on the cloth, which doesn’t mean however that this image will never be naturally explained in the future), the devotion to the Shroud underwent a real mutation because it is no longer the memorial of the Lord’s Passion and death but the material witness of his Resurrection and, by doing so, the providential object called to heal this modern decease which is the decline of the Christian faith.” With this comment, I think Mrs. Celier give us a very good way to evaluate our perception of the Shroud and the level of dangerousness of such a perception for the faith of anybody. So here’s the test I suggest you to do: I would like you to look at the Shroud and let us know if what you see is mainly an image of the Passion and death of Jesus Christ or mainly an image of the Resurrected Christ… If you answer “an image of the Passion and death of Christ”, I think there are good chances that you can follow Shroud science without too much religious bias. And if you’re a Shroud researcher, I think there are good chances that you can do your scientific work without too much religious bias. But, on the contrary, if you answer “an image of the Resurrection of Jesus”, then I’m afraid that you’re on the right track to fall into the “supernatural trap” with this cloth and see Shroud science as a possible way for men to physically prove this spiritual event that is the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. I think Mrs. Celier is totally right when she said that our scientific age is responsible for the fact that a lot of good Christians have unfortunately fall into that dangerous trap (dangerous for the quality of their faith I mean). Effectively, it’s part of human nature to always tend to find clear, rational and physical answers and proofs for such a mystery… It was like that well before our modern scientific age started and since that time, it is even truer because many people wrongly think that science can explain spiritual things, which is totally irrational and even ludicrous because, by definition, science is bound to our space time material universe, which is located outside the spiritual world. As I said before, don’t you think like me that the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains on the cloth and the simple fact that such a gruesome burial cloth was taken from the tomb and well preserved until this day is well enough to understand that we can trust the testimony of the Apostles concerning the fact that Jesus is really Resurrected? These two facts concerning the Shroud are not enough for you to strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ, the Resurrected Son of God? THEY ARE FOR ME! I think if anyone (and particularly the scientists involved in Shroud research) could ends up by admitting that the image and bloodstains on the Shroud represent a dead man who look like Jesus after his Passion and death instead of the Risen Lord, then Shroud science could have some chances to get back on the right track, which is to ONLY seek the truth regarding that cloth without any preconceived religious notions and whatever this truth could be… So now it’s up to you!

Kearse comment #6 concerning the possible presence of traces of aloes and myrrh on the Shroud. M. Kearse, I agree with your scientific principle on a general sense. However, concerning the question of the possible presence of traces of aloes and myrrh on the Shroud, I have a pretty good alternative argument that strongly suggests that there was no use of such burial products in the case of the Shroud man. My argument is based on the FACT that there is absolutely no coloration on the Shroud outside the actual body image! This can be seen as a very good sign that no ancient burial products (including myrrh and aloes) were used on the Shroud and/or on the body of the Shroud man because these kinds of products can stained very easily a linen cloth! Effectively, in a paper he wrote for STURP in 1980, which is entitled Spectral Properties of the Shroud of Turin (this is a very good paper!), Samuel Pellicori describe many coloration experiments on linen he made with the most common burial products used by the ancient Jews at the time of Christ (including aloes and myrrh and also olive oil) and EACH TIME he put one of these product in contact with his linen samples, he ALWAYS got a coloration very similar to the Shroud’s image after he baked his sample to simulate aging. And he obtained such a good and visible result even when the contact was very light and subtle between these products and his linen samples! Consequently, if there would have been a spreading of such products on the cloth or if the body of the Shroud man would have been anointed with them, it’s EVIDENT that there would have been a coloration (probably looking more like a staining) of the cloth in zones that are located outside the actual body image. There’s no doubt that it’s totally irrational to assume that a spreading on the cloth could have been restricted to the area where we find the actual body image (on the dorsal part as well as the frontal part) and it’s also highly improbable that there would not have been some staining of the cloth outside the actual body image if the corpse would have been anointed with these products because we know for a fact that some parts of the body were in direct contact with many areas located outside the body image at one point during the burial! How do we know that? Because of the few bloodstains and scourge marks that are located in places where there is no body image! Since each one of these bloodstains and scourge marks must have come from a direct contact between the body and the cloth, if there would have been aloes and myrrh on the body, there would consequently have been some staining of the cloth in these areas where we can see off body image bloodstains! THIS IS PURE LOGICAL THINKING! So, to me, along with the incapacity of STURP to detect any traces of these burial products, the fact that there is no coloration on the Shroud outside the actual body image is the most important piece of evidence to conclude that, most probably, there was no use of such products during the burial of the Shroud man OR, if there really was such a use, it was exactly like Pierre Barbet thought: a mixture of aloes and myrrh in powder that would have been placed inside some smaller cloths (like bags if you will) and then placed all around the corpse inside the Shroud, for the main purpose of removing some bad odors (and also to retard the putrefaction a bit) in the prevision of a return to the tomb early Sunday morning to finish the burial rite properly with a real anointing and probably also a washing and dressing of the body. If Barbet’s hypothesis is correct, then that would explain why there is no coloration outside the actual body image and why STURP never found any traces of these products, even though they were really used during the burial (in a powder state instead of in an oily state), as it was reported in John’s Gospel. In sum, for me, the results obtained by Pellicori leaves NO DOUBT AT ALL that if there would have been direct contact between these products and the cloth (directly or indirectly via the anointed corpse), there would have been a lot of staining of the cloth in places located outside the actual body image..","date":"2012-12-18","mins":"9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is-it-absurd-to-think-that-the-shroud-can-show-a-physical-trace-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","title":"Is it absurd to think that the Shroud can show a physical trace of the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-20651","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What I wanted to emphasize is the FACT (for anyone who has eyes to see) that the image on the cloth is OBVIOUSLTY THAT OF JESUS DEAD AFTER HIS PASSION.

What I really wanted with this questioning is to make people realize that if they can see signs of the Resurrection in this image of a martyrized corpse, they are most certainly religiously biased. Why? Simply because it is obviously a statement that is 100% based on Christian faith on the Resurrected Christ and nothing else. It is effectively the case for the reason I just mentioned (i.e. That the image on the Shroud is that of a dead man who even show evident signs of rigor mortis). And because of this, this particular idea that we can see a sign or even a proof of the Resurrection on the Shroud is EVIDENTLY a religiously biased idea. IT IS AS SIMPLE AND EVIDENT AS THAT MY FRIEND. And if you don’t trust me, just ask yourself the question: Which atheist, Jew or Buddhist would see an image of the Resurrected Christ on that cloth? This is ridiculous! But on the contrary, even they would admit that this image is similar to the image of Jesus after his Passion and death! That’s the very best proof that this image is that of the dead Jesus and not the one of the Risen Lord! Meditate on that. This kind of thinking is not grave when it comes from Joe Bloe, but when it comes from a scientist who is involve in Shroud research (and believe me, there really are such persons), that’s when things got much worse! In such cases, I have no choice than to raise the red flag and say there really is an appearance of “religiously biased science” here! Shroud science doesn’t need this kind of “scientist”!

What convinced Hovelaque that Jesus was probably resurrected is the evidence coming from the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains that was described to him by Barbet!!! This is the true story and we can find it in Barbet’s book A doctor at calvary. The body image NEVER was a factor in Hovelaque’s change of mind versus the Shroud. The appearance of the bloodstains was the true factor that shook his unbelief regarding the possibility that Jesus was really resurrected! And that’s very telling because, on the contrary to the body image, the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains is the ONLY CHARACTERISTIC coming from the Shroud that really seem to be scientifically unexplainable in the context of a dead body of a crucified man that was covered by blood clots and who spend at least 24 hours or so and no more than 72 hours inside the Shroud. And this is truly something most people don’t understand versus the Shroud! It is possible to see a sign (not a proof, which is very different) of the Resurrection of Christ from this undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains because this characteristic really seem to be scientifically unexplainable (and this was not even a definitive conclusion of Barbet because he was open to the possibility that science could naturally explain this aspect of the bloodstains in the future), while this is NOT the case at all for the body image. In fact, the truth is that the body image has not been explained yet by science, which is something completely different!!! STURP has never proclaimed that the body image was scientifically unexplainable but that the team was not able to completely explain it in the present state of their scientific knowledge. As I said in my letter, people must realize that, unlike the very unusual aspect of the bloodstains, there is absolutely no fact or observation coming from the Shroud that can exclude the possibility of a natural formation of the image. Unfortunately, from the time STURP published this particular conclusion, there was a bunch of supernatural freaks who entered in the Shroud world (among them, many scientists!) because they thought that such a statement was meaning that the body image could never been naturally explained and consequently, was surely coming from the Resurrection event. These people were only looking to find a physical proof of this event in the body image, while putting aside (or inventing new “facts”) in order to back up their religious based agenda.

Rogers work on the Shroud really indicates that a natural image formation is very likely, even though he wasn’t able to completely solve the mystery of the image in a complete way.

People don’t understand that, for Rogers, Barbet, Vignon, Legrand, Rinaldi and many others, a natural formation of the image coming from the dead corpse of Jesus is not incompatible at all with the Catholic idea of the Resurrection, which is a spiritualization and a sudden disappearance of his body before the arrival of the first liquid of putrefaction.

You can’t since there’s nothing in the data and observations coming from the Shroud that can presently exclude the possibility that the image was formed naturally. If one day, science would conclude that this image is totally unexplainable scientifically, then maybe you could think that way. But we’re far from being there. In fact, this is precisely the opposite. Like it or not, since the great work of Rogers near the end of his life (this was a pure blessing from the sky that he could do this before dying), there’s good reasons to believe the image comes from one or more natural process(es). As I often said, the clue is the image chromophore.

I have 2 questions for all the persons who believe the image on the Shroud was produced by some kind of burst of energy. 1 Where do you see in the Gospel accounts we find in St John of the apparitions of the Resurrected Christ to his disciples in the upper room a mention that there was a burst of radiation, a flash of light or an electrostatic discharge at the very moment he suddenly appeared in front of them? Answer: NOWHERE! There are absolutely no signs in the Gospel that the apparition of the Resurrected Jesus was accompanied by any kind of energetic release! No… He just suddenly appeared in front of them! 2 Where do you see in the Gospel account we find in St Luke of the apparition of the Resurrected Christ to the two disciples of Emmaus a mention that there was a burst of radiation, a flash of light or an electrostatic discharge at the very moment he suddenly disappeared in front of them when they recognize him? Answer: NOWHERE! There are absolutely no signs in the Gospel that the disappearance of the Resurrected Jesus was accompanied by any kind of energetic release! No… He just suddenly disappeared in front of them! From these accounts, we have a strong feeling that the Resurrected body of Christ never emit any kind of energetic radiation (including light) when he appeared and disappeared from this material world. A second before the apparition of Jesus to his disciples, he just wasn’t there and then boom! He was present in front of them. No release of anything. No puff of smoke. No flash of light. No nothing! And it’s the very same thing when he disappeared in front of the two disciples of Emmaus! These particular Gospel accounts are very telling when we think about the image on the Shroud. Why would there be any kind of energetic released by the body at the moment of Jesus Resurrection when there was certainly not every time he appeared and disappeared in front of his disciples? Good question, don’t you think? Why is it so hard for you to be open to the possibility that there was no more release of energy at the very moment of the Resurrection than there was when the Resurrected Jesus appeared and disappeared from this world? I have a little exercise for you: Please, read again these accounts in the Gospels of John and Luke and try to imagine that the disappearance of Jesus body from inside the Shroud and the tomb (and front inside this world) at the moment of his Resurrection was EXACTLY like these accounts: No burst of energy of any sort! Just a sudden disappearance of his physical body to enter into the spiritual world of the Father. For me, this moment certainly looked pretty much like the last scene of the movie The Passion of the Christ when we see the enshrouded body suddenly disappeared and the burial cloth collapsing slowly to the ground WITHOUT any release of energetic radiation of any kind (and without any sound and earthquake too). Just a very quiet and sudden disappearance of the body in the same manner than he appeared and disappeared in front of his disciples after his Resurrection. Last questions: WHY WOULDN’T BE THAT WAY FOR THE RESURRECTION EVENT? And if it was, then WHY THE IMAGE ON THE SHROUD COULDN’T HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOME GASEOUS AND/OR MOLECULAR RELEASED BY THE DEAD BODY PRIOR TO THIS SUDDEN EVENT? Deep in my heart and mind, I’m convinced this is very near the truth.

And recently, I asked the question to M. Kelly Kearse and here’s what he said about that: “I’m not so sure you can go from the imprints of the cloth to a collapse. I would think there would be some sticking if the cloth was simply removed from the body, and some tearing away or distortion of the wounds. Their regular outline would suggest something different is involved here, but I don’t really know how far you could take it.” Even M. Kearse agree that the undisturbed aspect and shape of the bloodstains on the Shroud really seems to be inconsistent with the idea of an extraction of the bloodstained corpse from the burial cloth at a moment when the blood clots were all dried and stuck to the fabric. This is not a proof of the Resurrection of course, but this could be seen as a sign of this event that involved a spiritualization of the body¸and his disappearance from our material universe. I have been very prudent not to state categorically that the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains is a proof of the Resurrection. That’s why I am far from being a “miraculist”!!! In fact, there’s no scientific proof of this spiritual event. God respect too much our free will for leaving such a proof on a piece of cloth. That would completely contradict all the teaching of Jesus (including his great teaching concerning the doubting Thomas) concerning the fact that we will only be happy as believers when we will be able to believe without seeing! The Shroud is not a proof of Jesus Resurrection. It can only be a proof of God’s Incarnation. Of course, with the eyes of faith, someone can see a sign of the Resurrection in the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains but that will forever be only a sign, which is something completely different than a proof.

Oxley and everyone else. Do you think that this piece of cloth could have come originally from Saint Louis IX king of France ? Is it possible that it came from the “part of the Shroud” he get in 1247 from Baldwin II, emperor of Constantinople ? This relic came with many other relics and his part of several lists of relics that were kept in the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. The official lists said “part of the Shroud”. Some years ago, a researchers, Cesar Barta, made some research about this particular relic that was lost during the French revolution of 1789. There’s a piece of this relic that still exist today in the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain. M. Barta wrote a very interesting article on the British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter about his analysis of this relic. You can find the paper on Shroud.com : http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n56part5.pdf From this textile analysis, M. Barta conclude that the “part of the Shroud” that Saint Louis get in 1247 wasn’t originally a part of the Shroud of Turin like many Shroudies thought (because of the 2 missing corners we see on the Shroud). The textile structure of the piece of cloth kept in Toledo isn’t the same than the Shroud. Personally, I think there’s a fair possibility that this linen cloth which was purchased by Saint Louis was originally found in the tomb ALONG with the Shroud. There’s some lists of relics from Constantinople in the 12th century that mentionned specifically “the linen cloths found in the tomb” instead of just a single shroud. Maybe those others linen cloths were linen strips used to tied up the body ? That could also be some linen cloth that contain aloes and myhrr and that were put around to the body in the Shroud or beside the shrouded body in the tomb… I don’t think the item on Ebay have great chances to be genuine but if it is, I think there is more probability that this came from the “part of the Shroud” that Saint Louis get with other relics in 1247 than from the actual Shroud of Turin.

So, forget the idea that some artists have made these coins while looking at the Shroud because IT’S COMPLETELY LUDICROUS !!! BUT before you throw me some rocks (like the Jews for Jesus), I would add this : Because of many stricking similarities between the face on the Shroud and the Pantocrator icons, there are pretty good chances that the first Pantocrator icon was created directly (or indirectly) from the Shroud itself… So, let’s never forget this great FACT : The Pantocrator icon was VERY POPULAR in Constantinople (unlike the Shroud it seem, because there is just on sure public showing of it and it came in 1203 1204). The great popularity of this icon can also be measured by the presence of an important monastry in Constantinople during the Byzantine era that was called “The Pantokrator Monastery”. It is most probably because of this great popularity of the Pantocrator icon that some Byzantine emperors decided to put the face of this particular Sacred icon on their coins. The Shroud of Turin had nothing to do with this (at least, not directly)… It’s important to understand this historical FACT. I have done this in the past on this same blog, but I’ll do it again : I recommand you and anyone else here the reading of the great study of the Byzantine coins made by a well respected scholar named Grierson. You can find this article here : http://www.doaks.org/publications/doaks online publications/byzcoins.pdf In this paper, you’ll see that, for this scholar, the coins in question were made directly from the Pantocrator icon… Not from the Shroud ! This is a great confirmation of what I just said in this comment. In fact, I just wanted to set the record straight, because there’s too much erroneous things that are said concerning the Shroud’s ancient history.

Schneider have said here (sorry again for the length of this comment) : Quote 1 : “One agenda driven account is not more convincing than another. Wilson never claims to prove the shroud authentic. He is making a fragmentary case with what evidence there is.” Comment from me : It’s interesting to note this admission from M. Schneider that Wilson’s hypothesis is “agenda driven”. I completely agree with him on this point. And for the fact that Wilson never claim he has proved the shroud authenticity, it’s maybe true to some extent (I don’t think Wilson ever made an explicit claim like that), but nevertheless, it’s very sad to note that many persons interested in the Shroud (and even some official websites and TV documentaries concerning the Shroud) have considered blindly this very doubtful HYPOTHESIS like if it was a real confirmed THEORY accepted by most scholars, while it’s very far from being the case !!! That’s why I’m so passionate about this topic and always want to set the record straight every time I get the chance to do so. Quote 2 : “There are many small things that point to authenticity and there are some that point in the opposite direction.” Comment from me : Here, I would like that M. Schneider told us what are exactly the things (in the plural) that really point in the opposite direction versus the authenticity of the Shroud ??? In the past years, we were aware of only 2 of those things which were the C14 result (concluding that the Shroud was made between 1260 and 1390 !) and the memorandum of Pierre d’Arcy (who claimed he knew the artist who painted this false relic). That’s the only 2 things I’m aware that were really pointing toward something else than authenticity. But the reality is this : those 2 things have been scientifically discarded long ago !!! The C14 result is now obsolete because of all the evidences that are showing that the sample that was used for the dating was not representative of the main cloth. And for the d’Arcy memorandum, never mind if this Bishop was honest or not in his letter to the pope, since the STURP team work, we know for sure that it was a false interpretation of the image that was on the Shroud. Since we know for a fact now that the Shroud IS NOT some kind of artistic forgery, this “evidence” of the memorandum has to be discarded too. That’s why unless someone can show me one solid evidence, other than the 2 I just mentioned, that point in the direction of non authenticity, I think it’s fair to say that, presently, there’s absolutely NO real and solid scientific evidence that can really put the authenticity of the Shroud in jeopardy. That’s why I ask M. Schneider (or anyone else) to tell me what else can really put the Shroud authenticity in doubt at the time we are speaking ??? I don’t see nothing right now… Quote 3 : “I do think that Freeman has a point about the handling of shroud research. STURP did what it could but it was a quickly thrown together association of scientists with relatively few resources. If they were not as professional as they might have been it should be remembered that they were the first and only investigation that has taken place and their research was compressed into 120 continuous hours.” Comment from me : This quote from M. Schneider really surprises me ! Unless I get it wrong… One thing’s for sure : I would really love to hear Barrie Schwortz about that !!! From what I’ve learn from Barrie along the years, I think this opinion of M. Schneider is simply false versus the reality. Barrie often told me how the STURP team took almost 2 years in order to be ready for the 5 days of examination in Turin. I think this simple FACT is enough to discard the term used by M. Schneider when he describe the STURP team as “a quickly thrown together association of scientists” !!! And when he said that they were a team “with relatively few resources”, I don’t think it’s true either ! Just look at all the material and tests they were able to perform in 1978, despite a pretty short period of time that was hallowed (5 days and nights) and many unplanned bugs and you’ll realize that, for a first in deep examination of the Shroud, this was a very good success and they were able to collect a large spectrum of data still in use today in Shroud science. Of course, looking back, anyone can make critics and say “they should have done this” or “they should have tried that”, but that’s completely unfair to say things like that ! That’s what I think. I really think we should look at the STURP team work and say “Bravo” to those scientists simply because of the great work they were able to accomplish in the context of the time (particularly in regard of the fact that it was a real pioneer work that will most probably be very useful when the time will come to make a second round of direct examination of the cloth). Lastly, maybe I get it wrong (remember that I don’t speak and understand English completely well), but I have a hard time to understand the fact that M. Schneider seem to criticize the professionalism of the STURP team. Really, I don’t get it. When you look at the poor quality of the Shroud research that’s going on these days, I don’t think anyone has the right to put the professionalism of those guys in question !!! Of course they probably did some interpretation mistakes (the biggest one being the probable error versus the chromophore of the image who resides in a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers instead of on the fiber walls themselves), but hey ? Who is perfect in this world ? I think the fact that a bunch of conclusions from the STURP papers have already been confirmed is well enough to understand the great professionalism of this team. So, unless I didn’t understand well what M. Schneider wanted to say, I have to say that I completely disagree with his (pretty poor) opinion of the STURP team….","date":"2012-05-30","mins":"5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/29/scientific-study-of-the-shroud-of-turin-hampered-by-sturp/","cat":"books","title":"Scientific Study of the Shroud of Turin hampered by STURP?"},{"id":"comment-11743","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I’m sure the STURP team should had been replaced by the Collinsberry team !!!

Like Paul said in one of his letters, if Christ has not rise from the dead, vain his your faith ! He also said that if the resurrection isn’t true, then we Christians are the worst off. Talking about the historic reality of the resurrection of Christ, Benedict 16, in his new book about Jesus, said this very interesting remark : “If we consider, from the story of the creation (from Genesis) and from the Decalogue, what is the importance of the Sabbath in the old Testament tradition, then it is evident that only a stong and deeply moving event could have lead to the reject of the Sabbath practice (by the first christians) and his replacement by the first day of the week. Only an event that would have been printed in the souls with extraordinary force could have lead to a change so central in the religious culture of the week. Theological speculations alone would have not been sufficient for this change. The celebration of the Lord’s Day, who, from the beginning, had distinguish the Christian community (from the Jewish community), is for me one of the strongest proof of the fact that, on this first day of the week, something amazing happened : the finding of the empty tomb and the encounter with the Risen Lord.” I fully agree with this reflection by the pope and I found this piece of evidence very interesting. Historically, there must have been a very extraordinary event to push the Christian to adopt another day of celebration than the Sabbath day. When you know the importance of this day for the Jews of this time, you understand that, indeed, something remarkable happened. And only an important event like the resurrection of Christ could have force the apostles to get out (at the risk of their lives) and proclaim the good news. Christian faith is not based on some ideas or concepts but on a real historical event. There’s no way to explain the emergence of Christianity other than to accept the fact that there was some people (the disciples) who were convince to have seen Jesus alive after his crucifixion and his entombment… And the reality of the empty tomb (and the empty shroud !!!) was important as a sign of this event.

It’s important to understand that some of these biological stains could have been formed on the cloth by temporary contacts during the burial procedure (for example, during the probable moving of the enshrouded body from a central place inside the tomb to his final resting place on a stone bench carved in a wall of the tomb), while others (representing certainly the major part of the bloodstains) are the result of a permanent contact between the corpse and the cloth (e.g. Direct contacts that were maintained after the end of the burial procedure). And it should be noted that the very probable fact that some bloodstains were formed by temporary contacts during the burial procedure could explain why some bloodstains on the Shroud are offregister with respect to the anatomical details of the body images (Item xv).” Such a scenario can explain at least as good as yours why there is a bloodstain off the right elbow of the Shroud man’s body image..","date":"2014-06-20","mins":"4:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/16/clarification-of-the-stochastic-process-paper/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Clarification of the Stochastic Process Paper"},{"id":"comment-4285","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Max, if it’s there, why I don’t see nothing ?

But obviously, YOU CAN’T simply because it ain’t there ! If we summarize this question : 1 There is no exact reference in ancient jewish litterature (Thora, Mishna, Talmud, etc.) about the fact that putting coins over the eyes was a normal procedure in ancient jewish burials. 2 The procedure of putting coins over the eyes (or into the mouth) was a pagan rite and this rite could have been taken as an act of idolatry by the pious jews like the Pharisees. 3 The coins that are claimed to be on the shroud are Roman coins. Those coins were not hallowed in the Temple by the jewish authorities. 4 Jesus and his followers were all pious Jews and not hellenistic jews. 5 The burial rite after Jesus death was only partially done on friday and they had to come back on sunday to do an anointing of the body. Love it or not, this was the situation on the day of Jesus death. And we can add this fact to the list below : Most of the people who have looked at the shroud images of the eye area HAVE NOT SEEN any images of coins there. Now, it’s up to you to make up your own mind about this question of the coins. Personally, it’s evident for me that the chances that there are really images of coins over the eyes on the Shroud are close to absolute zero.

First of all, the first few mentions of an image of Christ (always a facial image only of the living Christ) that we found in some accounts of the Abgar legend talks specifically about a man made image done with paint by the man who was sent by Abgar in Jerusalem to meet Jesus. That’s the first point: the image of Edessa was, at the origin, a painted image of the face of the living Christ made BEFORE his passion. The second is this: Don’t underestimate the great impact on the faithful and pilgrim’s faith and imagination that an official statement done by the Church leaders in Edessa concerning a so called supernatural origin for the image could had back in those days (some time during the 6th Century or maybe a bit layer, during the Iconoclast period). This is an historical fact that once the Church declare something miraculous, you got immediately a bunch of person to believe this without questioning anything! Look at what happened in Mexico with the Guadalupe Tilma and you’ll see that this is true… Who can be certain if this Tilma is not simply a false painted relic? This is a true possibility, even if the official position of the Mexico Church is to make believe it has been done through a miraculous event and even though you still got millions of faithful and pilgrims to believe it.

In the light of all the data we got from STURP (and from other scientist inquiries like the one done by Barbet, Zugibe, Lavoie, Baima Bollone, etc.), I firmly believe these 4 scenarios are the only ones that can have any chance to be correct versus the Shroud and, sadly for your vision, the idea of an artistic forgery is not present in these 4 scenarios… In future interviews, I wish you could mention these 4 possible scenarios when you talk about the question of the authenticity of the relic, instead of still leaving the door open to an artistic forgery, which has already been set aside by science.

I think sharing our ideas about Christ and about his Father is truly positive, so you can be sure that I won’t stop today… When he entered in Jerusalem on Palms Sunday, Jesus said to the Pharisees who wanted his disciples to shut their mouth because they were proclaiming him “the king of the Jews” : “if they keep silent, the very stones will cry out!” It’s a bit like that for me when it comes to defending the faith in the Father of Jesus who is love and mercy (and nothing else than this)!.","date":"2013-05-07","mins":"10:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/03/barrie-schwortz-tedx-via-della-conciliazione-talk/","cat":"science","title":"Barrie Schwortz’ TEDx Via della Conciliazione Talk"},{"id":"comment-33096","author":"yannick_clément","post":"No. When I read non Christian ideas coming from someone who call himself a Christian, I just can’t help myself.

And, while doing so, he managed to preserved their liberty of faith by taking different appearances (at least 2 if not more), so that they never recognized him at first sight. To me, these different appearances had an important secondary meaning: they ment that now, we can find the Resurrected Christ in every one of our brothers and sisters in humanity no matter who he is and no matter his faith or non faith. So, along with the entrance of the tomb that was open, and the tomb and the shroud that were empty, I see the material apparitions of the resurrected Jesus as some more material signs of his spiritual resurrection; a resurrection that, of course, occured in eternity at the very moment he died on the cross on Good Friday and not just on Easter morning. Unfortunately, because Jesus followers were all Jews and that the Jews of that time had very sadly (and very wrongly) a very materialistic view of the life after death, they took these few material apparitions of Jesus as granted and believed that life after death would be just like our present life on Earth but without pain, suffering or death… They took Jesus saying before his death concerning the “new wine” he would drink with them in his Father’s Kingdom at the first level without understanding that it was a metaphor used by him to describe a new way to live in a communion of love with each other… The fact that our new body will never suffer again and never die again is true of course, but since we will experience this new life in eternity and not in our present space time universe, it’s ludicrous to think that our own resurrection (I prefer by far to talk of our future life with a spiritual body because the word “resurrection” is way too much ambiguous because it can be easily understood as just a “re animation” of the dead body, which is false) will look pretty much like our present life on Earth (or like the apparations of the resurrected Jesus eating fish with his disciples). Sorry but in Heaven, we won’t have to eat no more! We won’t have to drink no more! We won’t have to sleep no more! We won’t have any sexual desires no more! These things are only part for our present material existence and will have absolutely no sense in eternity. Heaven will be the liberation of all these physical needs that can be seen as chains for us… Look… Heaven is not even a “place” because it is not found in our space time universe. How can we believe that we will only get our present material body which will be somewhat “refurbished” by God? It’s completely ludicrous, but sadly, many Christians see life after death exactly like this… I think those people should read again what Jesus said one day to the Sadducees : “They can no longer die (i.e. Those who are in Heaven), for they are like angels.” Now, as I know, an angel has a spiritual body and not a renewed material body! How can we think the body we will get in Heaven will be somewhat close to the material body we have now? Again, this is ludicrous and a very materialistic way to see eternity! In conclusion, even if the material body of Jesus had go on and rot in the tomb like any other corpse, and if the tomb had remained closed with the rotting body inside of it, Jesus would have been already resurrected anyway! But the thing is: no one of his disciples would have been able to believe this!!! They would have said something like this: Ho… Jesus was a very good man and teacher but now, he’s in the Sheol with all the other dead men, waiting with them for the general resurrection of the deads at the end of time… In other words, without these material signs (that include all the physical appations of the resurrected Christ), they would never have been able to believe that Jesus was already living a new eternal life and, consequently, that every human being is also living a new eternal life after he die. Jesus resurrection must be understood as the physical sign “par excellence” of our own resurrection (again, I prefer to say: of our future life with a spiritual body in eternity). Truly, life after death is misunderstood by a lot of people, even by many Church leaders, for the simple reason that they took the resurrection accounts at the first level without trying to understand the profound and spiritual meaning of it….","date":"2013-07-21","mins":"9:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/19/imagine-taking-easter-out-and-there-just-isnt-a-story/","cat":"video","title":"Imagine taking Easter out and there just isn’t a story"},{"id":"comment-39875","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s my idea versus Paul and Thomas’ experience of the Resurrected Jesus. It’s only my own thoughts on the subject… For Paul: I truly believe Paul’s conversion to Christianism started at the exact moment he saw Stephen’s martyrdom. I think the way Stephen died while asking God to forgive the sin of his executioners was the starting point of everything for Paul. Then, his conversion on the road to Damascus is, for me, only the full achievement of the conversion that had started when he saw Stephen’s martyrdom some time before in Jerusalem. And you know what I think? I think this event on the road to Damascus was much more an interior and spiritual event in the life of Paul than a physical encounter with the Resurrected Christ, in the same way the disciples experimented it in Jerusalem on Easter morning and in the following days… In the end, I see the different narrative stories of his conversion on the road to Damascus that we find in the Bible as stories written in a pure Middle Eastern style with a full package of imageries that are intend to explain with our poor words what was at the heart of Paul’s interior and spiritual experience of conversion (note that such interior expériences still happened every day or so in the world). Here, it’s important for me to categorically state this: I have absolutely no doubt Paul’s interior experience of conversion really happened when he was on his way to persecute the Christians who were living in Damascus. In conclusion, I would say that, in my mind, we cannot at all see Paul’s conversion as being an event that was based on a sure proof of the reality of Jesus’ resurrection (at least, not in the scientific sense we usually use the word “proof”). For Thomas: If you read again very carefully the accounts of the encounters between the Resurrected Christ and his disciples that we found in John’s Gospel, you can conclude, like me, that Jesus’ physical appearance was not at all the same as it was before his death and you can also conclude that, at least for one occasion (during his last apparition on the shore of the Sea of Galilee), Jesus took another human form that was different than the previous one he had on Easter morning (and also probably 8 days later when he appeared to Thomas). Then, I think it’s fair to conclude that, during all his apparitions to his disciples (including the apparition to Thomas), Jesus had a different body appearance than he had before his death but was still showing his crucifixion wounds in his hands and in his side (and probably also in his feet). Important note about that: when you read again the 2 accounts in John’s Gospel in which Jesus appeared to his disciples in the Upper Room in Jerusalem, it is pretty evident to understand that it is only after the disciples saw his crucifixion wounds that they came to the conclusion that this person who had a body they never saw before was really Jesus alive again!!! That’s why I think it’s totally untrue to assume that Thomas received a full proof (in the scientific sense) of Jesus’ Resurrection when he meet him for the first time! No… For me, based on my understanding of the apparition accounts (especially the ones we found in John’s Gospel), I still think the disciples, including Thomas, had to make a leap of faith in order to recognize the Resurrected Jesus in this stranger they had in front of them… Because of this, I still think that no one in all the Bible had such an experience of the Resurrected Christ that it can be call “a proof” (in the scientific sense of course). I still think that all these physical apparitions of the Resurrected Christ were “only” material signs given by God to Jesus’ disciples, so that they could end up believing that, yes, Jesus was truly resurrected in the way he was describing it prior to his death (after 3 days, I will rise again) and not the way these Jews understood his words, i.e. As a pictorial way for Jesus to talk about his Resurrection at the end of times, along all the other “righteous” (which is the way the Jews of Jesus’ time were seeing the Resurrection of the deads). In other words, the physical apparitions of the Resurrected Christ (including the fact that his unusual body was showing all his crucifixion wounds) was the way God choose to help Jesus’ disciples to believe in a spiritual reality (Jesus’ Resurrection and his “ascension” in Heaven) that was already real at the moment he died on the cross on Good Friday, while preserving the liberty of these disciples to believe or not in this spiritual reality (note that in Matthew’s Gospel, there is a very good clue that this is true when he reported that some disciples were still not sure if it was truly Jesus or not after they saw him in Galilee). I’m truly convinced that if Jesus had not appeared physically to his disciples (with a different body appearance that was still showing his crucifixion wounds), each of them would have been able to believe that he was already resurrected and that he was now in Heaven, watching over us. Each one of them would have ended up believing that he would only resurrect with them at the end of times and Christianism would never had born! I know this is not in total sync with the official teaching of the Church but I don’t care one bit! You know why? Because I know for a fact that this official teaching is not always infallible!!! You want a proof of this (in the scientific sense !!!)? Ok, here it is: In the following years and decades following Jesus death and Resurrection, the apostles themselves were teaching that the end of the world was coming fast and the first Christians were truly believing that they would saw it coming during their lifetime! We now know that it was a terrible mistake on their part (which probably came from a bad understanding of Jesus’ teaching about that, but which, at the same time, paid off well because I’m sure it persuade a lot of fearful people to become Christians). So, let me ask you: If it was possible for the apostles of Jesus to do some mistakes in their teaching, don’t you think it is also possible for today’s Church to also make some mistakes in it’s teaching and to not always understand correctly every aspects surrounding the Resurrection of Christ??? I truly think so!!!.","date":"2013-07-27","mins":"6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/19/imagine-taking-easter-out-and-there-just-isnt-a-story/","cat":"video","title":"Imagine taking Easter out and there just isn’t a story"},{"id":"comment-39515","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I just share my thoughts that came from a long reflection on the subject in the light of my own experience of God… Anyone is free to believe otherwise..","date":"2013-07-22","mins":"8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/19/imagine-taking-easter-out-and-there-just-isnt-a-story/","cat":"video","title":"Imagine taking Easter out and there just isn’t a story"},{"id":"comment-120536","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Russ, I’ll tell you again: On the contrary to what you always say publicly (and again, you said it at the very beginning of this interview), the Shroud is not, in the strict sense of the term, an historical document of the Resurrection but rather a historical document of the Passion and death of Jesus of Nazareth… The image and bloodstains on this cloth are showing a DEAD CHRIST and not a Risen one..","date":"2014-05-16","mins":"3:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/14/russ-breault-on-pitn-youtube-video/","cat":"video","title":"Russ Breault on PITN YouTube Video"},{"id":"comment-39976","author":"yannick_clément","post":"All this to respect the freedom to believe in himself or not.

It was like I was saying that the Resurrection of Christ is a proven historical fact, while this is not at all what I said to him! True, the Resurrection of Christ is not and will never be an event that we can consider as being a true and proven historical fact, but the empty tomb is a different story! And what can make me consider this story as being a true and solid historical fact: simply because the enemies of the faith, whether it was the Roman or the Jews, never denied that event! The only thing they denied was the understanding of this event… For them, it was evident that the disciple came to the tomb and stole the corpse. So, the simple fact that they never denied that the tomb had been found empty on Easter morning is well enough to understand that it was a true story. When I explained this to my friend, he had no other choice than to agree with me (at least, saying that it was a probable fact). And for the empty Shroud, I think it’s fair to say that it’s also a sure historical fact, based on the same account of the empty tomb, and this fact is reinforced by the very probable fact that the Shroud of Turin (which contained only for a short time the dead body of a crucified man who showed the same stigmatas than the Jesus of the Gospels) is really the true Shroud used to covered the body of Jesus of Nazareth after his crucifixion. These 2 historical facts (the empty tomb and the empty Shroud) truly complement each other, while it’s important to say it’s impossible to consider them as being a solid scientific and historical proof of the reality of Jesus resurrection. And concerning the encounters made by the disciples after the founding of the empty tomb, I say that it is a very probable historical fact for the simple and good reason that it doesn’t sound at all like an invented story, because if this would have been the case and that story would have been made up by the disciples of Jesus, it’s evident that they would have claimed having no problem at all to recognize him after his resurrection… This is pure rational thinking! But again, even if these stories of the disciples having encountered someone after Jesus death, while ending up believing that it was really him alive again, are most probably true, that doesn’t mean that the person they meet was truly the resurrected Jesus… That only mean they ended up being sure that it was him, while having no proof (in the scientific sense of course) to show to back up their claims. So, the door will be always left open for some mistakes on their part… Concerning the resurrection of Jesus Christ, FAITH IS AND WILL FOREVER BE NEEDED!.","date":"2013-07-17","mins":"1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/16/the-investigator-new-film-about-the-death-and-resurrection-of-christ/","cat":"movie","title":"The Investigator:  New Film About the Death and Resurrection of Christ"},{"id":"comment-39193","author":"yannick_clément","post":"When he see that more and more people in our modern world are desperately seeking to find some proofs of the existence of God, especially by trying to find solid evidences of the Resurrection of Christ, I say to myself that St Paul must turn over in his grave!

Note that there are a lot of persons who are interested by the Shroud of Turin exactly for this reason (i.e. Finding some proofs of the Resurrection of Christ).

All those data cannot be accurately extact from the Shroud images and those are very important and can make a pretty big difference in the physiognomy of someone. So, we have to take this portrait of Jesus with a grain of salt… Also, being catholic as many of you know by now, there’s one aspect of the program that really bug me and that’s all the talks about the gnostics concepts versus the Shroud, which is something I’ve found TOTALLY OFF TRACK AND OFF TOPIC… If I were the producer, I would have droped completely all this part of the program to stay focused on the historical Jesus. I really don’t understand what a gnostic concept of the Universe have to do with the Shroud of Turin… To me, this kind of association is borderline to the lunatic fringe. But beside that, good program that deserve to be seen at least one time by every person interested in the Shroud… To me, one of the best part of the show is when they extract all the blood from the images by playing with the colors. That’s pretty impressive. You can see that the body of Jesus was literally covered with humid blood clots (some more than others, with the result of giving different kinds of blood marks, some really evident and some other much more superficial and hard to see with the naked eye). In fact, this playing of color revealed many marks that are not really visible with the naked eye and we have to assume that they came from near dried blood clots. It is interesting to note that some blood clots were nearly completely dried when they put to body in the Shroud and to me, this is very consistent with the study of the Sudarium of Oviedo that reveal that Jesus body spend one hour on the cross after his death (vertical position) and another hours on the ground (horizontal position) before being put into the Sudarium. So, in 2 hours, it’s enough for many blood clots that were still humid before death to dried almost completely and only leave a faint mark on the Shroud. Tto me, all those blood details are the most important details that we can see on the Shroud to logically deduce that this cloth is an authentic burial cloth that has contain a dead corpse of a man that was tortured exactly like Christ… I ask this question before, but I’ll do it again : IF IT’S NOT JESUS, THEN WHO WAS HE ??? : ).","date":"2011-11-19","mins":"9:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/19/the-real-face-of-jesus-on-kindle-fire/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Real Face of Jesus on Kindle Fire"},{"id":"comment-4890","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Oups, I’ve made a little mistake.

I should have said this instead : “very consistent with the study of the Sudarium of Oviedo that reveal that Jesus body spend one hour on the cross after his death (vertical position) and another hour on the ground (horizontal position) before being put into the SHROUD.” Anyway, I’m sure you understand what I meant. Another thing I want to add to my comment : This 2 hours conclusion is an estimation done in laboratory. So, the real time frame can well be + or – 30 minutes or so, but in the end, the important thing to understand is that there was a pretty long wait between Jesus death and the moment they put his body in the Shroud and that conclusion from the study of the Oviedo cloth is totally consistent with what we can see on the Shroud concerning the blood marks and also consistent with the gospels account who talk about an unprepared (because it was unexpected) burial rite that was due only to the negociation done by Joseph of Arimathea with Pilate after Jesus death… When you check out carefully the whole portrait of the Gospels, the Shroud and the Sudarium, IT FITS.

But that command a few remark from me : 1 The double superficiality, in my mind, only concern the body images and not the blood images. It’s pretty clear that the 2 types of images were transferred to the cloth by 2 different process. So, the blood transfer was a clear natural transfer process that implied direct contact with humid blood clots and those contacts left mirror images of the blood clots (Ref. : Barbet’s book “A doctor at Calvary” and also Adler book “The Orphaned Manuscript”). With a transfer process like that, it’s natural to see profound penetration of the blood material into the cloth and this blood, in many cases, was able to soak all the way to the other side of the cloth. Now, with the body image, it is pretty clear that there was no profound penetration of the coloration anywhere and there’s some possibility (it’s a possibility and not a confirmed fact for the moment) that yes, there are really BODY images on both sides of the Shroud (that we can called “double superficiality images”) but only for some body parts like the hair, the nose and mouth region and the hands and those body images appeared to be only in the back part of the frontal image of the Shroud. 2 If you read Ray Rogers book carefully (and I know you already did !), he talk about a statement from Monsignor Ghiberti who was present in Turin during the 2002 restoration of the Shroud and who said that that the only body image that can be seen with the naked eye was in the hair region. For the double superficiality of the face region, it’s another story because M. Fanti used strong imagery treatment to find an image and that’s surely questionable. Only direct chemical tests from fibers samples of all those regions (hair, face, hands) will tell us if there is really a body image there. For the moment, I think the declaration of Ghiberti have to be taken seriously because it came from an eye witness who surely had no bad intention or any agenda behind his head to said what he had said… But, to be absolutely sure, we have to wait until new direct chemical analysis could be performed on samples from those regions. Question regarding my 2 comments : If there is still a possibility that those body images (or some of them) are really there on the back part of the Shroud, why the fact that there’s blood in those region that were able to soak deep into the cloth can contradict the hypothesis of a double superficial image made by Fanti and confirmed partially by Ghiberti’s declaration ? I always thought that this concept of double superficiality only concerned the body images and not the blood images… There’s another question I have regarding what Mario said about the penetration of the tiny blood stains in the beard and mustache area : Is it confirmed that those tiny blood decals are visible on the back part of the cloth ? I ask that because it’s pretty clear from the transmitted light photos of Barrie Schwortz that not all blood marks were able to soak very deep into the cloth. Some of them are not visible in the transmitted light photos, meaning that those are pretty superficial. It is the case for many scourge marks, especially in the frontal part of the cloth. So, I’m curious to know if those tiny blood stains are superficial in nature or if they really were able to soak deep into the cloth and stain also the back part of the Shroud… I think the photo of the back part of the Shroud (published by Flury Lemberg) could give us the correct answer to this question..","date":"2011-11-19","mins":"11:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/19/the-real-face-of-jesus-on-kindle-fire/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Real Face of Jesus on Kindle Fire"},{"id":"comment-5459","author":"yannick_clément","post":"One of the best documentary about the Shroud, except, as I said before, all the part where they make a very bad link with the Gnostic philosophy of the Universe which is completely heretic and non christian.

I think it’s the very best conclusion that we can draw for the moment, until a new series of direct tests could be performed on the cloth and until new laboratory experiments could be done to test every possible image formation hypothesis.
