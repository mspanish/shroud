Of course, history is different than a hard science like physic or chemistry. But I think there is often a common base among credible historians about some accepted historical facts and it is on that base that the hypothesis should be built. Also, it is important to note that other scientific fields can be called in to back up some historical hypothesis. In the case of the Shroud, it’s risky (scientifically speaking) for an historian to call it to back up the historical Jesus case because it’s scientifically impossible to get a 100% sure match between the identity of the man of the Shroud and Jesus of Nazareth. There will always be some door left open for the possibility that the man could have been the unwilling victim of a forger who wanted to produced a false relic of Christ while using a real body to do so (first possible scenario that you can find in my recent paper) and also for the possibility that the man of the Shroud could be a real crucifixion victim of the Romans other than Jesus but who suffered the same tortures than him (second possible scenario that you can find in my recent paper). If I was an historian, I would avoid relying on the Shroud to back up the case of the historical Jesus. Of course, it could be mention in an article on the subject but it should not be consider as some kind of proof that can back up the case. Potential proof, yes.

The comparative results of aragonite dirt found on the Shroud and aragonite dirt found in an ancient rock tomb in Jerusalem was first published in 1985 by Riccardo Levi Setti of the University of Chicago’s Enrico Fermi Institute. This man is a well respected scientist in his field and in his paper (that was published in the Scanning Electron Microscopy journal under the title “Progress in high resolution scanning ion microscopy and secondary ion mass spectroscopy imaging microanalysis”), he was able to scientifically CONFIRMED the conclusion of Joseph A. Kohlbeck (an optical cristallographer) and Eugenia L. Nitowski (an archaeologist) that they finally published one year layer (in 1986) in an article of the Biblical Archaeology Review but that they already found before Setti published is own results. In fact, Kohlbeck and Nitowski were working on that study since 1982 ! Here’s a link to the article of Kohlbeck and Nitowski: http://members.bib arch.org/publication.asp?Pub ID=BSBA&Volume=12&Issue=04&Article ID=01&User ID=0&amp;). And the conclusion reached by Kohlbeck and Nitowski that was independently confirmed by Levi Setti is really important and too often neglect concerning the authenticity of the Shroud : The sample of aragonite found in the region of one heel on the Shroud have almost the same chemical signature than a sample of aragonite taken by Nitowski inside a 1st century tomb near the Damascus gate in Jerusalem, which makes a very good “match”. And there’s 2 things that are very important to note about this study of the aragonite dirt : 1 No aragonite dirt with the same chemical signature than the one coming from the Shroud and from Jerusalem has been found elsewhere in the world. 2 Kohlbeck and Nitowski also analyzed eight more samples of limestone dirt taken in different site in Israel (Emmaus, Jericho, Qumran, Beth Shan, Sepphoris, two samples from Beth She’arim and Mt Carmel) and found that from as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the aragonite chemical composition changes and does not match either Jerusalem or Shroud samples. I have not found a direct link for the article of Levi Setti (for a summary or a complete downloadable version) but it was put in reference of at least 2 papers he wrote in 1988 and in 1992 (links : http://www.biolcellusa.org/boc/063/0077/boc0630077.pdf / see reference #8 and http://www.biolcellusa.org/boc/074/0051/boc0740051.pdf / see reference #12) and the same reference can also be found in the 1986 article of Kohlbeck and Nitowski. From all these references, there’s no doubt that this article was really published in 1985… And concerning the XX chromosom claim, you should never forget that there was already a DNA study done in Texas by doctor Trion in the 1990s from a blood sample taken on the Shroud and his conclusion was that the DNA was so degraded that all it was possible for him to confirm was this : 1 The blood is human blood. 2 The blood was from a man. I didn’t mention this DNA study in my recent paper about the bloodstain evidence because it was an unautorized study.

Despite the fact that Levi Setti has not published his spectra, it’s obvious that the information pretending that he was able to independently confirmed the first results obtained by Kohlbeck is solid. In his paper with Nitowski, Kohlbeck refers to the results obtained by Levi Setti with his ion mass spectroscopy imaging microanalysis technique and if the information he gave was really untrue or incorrect, I think it’s fair to assume that Levi Setti would have strongly denied this assertion. Since he didn’t do it (in fact, as Thibault said, it looks like it’s precisely the opposite), I don’t see why we should put so much doubt versus these matching results obtained by Kohlbeck first and then by Levi Setti… In my mind, here’s 3 very good reason why we should trust this reported good chemical match between the sample from the Shroud and the sample taken inside a rock tomb in Jerusalem : 1 There is no good reason to doubt the validity of the samples that were analyzed (unlike the validity of the DNA sample supposedly from the Shroud that gave a so called positive result for a XX chromosome). The sample from the Shroud was taken by Ray Rogers in 1978 and that’s him who gave it personally to Kohlbeck in 1982 (less than 4 years after) for some analyses. In that case, the “chain of custody” can easily be established and I don’t think there’s any doubt that Rogers was able to make sure his samples suffered no external contamination. 2 There is no good reason to doubt the honesty, the expertise and/or the validity of Kohlbeck and Levi Setti or the techniques of analysis they used on those dirt samples. 3 The sample taken in Jerusalem was not the only aragonite sample that was provide by Nitowski for comparative analysis with the Shroud sample. In fact, she took 8 others samples from 7 other places in Israel and all these other samples too were analyzed by Kohlbeck and Levi Setti and nevertheless, the only sample that offered a good match with the Shroud sample was the one coming from inside a tomb in Jerusalem. That was good enough for Nitowski to state this : “From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Therefore, the match between Jerusalem and the shroud is a valid one. The Shroud of Turin was indeed in Jerusalem at one time during its history.” To me (Yannick), the fact that they analyzed other aragonite samples from different locations provide very good “control” samples that offers a very good insurance against the possibility of a “false positive” result concerning the sample from Jerusalem. The simple fact that the chemical signature of the aragonite dirt changed so much as close as 30 miles away from Jerusalem is a very good indicator that the Jerusalem aragonite possess some very distinct chemical characteristics that can be offer good points of comparison for a comparative analysis. Again, the fact that the aragonite from Jerusalem is so distinct from the other regions of Palestine offer a pretty good insurance against “false positive” results. Of course, I agree with Gabriel that more comparative analyses should be done to confirm more firmly the result obtained by Kohlbeck and Levi Setti, but presently, I don’t see any good reason to really doubt the good chemical match that was found. And I have to say that I disagree a bit with another quote from Gabriel who said : “In my view, if everything around the aragonite could be confirmed independently in a more scientific way, the authenticity of the Shroud could be firmly established.” Even if the chemical match could be indepently confirmed one day, that would be enough in my mind to scientifically established the authenticity of the Shroud as being the one of Jesus of Nazareth because : 1 This confirmation of a good match between the aragonite from the Shroud and the aragonite from Jerusalem would not be an absolute proof that there is not another place in the world where the same kind of aragonite could be found. On the website shroudofturin4journalists.com created by Dan, we can read a comment made by Kohlbeck himself where he confirm this point of view. Here’s the quote: “Kolbeck acknowledges that this is not absolute proof that the Shroud was in Jerusalem and that there might be other places in the world — though none are known and it is statistically unlikely any will be found — where travertine aragonite has the identical trace chemical composition. It is also slightly possible though highly implausible that this dirt was applied by a forger.” (link : http://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/terms/travertine aragonite.htm). 2 Even if there could be an absolute confirmation that there is no other place in the world where we can find the same kind of aragonite, as we could read on Dan’s website, there would still be the possibility that a forger (while making a “natural” forgery using a real crucified corpse) could have taken some dirt in Jerusalem and put some on the cloth later on. Of course, this idea is highly unlikely, but nevertheless, it’s scientifically impossible to discard it completely. 3 Even if there could be an absolute confirmation that there is no place in the world where we can find the same kind of aragonite and if we could be 100% that a forger could not have artificially put some dirt from Jerusalem of the cloth, all this piece of evidence could really tell us is this : The man of the Shroud was most probably really beaten, scourged and crucified in the immediate region of Jerusalem. In itself, this fact wouldn’t be enough to give us the identity of this man (without any doubt). Effectively, this fact may apply to another person than Jesus who would have suffered the same exact tortures than him (scenario #2 in my paper) in the region of Jerusalem (most probably done by the Romans during the time crucifixion was still legally practice by them)… It may also apply to the unwilling victim of a forger who wanted to use a real body to produced a false relic of Christ (scenario #1 in my paper). In this case, the tortures and crucifixion of this victim would have been done in the Jerusalem area by this forger (or by the authorities who were conniving with the forger). Scientifically speaking, even if these 2 ideas appeared quite unlikely at first sight, it’s impossible to reject them completely. This aragonite evidence versus the identity of the man of the Shroud is a perfect example of all the things I have to analyzed in the paper I’m currently writting that will deals with the second part of the question of the authenticity of the Shroud, i.e. The question of the identity of the man of the Shroud. For this paper, I do an exhaustive analysis of every pertinent data versus each one of the possible scenario I have described in my first paper. It’s a very long and hard task….","date":"2012-08-29","mins":"10:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/barrie-schwortz-announces-latest-changes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-website-stera-inc/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz Announces Latest Changes to the Shroud of Turin Website (STERA, Inc.)"},{"id":"comment-15662","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s a reply to Thibault’s recent comment that we found here : https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/barrie schwortz announces latest changes to the shroud of turin website stera inc/#comment 15619 If that’s not true that Levi Setti analyzed the other samples from other Palestinian site, then I agree : more analyses need to be done. But on the other hand, here’s a quote from Nitowski : “Limestone (calcium) samples were collected from as far south as 30 miles from Jerusalem to as far north as the Galilee and Mt. Carmel. As previously reported, Kohlbeck and Damian had matched a heavy calcium concentration from the foot area on the Shroud of Turin to samples collected in Jerusalem. This evidence was called into question, so sampling around Israel was performed to assertain if such a test was valid. From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Therefore, the match between Jerusalem and the shroud is a valid one. The Shroud of Turin was indeed in Jerusalem at one time during its history.” This important quote is a proof that there was a comparative analysis done by Kohlbeck and Damian and that they didn’t found any other good chemical match between the sample from the Shroud and the other Palestinian samples. That’a a very important fact concerning this topic. Unfortunatelly, from what Thibault said (and unlike the good match between the Shroud and the Jerusalem samples), this fact still need to be independently confirmed. Does anyone know what has happen with these samples ? Where they are ? Who own them ? Did they were preserved correctly to avoid any contamination ? And most importantly : Would they still represent valid samples to be independently analyzed ? Anyway, I think that someone specialized in this field should try hard to get new samples from Palestine and other places in the world were travertine aragonite could be found and should try to scientifically confirmed the results obtained by Kohlbeck and Damian. In other words, someone should do the job that Levi Setti sould have done back then !!!! Anyway, no matter what people can think about this issue, I still think the aragonite match is one of the most underated fact that exist concerning the Shroud… I understand the great reserve that exist for the pollen analysis because of the bad state of the samples used, but for this particular issue, I have absolutely no doubt about the validity of the samples that were used in this comparative study and that’s the main reason why I choose to put my trust in the results published by Kohlbeck and Nitowski. I will stuck to this conclusion until another expert in this field can scientifically prove that Kohlbeck and Levi Setti results were wrong and/or can scientifically prove that the particular type of aragonite that exist in Jerusalem can easily been found elsewhere in the world. I really think that THE BURDEN OF THE PROOF NOW LIES ON THE SHOULDERS OF THOSE (LIKE GABRIEL) WHO DON’T TRUST KOHLBECK AND LEVI SETTI’S RESULTS. That’s important to understand this aspect of the question. One last thing : I agree with Thibault’s own conclusion that if the Shroud is a forgery (remember that it is now a proven fact that it cannot be an artistic forgery and it could only be a “natural” kind of forgery using a real corpse of a crucified man – see my paper on the subject), the idea of a forger who would have put some Jerusalem in the heel region of his false shroud of Christ appeared highly unlikely to say the least. In the present paper I wrote now, here’s what I say about that : “Another possible solution is to think that the forger took some aragonite dirt in the Jerusalem area and put it later on the Shroud in order to create a relic more “authentic” or to sanctify his work, but these reasons are truly speculative in reality. If we replace the situation in the context of an anonymous forger who simply wanted to make a false relic, there seem to be no good and rational reason why this person would have wanted to artificially put some aragonite dirt from Jerusalem in the region of the victim’s heel. This was precisely the opinion of Joseph Kohlbeck, the cristallographer who was the first to analyze this dirt, when he said that this idea was slightly possible though highly implausible. In reality, it seems much more probable that this dirt really stained the heel of the man of the Shroud naturally while he was walking barefoot in the region of Jerusalem. Logically, there’s two moments when this could have happened: 1 during his scourging, when he was completely nude or 2 when he was walking barefoot during the carrying of his cross from the tribunal to the place of execution. Because this conclusion is most likely correct, the idea that the forger would have artificially put some aragonite dirt on the Shroud appears to be untenable. We have to conclude that the chances are very strong that the man of the Shroud was really executed and buried in the region of Jerusalem. Nevertheless, while this is a fact that no aragonite dirt with the same chemical signature than the one coming from the Shroud and from Jerusalem has been found elsewhere in the world, there is still a slim possibility that this same kind of aragonite dirt can really exist somewhere else. So, if we base our judgement only on this aragonite evidence alone, it is scientifically impossible to be 100% certain if the man of the Shroud was really executed and buried in Jerusalem, even though the chemical signature and the particular location of the aragonite dirt present on the Shroud must be considered as a very important clue that point in that direction. But when we take a more global view of the data from the Shroud and really put together all the relevant facts (i.e. The very particular chemical signature and location of the aragonite dirt that was found on the cloth, the complete absence of a wool contamination on the cloth, the “Masada” type of stitching, etc.), we have no other choice than to conclude that if the Shroud is really the product of a “natural” forgery, the man of the Shroud was most probably tortured, crucified and buried in the region of Jerusalem.” I think this is a pretty fair comment from me that gives a pretty good summary of the outcome of this finding by Kohlbeck (in the case this finding is correct of course). Be sure of one thing : I tried to stay honest while I was writting it. That’s where I stand right now in my reflection on this particularly interesting subject….","date":"2012-08-31","mins":"4:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/barrie-schwortz-announces-latest-changes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-website-stera-inc/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz Announces Latest Changes to the Shroud of Turin Website (STERA, Inc.)"},{"id":"comment-15668","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Error of typing.

In a perfect world, I agree with you, that’s the only data we should trust. But because there was only one true direct series of researches on the Shroud (STURP in 1978), presently, I think we should try to separate what has good chances to be true than what appear to be crap (or at least, what don’t rest on solid bases). By doing this process of filtration, I don’t say we should trust blindly all the things we could evaluate has being “credible”, but at least, we should considere them as good “clues” in this big puzzle that is the Shroud of Turin ! That’s how I try to evaluate data that still need independent confirmation (and there’s a lot). After much reflection, I came out convinced that, for all the reasons I already mention in this paper, that Kohlbeck results and conclusion have some good chanes to be correct. Much more than let’s say the supposed writtings or flower or coin images on the Shroud. My argument here is based on the most probable validity of Rogers and Nitowski’s samples and on the fact that Kohlbeck and Levi Setti are real experts in their scientific fields and used good scientific methods to analyzed their samples. I couldn’t say the same thing for a guy like Fanti who’s just an engineer and is very far from being considered an expert in chemistry and microscopy the way Rogers was (just an example) ! I hope you understand my method of filtration !!! That’s how I proceed versus all the data coming from the Shroud that still need to get scientific confirmation. If I came out convinced of the validity of the method used, along with the credibility of the researcher who did the testing, I conclude that this particular data should be considered as a good “clue” that can help us to understand part of the mystery of the Shroud. Concerning the particular subject of the aragonite, I’m still convinced of the validity of the matching result obtain by Kohlbeck concerning the Shroud and the Jerusalem samples because it was backed up by Levi Setti own independent analysis (even if he never published his own result himself). The fact is this : I don’t see any good reason to think that there could be some sort of pro shroud bias there (or some pro shroud conspiracy !). And because of what Thibault told us about the lack of confirmation by Levi Setti for the other samples taken by Nitowski elsewhere in Palestine, I think just have to be more prudent versus the result obtained by Kohlbeck that they did not offer a good match with the Shroud or the Jerusalem samples, but without having to consider these results as “problematic” or “very doubtful”. I don’t see any good reason to think like that. Don’t forget that this was Rogers who choose Kohlbeck to analyze the dirt sample he had. If he did that, I’m sure that was because he was convinced that this guy was a real expert in his field of crystallography. Of course, some can say that it was also Rogers who gave many samples to Mc Crone !!! But before we could learn how anti shroud this guy was, most of the scientific community was considering him a well respected scientist in his field of microscopy. How Rogers could have known the great anti Shroud bias that he had ? All this to say that I don’t see good reasons to doubt the results of Kohlbeck and I don’t see good reasons to doubt his profesionnalism (the fact that he wrongly refers to a paper of Levi Setti while he should have simply mentioned in his paper the results of the independent analysis on the dirt samples done by this expert is not enough in my mind to doubt his honesty). Love it or not, in my upcoming paper concerning the question of the identity of the man of the Shroud, I will used this data to support the probable fact that the man of the Shroud was tortured, crucified and buried in the immediate region of Jerusalem. I know this will leave the door open to criticism but I don’t care. That’s what I think and I’m free to choose which data should be kept (like the aragonite evidence) and which data should be left out (like the so called pollen evidence) for a study like mine. Finally, of course, I agree totally with what you say about the great validity of the bloodstains evidence (that was even backed up recently by Dr. Kelly Kearse concerning the probable validity of the AB blood typing found by Baima Bollone). That’s precisely why I decided to put the bloodstains evidences at the heart of my argumentation in my recent paper, because this is most probably the topic concerning the Shroud that science possess the best amount of solid data and that science can explain with the most certainty. Don’t you think it would be great if that was the case also for all the other issues regarding the Shroud ???

Instead of “Because of that, it is scientifically impossible to be 100% certain if the man of the Shroud was really executed and buried in Jerusalem”, it is now written : “So, if we base our judgement strickly on this aragonite evidence alone, it is scientifically impossible to be 100% certain if the man of the Shroud was really executed and buried in Jerusalem.” I think this phrase is much more true and precise in this new form. And right after that, here’s what I wrote : “But when we take a more global view of the data from the Shroud and really put together all the relevant facts (i.e. The very particular chemical signature and location of the aragonite dirt that was found on the cloth, the complete absence of a wool contamination on the cloth, the “Masada” type of stitching, etc.), we have no other choice than to conclude that if the Shroud is really the product of a “natural” forgery (note: this quote is taken from the part where I analyze the first scenario that you find in my paper about the bloodstains evidence, i.e. A “natural” forgery), the man of the Shroud was most probably tortured, crucified and buried in the region of Jerusalem.” In order for you to understand easily all my quote, here it is again (in his full version) : “…while this is a fact that no aragonite dirt with the same chemical signature than the one coming from the Shroud and from Jerusalem has been found elsewhere in the world, there is still a slim possibility that this same kind of aragonite dirt can really exist somewhere else. So, if we base our judgement strickly on this aragonite evidence alone, it is scientifically impossible to be 100% certain if the man of the Shroud was really executed and buried in Jerusalem, even thought the chemical signature and the particular location of the aragonite dirt present on the Shroud must be considered as a very important clue that point in that direction. But when we take a more global view of the data from the Shroud and really put together all the relevant facts (i.e. The very particular chemical signature and location of the aragonite dirt that was found on the cloth, the complete absence of a wool contamination on the cloth, the “Masada” type of stitching, etc.), we have no other choice than to conclude that if the Shroud is really the product of a “natural” forgery, the man of the Shroud was most probably tortured, crucified and buried in the region of Jerusalem.” I think it’s a pretty good footnote….","date":"2012-08-27","mins":"9:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/barrie-schwortz-announces-latest-changes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-website-stera-inc/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz Announces Latest Changes to the Shroud of Turin Website (STERA, Inc.)"},{"id":"comment-15527","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Erratum : In the quote from my upcoming paper, you should read “even though” and not “even thought”.

For example, I would like to read some credible scientific papers that can prove us the validity of these alternative methods of dating. While I wait for this, I remain highly skeptical about the validity of the mechanical method that has been used, especially regarding a cloth like the Shroud that has been so much manipulated over the centuries, which could certainly had an effect on the mechanical parameters of the linen fibers that were analyzed by Fanti, because if these fibers were really originating from the original cloth, that mean they are all tiny broken fibers collected in the dust vaccuumed by Riggi that were submitted to a very high stress over the years. I really doubt such broken fibrils can truly be representative of the main body of the Shroud… I am also skeptical regarding the two chemical methods used, mainly because of the high risks of contamination related to these tiny broken fibrils found in the dust samples by Fanti et al..","date":"2013-03-29","mins":"8:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"id":"comment-28767","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Bullshit dude.

Will it be the same journal which always publish anything from him? If that’s the one, then sorry but that will not elevate the credibility of his claim that much to me… Quote: “Third, the decision to publish Fanti’s book at Easter, before Fanti’s paper appeared in the journal, is the book’s PUBLISHER, not Fanti’s.” Answer: How do you know this? So, you think Fanti has not a word to say about the date of release of his own book? Come on!!! Quote: “Ad hominem fallacy. And again, as I pointed out, it is the NORM today that scientists publish their findings in the popular media before they are published in scientific journals, and publications like Science Daily and Live Science exist for that very purpose. And that is not just today. Twenty five years ago, the results of the three C 14 laboratories’ tests, that the Shroud was dated 1260 1390, were announced in a PRESS CONFERENCE on 13 October 1988, FOUR MONTHS before they appeared in the scientific journal that they were submitted to, Nature, 16 February 1989. Does that thereby make the C 14 scientists not “credible and honest”?” Announcing some results at a press conference while you’re sure to be publish in a highly respected peer reviewed journal is one thing and selling a book for popular crowds before being published in a scientific journal that accept almost everything you submit for publication is another thing in my mind… But in the end, I don’t care too much. That’s not the most important thing to note about this whole affair… No, the most important thing to remember is this: Fanti can claim anything he wants on the basis of his analysis of his very old and questionable dust samples, but he will never be able to get largely accepted these as proven facts regarding the Shroud by the scientific community. Again, that’s the reality, because of the highly questionable aspect of the samples he used and also because of the highly suspicion that exist versus the honesty, integrity and profesionnalism of the man. So, before some of Fanti’s claims can be accepted as true facts by the scientific community, be sure that it will take more than a peer reviewed journal publication, especially if this publication happen in the same journal in which Fanti always publish his works about the Shroud. In fact, it will take another round of direct researches on the Shroud that could scientifically confirm them.

Obviously, Fanti did exactly the contrary and that’s speak very loud to me. THAT’S NOT THE WAY IT’S SUPPOSE TO BE IN SCIENCE. I remember that when Garlaschelli made a press conference to claim he had reproduced the Shroud, people in the pro Shroud world were completely offended by this kind of acting. Why would it be different for our friend Fanti??? As I also said the other day (https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/28/an inevitable dispute fanti and the archbishop/#comment 28612), until Fanti’s conclusion can be scientifically confirmed by a new series of direct testing on the Shroud, all his claims will remain anecdotal at best. It’s just totally impossible and unscientific to use these results, which were made with highly questionable samples that were taken long ago (and that are still waiting for proper confirmation), in order to proclaim that the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus or anything of that nature.

Really? And what about the possibility that this cloth could be the authentic burial cloth of another criminal who would have been tortured like the Jesus of the Gospel? Even though this is evidently a pretty weak hypothesis if we place it on a probabilistic scale, no one here has the right to discard it completely… And what about the possibility that this cloth could be the authentic burial cloth of an imitator of Christ’s Passion who lived during the 3rd or 4th century AD, like an anchorite for example? Remember that those persons were well known for their desire to imitate the suffering of Christ… Again, even though this is another pretty weak hypothesis if we place it on a probabilistic scale, no one can completely discard it so far. Note that in both cases, the image on the cloth would have been formed by a natural interaction between the cloth and the dead body it covered, which is, in the present state of our knowledge, the very best hypothesis that exist to explain it, even though the exact process still wait to be completely described. I think you should start to explore other possible avenues other than the idea that the Shroud can only be the authentic burial cloth of Jesus or a simple forgery (and remember that if it is a forgery, it can only be a forgery made with a real tortured and crucified corpse, since the STURP team has been able to prove that the image on the cloth cannot be the product of any known form of artistic technique)..","date":"2013-03-31","mins":"10:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"id":"comment-32086","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This phrase represent a very good example of the fabulous sense of humor of my friend Barrie….","date":"2013-04-27","mins":"5:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/26/barrie-schwortz-isnt-it-funny-how-god-always-picks-a-jew-to-be-the-messenger/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz: Isn’t it funny how God always picks a Jew to be the messenger"},{"id":"comment-32089","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Effectively, this is a good one.

Therese of Lisieux), the story of some apparitions (like the Marian apparitions to Bernadette in Lourdes) or the story of some great signs (like the Eucharistic miracle of Lanciano) are also good insurance for my faith.

In other words, Barrie don’t see a proof or even a sign of the resurrection of Christ on this cloth, but nevertheless, he believe that this is a real burial shroud and, mainly because of the injuries due to a cap of thorns, he also believe that it cannot belong to someone else than Jesus of Nazareth (the Jesus of History).

The fact that some written documents (even if there’s only a few) exists should not be enough for you to, at least, be prudent regarding that possible hypothesis instead of puting the tag “invented” over it. You must also acknowledge the possible authentic coffin that is still kept in the Ray sur Saône castle (Othon de la Roche’s castle in France) and that could have been used to preserved the Shroud for a while… Personally, I think it’s much more prudent to keep this possible path for the Shroud (Constantinople Athens Ray sur Saône Lirey) open while we wait for historians to make more research about this particular option. IF (the “if” is important) the Shroud was really in Constantinople at the time of the sack of the city and reappeared in Lirey around 1357, then I think the city of Athens should be considered as one truly possible place where the Shroud could have been kept for a while after the sack….","date":"2012-09-02","mins":"5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/01/hat-trick-to-freeman-jones-unhorsed-too-bad/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Hat trick to Freeman!

One would have been written by Alexios V Doukas (the one who was the Emperor of Constantinople at the moment of the sack : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexios V Doukas) and the other would have been written in August 1st, 1205 by Theodore Komnenos Doukas Angelos (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore Komnenos Doukas). Both letters mentioned the presence of the Shroud in Athens and the second letter (the one of Theodore Komnenos Doukas Angelos) even state that it was not the Venetians crusaders who have stolen the Shroud but the French crusaders. The letter states that the Venetians were more interested by the gold that could be found in Constantinople. Scavone talk about the first letter I mentioned in page 3 of a recent article he published : http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Scavone Besancon Web.pdf This letter was reported by Antoine Legrand (the great Shroud scholars from France) in an article published in 1982 and entitled “Du nouveau pour le Suaire de Turin : Une lettre de l’empereur Alexis V”.

To me, the fact that Wilson is an opportunist is so obvious ! In 1978, the STURP team anounced that they will do a great series of direct researches on the Shroud, and totally by chances, a few time before they came to Turin, Wilson published his first book on the Shroud ! Then, right between the 1998 and the 2000 public showings of the Shroud, he published another book on the subject (The Blood and the Shroud). Then, right before the 2010 public showing, he published yet another book on the subject (Shroud Fake or Fact). Of course, all this is just an accident ! There’s no connexion at all between these big media covers of the Shroud and the books he published on the Shroud… Nice or not, If that’s not being opportunist, I don’t know what it is… And no, I really don’t consider Wilson and Scavone has “good historians”. First, Wilson is not even an historian, he is a journalist (just like Fanti is not a chemist or a microscopist but he is a engineer !). Secondly, when you defend a very unlikely hypothesis (that rest mainly on special assumptions) at all cost like Wilson do (and Scavone too behind him), that’s not what I call doing good history. That’s more doing good propaganda. And for Guscin, he tried to remain more neutral even though it’s evident that he is very friendly toward Wilson and his hypothesis. At least, he don’t get too far into the propaganda that’s going on in the Shroud world about this weak hypothesis and that contribute greatly to kill the few amount of credibility that sindonology may still have.

Of course, if you have already made up your mind and believe blindly in Wilson’s ideas, good for you and neither hi or Freeman will change anything to your point of view. But for those who still have an open mind about this subject, I just want to say that you can trust me and Freeman on the main point, which is : Wilson’s hypothesis is wrong ! Period. We got to search for another answer concerning the Shroud’s obscure years instead of being stuck with this weak hypothesis, just like it was a proven and accepted theory (which is very far from being the case) !!! I think scholars today should take the great work and conclusions of Vignon and try to start from there. For Vignong (and for me), the Mandylion was NOT the Shroud but the Mandylion WAS based on the Shroud’s image. When we consider all the historical and artistic facts that exist on the subject (there’s a lot and you can learn many of them in my article as well as in the article of M. Freeman) without forgetting anything and with honesty, we have no other choice than to conclude that Vignong’s conclusion is probably correct. Of course, this cannot be proven without any doubt, but using the Occam’s razor principle to evaluates all the possibles solutions that exist in link with all the known historical and artistic facts, Vignon’s conclusion must come on top of your list of possible explanation concerning the Shroud and the Mandylion (and also some other so called miraculous images of the living Christ that came out at the same time – second half of the 6th century – than the Mandylion). I still don’t understand perfectly why most English speaking pro shroudies have so much problem to admit that Wilson’s hypothesis as some chances (great chances in my mind) to be wrong, while the alternative hypothesis of Vignon is not anti shroud at all ! In fact, if Vignon is correct (as I think he is), then that mean the Shroud was present in the Middle East during the second half of the 6th century ! I know that it is still far from the 1st century A.D., but nevertheless it’s much better than the date given by the C14 labs in 1988 and allowed us to eliminate of our minds some possibilities of a medieval or Byzantine forger (around Constantinople or in Europe) that would have used the corpse of a real crucified man to produce a false relic between the second half of the 10th century (when we found the first written mention of a Shroud of Christ present in Constantinople) and the first public showing of the Shroud in Lirey, around 1357. That’s a great step in the right direction no ? Why being so stuck to Wilson’s hypothesis like there was no other possible solutions to explain the Shroud’s ancient history ??? I have a hard time to understand this reality.

The fact that there is absolutely no coloration on the Shroud outside the body image is the most compelling fact that shows there was NO burial products used during the burial of the Shroud man, which is TOTALLY consistent with the Gospels, except for the Gospel of John. However, if we believe Pierre Barbet’s hypothesis that a mixture of aloes and myrrh in powder has possibly been used but only in smaller cloths used as bags and put all around the dead body inside the Shroud to remove bad odours and retard a bit the arrival of the first liquid of putrefaction, this would wonderfully explain why the STURP team (Rogers especially) never found any traces of aloes and myrrh on the cloth! Let me suggest all the readers to read this previous comment of mine in which I detailed this particular argument related to the total absence of a coloration outside the body image on the Shroud which goes against the possibility that there was aloes and myrrh applied directly on the cloth and/or on the body during the burial : https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is it absurd to think that the shroud can show a physical trace of the resurrection/#comment 20623 Maybe I’m wrong but I think I’m the very first one to have come up with such an argument that is based on Pellicori’s coloration experiments. There are some things that are very important to note from these experiments: 1 ALL the ancient burial products tested by Pellicori ALWAYS gave a visible color on his linen samples. 2 The coloration was a latent one and needed the use of the backing technique (to simulate ageing) in order to became visible on the cloth. 3 Except for the aloes, all the other ancient burial products used by Pellicori gave a color on linen that was very close to the Shroud’s image spectal characteristics. 4 Even a very light contact between a product and the linen cloth was enough for Pellicori to obtain a visible color on linen after baking. And now, concerning Dave’s comment about the very probable fact that the Shroud’s image is located ONLY in a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers without having affected the fiber itself in any way, I see that my teaching have finally produced some fruits!!!! HA HA HA!!! This was one of my goal to make people around here understand this very probable fact because this question is crucial when it comes to evaluate to level of similarity of one particular image formation hypothesis. And finally, here’s an advice for Thibault (if he can read this): Don’t you think you have lost enough time arguing with someone like Colin Berry who is not even able to understand that the evidence of the bloodstains on the Shroud is well enough to conclude that the Shroud is NOT the product of any form of artistic forgery???.","date":"2012-12-23","mins":"7:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/22/a-note-to-thibault-heimburger-from-colin-berry/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"A note to Thibault Heimburger from Colin Berry?"},{"id":"comment-21045","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I truly think that if the chromophore of the Shroud’s image would have been a colored layer of aloes and myrrh residing on top of the cloth, some traces of these products would have been easily found by Rogers and the rest of the STURP team.

A “must read” article for anyone who is interested in Shroud science!!! It’s interesting to note that Pellicori used his results to back up his personal hypothesis that the Shroud’s image was a natural one that came from an anointing of the corpse prior to his deposit into the Shroud, but this idea is inconsistent with the fact that there are some bloodstains and scourge marks located in places where there is absolutely no body image (no coloration) and also with the general lack of distortion in the body image even though we know for a fact that at some point during the burial of the Shroud man, a good portion of his corpse must have been in direct contact with the cloth. This fact come from the presence of bloodstains and scourge marks almost everywhere in the body image zones (front and back), while we know very well that all these stains could only have come from a direct contact. In this context, there’s no doubt that if the body would have been anointed, there would have been some colored stains in the actual places where there are some off body bloodstains and scourge marks and also, the resulting body image would have been seriously distorted if it would have been formed by a direct contact with an anointed body, the way described by Pellicori.

Besides the observations of Adler, if we compare a partially burned thread from the Shroud that come from the edge of a zone destroyed by the 1532 fire with a thread taken in the body image area, radical differences appeared. Threads affected by the fire show a carbonized edge. Image threads show alteration concentrated to the most superficial fibrils. To manufacture a shroud, it would need to find a system to extend a long piece of cloth of the dimension of the Shroud and keep it rigorously parallel to a big bas relief maintained continuously at 220 degree Celcius. This requires a series of devices and mechanisms that could only be installed in a well equip and modern laboratory… Also, experiments clearly showed that the images obtained by heating a linen cloth tend to penetrate inside the fibers, while the image of the Shroud is restricted to their surface. Experimental images vanished with time, on the contrary to what happened for the Shroud. Finally, zones that were scorched by the fire are fluorescent, while the body image area on the Shroud are not. For all these reasons, it should be radically excluded that the image on the Shroud was produced by heat.” This opinion of Baima Bollone look pretty much like the one I expressed yesterday, especially concerning the FACT that it would need modern technologies to create a complete body image (front and back) on a long piece of linen like the Shroud. And noticed that Baima Bollone don’t even mentioned the evidence of the bloodstains that show without a doubt that this Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real crucified body. And finally, here’s another important thing to remember that come from Ray Rogers : If the chromophore of the image is really a thin layer of impurities residing on top of the most superficial fibers of the Shroud, it is almost impossible that heat (or any other kind of energetic radiation) could have affected ONLY this thin layer of impurity while leaving the surface of the linen fiber undamaged and clean like it was seen with the ghosts of color or after the color had been reduced with a strong chemical reagent. So, it’s up to you to still lose your time with this impossible hypothesis in the context of a Byzantine or medieval forgery. And as I said, in the context of the Resurrection of Christ, this idea of a heating of the cloth is almost as untenable because of the reasons mentioned by Baima Bollone above and also, if Rogers hypothesis of the chromophore is true, this kind of supernatural heating would also have to be considered almost impossible… And concerning the comment of Barrie Schwortz, I knew that Rogers thought that there was another process going on but after reading all of his writing, you can be sure that he never considered heat as a possible solution, especially in the context of the chromophore being ONLY a thin layer of impurities on the surface of the fiber… So, what can be this other process ? I think science should look at possible biological chemical reactions that could occured between a crucified body that has been tortured for hours prior to death and the thin layer of impurities postulated by Rogers. Why not checking out more deeply the Volckringer pattern process ? Maybe that could give us some clues ?

We would expect to see color in the center of the cloth. WE DO NOT.” So, we can say that if there really is a superficial body image of the hair on the back of the cloth as describe by Fanti in one of his paper, it will be a very good scientific proof that heat had nothing to do with the image formation process. Of course, the “if” is important because we cannot consider the conclusion of Fanti as definitive… Anyway, that’s another argument that can well be very good against this particular hypothesis (or any other hypothesis involving other kinds of energetic radiations). Elsewhere in his book, Rogers add: “The lower density of the hair makes it UNLIKELY that large amounts of either HEAT OR RADIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN THE HAIR.” And in another place in his book, we can read this comment that Rogers consider to be a FACT: “Image formation proceeded at NORMAL TEMPERATURES in the absence of energetic radiation of any kind.” And don’t forget the other important argument of Rogers concerning heat or other types of energetic radiations : “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was improbable that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source : the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was NO MORE DEFECTIVE than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” So, after taking account of what Baima Bollone and Rogers said about scorch and heat, can we please start looking in another more rational direction (I think possible biological chemical reactions between a thin layer of impurities and a fresh tortured corpse are the right place to start searching) in order to find a proper answer to the “mystery” of the body image ???.","date":"2012-09-14","mins":"9:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/13/an-email-from-colin-berry/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"An Email from Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-16358","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Read the message I just wrote to Ron just above.

There’s also another interesting hypothesis that was proposed years ago by English Dr. Alan Mills about a possible molecular transfer of singlet oxygen molecules coming from the superficial cells of the skin… As you can see, there’s many biological chemical interactions that could have been at work at the same time inside the Shroud and more research is truly needed to verify all these hypothesis properly.

That was exactly the purpose of my recent paper that was published on shroudn.com and on the website of the Holy Shroud Guild ! On the question of the authenticity of the Shroud and on the question of the image formation process, people ALWAYS tend to neglect the great set of data that comes from the blood and serum stains… Like I wrote in my paper, this great set of data is well enough for science to give us 2 very important conclusions about the Shroud : 1 THE SHROUD IS NOT AN ARTWORK OF ANY KIND, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BLOODSTAINS CLEARLY INDICATE THAT IT IS A REAL BURIAL SHROUD THAT ENVELOPED, FOR LESS THAN 72 HOURS, A REAL MAN WHO WAS TORTURED, SCOURGED, CROWNED WITH THORNS AND DIED BY CRUCIFIXION. 2 THE BODY IMAGE ON THE SHROUD MUST ABSOLUTELY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOME FORM OF INTERRACTION BETWEEN THE CLOTH AND THIS TORTURED AND CRUCIFIED BODY. I’m sorry for all the Colins of the world but these conclusion are solid enough to categorically reject the scorch hypothesis proposed by Colin and others along the years. So, can we please start to concentrate of possible natural image formation processes that are related to some kind of interaction between a crucified body that has been tortured for a long period of time and an ancient linen cloth that most probably contain a thin layer of carbohydrates and polysaccharides impurities on his surface ?

So why wasting your time boys on that dead end road ??? Don’t you realized that the Shroud is a real Shroud of a real crucified man who left lots of mirror images of humid blod clots (with some liquid post mortem blood at the feet) PRIOR to the formation of the body image ? I think you should read again my paper about the evidence of the bloodstains if you’re still not convinced of these basic SCIENTIFIC FACTS. Consequently, the body image HAS to come from some kind of interaction between the corpse and the cloth and has I know, a dead body never emit enough heat to scorch a linen cloth !!! He he ! : ) Colin, Thibault and all the rest should spend their precious time searching what possible biological chemical reactions could produce a superficial image like the one that is on the Shroud instead of chasing this wild rabbit (the scorch hypothesis) that has been set aside a long time ago by science) ? Really, I don’t understand. It’s like someone who would still try to reproduce the Shroud with a painting or a rubbing technique. Wake up folks ! All these things have already been set aside by science !!! THE SHROUD IS NOT AN ARTWORK. PERIOD. If it was, it’s been a very long time since we would have been able to reproduce it !!! And if you’re still not convinced, then just show me one artist that can reproduced the bloodstains we see on the Shroud with that degree of forensic detail, along with the same nature (i.e. A blood that don’t come from a complete blood in liquid form but from exudates of blood clots). As Adler wrote cleverly about that : “We have shown by immunological tests that the blood is definitely primate blood, and that it must have been taken from the exudate of a clot at a certain point in the clotting process. An artist would therefore have needed the exudate from the wounds of a severely tortured man, or baboon, and he would need to take the substance within a 20 minute period after the clotting had begun, and paint it on the cloth with the serum edges and all the other forensic precision that we see there. I believe most reasonable people would conclude that it is simply impossible that an artist could have produced the blood imprints on the Shroud of Turin. Rather, it is logical to conclude, from the nature and characteristics of the bloodstains on the Shroud, that the cloth once enfolded the body of a severely beaten and crucified human being.” After reading this comment from Adler, I think I don’t have anything more to say except that in my book, it’s a total waste of time to still verify any of these artwork techniques versus the Shroud. All this time would be better spend in searching for a possible biological chemical interaction between a dead corpse that has been tortured for a long period of time prior to his death and a linen Shroud made with an antique method. I dream of the day when people interested in the Shroud’s image formation will focus on this instead of losing their time again and again on any artwork technique that you can imagine… After all, think about that fact : We have an image of a crucified body on a linen cloth. In that context, don’t you think the very best hypothesis would be that there was some kind of biological chemical interaction between these 2 features (the body and the cloth) ??? It’s pretty incredible to note how people tend to look anywhere but there when they seek an explanation for the Shroud !!!! It’s like there are only two extreme paths to follow : It must be an artwork of some sort or it must be a miraculous process of some sort linked with the Resurrection ! Can’t we get back in between please ??? In face of all the data, fact and observations we know about the Shroud, I’m convinced more than ever that it is the most rational direction to follow if we really want to find a scientific solution concerning the Shroud… And meditate on that: We already know that this is exactly the answer for the bloodstains (i.e. A complete biological and natural transfer that came from an interaction between a crucified corpse and a linen cloth) !!! So, why wouldn’t it be also the same kind of natural interaction that have created the body image on the Shroud (i.e. Some kind of still undetermined biological chemical reaction) ??? Right now, I really don’t see one good reason to search elsewhere… Because it’s supposed to be Jesus on the cloth ? That kind of thinking is totally unscientific and in fact, this is pure bullsh** !!! Sincerely, are we living in the modern era or are we getting back to the darkest age of the medieval time ? If we want to live like modern people, WE GOT TO FOLLOW THE FACTS. And right now, the facts are saying clearly and loud : The Shroud IS NOT the product of a forger who would have used some kind of a scorch technique. PERIOD. And if you think for 2 seconds that all this heat necessary to create the image came from the Resurrection, then BRAVO ! because you just step out of the scientific method because anyone knows that a dead body doesn’t emit that kind of heat….","date":"2012-09-13","mins":"4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/13/an-email-from-colin-berry/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"An Email from Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-16280","author":"yannick_clément","post":"No Ron… It is a well established FACT that a dead body CANNOT in any circumstances produced enough heat to scorch a linen cloth (or a thin layer of impurities on the surface).

In fact, that statement is most probably in contradiction with the way Barbet and Adler estimates most of the blood transfers on the Shroud ! Here’s just another way to see the blood stains outside the body image on the Shroud : If we take the blood outside the right elbow (letf elbow on the positive photo) on the Shroud, that stain could have been done while the persons involved in the burial were moving the corpse from the preparation table in the tomb (called “Onction stone” in the Holy Sepulchre) to his final resting place in another place in the tomb (probably a vaulted arch like you can see in the 3rd photo of this page : http://www.interbible.org/inter Bible/decouverte/archeologie/1999/arc 990305.htm). Imagine this scenario : Jesus died and wasn’t transferred to the tomb right away. At the time his body reached the tomb, almost all of the blood stains on the body had enough time to clot and were completely dried. Then, inside the tomb, the persons involved in the burial put the body inside the Shroud and draped the Shroud losely over the body without any linen strips to tied the body. They would have done this operation in a central room inside the tomb dedicated for that kind of job. Then, for an unknown reason, imagine the body resting there for 30 minutes, one hour, or more. That time off could have been enough for many clotted blood stains to get humid at their surface (because of what Pierre Barbet called “an aqueous environment” in which the body inside the Shroud was submit (remember that a dead body can still emit water vapor from every pore of the skin). Then, after that delay that cause an humidification of many blood clots at their surface, the persons involved in the burial took the body (still draped inside the Shroud) and move him with great care to his final resting place, on a stone tablet (probably inside a vaulted arch). This movement of the body could well have cause the Shroud to touch for a short time the back of the right elbow and cause the blood stain we see outside the body image, simply because a re arangement of the draping of the Shroud could have been done after the displacement of the body to his final place in the tomb. At that point, the Shroud could have been draped again nicely over the body (still losely draped without the use of any linen strips) with the result of moving this fresh blood stain on the cloth far enough from the right elbow that, when the body image formation occured (later), this blood stain wasn’t affected at all by it and the body image of the right elbow was formed away from the stain, giving the impression that the blood stain outside this elbow was the result of “some blood drained from the corpse to the fabric”. In fact, if my scenario is correct, the statement above is incorrect.

And concerning the unscientific aspect of your paper, I see at least one thing: You agreed in that paper with Jackson’s ludicrous hypothesis that pretend that some blood clots on the skin of the Shroud man have projected themselves at a distance and have left their images on the Shroud! Sorry but blood don’t project itself in the air!!! It’s scientifically impossible. The truth is this: All the bloodstains on the Shroud came from DIRECT CONTACT and this is a scientific fact my friend that you don’t seem to understand. And when someone understand that FACT, he also understand that, in order to get so many bloodstains on the cloth in so many places, you must have a very tight compression of the cloth on the corpse. And here’s another truth: The undistorted image that we see on the Shroud is TOTALLY INCONSISTENT with this kind of tight compression position of the cloth around the body! If the Shroud would have stayed that way around the body until the image formation process began, it’s obvious that the resulting image would have been seriously distorted, especially laterally. Consequently, a change of position from a tight compression position to a more looser and natural position MUST have occurred. But you’re right about the fact that there is no need to call for a miraculous intervention concerning such a change of position! All you have to do is understand that the body wasn’t placed in the Shroud in his final resting place inside the tomb (a stone bench), but was most probably placed inside the cloth in a central room (the tradition of the Holy Sepulchre call it the stone of the anointing). That mean there was at least one transfer done with the enshrouded body from that central place to the stone bench and it is easy to assume that such a manual transfer would have placed the shroud very close and tight with the body, which would have caused the formation of many of the bloodstains we see on the Shroud (including some located in places where there is no body image at all!). Then, you just have to assume that after the enshrouded body had been placed in his final resting place inside the tomb, the Shroud would have been replaced in a more natural and loose position by the people in charge of the burial. And only after this had been done, the image formation process really became active. Unlike Lavoie, such a rational scenario would not call for any divine intervention but nevertheless, I have to agree with this medecine expert that in order to get the bloodstains we see on the Shroud AND a undistorted body image, a change of position of the cloth MUST have occurred!!! Finally, concerning your belief versus the Shroud, no offense but I remember that, in one exchange of emails you did with me some years ago, you really seemed to favored some supernatural process to explain the image… I remember this because hearing that from a scientist like you was a shocker!

Again, the “if” is important here. But, at the same time, I wanted to state in my letter that, from my point of view, if I submit both chromophore hypothesis (the one by Rogers and the one by Fanti and Di Lazzaro) to Occam razor (while I consider the whole picture of the body images : their relationship with the banding effect, the fact that they are confined to the most external surface of the cloth, etc.), honestly, I come to the conclusion that Rogers hypothesis is better because it need less “special assumptions” in order to explain everything we know about the colored fibers of the Shroud. So, before people start to think that the ENEA’s experiments prove anything about the Shroud, I just say : Calm down people and please be prudent because those experiments can well be completely irrelevant to the body images we found on the cloth.

When you say that it happened only once in history, sorry but it’s not completely true ! Go see this paper from Barrie’s website : http://shroud.com/pdfs/mattress.pdf Also, in his book “101 questions about the Holy Shroud”, Baima Bollone reports some more burial cloths that are supposed to show a body image of the dead. It’s EXTREMELY RARE, but it seemed to have been reported a few times over the centuries. For the Jospine matress in particular, I don’t say it was exactly the same chemical process that was involve in the case of the Shroud body images, but THE FACT IS that nature can create body images on a cloth ! You can believe anything you want and it’s ok but please, don’t tell me that nature cannot create a body image on a cloth because it’s simply not true. This Jospine Matress is there to prove I’m right about that. Why a thing like that don’t happen more often ? My guess is this : Because all the physical, chemical and environmental elements and conditions that are needed to be present to create such an image are so improbable that it is extremely rare that it happen. Also, when do you see a dead being put out of his burial cloth before his body start to rot ? This is also extremely rare ! That’s another answer to explain why we don’t have many body images on cloths ! Because they rot with the dead !!!! So, you see, I don’t buy this (wrong) argument that the Shroud is alone in his category and that’s a proof that the image is miraculous.

I understand perfectly well what you say. I don’t agree with you about M. Fanti but that’s another story and it’s not relevant about what I want to respond to you. What I really want to say is this : There’s one important thing to remember : it’s not because science his not able for the moment to fully explain the body image that it means that it came from a by product of the resurrection ! The same thinking is true versus the fact that this cloth is supposed to belong to Jesus (which I think is true). In other word, it’s not because it’s the Shroud of Christ that it means the image on it has anything to do with the resurrection. I think I’m not alone to be a Catholic who believe in the resurrection and, at the same time, who don’t believe one second that this SPIRITUAL event was the source for the images. Don’t get me wrong here : I respect the belief of a guy like Ron because, unlike the Fantis of this world, he’s not someone who desperately want to use the Shroud as a banner to say : “Look what we have here ! A proof of the resurrection !”. It’s only when people who are supposed to be scientists (I’m not talking specifically of M. Fanti here because there’s many other like him) and despite that fact, wanted anyway to used the Shroud to promote some ideology that I raise the red flag and say : WOOOOO !!!! I’M AGAINST THIS KIND OF ACTING !!! I feel ok with the fact that people like Ron and maybe you or maybe Domenico believe the Shroud body images have been produced by a by product of the resurrection ! It’s your liberty and I live well with this. The only problem is when someone use science to promote this idea and make believe that the Shroud offer a PHYSICAL PROOF of the resurrection ! I’m against that because it’s not true ! PERIOD. All that M. Fanti has been able to do his to show that a plasma ball or a UV laser can create a coloration on linen that is near the coloration on the Shroud. Big deal ! I can responde that Sam Pellicori of STURP was able to show that sweat or myrrh or olive oil was able to create a coloration also very close to the Shroud image ! You see, coloring linen is pretty easy. But that don’t mean one bit that it is a proof that the Shroud image was done that way ! M. Fanti and M. Pellicori cannot pretend to have proven anything regarding the Shroud ! Of course, as I often said, the Shroud offer a SIGN of the resurrection because there was really a dead man (with all the stigmata of Christ) who was crucified in this cloth, but is body seemed to have disappeared completely before any signs of putrefaction and the blood stains didn’t seemed to have been disturb. What I just describe is not a proof. It is a sign. Only with the eyes of faith we can see a real sign of the resurrection there ! Why I react so hard against people like M. Fanti ? Because the fact that when he promote to the public his idea about a physical proof of the resurrection, he may convince some people to believe in Christ only on this poor base ! And I really think that basing his faith on the Shroud is a really bad thing… That’s why I react agains people who tend to propose the Shroud as the base for someone’s faith. With the eyes of faith, the Shroud is a sign, but it will never be a proof..","date":"2011-11-06","mins":"9:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/04/a-guest-posting-by-giulio-fanti/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by Giulio Fanti"},{"id":"comment-4656","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I should say that I also disagree with the kind of thing Fanti proposed and, be honest with me Maria, a corona discharge that happen in a sealed tomb with a dead corpse in it is not what I call a natural event.

Science will NEVER be able to prove resurrection (even if M. Fanti and many others try hard to convince people that it is the case). For example, to be able to prove his hypothesis, M. Fanti would have to take a fresh corpse and a linen shroud and try to recreate a corona discharge from inside this dead body and product a body images of it (ventral and dorsal) with all the same characteristics (physical and chemical) than the body images on the Shroud.

Simply because this kind of findings don’t go along too well with some burst of energy coming from the corpse at the moment of resurrection. M. Fanti believe that it was this kind of thing that change de C14 content. Sorry but this kind of belief (again, I was about to say something else) hasn’t been scientifically proved yet ! When you look at the way M. Fanti conclude his comment, it is pretty obvious to see where he stand in the world of the Shroud and it is surely not with the majority of the scientists on this planet… I would conclude with 2 questions for M. Fanti : 1 You think the Shroud proves the resurrection ? Show me the proof ! 2 You think that there’s some supernatural forces going on during the Marian apparitions in Medjugorje ? Show me the proof !

Along with this new C14 dating, I would not disagree to try some alternative methods but only if these methods have receive the approval of some credible experts in the field of dating ancient fabrics that would have previously verify the level of validity and accuracy of such methods.

And right now, I seriously doubt that there can be a more accurate method of dating ancient fabrics. Rogers’ own alternative method concerning the lack of vanillin can only be taken as a good clue to believe that the cloth is much older than the result given in 1989 for the C14 dating but it can’t go much further than this in my mind. Same thing for Fanti’s alternative methods. That’s why I keep thinking a new and more carefully done C14 test is truly necessary and should definately be included in a wider research protocol of direct testing of the cloth. And, truly, I’m not sure your opinion that the C14 method is no good at all to date accurately ancient fabrics is share by a lot of experts in the field of ancient dating (including archaeologist).

At best, the conclusions of the analyses done on this highly questionable material should have been presented to the public by Fanti et al. As being only interesting CLUES (NOT PROOFS) regarding the authenticity of the cloth and it should have been specified that such clues cannot prove anything (scientifically speaking) regarding the Shroud. Fanti and his gang should also have specified that these clues are truly waiting for a proper scientific confirmation that could ONLY happen when a new series of direct testing can be allowed on the Shroud by the Vatican. Until that happen, sorry but the results of Fanti’s study of that very old dust material can only be considered as anecdotal at best and highly questionable if we want to stay scientifically sound. In the end, I put these results in the same category than Max Frei’s conclusions regarding the pollens and even then, I think I’m generous because Frei’s samples were at least fresh samples just taken from the cloth’s surface, on the contrary to Fanti’s very old samples. And people should also consider the fact that Fanti’s material was taken by Riggi on the BACK SURFACE of the cloth, which was back then in DIRECT CONTACT with the Holland cloth, which could have lead to some contamination and could also have facilitate the trapping of some more recent material in between the 2 cloths that had nothing to do with the origin of the Shroud or with the places where the cloth could have been kept.

Sorry but this part of Wilson’s argumentation (which is an important corner stone in the building of his global hypothesis) is simply irrelevant. Why? Because once you read the entire book of the Acts of Theddeus (remember that this is the only place we find this word “tetradiplon” in link with the cloth who receive the miraculous imprint), you are force to conclude that the tetradiplon cloth was a totally different cloth than a burial shroud (because Jesus used that cloth well before his Passion while he was still alive and well, with no blood or bruises on his face), that this cloth had nothing to do with the burial cloths that were used to cover the body of Jesus in the tomb (because the author made a specific mention of those burial cloths in a different section of his book, with absolutely no reference to the tetradiplon cloth he mentioned earlier at the time of the miraculous imprint) and that the only image that was imprinted on that cloth was the face of Jesus and not his entire body (front and back). Note that if the author would have knew the cloth was folded in 8 parts, there would have been good chances that he also knew this was a burial shroud showing the entire body of a crucified Christ. Unfortunatelly for Wilson’s supporters, this is not what the author is showing us in his book. Absolutely not. And you can also bet your house that if this author would have known the Mandylion was a long piece of cloth folded in 8 parts, other authors would have made reference to this very unusual aspect of the relic later on, which has not happened at all.. So, the bottom line is this: You have the right to support Wilson’s fantasies (which have no more credibility than Dan Brown’s hypothesis about Jesus, Mary Magdalen and their supposed child), but don’t bring no more the “tetradiplon” argument, because, from the context of the Acts of Thaddeus (which is, again, the only place we found this word in link with the cloth that was showing the miraculous imprint), there is absolutely no way to link it with a burial shroud that would show the imprint of the entire body of a beaten and bloody Christ.

(note that this can well be a reference to a long burial shroud since the author in ancient times often used different terms, including “sudario” to talk about such a cloth). Also, there is another reference to “burial shrouds of Christ” in a manuscript written by St John Damascene (he never mention where this relic was kept but it is possibly Jerusalem, since this manuscript was written not long after – a few decades – the testimony of Arculf). The testimony of Damascene was also retranscripted in another text of the Venerable Bede, which can be seen as a confirmation of the validity of Damascene’s testimony (which include a list of many other relics associated with the Passion of Christ). It should be noted that in a totally different part of the same manuscript, Damascene describe the Abgar legend and the miraculous imprint of Christ’s face of a cloth (Damascene talk about a miraculous imprint of the face only happening before the Passion when Jesus was alive and well), which is another important piece of evidence to support the conclusion that the Mandylion was a totally different cloth than the Shroud of Turin, since he never included the Mandylion (known as the Image of Edessa back then) in his list of relics of Christ’s Passion. I also read that there is another testimony of a monk who visited Jérusalem around the year 1000 A.D. Who also reported the presence of a Shroud of Christ there. Those are the only reference I know and not long after 1000 A.D.

Because he wanted to make us understand that in every brother and sister we encounter in our life (i.e. Every human being), it is Jesus himself which we encounter!!! By the way, this is the most profound meaning of the parable of Matthew 25 about the sheep and the goats… And, in truth, this is the heart of the Christian faith : we all have the same Father who is in Heaven and we’re all brothers and sisters. That’s why Jesus told us that there is only 2 commandments in reality : Love God and love one another! Once a Christian truly believe this, I think he has understood the most important aspect of Jesus teaching. And after this, the challenge is to try to live it, which is not easy because we’re all sinners. But God doesn’t ask us to do more than to try to live it the best we can with his Grace… In sum, God is spiritualy present in everyone of his children and the fact that the Resurrected Jesus took different human forms during his apparitions was intended to make us understand this mysterious reality called “the mystical body of Christ” by St Paul… Another important reason why he acted like this is because he also wanted to respect the liberty of his disciples to believe in him or not and didn’t wanted to force their faith because God is Love and never force anyone to believe in him or not). Note that, almost everytime, they only recognize him after seeing a SIGN (the breaking of the bread, the tonality of the voice who said “Mary”, the miraculous fishing, the holes in his hands and side, etc.).

I don’t think so personally because the experiment of Di Lazzaro can only be linked to the Shroud of Turin after an EXTRAPOLATION made by those who believe in the supernatural image formation process. So, I ask the question : Is it a good thing to try to convince people that doubt in the authenticity of the Shroud with an EXTRAPOLATION which have good chances in the end to have nothing to do with the Shroud ??? Again, personally, I don’t think so… It’s important to understand that Di Lazzaro’s experiment cannot prove one bit that UV lights had something to do in the image formation process. It’s a stretch (or an extrapolation if you prefer) made only by those who wants to confort their idea that the body images MUST have been produced by some burst of energy during the resurrection. Note : this comment is not adressed directly to M. Marino but I only react to what he said.

It’s not even because of our faith or of our lack of faith. It is simply because God consider each one of us as his beloved child. That’s it. There’s no other reason that this one and Jesus mission was to reveal this truth to us. Most of the Jews in Jesus time (as well as most of today’s Christians I’m affraid) believed that, to be save, we had to follow the law perfectly ! THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE !!! Why ? Simply because we’re all sinners… So, in that context, salvation can ONLY BE A FREE GIFT OF GOD. And concerning your question of why do we have to spend times here on Earth before entering into God’s Kingdom, this is a real mystery my friend. So far, I have found only one “good” answer about that: To really and fully appreciate the great joy and confort of a good fireplace, we must experiment cold. And if we made the experience of spending one full day outside when the temperature is very very cold, then we will appreciate even more the good heat of the fireplace!!! In other words, it’s only by experimenting the suffering, the toughness, the treasons, the deceptions, etc. Of life on Earth (everything that is contrary to God in sum) that we will fully enjoy at the max our eternal life in Heaven with the Father.

Again, I’ll take some of the things you said and comment : You wrote : “I think you make a huge assumption when stating the image cannot be an act of God because it is incomplete.” What I tried to say is that a purely heavenly miracle image (without the help of a by product of the resurrection) would not ressemble the Shroud image because it would surely be complete, a little bit like the Tilma of the virgin Mary in Mexico. This image is considered as a pure miraculous image that didn’t come from a by product of a miracle and this image seem complete. That’s all I tried to say. If you go and read again the part where I say that, just after, I say : So, we’re left with two possibilities : a by product of the resurrection or a natural cause. You see ? I don’t discard totally the possibility of a by product that would have caused the image (like the hypothesis postulated by Fanti, Jackson, etc.). But I don’t believe we have to believe in those kind of hypotheses to explain an image that is not fully understood by modern science… And if we turn the thing around, I could say that if the body image of the Shroud would have been complete, then it would have been really hard for me to defend the idea that a natural phenomenon would have caused it ! But no ! The image is incomplete and even more, some data collected by STURP proved that the image is a bit different in some places. An example of that ? In the paper from Miller and Pellicori entitled “Ultraviolet Fluorescence Photography of the Shroud of Turin”, they reported that the image of the back was a bit more defined than the image of the front (by the way, this is a proof that the weight of the body had some kind of effect on image formation). They also reported that, on the frontal part of the cloth, the body image was a bit more defined on the left side than on the right side. All this is consistent with the idea that the image process or, like I think, the image processes, were natural. Of course, you will tell me that it is also possible that a by product of the resurrection account for those data but the main point is that nobody cannot ruled out tha possibility of a natural image formation process or processes. You wrote : “but I honestly believe even with complete direct access to the Shroud, the experts would still be at a loss to exlplain it…” Now Ron, it is you who make a huge assumption !!! ; ) You wrote : “one member of STURP stated “science cannot reproduce the resurrection in a lab” That’s correct. But what science can do and must do in the future is another round of direct testing on the Shroud and try to resolve many questions that were raised by STURP. I’m sure that will be done one day and then, we will know the cloth and his images (blood and body image) way better than now. Don’t forget that science always progress and I’m sure our understanding of the Shroud will progress too when a new round of researches will be done. You wrote about the Jospine matress : “Mysterious yes, freak of nature, yes…but not in the same category as the Shroud image.” Why the Shroud is in another category ? Just because it is supposed to be the one of Jesus Christ of course ! But, if you look at it with rationality, you will admit that those 2 images on cloth belong in the same class, i.e., the class of material objects on earth that bears an image that science today cannot fully understand. From a scientific point of view, why should it be so different ? It’s 2 mysterious images ! Not the same, yes, but nevertheless, both are not explained yet ! And since almost anyone with a brain surely don’t think the Jospine matress is an act of God, that mean that nature have done something really remarkable on this matress and that also mean that the Shroud could also be a masterpiece of nature ! I repeat : in all the scientific data that I’ve read on the Shroud, I don’t see anything there (not even the 3 D information that can be extract from the image) that make me think of some kind of by product from the resurrection. NOTHING ! You wrote : “To me the onus is on science to disprove this and until they do, (and again I’ll state, I don’t believe they ever will) I will hold on to my ideas.” Good point and that’s the way it should be ! Since science exist, it was always is role to explain things that, at first sight, we thought were coming from God or were unexplainable ! The history of science is full of moments like this were a phenomenon that was believed to be coming directly from God was finally proved to be made by natural laws… I think it will be that way also with the Shroud someday. Or maybe not after all ! And that would never proved to me that the Shroud is miraculous ! It would only proved that nodoby was there in Jerusalem 2000 years ago to scientifically collect data surrounding the scourging, the crucifixion, the death, the entombment and also, the resurrection of a great teacher from Galilea ! Then, it will always be very difficult for any scientist to totally reproduced the Shroud because there always be some data that we’ll NEVER KNOW ! It will always be a matter of trial and error and also a question of wild guesses ! In this kind of situation, founding the correct “recipe” will always be very hard….","date":"2011-08-31","mins":"6:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/25/john-and-rebecca-jackson-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin-at-saint-james-the-just-parish-in-ogden-utah/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"John and Rebecca Jackson to Speak on the Shroud of Turin at Saint James the Just Parish in Ogden, Utah"},{"id":"comment-3697","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Ron, you wrote : “This disappearance would undoubtably release some kind of energy or leave energy or particles behind.” I completely disagree with your point of view ! Sorry. How can you say that ? Nobody was there to record the event. And there’s no reports in the Gospel accounts of the risen Christ where it is reported that his sudden appearence in one place was accompanied by extraordinary phenomena ! And don’t forget what Barrie Schwortz always say : Science cannot resurrect people and analysed what image an event like this can do on a cloth !!! From my catholic roots, I believed that the body of Jesus simply disappeared from this material world. Nothing can make me think that this event would have produced any by product… I just can’t understand why it should be so. And that would mean that God would have left some kind of proof of the resurrection of his Son on a piece of cloth ! WHY ? If we ever found proofs of this event, then faith would not be needed anymore and I just can’t believe that’s the will of God. Look at the Gospel accounts of the resurrected Christ. His close disciples ALWAYS had difficulties to recongnize Jesus ! Even his close friends needed FAITH to recognize him !!! In my mind, that’s says a lot about who God really is. He never want to impose his presence to us because God is Love and not a tyrannical despot ! That’s it for the theological aspect of the question… You remember the end of the movie The Passion of Christ from Mel Gibson ? We see the Shroud droped to the ground because the body in it simply disappeared without any flash of light or any burst of energy. A very subtle event ! That’s exactly how I see the resurrection event… Why always think of some big Hollywood special effects to go along the resurrection of Christ ??? We’re not in cinema ! Remember the “Beam me up Scotty ?”. Sorry but Jesus is not a character from Star Trek !!! Regarding the Shroud and his unexplained image, there’s a great danger that many people fall in : believing that something we see in the nature and we can’t explain is automatically due to God himself ! It’s not because science, today, cannot fully explain the image that science, in the future, could not find the correct explanation ! The history of mankind is full of discoveries that were able to solve mystery that people believed were directly caused by God ! Regarding the Shroud, we have to always remember that science asn’t completed yet all testings and experiments of all the possible natural causes. There’s more experiments and analyses waiting to be done… From all my readings of the published papers in peer reviewed journals, there’s no facts there that convinced me that the image is due to some supernatural cause. And I have notice one important thing : from all the scientist who analysed the cloth in 1978 (including the italian team composed of Baima Bollone, Riggi, etc.), I AM AWARE OF ONLY ONE PERSON who believe that the resurrection have something to do with the image formation : John Jackson !!! And don’t forget one thing : M. Jackson hypothesis still have some problems (the image of the back is one of the most important), just like the Maillard reaction alone have some problems, the Corona discharge have some problems too and any direct contact hypothesis have some problems. THERE’S NOT ONE SINGLE PROCESS THAT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE IMAGE. So, I think science will have to look for the correct combination of processes to find the right explanation… To achieve that, it will surely take another series of direct researches on the cloth. We’ll have to be patient. For the moment, I’m still optimistic that science, one day, will be able to find the solution and I’m still convinced that this solution will involved only natural processes (probably 2 or more complex chemical processes). Again, I want to say it again : from all the scientific data collected by STURP or other researchers who analysed directly the cloth, I haven’t seen anything who convinced me that the solution must me search in some supernatural event ! Finally, we have to remember one important thing : NATURE CAN BE VERY SURPRISING SOMETIMES !!!! If you’re not convinced, read this paper : http://shroud.com/pdfs/mattress.pdf I just hope nobody will believe this image on the matress come from God !!! And still, science cannot fully explain it even today ! For this reason, do you think we have to call it a miraculous image ? I don’t think so !

I just want to keep on with you this friendly exchange of ideas ! I just want to take some of the interesting things you said and comment : You wrote : “I personally believe the Shroud is of Christ and believe it WAS left by God as a testiment to his ressurection.” I respect your belief but, as I said and even if I’m a catholic who believe in the resurrection, I don’t understand why God would have left some kind of physical trace of this event that goes beyond our material world. It’s just my opinion. You wrote : “The facts speak for themselfs, so many unanswered questions…” As I said before and I think I’m right on this point, it’s not because science can’t completely explain the image today that it will be the case in the future ! If science cannot fully explain the image today, don’t you think it’s just because modern science is just not advanced enough ? Who can say what the future will bring ? The only thing science can say right now is : Science cannot fully explain the image in the present state of our knowledge of the cloth. And that doesn’t mean it will always be that way in the future. And one other very important thing to always remember : Nobody know all the starting parameters regarding the Shroud (mainly from a textile point of view), the body that was put in it and the tortures he suffer (mainly from a forensic point of view) and the environment surrounding the crucifixion place and the tomb (mainly from a meteorogical point of view). So, it is VERY hard for scientist to explain an image that come from a set up with so much unknown starting data ! You wrote : “But speaking scientifically it would seem impossible that a body can just leave this environment or dimension without a trace of it ever existing.” Speaking scientifically Ron, there’s many things related to Jesus that seem impossible !!!! ; ) Speaking scientifically, it would seem impossible that someone walk on water. Speaking scientifically, it would seem impossible that someone feed more than 5000 persons with only 2 fish and 5 breads ! You surely understand my point ! If Jesus was really the Son of God, as I believe he is, his miracles were Signs made by God that operate them outside the normal physical laws. And if resurrection is the biggest Sign made by God, why this Sign could not have happened without the emission of any physical by products ? I don’t see why it could not have been that way 2000 years ago. It was an event that is completely outside our physical laws !!! Speaking scientifically Ron, it would seem to me impossible that a dead body could have emit any kind of energy at all !!! ; ) You wrote : “This is not a ‘Natural’ occurence.” Of course ! It is something that happened once in all history of mankind and goes beyond the field of science ! So, in this sense, how can we be so sure that it was necessarily accompanied of some physical by products ? Just a little theological reflexion about this : remember the story of the Old testament where Elijah encounter God on the mountain ? God wasn’t in the fire, he was not in the storm, etc. He was in a still small voice ! This text is extraordinary to make us understand that God is not like we always tend to see him : A supernatural being who act like a Super Hero from Hollywood ! God is Love, so when your name is Love, you don’t need to do extraordinary thing to impress anyone. Why always make a Hollywood scenario when we think about the resurrection and think that it needed a burst of light or energy of some kind ? You wrote : “actuality it would seem that Mr.Gibson produced that scene with Jackson’s theory in mind.” If we ask John Jackson to film a movie scene of his hypothesis, I really don’t think it would be a copy of Mel Gibson’s final scene. Jackson pretend that the body, while he dematerialized, became some kind of an energetic field in which the Shroud dropped. In the scene of Gibson, where do you see a energetic field (that surely would have produced some kind of light) inside the Shroud ? Did you saw the excellent documentary “The real face of Jesus” that was showed on History channel ? In it, Russ Breault present a scenario of the resurrection versus the Shroud that, to me, is much more close to the hypothesis of Jackson with a very short burst of light coming from the body. You can see it here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv AJ Rp4 C Xd U Can we agree that this resurrection scene is not the same than the one from the movie of Gibson ??? You wrote : “We are the generation(s) that require this ‘sign’ more then anyother in history.” On this, I completely agree with you that the Shroud is a SIGN (not a proof) of the resurrection and that our scientific age seem to be design for it. As John Paul II said : The Shroud is a challenge for the intelligence. Well said ! But that don’t mean it is a by product of the resurrection… For me, I have said it before, the Shroud is like the empty tomb. It is a sign that point out to the resurrection of Christ. But I don’t see it as a physical proof of this event. It’s not the same. You wrote : “why not believe that God foresaw this and thus left us this miraculous image to strengthen our resolve or simply to remind ALL what exactly he did for us?” Again, as a catholic, I agree with you on this point ! I think the Shroud can be good for lead to faith some doubters or, like it does for me, to strengthen the faith of some believers. But, why not think that God would have used the laws of nature to produced this marvelous image of himself ? Again, to finish, I’ll say something that, I think, speaks very loud : from all the scientists who analysed the cloth in 1978 (including the italian team composed of Baima Bollone, Riggi, etc.), I AM AWARE OF ONLY ONE PERSON who believe that the resurrection have something to do with the image formation : John Jackson !!!

Don’t worry ! I don’t want to impose my view to you and I respect your belief. I just want to let you know that there is other possibilities than to believe the Shroud is a true miraculous image or at least, came from a by product of the resurrection. By the way, did you know that the image is incomplete ? The top of the feet, the back of the knees, the sides of the body and the top of the head is missing. So, just from this standpoint, I don’t think we have to really consider the possibility of a true miraculous image because if it was so, the image would surely be complete ! So, we’re left with two possibilities : a by product of the resurrection or a natural cause. I will say it again : it’s not because science didn’t understand completely the image for now that it means it was caused by the resurrection. That’s all I say. Even if science, for the moment, don’t have a satisfactory answer to the question of how the image came to be, it is still possible that it is a true masterpiece from the nature (with the will of God) ! And if it is so, it doesn’t mean at all that the resurrection it’s not a reality ! In fact, as a catholic believer, I’m able to see a sign of the resurrection on the Shroud but it’s not in the image, it’s in the blood ! As doctor Barbet point out, the blood traces were not distract at all by the disappearence of the body from the Shroud. It’s really like the body dematerialized ! That’s a great sign of the resurrection ! But, it doesn’t mean there was any by product of this extraordinary event. I believe in Christ and I believe in the resurrection. I also believe the Shroud is the real burial cloth of Christ. But, I don’t think we must make 1 + 1 = 2 in this case. To me, it’s premature to think that way because the science didn’t make all the testing that could be done on the cloth. There is still many experiments that could be done and will be done one day, when the Vatican will permit a new series of direct testings on the cloth ! In some STURP papers, it is even written specifically that there’s more testings that have to be done on the cloth and that the STURP team wasn’t able to do in Turin. Also, it is written that there’s some re testings that will have to be done one day with more precise instruments. STURP did their examination in 1978. Since, new instruments and techniques are avalaible to examine the cloth more precisely. I really think a future “STURP 2” will be able to resolve many issues about the Shroud. Let’s wait and see ! Sience always goes on and one day, I think we will find some answers. Maybe there still be some questions left open. It’s possible. But, to me, that will not mean the image is miraculous. Just look at the Jospine matress body image. Science can’t fully explain this image too. But I hope, at least, we can agree that this image is not an “act of God” !!! It is surely a natural image that we don’t fully understand FOR THE MOMENT. Why would it be so different for the Shroud image ? Because it is the Shroud of Christ ? I don’t think it’s as obvious as this. I just finish the reading of ALL the papers published by STURP ! Yes, everyone of them ! And I must tell that there’s nothing in it that convinced me to believe the image is a by product of the resurrection. Sorry to let you know this, but all the data I’ve learned in my reading point to a natural cause… I know there is some big difficulties regarding the image (like the 3 D information incode in it) but that don’t mean science won’t be able to resolve them one day. So, yes, I think we’ll have to agree to disagree but it’s all right ! Everyone can have his own opinion about the image on the Shroud. At least, you and me, we’re not shy to share our point of view on this question !!! ; ) And, in the end, the most important thing (and we agree on that) is the fact that the Shroud is probably the genuine shroud of Jesus Christ !.","date":"2011-08-29","mins":"11:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/25/john-and-rebecca-jackson-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin-at-saint-james-the-just-parish-in-ogden-utah/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"John and Rebecca Jackson to Speak on the Shroud of Turin at Saint James the Just Parish in Ogden, Utah"},{"id":"comment-7142","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Nice comment Chris.

Jackson hypothesis postulate the opposite : That the dorsal image is only (or mainly, I don’t remember is exact words during his presentation in St Louis in 1991) the result of a direct contact process, on the contrary to the frontal image the is not just a direct contact process, but both contact and at a distance process.

The only thing is that this distance information is less evident because a bigger portion of the back part of the corpse was in direct contact with the cloth.

Chris, you impress me… Pierre Barbet noted that the undisturbed aspect of the blood stain on the Shroud was scientifically unexplainable (Barbet add prudently : in the present state of our knowledge) and, for him (and for me also), this is the only “clear” sign of resurrection that a faithful can see on the Shroud. In other word, you search for a sign of the resurrection on the Shroud & Don’t look at the body images, look at the blood stains !!! But sadly, most people always do the opposite !!! As Barbet point out : If the body was taken out of the Shroud by someone (after the blood had dried, that should have been pretty fast after the draping), then we SHOULD NOT SEE complete blood stains with sharp edges and without missing parts. In other word, the high quality of the blood stains (and the fact that they are not “broken”, if I can use this term) makes the scenario of a removal of the corpse by someone almost impossible and it really “look like” the body simply disappeared ! As crazy as this observation seem(for someone who don’t believe in the resurrection), this is the REALITY of the blood stains on the Shroud, as noted by a medical expert like Barbet ! It’s not just a pseudo scientific idea here… This is a solid fact ! The quality and the aspect of the blood stains just don’t fit with the scenario of someone who remove a dead body from a Shroud. The only way it could be possible, would have been a removal of the corpse almost immediately after he was put in the Shroud, while the blood clots were still humid. This scenario is highly improbable. For the lenght of time that the corpse remains into the Shroud, it could not have been more than 36 to 40 hours because after that, the first liquids from the rotting process appeared and they would have destroyed the images and the blood stains. Now, for the minimal lenght of time that the body had to be in the Shroud in order for the image to be formed, it is, as you say, impossible to say for sure, not until we can be sure of the image formation mechanism. Vignon, who proposed a vaporographic theory in the beggining of the 20th century said that the body should have been in the Shroud for at least 24 hours, in order to produced an image via his “vaporographic” image formation process. This is just an example. If the image formation process is a natural phenomenon, we can be almost sure that the body should have been in contact with the body for at least this lenght of time (24 hours), but this is just a wild guess….","date":"2012-01-19","mins":"11:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\""},{"id":"comment-7489","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Ha ha ha !.","date":"2012-01-24","mins":"5:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\""},{"id":"comment-5952","author":"yannick_clément","post":"All this extrapolation (supernatural process) is just a joke..","date":"2011-12-22","mins":"2:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/22/quote-for-today-luigi-garlaschelli-on-the-enea-report/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Luigi Garlaschelli on the ENEA Report"},{"id":"comment-7512","author":"yannick_clément","post":"At least Max, we agree that the best probability that can explain the Shroud images is a NATURAL kind of phenomenon….","date":"2012-01-25","mins":"9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\""},{"id":"comment-6061","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I’ve once saw here in Quebec a teleseries about the Christian’s relics (very interesting) and I was surprised (and not so surprised in a sense) to see this guy Garlaschelli who was trying to debunk another Christian relic in Italy !!!

Similarly, in D 7 and C 7 (note : This is the buttocks area), there is NO FLUORESCENCE EMISSION (note : normally, when there is a blood stain, there is also a fluorescence emission due to the presence of a small halo of serum around the blood), but PERHAPS THE MARKS HAVE THE SAME ORIGIN AS THE CIRCULAR BURN HOLES in this section. (note : they are talking about the so called “poker holes”). So, you can see that Miller and Pellicori, even if they stayed prudent on the subject (proving that they had a good scientific judgement), conclude that those marks have more chances to be scorch marks than blood stains, mainly because of the lack of a fluorescence emission around them. And as you know now, I’ve also add one other clue in favor of the scorch marks hypothesis : the probable presence of circulars water (or wine) stains around each dark marks.

Love it or not, it’s true. I’ve check it out myself from a photo of the Shroud in a mapping software I work with. The only thing is that the axis for the symmetry is not totally straight up. You have to BEND THE AXIS a bit. But if you do that, the 2 series of marks align almost perfectly one over the other. This observation is a good indicator (not a proof) that the Shroud was probably folded in 2 for those marks to appear. 2 Miller and Pellicori from STURP didn’t notice any fluorescence around those marks. Here, we have to remember that around almost every blood stains and scourge marks, Miller and Pellicori did noticed fluorescent halos… It’s fun how people around here neglect this precious scientific FACT ! An what is the real meaning of this information ? It mean that, most probably, the liquid stains we see around every marks were formed on the Shroud AFTER the body image was formed !!! Effectively, we know for a FACT that the serum halos that we found around almost every blood stains and scourge marks on the Shroud, did stained the cloth BEFORE the body image formation was active. By staining the cloth in those areas, the serum was able to prevent any coloration on the surface of the fibrils they covered. No such thing was seen by Miller and Pellicori in the UV photo of those 2 series of 3 marks in the buttocks area. So, if those circular liquid stains were formed AFTER the body images, that mean that, most probably, the marks were ALSO formed AFTER the body images. The hypothesis that those marks are scorches reaches a higher level, just by considering this scientific FACT. 3 The fact that those liquid stains seem almost perfect in their circular shape makes me believe that it cannot have come from someone throwing water in a hurry to extinguish the firebrand. It MUST have come from someone dropping some liquid on those places very gently AFTER the firebrand were extinct, just to make sure that they were 100% extinct. This scenario of mine offers a simple and realistic explanation for those liquid stains IF the marks are really scorches (like I think). 4 If you take into account of all the observations and facts we know about the body images, the blood on the Shroud and those particular marks, and then you used the Occam razor, then the most plausible conclusion is that those marks are light scorches and not blood. The best thing that could happen to really know the truth about those marks would be to find the right X Ray photo that was taken from this area and look if we can see the dark marks. If we can, that would prove that they are not composed of blood, since THE BLOOD STAINS ARE NOT VISIBLE on this kind of photos, only the water stains can be seen (other than added material like the patches – quote from STURP)….","date":"2012-01-30","mins":"3:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/29/quote-for-today-by-mario-latendresse/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for today by Mario Latendresse"},{"id":"comment-7718","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I also want to say that : If it’s ever proved that those marks are really blood stains, that wouldn’t make Mario’s hypothesis necessarily true, since 1 there is no record in history that the Romans ever used spikes on their cross to torture the victim.

What do you make of this observation ? Just to be clear : The fluorescent halos Miller and Pellicori saw around every blood stains and scourge marks are there simply because the serum stains that stained the cloth around the blood stains were able to prevent any image formation under them. By doing so, the natural weak fluorescence of the Shroud (that is present everywhere there’s no body image and that was caused probably by the washing of the cloth with Saponaria – Ref. : Rogers) was able to pierce through those serum stains and could be seen by Miller and Pellicori. That’s exactly why they could detect fluorescent halos in the regions that were stained by serum coming from the retraction of the blood clots (normal process of blood clotting).

I’m a free thinker… Mario got his opinion on the question. I got mine. And what is funny is that, at first, when I read his paper on the subject, my first reaction was : This conclusion is very probable ! But, after I look more closely on those images, I started to detect some pieces of evidence that eventually lead me to believe (and I would bet my house on that), that those marks are not blood stains at all, but instead, they are light scorches marks, most probably create when 3 firebrands of incense would have drop on the Shroud in the area of the right buttocks (if you look at a positive photo). To answer your questions : 1 Yes, the 3 marks on each side are clearly symetric but not in a totally vertical axis (not in 90 degrees). And those marks only appear in 2 corners, not 4. The symetry came when someone would have fold the Shroud in 2, in an effort to extinguish the 3 firebrands of incense that would have droped on the Shroud, who was most probably completely unfold at the time the drop of firebrands. This way of exinguish the firebrands is just a logical move of someone in a panic. If my supposition if correct and if there is no liquid near you when that happen, what will you do ? Me, everytime, I’ll fold the cloth in 2 to take out any air for the fire to continue. From my perception, I really think that’s what happened. 2 The form of the water stains (very circular) made me think that someone just gently droped a cup of water (or maybe a cup of wine; this is a possibility since the accident maybe occured during a religious celebration), anyway a cup of liquid, after the cloth was unfold again, on the 3 places were the firebrands had droped + the 3 opposite places that touched the firebrands when the cloth was folded in two. This was probably unnecessary, because the folding had done the job, but it was surely done to make sure all the firebrands were completely extinguished (that would explain the very circular aspect of the water or wine stains). In other word, the folding of the Shroud was probably done in a hurry, but not the droping of liquid, that was done afterward. 3 There is other light scorch marks like that elsewhere on the Shroud. Just look at First, I want to say it again : Those marks were judge as probable scorch marks by Miller and Pellicori of STURP. This is something we have to really take notice ! Mario is not a fan of Miller and Pellicori and don’t believe what they said about that. He’s free of his opinion but I completely disagree with him on this. Miller and Pellicori, you can ask Barrie Schwortz about that, were not amateurs regarding imaging !!! They were truly experts on this subject, contrary to Mario, by the way (and me, of course). To conclude my point, the funniest thing about all this debate is that there is a simple way that exist and that can tell us, once and for all, who’s probably right between Mario and me on this question, and that is the X Ray fluorescent photographies that were taken by STURP in 1978. Effectively, here’s what we can read on page 463 of the STURP paper « A Comprehensive Examination of the Various Stains and Images on the Shroud of Turin » : “The water marks are interesting as they are the only marks (other than added material like the patches) that show up distinctly in the x radiographs. Clearly, the density of heavy elements in the water mark boundaries is sufficiently great to be apparent on these x radiographs.” So, if we could look at those X Ray photos (I wish I could !!!), we could confirm if what I see as water (or wine) stains, really is (and that is not something else related to blood, like serum or plasma stain, as proposed by Mario). And if those circular stains around each marks are really water (or wine) stains like I think they are, then, using Occam razor, we would be almost certain that those 6 dark marks surrounded by liquid stains are scorch marks and not blood stains, since that make no sense for someone to drop a bit of water (or wine) on some blood stains ! I’m sure, you understand my reasoning. I’ve asked Barrie Schwortz about those X Ray photos and he told me that he have the negatives of those photos but, unfortunatelly, there was no exact references that were made to know what exact part of the Shroud one photo represent, and what other part of the Shroud the another photo represent. Since Barrie is not the one who took those photos, it would be a very hard task for him to try to find the right one who was taken in this specific area of the Shroud !!! So, I think that, unless a miracle, we’ll have to rest on our judgement to try to determine if those marks are really scorch marks or blood stains. But remember folks, Miller and Pellicori from STURP thought that those marks were scorch marks and not made of blood.

Read again Miller and Pellicori paper and you’ll see that all scourge marks have a fluorescent halo around them ! THIS IS A FACT. But, of course, their conclusion don’t go with your preconception, so you prefer to discard them. It’s so easy to do that : Take what fits with your preconception and forget one or two FACTS that don’t fit… THIS IS NOT SCIENCE. There is water stains around each marks (not serum stains). This FACT alone (no matter the form of the water stains) fits better with the idea of scorches than with the idea of blood stains. And the absence of fluorescence mean that those water stains (if this is not wine) appeared on the Shroud AFTER the body image was formed. This FACT is completely incoherent with the data we know about the blood stains formation versus the body image formation (blood stains came first, then the body image)… WHY IN THE WORLD THERE WOULD BE WATER STAINS (OR WINE STAINS) AROUND EACH MARKS IF THEY WOULD BE MIRROR IMAGE OF BLOOD CLOTS ? This observation just doesn’t fit right with the idea pretending that those marks are made of blood. Again, I’ll repeat it to make it clear : Nobody can say for sure if Miller, Pellicori and me are correct with the “scorches” hypothesis, but this is also true with Mario’s hypothesis. And for me, his hypothesis, using Occam razor is highly unlikely. And, to conclude, the only thing that could resolve the question, would be a CHEMICAL TEST (and not just a check out of some high resolution photos like Mario think) to know if those marks are composed of blood.

Here is the complete answer : 3 There is other light scorch marks like that elsewhere on the Shroud. Just look carefully at the so called “poker holes” that is outside the righ buttock (when you look at a dorsal positive photo of the Shroud) , and you’ll see light scorches that look pretty much like the 2 set of 3 marks in the buttocks area (because of their small shapes and also because we can also see circular liquid stains around them). Here’s a link on Mario’s website in order to see the area I mean : http://sindonology.org/shroud Scope/shroud Scope.shtml?zl=3&image=2&lon=323&lat=1419 The light scorch marks I refer to are located right in the middle of the screen.

Historically speaking, this “potential” information can have some great value… From my perspective, that is one more clue that the Shroud was probably kept in Constantinople for a long time, since there was at least 2 pyrolisis incidents on the Shroud (the so called “poker holes” and this one in the buttocks area) that were most probably due to some drops of firebrands of incense on the cloth. For the so called “poker holes”, we have to think that the firebrands were much bigger and, consequently, the incident must have been more important and dramatic. I firmly think that this would be wrong to judge this topic as “no value”, especially, as I said, in an historical perspective about the Shroud… That’s where I stand presently in my reflection about this interesting “inquiry” !!! I think that if I proven right about this, that mean that the Shroud survived A BUNCH of pyrolisis incidents during his long life, and to me, the fact that this cloth is still here with us in a relative good condition, this is what I call a little “miracle” in itself !

It’s correct. But the blood in the feet area and the blood across the back are probably the 2 only places where there’s no fluorescence at all, and you know why ? Simply because this blood was post mortem blood in a liquid state when he stained the cloth ! There was no time for a retraction process before he stained the cloth (I’m not even sure that a retraction process is still working in the case of post mortem blood) and that’s why there’s no serum stains around those blood stains. BUT, for all the scourge marks all around the 2 sets of marks in the buttocks area, Miller and Pellicori report fluorescent halos !!! This is a fact. In this particular area (the buttocks), there’s only those 2 sets of marks that doesn’t react the same way than all the blood stains present there (the scourge marks). It’s a good indicator that those 2 sets of marks are not made of blood. And don’t forget the fact that there are liquid stains around each mark that are clearly not made of serum or other blood material. Those stains are probably made of water or another liquid like that and came most probably in contact with the Shroud AFTER the body image formation. All this is in good agreement with the idea that those marks are scorches instead of blood stains. And for the quote from Thibault’s website, I don’t agree with his remark in the sense that those fluorescent halos were detect everywhere there’s bloos stains on the Shroud, except, like you said, of the feet area and the blood flow across the back (for the reason I’ve explain : they were made of post mortem blood in a liquid state). I think Thibault was too much prudent in his remark. When you read the paper of Miller and Pellicori, it is quite clear that those fluorescent halos are present everywhere, especially around all the scourge marks, or, at the very least, around the vast majority of them. And that include those in the buttocks area, but not the 2 sets of marks… I really think this observation of Miller and Pellicori is a clear indicator that if a blood stain on the Shroud came from the decal of a pre mortem blood clot (that was still humid at his surface), there was almost everytime a serum stain that was formed around this blood stain. Since there is no such serum stains around the 2 sets of marks, it’s a clear indicator that it is highly improbable that those stains came from pre mortem blood clots. There would be a serum stain around them if this was the case.

Rogers made his Maillard reaction experiments on linen samples that were specially prepared the old fashion way as describe by Pliny the Elder in Antiquity.

Having said that with my heart, of course, it’s important that we could confirm this with scientific facts. But all in all, we have to understand one thing : C14 dating is not 100% sure (see the paper on the C14 written by Meacham : http://www.shroud.com/meacham.htm Also, C14 is not everything. Like my friend Barrie Schwortz often told : With the Shroud, we have around 99 evidences and clues that point out toward authenticity, and then we have this single test that point out toward a fake. In this context, what someone intelligent would do ? Of course, he will be really suspicious regarding the dissonant result ! And that’s exactly what Benford Marino did around 2000 and after that, Rogers check out their ideas more deeply and his findings were confirmed by John L. Brown. I think now we know FOR A FACT that this C14 conclusion of 88 is incorrect because the dating was done on a non representative sample. PERIOD. Of course, that doesn’t tell us with 100% confidence that the Shroud is 2000 years old, but almost every evidences and observations about the Shroud point out in that direction… So, to me, this C14 result of 88 is far from being something that I consider a true scientific fact that, without a doubt, can tell me the real age of the Shroud.

Such a crazed coating would be easy to pull off with adhesive, explaining the easy removal of tapes from image areas.” As you can see (and as I realized more and more following what goes on in the Shroud world), in science, what is the most important thing is not necessarily the data itself but, very often, it is much more the INTERPRETATION you do of that particular data!!!! And on this question, many different point of views can exist for one single data. That’s why I often prefer to put my trust in Rogers’ judgment because I know how good, unbiased and profesionnal a scientist he was. Don’t forget that, since the STURP days, he changed his mind a lot of time when some new data or observation came in his way. For me, that’s a very good sign of integrity.

Here’s an important comment for all of you: This morning, I found out one more interesting quote from Ray Rogers and decided to add it in my paper and I just sent this updated version of my paper to Dan a few hours ago. So, I hope Dan can do the switch rapidly with my new version. While we wait for that, here’s this new quote that speak loud versus the fact that, for Rogers, the primary cell wall of the linen fiber on the Shroud was not a relevant option for the chromophore: “An average flax fiber is 10 20 um in diameter, and some lower fibers are colored in image areas. Any radiation that colored the circumference of two, superimposed fibers would have to penetrate at least 20 40 um of cellulose. Radiation that penetrated the entire 10 20 um diameter of a fiber would certainly affect the entire volume of the fiber, including the walls of the medulla (the cylindrical void in the center of the fiber). All image fibers (from the Shroud) show color on their outer surfaces, but the body of the fiber and the walls of the medulla are not colored.” The last phrase is truly important. It is one of the most precise description of Rogers’ opinion concerning the chromophore of the image. I’m sorry for all the defenders of the primary cell wall hypothesis (Fanti, Di Lazzaro, etc.) but this new quote of Rogers made it clear that, in his mind, the whole body of the fiber (that certainly includes the primary cell wall!) never was affected and colored during the image formation process. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily means that Rogers was right about that, but you know what? I don’t see any good reason right now to doubt his professional opinion on that question. Until new data could prove he was wrong, I think it’s fair to consider the chromophore of the image as being most probably a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities. Rogers’ arguments are very strong because he considered all the data and observations available without lefting one aside. Also, we have to consider that, unlike almost every modern Shroud researchers, Rogers was able to see and analyzed the image directly in Turin in 1978.

On the contrary, I have a deep feeling that most of the present research (I don’t want to make any kind of personal accusation here) is done (conciously or not) with some kind of “religious agenda” that lies under a real quest for truth. That’s something I call “religious pollution” in scientific research regarding the Shroud ! Because of the subject matter, that don’t surprise me much, but I have to say that, for a guy like me who only seek the truth, it’s very sad to see. And that’s the principal reason why Shroud science has lost most of is credibility in recent years. I think it’s easy to note that we’re VERY FAR from the good old days of the STURP team, where everything was done with one major goal : the seek of TRUTH ! Since then, we have seen a big bunch of Jesus freaks, of lunatics, of opportunists, and/or of pseudo scientists came in the Shroud research and destroy most of his credibility in regard of the international scientific community.

For the first point, what you say is some kind of a play on words. When you read Rogers papers and his book, it is clear that the stripping of color was a confirmation of the reduction of color with diimide. Maybe he didn’t say it EXPLICITELY in those terms, but nevertheless, for him, those observations were a great indicator that it wasn’t the fiber itself that was directly affected by the image formation process. And this is confirmed by what he said in page 86 of his book versus the result he obtained with corona discharge. Even if the internal part of the fiber didn’t seem to be affected by the oxydation process and just the external part was, for Rogers, this was DIFFERENT from the image fibers from the Shroud that he analysed. And for Rogers, it is very clear that the banding effect was another great evidence that the body image reside only on carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers. Of course, you can have a different opinion than Rogers on the subject (and you’re surely not alone). But for him, the banding effect is a very important evidence in favor of his hypothesis concerning the thin layer of impurities that would be present on top of the fiber. Here’s my point #16. Read again what Rogers said : “16 Bands of different colored yarn can be observed in the weave of the cloth. Where darker bands intersect image areas, the image is darker and where lighter bands intersect image areas, the image is lighter. THIS PROVES that the image color IS NOT SOLELY a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen. Something ON THE SURFACE of the different batches of yarn produced color and/or accelerated color formation. This suggests that significant VARIATIONS in impurity concentrations existed among yarn batches. The observations of bands of color agree with historical reports on the methods used to produce ancient linen.” Here, you can see that he’s quite prudent in his affirmation. But nevertheless, for him, this was a great observation that contribute to comfort his hypothesis concerning the chromophore of the image. Finaly, I don’t understand how you can, at the same time, agree that there is a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers (Rogers hypothesis) and believe that “the image consists of colored and not colored fibers as in a pixel image”. If there really is a thin layer of impurities, then it is sure that this layer was colored during the image formation process and all the other observations (ghosts, diimide, bands, etc.) indicate that, if it is really the case, this was the ONLY thing that was colored during the process !!! You’re 2 ideas on the question seem to be in contradiction. Unless you think that the coloration affect both the layer of impurities and the fiber itself ? But then, how can you explain the diimide and the ghost that leave a colorless and undammaged fiber behind ?.","date":"2012-05-11","mins":"3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","title":"Sentence One in the Richard Dawkins Challenge is Wrong. Period."},{"id":"comment-11310","author":"yannick_clément","post":"That’s right Adrie.

But I disagree with him one what he said here : “ALL the facts are consistent with both possibilities.” For the moment, I don’t think this is true. Rogers as showed with good scientific arguments that his hypothesis CAN be correct regarding ALL the observations and facts concerning the body image on the Shroud. But I’ve NEVER seen one single scientific paper published by a real Shroud expert who is also an expert in chemistry and microscopy that do the same than Rogers did with his papers, i.e. To DEMONSTRATE that the hypothesis he defend CAN be applied to what we know about the body image on the Shroud. I still wait for a paper like that to be published in order to properly defend the hypothesis of the primary cell wall being the true chromophore of the image. I’ve never saw one so far. For the moment, I consider this hypothesis of the primary cell wall more like a personal opinion of some researchers than a real hypothesis that have been correctly DEMONSTRATE with solid scientific arguments, like it was done by Rogers for his own hypothesis. Sorry Thibault for having a different opinion that yours on the subject !!! ; ) In fact, we both agree that there is no way to be scientifically certain about the correct chromophore of the image but, where I defer from him, is because I favor Rogers hypothesis well before the one about the primary cell wall. But that just my opinion, based on a long reflection… Also, you have to know that Thibault Heimburger, a friend of mine, is one of the co author of the paper published in 2010 with Fanti, Di Lazzaro and some other members of the Shroud Science Group that pushed the issue of the primary cell wall. That’s why I’m not really surprised by the fact he put the hypothesis of the primary cell wall on the same level of credibility than the one of Rogers. As I said, that’s where I defer from him. On the general principle, I agree with him but I don’t think it is scientifically correct to think those 2 hypotheses have the same credibility, simply because the hypothesis of the primary cell wall has never been studied (in regard of what we know about the body image on the Shroud) to the SAME in deep level as the hypothesis of Rogers… For example, can someone give me a solid and credible scientific explanation for the FACT that the ghost and the diimide leave a clean uncolored and undamaged fiber behind ? At first sight, that doesn’t seem to really fit with the idea that the primary cell wall would have been colored instead of a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers !!! If the color would be in the primary cell wall, then the ghosts would be composed mainly of a dehydrated and oxidized primary cell wall that surely would have left a DAMAGED fiber behind. You understand what I mean ? This is PURE LOGIC thinking ! If you take away the colored primary cell wall of a fiber, how in the world the resulting linen fiber can be considered undamaged ??? It just doesn’t seem to fit. And the reduction of the color with diimide, leaving an undamaged linen fiber behind, is also one of the main argument of Rogers (among many other) to show that the whole linen fiber (including the primary cell wall) WAS NOT colored at all during the image formation process, because the resulting fiber seem to be undamaged. Don’t you think that chemist experts like Rogers and Adler (also expert on the Shroud) would not have noticed the absence of the primary cell wall of the fibers after the use of diimide ? I just can’t imagine that ! For me, it’s pretty evident that experts like them would have note a significant change in the physical aspect of the resulting fibers. That’s just my opinion of course but I don’t think it’s idiot to think that way….","date":"2012-05-12","mins":"7:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/11/sentence-one-in-the-richard-dawkins-challenge-is-wrong-period/","cat":"challenge","title":"Sentence One in the Richard Dawkins Challenge is Wrong. Period."},{"id":"comment-11312","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Oups, typing mistake !

And their assumption is that the coloration affected the primary cell wall instead, which is made of other kinds of carbohydrates. No matter what the list of Dallas said in point A4, I don’t think any credible scientist will state that one hypothesis or the other concerning the chromophore of the image is completely proven without any doubts for the moment. Even for Rogers, I don’t think he ever wrote that his hypothesis regarding the thin layer of impurities was completely proven without any doubts. In fact, that’s precisely why it is called a “hypothesis” and not a “theory” ! The carbohydrate layer that was colored on the surface of the Shroud is so thin and his chemical structure is so common (this fact was clearly mentioned by Rogers himself) that it is easy, for someone who is not an expert in chemistry, to get fooled. Look, even Rogers himself was fooled by it when he analyze the question during his investigation with the STURP team ! He and the other members of STURP thought that the coloration affected the linen fibers themselves and that’s exactly what they wrote in their conclusion (published in peer reviewed journals) ! This example show you how complex and unresolved this question can be ! For the moment, Rogers hypothesis can really look like the right answer to the mystery, but no credible scientist can state that it is a proven FACT ! That’s precisely why this list of “facts” presented in Dallas in 2005 didn’t received praised from all the scientists involved with the Shroud… And I think these critics were right because this list contains some “facts” (even in part A) that are still waiting to be fully demonstrate and proven !!! Rogers hypothesis about the thin layer of impurities was present in the part A of the list in 2005 and, in 2010, Fanti take this list and present an updated list by himself. And in his own list, Rogers hypothesis wasn’t there no more ! You can see that this question is still debated today. But, I’ll say it again, in regard of all we know about the Shroud, it seem to me evident that Rogers hypothesis is the best we have to explain correctly the body image on the Shroud. M. Rolfe and all the others who signed the list of Valencia don’t seem to agree with that… But the bottom line is this : For the moment, no one can be 100% sure, scientifically speaking, of the real answer.

The Di Lazarro’s experiments with laser and Fanti’s hypothesis of the corona discharge are much more easily backed up with the primary cell wall as the chromophore than an external layer of impurities on top of the fibers. That’s why they push this hypothesis of the primary cell wall and, scientifically speaking and to stay honest, it’s impossible to totally reject their proposition for the moment.

All right, it is theory. I know. But, there is also a great example of an image of a living thing that possess real 3 D informations (related to the distance) and that is done completely naturally. It is called a Volckringer pattern and you can go there to see 2 images of leaves that were transferred on paper and those images possesses real 3 D information just like the Shroud : http://gizapyramid.com/LECTURE SHROUD3.htm (check out slides 19 and 20) By the way, those images were done with a VP 8.

Tissue in the muscles of the deceased resort to anaerobic metabolism in the ABSENCE OF OXYGEN and significant amounts of lactic acid are released into the muscle tissue. This along with the loss of ATP causes the muscles to grow stiff.” With this in mind, I think there is very good chances that the body of Jesus would have become in a very intense and rapid state of Rigor Mortis right after death, because I really think there is a very good probability that Jesus body would have presented 2 very good conditions for that to happen : Firstly, I really think there’s a very good probability that he died from a progressive asphyxia on the cross (as supported by Bucklin, Baima Bollone and Pierre Barbet), so even before the death, the level of oxygen in the body (lungs, blood, etc.) would have been dramatically low. Secondly, the presence of a lactic acidosis in the body of someone who would have been tortured like Jesus (especially with a very violent scourging of more than 100 hits that causes bloody wounds) is very probable. So, with a high probability that those 2 pathological conditions would have been present in the few hours before the death of Jesus, I think it is pretty logic to think that the Rigor Mortis would have been very rapid in his case and very intense. Would be nice if a medical expert could confirm this but I think the chances for what I just describe have really happen to Jesus are very good : Lactic acidosis + progressive state of ashyxia = very rapid and intense Rigor Mortis.

And the question that we’re left with is this : If it’s not the work of a forger and that the Shroud is really an authentic burial Shroud, if it’s not the Shroud of Jesus, then, who the hell was buried in this cloth ? And to me, the fact that many pathologist have analyzed the Sudarium of Oviedo and came up with the conclusion that it shows the signs of a pulmonary edema is a very good point in favor of the authenticity of this cloth. How can a forger from the 7th or 8th century (the date given by the C14 test for the cloth) would know how to reproduce stains that came from a pulmonary edema ? And how he could knew that a victim of crucifixion would normally suffer from this kind of lung problem because of a progressive state of suffocation ? Remember that the crucifixion was banned in the 4th century… To me, the very precise physiological details that we see on both the Shroud and the Sudarium are the biggest signs in favor of their authenticity as 2 genuine burial cloths.

More researches and experiments need to be done. The Volckringer pattern hypothesis show many similarities very interesting with the Shroud images and I think a chemist should make experiment to really investigate the possibility that the chemical reaction that is at work for the leaves of the plants can be related in some ways with the Shroud images. That work still wait to be done. For your specific question about Rogers, I not truely qualified to answer a very specific question like that but, in Rogers book, he talk a lot about this topic. You should really buy this book… I can say this to you : For Rogers, in theory, it is possible that a body image like the Shroud can be formed from a chemical reaction he called Maillard reaction. He did some experiments that were not completely successful but he died before having time to fully explore his hypothesis. So, I think that nobody can completely discard the Maillard reaction hypothesis for the moment and we also have to think that maybe there was more than one process at work to create the Shroud images. So, who can be sure that this chemical reaction could not account partially for those images ? Would be nice if another chemist could take the work of Rogers and keep investigate the question. Now, for the work done by Di Lazarro, I think it’s interesting but nobody can say that this UV experiment can really be applied in the context of a dead man enrolled in a Shroud and buried in a tomb. Only in a context of resurrection that this thing can be view as “possible”… And even then, how can we be sure that the resurrection event produce any kind of by product whatsoever. As I said earlier, all those experiments prove only one thing : With those kind of lasers, you can make a coloration on linen that is pretty close to the Shroud coloration. That’s it. The important thing to remember is this : coloring linen is easy. But that doesn’t mean the coloration process used is the same that the process responsible for the body images on the Shroud. I think more research and analyses needed to be done by M. Di Lazarro and his team. For example, one thing they never experiment (to my knowledge) is to create real 3 D images of a body, part of a body or another thing with those lasers… They never also said one word (to my knowledge) about what would be the effect of those lasers on real dried blood clots on a linen cloth (like we see on the Shroud and that were proven by STURP not to have been distrubed at all by the image formation process). They never also said one word on how easy or how tough it is to disolved the coloration. The STURP team were only able to disolved the coloration on the Shroud with very strong chemical reagents like diimide… If the color cannot be reduce with diimide, it’s not the same coloration process than the process that was active on the Shroud. On the contrary, if the color is much more easy to disolve with less stronger reagents, then, again, it’s not the same coloration process than the process that was active on the Shroud. Another point of comparison that would be nice to analysed is the distance factor. We know from STURP that the darkest parts of the body images on the Shroud are those who were probably in direct contact with the body. We also know from STURP that beyond a distance of 4 cm, there is no body image at all. But also, the STURP team was able to determine that the color that reside on one single fiber possess the same degree of intensity (yellow straw color) no matter if the body was in direct contact with the Shroud or distant from it by less than 4 cm. So, I would like that M. Di Lazarro and his team show the results of those lasers on linen when the lasers are in direct contact with the cloth and compare the result when the lasers are 1 cm away from the cloth, 2 cm away, 3 cm away, 4 cm away, 5 cm away, etc., etc. I am curious to know if the results will be the same each time regarding the color intensity and also regarding the degree of penetration into the fiber… All those results would be nice to read in another scientific article. Then, we would have more data to judge if UV rays still can be considered as one potential candidate for the image formation process on the Shroud… oud..","date":"2011-11-12","mins":"4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4764","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Are you sure that some amount of heavy gas could not be produced earlier if abnormal conditions are present ?

There’s alot of things we’ll never know for sure about the man of the Shroud and who knows if some very particular and rare conditions were not reunite to permit some heavy gas release by the corpse in less than 36 40 hours ? Also, we have to remember that Rogers hypothesis was about heavy gas yes, but also about the release of ammoniac gas that can be released pretty fast by a dead body (especially by the lungs through the nose and mouth). This gas can also have been part of the image formation process. As Rogers said in his book : If a thin impurity layer made of sugars and carbohydrates was really present on the surface of the Shroud (and, by the way, the STURP team was able to detect traces of starch that tend to confirm the presence of this layer) and some gas were emit from the dead body, there WILL BE a chemical reaction of coloration. As Rogers said (and this is goddamn important) : THIS IS NOT AN HYPOTHESIS, THIS IS A FACT !!!! So, when a new series of direct researches will be done, I hope they will closely verified if the impurity layer postulate by Rogers can be detect or not on the Shroud. As I said, for the moment, starch impurities have been found by STURP (and confirm by Mc Crone !), and as Rogers said, those starch impurities can well have been one part of the composition of this impurity layer… Again, more researches and analyses need to be done..","date":"2011-11-12","mins":"5:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4762","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Hello again Ron and everybody else ! Yesterday, I wrote on this blog that I would find you the citation (citations actually) from the paper of Miller and Pellicori about the fact that the color density of the dorsal image is a bit darker than the frontal image on the Shroud. Here it is : Article : Ultraviolet fluorescence photography of the Shroud of Turin Authors : Vern D. Miller and Samuel F. Pellicori Citations : 1 Page 79 : “The body image (nonfluorescing) is VERY DENSE at the scapula and rib cage.” 2 Page 80 : “The dorsal body image is MORE DISTINCT than the ventral image.” Those citations made it pretty clear that the body image on the dorsal region is very dense, which is totally in agreement with the FACT that the denser body images on the Shroud are present in regions where there was a probable DIRECT CONTACT between the body and the cloth. The dorsal region being one of those very probable zones of direct contact, don’t you think it is very normal to observe a very dense color in this region (denser than most other parts of the cloth except maybe the face region) ? I really think so ! And an observation like that is not in disagreement at all with the idea that the Shroud body images were formed by a NATURAL mechanism (probably of a chemical nature). In fact, it’s one clue that lead me to think that the body images really came from a natural process not fully defined yet by science… Of course, Ron and anyone else can think otherwise, but I still think a natural process of image formation is still possible to explain the Shroud of Turin. The future will (maybe) tell us if I’m right or wrong ! Just for you to know that I’m not a liar, I also want to give you the exact reference about the fact that Jackson and Al., in their STURP paper about the possible image formation mechanisms, left the door open to the possibility of a hybrid mechanism that could well be natural. Here it is : Article : Correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3 D structure of a human body shape Authors : John P. Jackson, Eric J. Jumper and William R. Ercoline Citation : Page 2265 : “Thus the hybrid mechanism appears capable, to some degree, of forming images with the simultaneous relief and resolution characteristics found in the Shroud image.” After that, they talk about the fact that there is also important points of discrepancy in the experiment they’ve done. It’s true. But, what is also true, is the FACT that they didn’t tested EVERY possible hybrid mechanisms ! In fact, they tested one particular mechanism and that was a direct contact (by thermal contact) + a projection by diffusion mechanism (by a gaseous diffusion). What would be the result if they would test others hybrid mechanisms ? We don’t know ! So the fact that the authors state that a hybrid mechanism can theoretically account for both the relief and resolution characteristics found in the Shroud image, is not something we can take loosely ! Conclusion : MORE RESEARCHES ON HYBRID MECHANISMS NEED TO BE DONE !.","date":"2011-11-12","mins":"4:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4763","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I also want to give another possible answer to Gabriel that can explain (at least in part) the fact that the position of the hair in the Shroud image don’t seem to be natural for a corpse who lie in a tomb on his back and, on the contrary, look more, at first sight, like someone being in a vertical position. Gilbert Lavoie took this so called “anomaly” for granted and build a very bad hypothesis (in my opinion) about the body that would have levitated between the 2 parts of the Shroud during what he IMAGINE as the resurrection event and, then, the body would have been raised up in a vertical position just before some kind of radiation were released and produced the body images ! In this Hollywood scenario, Lavoie try to explain why the hair of the man of the Shroud looked like the hair of someone in a vertical position. And don’t get fool on this, he also try very hard to convinced people that the Shroud offer a scientific proof of the resurrection !!! I just want to say : ANOTHER ONE !!! In fact, this is another perfect example of Shroud pseudo science that is very bad for the credibility of sindonology in general. Ray Rogers, among others, fought against those kind of things all his life and I’m very grateful to him and to every other person in the Shroud world who keep his feet on the ground and try to stay logical and scientific about this cloth ! I really think there’s another explanation than the one given by Lavoie. I think this explanation can well be a combination of 2 important factors we have to remember versus the Shroud : 1 There was more blood on the body and in the hair than what appear on the Shroud, simply because a part of it was completely dry when the body was put into the Shroud, probably a pretty good time after death. In this context, we have to assume that the hair would have become rigid and kept a position similar to what they appeared while Jesus was on the cross. The coagulated blood and also the intense sweating of a man who was tortured intensely would account, at least partially, for the fact that the hair looks straight, just like a person in a vertical position. 2 This last factor is VERY OFTEN forgotten when it comes to analysed the Shroud images of the head. In fact, the head was not straight at all but bent forward and down to the chest. Why ? Simply because of the intense and rapid rigor mortis that would surely have been present in the case of a tortured man. So, when Jesus died, his head dropped down in the direction of his chest and stayed in this position because of the rigor mortis. Then, when the body was laid in the Shroud, the head was still in this position. This fact was already describe by Pierre Barbet around 1950 after an intensive study of the Shroud photos taken by Enrie in 1931. So, with this kind of bending of the head forward (toward the chest region), the hair (and their resulting images) would naturally look more like someone in a vertical position ! To me, this is THE most important factor (along with the rigid hair because of the sweat and the blood) that can explain the position of the hair in the Shroud images. Again, an example like that shows you that there’s no need for some kind of a supernatural explanation when you use you brain in a logical way and also, WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND !!!.","date":"2011-11-12","mins":"5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4714","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Read again point #4 of the list of Bucklin : The body had stiffened in Rigor Mortis.

For your blood question, I ask myself the same question ! I’ve made a long reflection about the blood and here’s my hypothesis about why there’s not more blood traces in the head and face region on the Shroud (while we know that any injury to the head region can easily cause an important bleeding – just like the description you did) : If we take notice of the study that was done about the Sudarium of Oviedo (http://www.shroud.com/heraseng.pdf), here’s the time estimation made by the authors (one of them was a pathologist by the way) : Jesus stayed about one hour on the cross after death. Then, he was dropped down from the cross and stayed on the ground another hour or so. Then, the body was moved to the tomb and this displacement took about 10 minutes. So, we have a total of about 2 hours and 10 minutes (maybe plus or minus 30 minutes) between the death of Jesus and the moment his body was laid in the Shroud. It’s well enough time for many of the blood clots that were still humid at the moment of his death to dried out completely and, because of that, those dried blood clot were not able to leave any imprint on the cloth. Only a small portion of the blood was able to stay enough humid during all this time to stained the cloth by the process called “decals of humid blood clots”. And for the face, notice how few blood stains are present there. I think there’s a good probability that the face was rapidly clean up with another cloth (by respect for the dead). If a rapid clean up of the face was really done, then I have to think the hypothesis of Lavoie who pretend the blood that we see in the hair region on both sides of the face was originaly directly on the face… But if the clean up was done just to remove the blood and fluid that was mainly present in the beard and mustache (and was not done on the cheeks), then, maybe Lavoie hypothesis is correct after all. This hypothesis of Lavoie is not easy to analyzed… What do you think of this hypothesis Ron ? But, for the blood present in the face and head region, if there’s not more decals present, I really think it is mainly due to the fact that the body was put in the Shroud only a long time after death, so that many blood clots that were humid at the time of death were not able to stay humid all this time and dried out completely. Only a small portion was able to stay humid enough to stain the cloth. This hypothesis is in total agreement with both the study done on the Sudarium of Oviedo and the gospel accounts for a burial that wasn’t prepared at all and wasn’t even expected..","date":"2011-11-13","mins":"8:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4769","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Thanks for your appreciation. The image formation process was acting differently only in a very subtle way between the front and the back part of the Shroud. The difference of the density seem to be very little and the penetration of the color is not deeper for the dorsal part of the Shroud that it is for the frontal part. The only difference seem to come from the fact that the back region of the body was generally in a closer proximity with the cloth than the frontal region. And, if we look closely at the frontal part of the Shroud, the face image is generally denser than the rest of the frontal image. This is another important aspect of the Shroud images that is not easy to explain. But, if we take the same logic than what I just told about for the back image, I think there’s some chances that this could be due mainly to the fact that the Shroud was in a closer proximity with the face than with the rest of the frontal part of the body. The image of the hands are also darker than most of the other parts of the frontal image, so we can think that, for this body part too, the Shroud was in a closer proximity. This probable closer proximity with the hands and the face regions can be explain by a little compression that could have been done by the people who participate in the burial rite (for whatever reason). And regarding the distance factor for the experiments made by Di Lazarro or for any hypothesis that pretend that the image is due to a burst of energy, what I never understand is the fact that beyond 4 cm, there’s no coloration. What kind of energy would be so subtle to create a coloration only within the first 4 cm of distance ? For me, it goes beyond the imagination… I think that’s the main point that show that those hypothesis are unable to fully explain the Shroud images. And in fact, this data of 4 cm can be reduce a bit, if we take notice of Mario Latendresse’s estimation. In the paper he presented at the 3rd conference on the Shroud in Dallas (in 2005), he wrote that, in his opinion, after only 2 cm, the image formation process had lost more than 80% of his capacity to color the cloth ! Ok, it’s only an estimation but I think it’s a pretty logical one when we look closely at the images. You can read this good article here : http://www.sindonology.org/papers/latendresse2005a.pdf (and you can find the 80% estimation on page 3). So, if this estimation is correct, WHAT KIND OF ENERGY WOULD LOSE 80% OF HIS CAPACITY TO COLOR A CLOTH WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE LIKE THAT (2 CM) FROM THE SOURCE ??? Good question, don’t you think ? Maybe I’m wrong but I don’t think a UV laser or a Corona Discharge can account for this data… To me, the fact the the image formation seemed to have been workingno more than a very close proximity way is the Achilles heel of these supernatural (or unnatural as Ron would say) hypotheses… Sorry, but I just can’t imagine one kind of energy that could act like that..","date":"2011-11-12","mins":"8:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4774","author":"yannick_clément","post":"And what about Beta particles ? ; ).","date":"2011-11-13","mins":"12:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4766","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Except for the proven 3 D properties of the Volckringer pattern !

Science has not been able to fully explain this phenomenon (maybe because of lack of experiments)… So how we can be sure that it is not a chemical process like that (maybe not exactly the same, but similar) that was at work to make the Shroud images ? Nobody know this answer for the moment. The 3 D property of the Shroud image, you’re right is the most difficult aspect of the question and, until this day, nobody has been able to show an image of a human body (or a human body part) that contain this kind of 3 D information. The mystery is still there BUT we have to be prudent not to link automatically the words “mystery” and “supernatural” !!!! That’s a problem that goes on in sindonology since STURP published their conclusion saying that they were not able to find one mechanism that can account for all the chemical and physical aspects of the Shroud images.

Please show me a proof that Alpha particles can act like the data that STURP report about the coloration on the Shroud ! What we have on the Shroud ? A coloration of the fibers that is the same no matter where we take a sample on the body images. Also, everywhere, it’s generally only the first fiber on the extreme surface that was colored. Also, beyond a distance of 4 cm from the body (the most probable source for the image formation process), no fibers were colored. And as mentioned earlier, Mario Latendresse report in his study an estimation that goes like this : Beyond 2 cm, the image formation process had already lost over 80% of his capacity to create a coloration. All this put together lead me to conclude that image formation process was a VERY MILD process. That’s important to remember when we have to evaluate the possibility for any kind of radiation (or burst of energy of any sort) as a possible image formation mechanism… That mean that the image formation process was done by direct contact and also by a vertical projection that was very limited in distance. That give us this data : From a point of direct contact until a distance of about 4 cm, any fiber that was colored was always colored the same way, with the same color and no more deeper into the cloth for a point of direct contact than for a fiber distant of 4 cm. Beyond 4 cm, no color at all ! So, I ask the questions : What kind of radiation (or any burst of energy of some sort) would act like that ? What kind of radiation (or any burst of energy of some sort) would color the fibers in the same exact way no matter those fibers are in direct contact with the source (the body) or distant of 4 cm from the source AND, at the same time, would not leave any color beyond this limit of 4 cm ? Normally, we would expect that the coloration would be more intense for the points of direct contact with the source (the body) than for the fibers distant from the source of about 4 cm. Rogers talked about “hot spots” that we could expect to see for the points of direct contact with the body if the image was done by radiation. But it’s not the way it goes with the Shroud. No traces of “hot spots” anywhere. That’s a very important aspect of the question… It’s one of the biggest mystery of those images. Very hard to explain. Another thing I don’t understand if the images were done by radiation is why, while the distance increase from the source (the body), the number of colored fibers decrease ? Again, what kind of radiation would act like that ? All this lead me to conclude that it would be easier for me to believe in a totally miraculous image than in a by product of the resurrection made by some sort of radiation… But, don’t worry, I don’t believe in either kind of process in regard of the Shroud images. Oh, and by the way, in the paper published by Jackson and Al. For STURP, it is clearly reported that radiations has a possible image formation mechanism didn’t fit correcly with the data we know about the Shroud… And many people seem also to forget that Ray Rogers was one of the top expert in radiation from Los Alamos National Lab. When you read his papers, for him, it was evident that the Shroud image wasn’t produced by a radiation (and he knew full well your Alpha particles by the way). It always amazes me that so many people seem to disregard Rogers opinion so easily, especially since he died and cannot defend himself no more. For me, when I read an opinion from a radiation specialist like him, I don’t know for you, but for me, I listen ! I don’t pretend that he could not have made some mistakes. But, when I see how much it was evident for him that radiations were not the solution for the Shroud images, I tend to believe him. I always say to myself : If an expert like him (who was there in Turin and did a close examination of the Shroud in person) didn’t see a clear sign of radiation in the body images of the Shroud, I have a big tendency to believe him. Rogers, contrary to some others researchers, didn’t had an agenda. So, why would he lied about that and hide the truth ? If radiation would be the solution, don’t you think he would have noticed some signs of it on the Shroud while he was in Turin and after, while he studied extensively many samples ?.","date":"2011-11-13","mins":"8:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4793","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Hello Gabriel !

I hope you don’t think that Rogers was fool enough to pretend that his paper covered ALL possibility of radiation effects on linen ! It’s pretty evident that his goal with this paper was not to make believe that he tried every possibility but to show that any radiation would NORMALLY leave signature traces on a fiber. Some signs that can be seen for trained eyes like him. On this particular subject, I would love to see what a guy like Rogers would think of the experiments done by Di Lazarro and what would be his own conclusions if he had the opportunity to analysed closely those samples. I’m not sure that he wouldn’t find some minor defects in the fiber structures of the fibers that are a bit different than the Shroud fibers structures, even if Di Lazarro pretend that both structures are the same… At least, I would love to see a scientific confirmation of Di Lazarro’s work by AN INDEPENDENT researcher… A chemist expert in UV radiations would be the best to do this kind of second opinion. Until an independent confirmation would be done, I’m still skeptic about the conclusions reached by Di Lazarro and his team. And even if Di Lazarro is right, his experiment is far from being totally on the nose with all the chemical and physical characteristics of the Shroud images. Just take the second face on the external part of the Shroud as an example of what I just say. The 3 D aspect of the image is another good example of things that Di Lazarro experiment is unable to replicate. To come back about Rogers, he show some example in his paper maybe with the use of high energy radiation, but that’s normal. He surely did that because that would be easier for him to show the effects on a fiber. I see his paper like a kind of teaching about radiation and their effects on linen, not as an extensive study of every kind of radiation and their effects on linen. The bottom line is this : Normally (for Rogers anyway) every possible radiation that we know would leave some kind of traces on linen fibers. Some kind of signature. What Rogers said is that he didn’t found anything like that on his samples from the Shroud images. And one major finding of Rogers is this one that goes against any radiation hypothesis : Everywhere on the Shroud, no matter if it’s in a body image region or in a non image region, the defects on the structure of the fibers ARE THE SAME. And those defects have the clear signature of defects NATURALY done by the aging process. Now, maybe the Shroud images were done by some kind of unknown radiation or unknown power that don’t leave any specific traces on fiber… But this is pure speculation. And I agree with you on one point : Nobody ever found a correct natural process to explain the Shroud image. But, at the same time, this conclusion is the same regarding unnatural hypothesis ! So, it’s not because nobody has found the correct process yet that this imply that it is surely an unnatural process..","date":"2011-11-16","mins":"11:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4717","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I forgot to talk about the question about the back image versus the image formation. First, I want to say that Miller and Pellicori, in their paper about the UV photos, noted that the back image was slightly denser than the frontal image. So, for me, it is a sign that the body weight had really an effect on the image formation but it is much more subtle than the scientists would have presumed. Also, my friend Barrie Schwortz once told me that there is some subtle signs of flattening in the back image. I don’t know if that observation can be found in scientific literature concerning the Shroud. In my opinion, if the Rigor Mortis was really intense, I don’t think it is abnormal that the image of the back looks like that on the Shroud. Also, in another paper he wrote for STURP, Sam Pellicori mentioned some experiments of coloration of linen he made with sweat, aloes, myrrh, olive oil, etc. All those things could have been present on the skin of the man of the Shroud and Pellicori wanted to analyze what kind of result could be produced if these things would be in contact with a linen cloth. His results were incredible ! He noted that almost all of those products could produce a coloration on linen after a long time (a good point for the latent image hypotheses) with a spectral property very similar to the Shroud body images. He obtained those results after the baking of his linen samples to simulate aging (a scientific standard procedure). Also, for some products (especially the sweat if I remember) he note, after simulated aging of his samples, that the spectral results tend to became the same, no matter if he pressed hard the sweat on the linen or just touch it very softly. For Pellicori, all those results prove that products like sweat, myrrh, olive oil, etc. Could, if they are made in contact with a linen cloth, produce a coloration, after a long time, very similar to the Shroud image and that they could account for the lack of notable difference in the color density between the dorsal and the frontal images we see on the Shroud. So, you see ? Before thinking that the Shroud image necessarily came from a miraculous event (or a by product of this event), anyone have to read carefully all the results of the analyses of the Shroud made by STURP. They don’t really point out to a miraculous process of image formation, even if they were not able to found one specific process that could account for the Shroud images. But that don’t mean this process will never be found in the future ! We have to wait until new series of direct researches will be done because there’s so much that still needed to be done before anyone have the right to discard every single natural possibilities for image formation… Why do you think the STURP team wanted to do a second series of direct tests on the Shroud in the middle of the 80s ? Because they were fully aware that there was still a lot of researches that needed to be done on the Shroud. We still wait for those researches and, personally, I have good hopes that some mysteries will be solved then… I know many people here will not be pleased to read my comment but that’s the truth !.","date":"2011-11-11","mins":"2:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-4720","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Don’t get me wrong : I don’t say that Pellicori found the correct image formation process.

I think you’re wrong about that. As I recall, the Centro’s conclusion indicates that it was placed very shortly after death occured and it stayed in contact with the head for 2 hours (not 2.5 hours). I just wanted to set the record straight about that. Nevertheless, I confirm that you’re right about the fact that the level of bilirubin for the Shroud man would definately have started to rise high during the very violent scourging that he suffered. No question about that. So, on that simple factual base, we can say to Daveb : Well try my friend but you’re hypothesis cannot explain a possible discrepancy (since we don’t know the result about that, we have to stay prudent here) between the level of bilirubin that was found on both cloths… I have asked Kelly Kearse to give me his opinion in the case there would really be a very strong discrepancy and he told that bilirubin was pretty sensible to degradation depending on environmental factors. Then, after I raised the fact that bilirubin was surely not so easily degradable because it is a proven fact that it was able to survived pretty well in the blood of the Shroud, even though we know that cloth was not always preserved well and even survived a big fire in 1532, he told me this, which is a pretty good answer : “It’s not that bilirubin is so unstable & that it’s so subject to degradation, it’s just something to keep in mind as a possible variable. Clearly, Heller & Adler detected bilirubin in the Shroud samples, so it was able to survive whatever environmental factors the cloth has been exposed to. The Shroud has been, of course, exposed to fire throughout its history it is difficult to say exactly what effect this may have had on certain areas of the cloth & any proteins/glycoproteins that are found there. Being folded, the intensity of the heat was most likely not uniform throughout, similar to a house burning down, but certain articles surviving. The variables throughout the histories of the Shroud & the Oviedo are a great unknown. In many respects, it may be difficult to achieve a side by side comparison for certain aspects of the cloths. I think it’s worth a try, but the most meaningful would be analysis using exactly the same method(s), with something to normalize to. As bilirubin has been reported to relatively sensitive to photolysis, it’s something to keep in mind, especially given the many unknowns of the conditions the cloths may have been subject to. It’s not as though the sample was applied to the same piece of material and torn in half, to be pieced together years later.” But in the end, if there really is a big discrepancy between the blood of the Sudarium and the blood of the Shroud (we’re not there yet, so the “if” is important), that would be a fact that would have to be considered as a piece of evidence AGAINST the idea that both cloths really covered the same head. But in the end, as M. Kearse once told me, the most important test that could be made would be a comparative DNA study between the Shroud and the Sudarium. Because the DNA is badly degraded on both cloths, maybe a proper comparative DNA study would be impossible, but it’s surely worth a try… To conclude on the question of the bilirubin level on the Sudarium, I just want to ask again the help of anyone who will read this in order to finally find the correct answer about that ! So, if someone know something about the bilirubin level that was found in the blood of the Sudarium, please, tell us the truth !!!!

Bennett and adress the very problematic issue of the two C14 dating that were done on the cloth in 1990 and 1992 (this lady made a presentation on the Sudarium in Panama this year and don’t even said a word about that !) and which gave these results : The first time (in 1990), two different C14 labs did the testing and gave two pretty close results of 642 869 (middle date of 756) for one (Tucson, Arizona) and 653 786 (middle date of 720) for the other (Toronto, Canada). The second time (in 1992), the C14 testing was only performed by the Arizona lab and gave a result of 540 754 (middle date of 647). Finally, it should be noted that the average date for these two series of tests is 708, which correspond to a time when Constantinople had become the capital of the false relics of Christianity, especially those associated with Jesus Passion. I also hope that M. Jones will talk about the complete absence of information concerning the level of bilirubin that was found in the blood samples from the Sudarium that were analyzed by Baima Bollone and maybe by some other medical experts. NOWHERE I have been able to find any information about that and I found this very strange because, in my opinion, if there’s a good “match” between the level of bilirubin that was found in the blood of the Sudarium and the very high level (much higher than normal) that was found by Adler in the blood of the Shroud, this would be an even better piece of evidence that both cloths have really covered the same head. But on the other hand, if the level of bilirubin that was found in the blood of the Sudarium is simply “normal” or “standard”, then I think this would be a very important piece of evidence to show that the Sudarium is probably a false relic that was created with the use of a real crucified body other than Jesus… Effectively, since both cloths are supposed to have covered the same bloody head one after the other, WE SHOULD EXPECT TO GET A LEVEL OF BILIRUBIN FOR THE SUDARIUM THAT WOULD BE VERY CLOSE TO THE ANOMALOUSLY HIGH LEVEL THAT WAS FIND BY ADLER ON THE SHROUD. DON’T YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT THIS TOTAL LACK OF INFORMATION CONCERNING THE LEVEL OF BILIRUBIN THAT WAS FOUND IN THE BLOOD OF THE SUDARIUM IS VERY BIZARRE (TO SAY THE LEAST) ??? I have tried to contact Baima Bollone directly by email on 2 different occasions about this in order to know the result he obtained and I never get any reply from him. I have also made numerous attemps elsewhere to find the correct result of bilirubin for the Sudarium (I even contact the Spanish Centro) and NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET AN ANSWER !!!! Strange you say ??? You bet !!! So, if someone out there know the truth about the level of bilirubin that was found in the blood from the Sudarium, please tell us the truth !!!!

I would not disagree to question these dating because they were unofficially done and in not optimal conditions or to consider the sample used doubtful because it was taken a long time before the dating (15 years or so), but I think it would not be scientific to reject completely these dating. I think this would be a big mistake and in the end, it would denote an evident bias. After all, the 2 sets of results were not incoherent. That’s a very important point to note ! On that particular subject, here’s the opinion of Timothy Jull from the Arizona C14 lab that did the 2 series of dating in 1990 and 1992 : “The two results… do not appear to me to be in disagreement. The ages are to my mind in agreement. One always gets some scatter between different measurements, although I agree it could be a little better in this case. I suppose it is possible that there is a small offset in the two ages due to the second having been heated, but the conditions you describe seem to me to be too low to have any great effect. We have material remaining from these samples, if there is some further question about the measurements.” This opinion from an expert like Jull just confirms what I just said about the fact that these 2 dating results are not incoherent… The other very important thing to note, of course, is the fact that, on the contrary to the Shroud dating of 1988, there is absolutely no solid scientific evidence of a contamination of some kind that would enable us to discard it. So, I think the best way to consider these 2 unofficial dating of the Sudarium is to think of them as 2 “preliminary results” that seems, at first sight, to indicates that MAYBE the Sudarium is a false relic of Christ made around 700 A.D. And the other very important thing to consider (for the Church at least) is that another official C14 dating done more properly MUST be performed in order to compare the result with these 2 preliminary results in order to evaluate correctly the real scientific value of these preliminary results. For the moment, I really think this is the best way to interpret these 2 C14 dating that were done in 1990 and 1992, and I would have like to see Miss Bennett say something about that in his paper… Of course, if someone could show some solid scientific evidence of contamination for the main sample that was used to date the cloth in 1990 and 1992, this would completely change the way to see these preliminary results, but so far, there’s nothing of that nature ! We should avoid thinking that because the Shroud’s dating of 1988 is certainly incorrect due to a probable repair or mending of the sampled corner that great doubts must necessarily be cast upon all the other C14 dating that were done (officially or not) for other cloths associated with Jesus Christ ! Thinking that way would be wrong. Totally and scientifically wrong. But in the end, I agree that a new dating done more properly should be done in the case of the Sudarium. I don’t understand why the Church have not done it yet ! Do they fear that the result would come out roughly the same as these 2 preliminary tests ? It’s possible….","date":"2012-10-15","mins":"10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/12/stephen-e-jones-starting-a-new-series-of-posts/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Stephen E.

And I’m sure this is NOT the conclusion of the EDICES. I have seen an interview with Mark Guscin on Shrouduniversity.com in which he showed how the cloth was folded and it is clear that it was first put on the head while the body was still on the cross and it must have stayed that way for around an hour ! What Guscin said would be completely wrong if it was true that the cloth would have been put on the head after an hour after death… This information from Guscin seem to be confirmed by the conclusion #11 found in the paper published by EDICES where we can read that once the body would have been placed on the ground with the Sudarium over his head, it would have stayed in this position for approximately ONE MORE HOUR. In my mind, that mean the body would have stayed also approximately one hour with the Sudarium while he was on the cross. In the light of the particular conclusion I gave you at the beginning of this comment, if Guscin is correct concerning the length of time the body would have stayed on the cross with the cloth over his head, then that mean the Sudarium must have been put on the head of the deceased person very shortly after his death. If I’m right about that, then that mean your interpretation of the conclusion #7 we can see in the paper published by EDICES must be wrong. First, let’s read again this particular conclusion: “At the bottom of the back of his head, there is a series of wounds produced in life by some sharp objects. These wounds had bled about an hour before the cloth was placed on top of them.” In my mind, what the scientists from EDICES really mean there is that these particular wounds were made from blood that was shed in life and not from post mortem. They didn’t meant that this particular bleeding happened at the exact time of time but WELL BEFORE ! If my interpretation is correct, that would not be in contradiction at all with the fact that the cloth would have been put on the head of the deceased person shortly after his death on the cross. But I have to admit that the paper published by EDICES is not always clear concerning the time when the cloth would have been put over the head of the deceased person… Effectively, in another part of the same paper, we read this : “help us to understand better what happened to the body of Jesus from an hour after his death on the cross, when the cloth was placed on his face, up till the time when it was taken off.” This particular comment found in the paper of EDICES is in total contradiction with the conclusion #7 that I gave you at the start of my comment !!!!

This important fact is well enough to completely reject any idea of a forger who would have painted the bloodstains on the Shroud ! The ONLY way the Shroud could have been created by a forger is to think that someone would have used a real crucified corpse that was showing all the stigmata of Christ, that he would have put this corpse in an antique linen cloth, that he would have waited between 24 and 72 hours and that he would finally had taken out the corpse from inside the Shroud so carefully that the bloodstains on the cloth remained completelly undisturbed (which is scientifically unexplainable for the moment). It’s very important to understand that such a scenario is the ONLY one that can possess some degree of credibility versus the reality of the Shroud… ALL the other forgery scenarios MUST be totally rejected. PERIOD ! And because of the fact that the Pantocrator styled images of Christ (dated from the beginning of the 6th century onwards) were probably influenced in some way by the Shroud, my conclusion is that if there really was this kind of “natural” forgery done, this could only have happened BEFORE 500 A.D.

He search the web and make a close examination of more than 300 paintings done between the 13th and the 16th century and he found three major differences between the image on the Shroud almost each of these paintings. Here it is : 1 99% of these paintings show the nails in the palm of the hands, while the man of the Shroud have them in the wrist area. 2 97% of these paintings show the crown of thorns like a headband, while the man of the Shroud have puncture wounds all over his scalp, meaning that he was wearing a helmet of thorns instead. 3 98% of these paintings do not show the nudity of Christ, while the man of the Shroud is completely naked. Those 3 major differences are well enough to show that it is highly unlikely that the Shroud could have been done by a medieval forger. I don’t say a medieval artist because the facts concerning the blood alone are well enough to understand that this is not any kind of artwork (you can forget the scorch hypothesis folks !), but, as I said before, the door have be open (even if the opening is not large to say the least) for the possibility that the Shroud could have been made by a forger using a real crucified body. But even in this highly unlikely scenario, we really have to wonder why in the world a forger like that would have departed so much from the artistic trend of his time (whether it be in the Middle Ages or in Antiquity) ??? That just doesn’t sound logical at all. If we use the Ockham razor principle here (I really love this logical principle !!!), the most likely answer (by far) is this : the Shroud is really a genuine burial shroud of somebody that was beaten, scourged and crucified by the Romans just like the Gospels tell us about Jesus of Nazareth. I believe that this is the very best scientific answer we can make right now..","date":"2012-04-14","mins":"9:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/13/russ-breault-here-is-one-gleaning-from-de-wesselows-book/","cat":"art","title":"Russ Breault:  ‘Here is one gleaning’  from de Wesselow’s Book"},{"id":"comment-10387","author":"yannick_clément","post":"To go deeper into this topic of the artistic trend of ancient time, here’s another quote from the article of Maurus Green about the ancient history of the Shroud of Turin : “A point of special interest is that the nakedness of the original gave the artists pause, since they often provide a loin cloth. I suggest that we have here important clues as to the treatment of the same Shroud when it was in Byzantine hands, due allowance being made for the more sophisticated, icon obsessed, Byzantine mentality. It is, after all, a major relic with its own in built icon, but an icon that the Syro Byzantine clergy could not possibly have exhibited as such during the long centuries of the Christological and Iconoclastic controversies. What success would a naked, horribly wounded, mysteriously blurred, dead Christ have enjoyed in those troubled centuries? Or later when the triumphant Holy Images were the very centre of religion? Hiat negative bleeding death mask would have been an embarrassment to orthodox and heretics alike. The solution was to have its face copied and turned into living portraits of Christ – Mandylions, the Pantocrator or Christ the Teacher.” This comment is in total agreement with the hypothesis of Paul Vignon who thought that the Mandylion was a false relic made by the Church of Edessa to fight heresies that denied the Incarnation of God and the two natures of Jesus (mainly, his humanity). Vignon thought that since the Church wasn’t able to show the Shroud to the faithful of that time (because this kind of burial cloth would have been considered sacrilageous and scandalous), a decision was made to make a face copy of a living Christ instead (without any injury or blood stain) in order to have a perfect tool to fight those heresies and be able to “prove” those 2 important dogmas of the Church : the Incarnation and the 2 natures of Christ. We have to understand that, before the 13th and 14th century, there is no example of a realistic artwork depicting the suffering Christ… During those days (let’s say before the sacking of Constantinople in 1204), an horrible and naked image like the Shroud would have been considered completely sacrilageous and scandalous by the faithful. We always have to remember the repulsive character that a burial shroud like could have had for the people of the ancient time (please, avoid to look at it through your modern eyes). That’s the principal reason I don’t believe at all in the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson. If there was no blood or wounds in the face region of the Shroud, that could be another story, but since the face on the Shroud is a real indicator of the Passion of Christ, I truly believe (just like Green said in his article and Vignon thought) that this kind of image would have been “religiously incorrect” if the Orthodox clergy would have dare to show it to the faithful before the sack of Constantinople. I know all this sound redundant in my mouth but I think I bring one more argument to defend my position against Wilson’s hypothesis, namely the artistic context of the time versus everything related to the Passion of the Christ !!! I leave you with a very good question : In the context where an image of Jesus in his Passion, as it could be seen on the Mandylion (from the perspective that Wilson is right), was known to the faithful because of public expositions of the relic and his image (important note: in the case of the Mandylion, we know that there have been), how is it then that the hyper realistic character of the visible signs of the Passion on the relic (the crown of thorns, for example) had no influence and has left no trace, over the years, in the Byzantine Christian art related to the Passion of the Christ over the years, from perhaps the fifth or sixth century to the late 12th century ??? In other words, if Wilson’s hypothesis was correct, why we have to wait until the 13th or the 14th century to see the art concerning the Passion of the Christ change drastically and start to show the suffering of Christ with some realism (while the Mandylion is known to have been in Edessa from maybe the 6th century until 944 and in Constantinople from that moment until 1204 at least) ??? And if Wilson’s hypothesis was correct, why the suffering Christ that would have been visible for all to see (during each public showing) would not have been reproduced in any of the many copies of the Mandylion, some of which were done while the relic was still in Constantinople (and we know from the Narratio manuscript that the relic was publicly showed once a year during those days) ??? Doesn’t make any sense at all ! Note : this period of great change in Christian art in the 13th and 14th century correspond precisely with the first known public showing of the Shroud (not the Mandylion, the Shroud) in 1203 in Constantinople. I think there’s a great link there ! I think that those public showing (one every friday) reported by Robert de Clari in Constantinople were the starting point of this great wind of change regarding the art related to the Passion of the Christ. Personally, I estimate that those public showing can well be the first ever public showing of the body images that are present on the Shroud. That’s were I stand in my reflection… That’s the main reason why I don’t believe at all in this hypothesis of Ian Wilson..","date":"2012-04-14","mins":"11:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/13/russ-breault-here-is-one-gleaning-from-de-wesselows-book/","cat":"art","title":"Russ Breault:  ‘Here is one gleaning’  from de Wesselow’s Book"},{"id":"comment-4818","author":"yannick_clément","post":"My point is not about the source of an hypothetic radiation bombardment.

And this is true for all the time that we’re sure this relic was known and shown publicly, i.e. From the 6th century in Edessa until the sack of Constantinople in 1204. In fact, what we can learn from the history of Christian art is this : Humanity had to wait until the 13th and the 14th century before a Christian artist decide to depict the Passion of the Christ with any sense of realism whatsoever. At that time, we’re not even 100% sure where was the Holy Mandylion !!! If Wilson was right with his idea that the Mandylion was the Shroud of Turin folded in 8, there’s absolutely no doubt in my mind that the signs of the Passion that would have been easily visible on the cloth would have left some kind of an impact on the Christian art of the Passion of the Christ. There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind that the drastic changes of the 13th and 14th century that we can learn from the history of art would have come much sooner if the Image of Edessa (Mandylion) really was the Shroud of Turin folded in 8. There’s no speculation possible about the fact that the face on the Shroud is a direct and very graphic throwback at the Passion of the Christ and it just make no sense at all that an image like that would not have greatly influenced the Christian art, starting with the Byzantine art, especially all the copies of the Mandylion that were done from the time the relic reached Constantinople in 944 and was showed publicly once every year (the first sunday of the CARÊME). And, on this particular topic of the copies of the Mandylion, what we can learn from the history of Christian art is this : Since EVERY copy of this relic show an image of the face of the living Christ on a small piece of cloth (this is an historic fact as good as any other scientific fact), we have to think that the most likely answer to explain this phenomenon is simply the fact that this is exactly how this relic looked like !!! Conclusion : if we use Ockham razor, along with the precious helps of the history of Christian art (especially the history of Byzantine art), in order to analyse properly the hypothesis of Ian Wilson about the Mandylion, it is as obvious as the nose in anyone’s face that the most likely answer is this : The Mandylion was a small cloth showing only the face of a living Christ with no signs of injuries and no traces of blood on it. No speculation at all is needed to reach this conclusion !!! As Maurus Green wrote in his article (I say it in my words) : This is the most prudent conclusion we can reach for the moment and we don’t have the right to change this conclusion. Not until new document or artwork can be found and that would bring such evidence (not speculative arguments) that it will force us to change this conclusion. Finally, I would say that there’s one more aspect of the Mandylion that the history of Christian art is able to tell us. It is the very probable influence that this relic had on Christian art related to the living face of Christ. In my opinion, this is where we can see some historical evidence of an influence that the Mandylion had on Christian art. No doubt that this relic was the catalyst, along with the Christ Pantocrator icon, that greatly helped to reach an uniformity (we can also say “reach a standard”) in all the depictions of Christ after the 6th century. THAT’S WHERE THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANDYLION CAN BE SEEN WHEN WE STUDIED THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN ART WITH AN OPEN MIND AND NOT SOME BIAS MIND. Sorry but there’s absolutely no traces of an influence that this relic had on the Christian art related to the Passion of the Christ, proving that this cloth had absolutely nothing to do with the Passion of the Christ. As a matter of fact, history of ancient documentary sources can totally confirm this ! Effectively, there is no, I repeat, absolutely no ancient writer (whether it’s Saint John Damascus, the emperor Constantine VII or anyone else) who have include the Image of Edessa or the Holy Mandylion in their list of the relics related to the Passion of the Christ. I repeat it again to make sure you understand this most crucial FACT (again, this is an historic fact as good as any other scientific fact) : In all the ancient lists related to the Passion of the Christ, there’s absolutely none of them that include the Image of Edessa or the Mandylion in them, while there’s plenty that include a shroud of Christ or, sometimes, burial cloths of Christ (in plural). And to understand that it is completely normal that those lists of relics exclude the Mandylion, all you have to do his listen the message proclaim very loud by the history of Christian art : The Mandylion was a relic of the living Christ that had nothing to do with his Passion and death ! Direct consequence of this conclusion : This cloth had nothing to do (at least, not directly) with the Shroud of Turin. That’s it folks ! That’s where my extensive research and reflection have leaded me. Now it’s up to you to make up your mind about the hypothesis of Wilson. At least, you now have the other side of the historical coin that Wilson and all his disciples do not want you to know (and/or don’t even want to look at this other side of the coin themselves) !!!  To conclude this long summary, here’s a personal message I want to address to M. Breault and all the other fans of Wilson’s hypothesis : If it’s true that you’re really interested by the history of Christian art, I really hope you will consider with great care, and with a very open mind, all the facts, evidences and reflections that I give you in this comment (and in the other one I’ve written yesterday) !!! I said it before and I’ll say it again : On the contrary to Ian Wilson and others who have published papers and books to defend his hypothesis, I have personally absolutely nothing to gain by telling you what I consider as truth, except the pure satisfaction of maybe elevate a bit the debate and maybe “force” some open minded people (I’m sure there are some) to reconsider what they, until now, have consider as an solid truth. Who knows ? Maybe some will start to see things differently ? Personally, I’ve reach the point where I have no other choice than to find another hypothesis that can properly and logically explain the dead silence of the ancient sources regarding a shroud of Christ that would bears the entire body images of Jesus. It’s true, before the testimonies of Nicolas Mesarites and Robert de Clari at the beginning of the 13th century in Constantinople, there’s absolutely no ancient document that specified that there was an entire body image of Jesus on his burial shroud. Deep down in my mind and also in my heart, I know that Wilson’s hypothesis about the Mandylion IS NOT THE ANSWER to this great mystery (note : this is a mystery only for us who believe the Shroud of Turin is authentic). The bottom line is this : I have to search elsewhere !!! Where ? I have some ideas right now but I’m far from reaching the point where I can claim to have found a coherent and complete hypothesis… I have an ego but he’s not that big !!!  Yannick Clément, the truth seeker ! : ) P.S. : I know very well that my point of view is somewhat of a pain in the *ss for many people around here, but sorry, I can’t keep quiet !!! No way. Simply because I trust my judgement about this subject. And what I want people to realise the most is this : the Mandylion hypothesis is very far from having win the right to be considered an authentic theory accepted by most historians !!!

I think it’s a more promising avenue for the Sudarium of Oviedo than for the Shroud thanks to the vaccuming of the cloth done during the 2002 restoration ! The question is : can we found enough pollens now for a proper study ? Also, the problem with radiocarbon dating the pollens is the evident question regarding the time when they were put on the cloth… For all we know, any pollens on the cloth could have come on the cloth just 100 years ago or 1000 years ago ! In my mind, it won’t be evident to determine the true age of the cloth with this method, even if there’s still enough pollens left on it to do a proper study. By the way, in a book written on the Shroud in 2000 by Baima Bollone, he talked about some biological tests (I don’t remember if it is related to DNA studies) that could be done on the blood to determine his age !!! When I read that, I found this avenue really promising because we’re pretty sure the blood on the cloth is pretty much of the same age than the Shroud. I wonder if Mr. Moose or anybody else know something about that ??? Anyone has some informations about the possibility of a test like that ???

The first techniques for this estimation have been based on the evaluation of the diminution of the solubility of the hematic substance in a variety of aqueous solvents. Since a long time, the scientists thought that the color changes of the bloodstains from red to black were caused by the oxidation of the haemoglobin. Many researches were done to test that hypothesis. Petterson took measurements of the color changes with a reflectance colorimeter and succeed to invent an objective method for evaluating the age. A non destructive spectrophotometric method has been developed by Kind and others, and a similar procedure has been applied to alkaline extracts from blood stains by Kind and Wozzon. The immuneelectrophoresis, the surface absorption spectrometry, the changes in enzymatic activities of the blood cells and an electronic resonance technique are some other methods applied to evaluate the age of blood stains.” Note : Baima Bollone then give the reference of a scientific article : J. Andrasko, The Estimation of Age of Bloodstains by HPLC Analysis, in Journal of Forensic Science, 42, 1997, pp. 601 607. He then said : “The same Andrasko has been able to evaluate the age of some bloodstains with a precision of + or – 2 months, thanks to the HPLC method.” Interesting don’t you think ? Isn’t very strange that nobody (as I know) in sindonology have tried to make some studies like that from blood samples taken by the STURP ??? Nevertheless, I’ve noted that Baima Bollone never speak about the evaluation of VERY OLD BLOODSTAINS. Maybe those methods are only able to evaluate the age of recent bloodstains ? I’ve also noted that he never said a word about the FACT that the bloodstains from the Shroud are very particular in the sense that were not formed with complete blood, but instead, they were mainly formed by the direct contact between the cloth and blood clots that were still humid enough on their surface (at various degrees), so that they were able to leave a mirror imprint. Even if I’m no expert, I’m pretty sure that this particularity of the bloodstains on the Shroud make also things much more complex when it’s time to apply those methods to evaluate the exact age of the stains… One thing’s for sure, if Adler was still alive, I would try to contact him in order to get is impression about those possibilities ! And I found it strange that a forensic expert like Baima Bollone simply talked briefly about those methods without mentioning if he, personally, have done some analysis like that. After all, he had in his possession some blood samples from his own investigation of the cloth done in 1978, just before the STURP. I would really like to know the point of view of a blood expert (or at least a forensic expert) about those possible methods to evaluate the age of bloodstains.

That mean he had the power to change his normal physical appearence in some way… To me, this was done for one purpose : To respect the freedom of his closest friends !!! He never wanted to “force” them to believe. They still needed FAITH to believe that it was really Jesus in front of them. This, to me, is a great proof of the love of God ! He respect so much our liberty that he didn’t wanted to “force” his disciple to believe he was resurrected..","date":"2012-08-12","mins":"6:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/11/yannick-clments-summa-theologica/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Yannick Clément’s Summa Theologica"},{"id":"comment-14842","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Effectively.

After that, the sample was given to Ray Rogers by Gonella in 1980 for analysis. Rogers state in his book that the sample came to him in a very bad state. Here’s what he say about that : “There was very little sample in the envelope (note : in fact, there was only some red flecks that were still there). The Zina sample had been cut to pieces.” Nevermind that fact, Rogers choose go ahead and analyzed some red flecks found in the envelope with the method known as pyrolisys mass spectrometry, which is a very precise method to found any organic material that would be present in a sample. Even if the state of the sample was no good, he still did the analysis because he did some previous chemical testings on the biggest red fleck he could find in the envelope and the results give him a good confidence that this red material was really blood. For the pyrolisys mass spectrometry, he got a high peak that indicate the presence of hydroxyproline. Carlos interpretation of this result is, of course, interesting in the context of a tortured and crucified body, but I think we should be careful not too extrapolate too much from this one single finding. I really don’t know if Heller and Adler have found traces of hydroxyproline in their own blood sample analysis. I’m really not sure about that. If hydroxyproline could be confirm in other blood samples coming from elsewhere on the Shroud, then the interpretation of Carlos would be much more possible in my mind. Anyway, it’s important to note that it’s not the most important thing that came out of this particular analysis of the red fleck made by Rogers. Let’s hear Rogers himself about that : “The appearance of a low temperature emission of hydroxyproline sets a definite upper limit on the highest temperature that could have been seen by the blood after it appear on the cloth. The blood WAS NEVER HEATED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE by boiling the Shroud in oil (as sometimes had been suggested) or BY THE IMAGE FORMATION PROCESS.” To me, that’s the main finding that came from the pyrolisys mass spectrometry analysis of the Zina samples that was made by Rogers. This finding is very important because it tend to corroborate the idea that the image formation process was probably active at room temperature without creating a high increase of temperature. This goes well with any natural image formation process involving a chemical reaction between the surface of the cloth and some biological substances coming from the dead body. Of course, this is just one clue in favor of these kind of chemical hypotheses, and never constitute a proof. But anyway, in my mind, this is an important data that point directly in that direction and not at all in the direction of some kind of energetic radiation that would have come from the corpse. It would be interesting if one day, some independent researchers could confirm this finding of Rogers, by using another blood sample that would come from another part of the Shroud and that would be in a better state of conservation. Independent confirmation my friends ! Everything is there. And in the case of any findings concerning the Shroud, I think it’s even more prudent to wait for 2 different independent confirmation coming from 2 different samples before considering a particular finding as an authentic fact !!!.","date":"2012-08-12","mins":"6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/07/and-yannick-responds-to-giulios-comments/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Yannick Reacts to Special Issue"},{"id":"comment-14844","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The most important things to keep in mind from what Father Carreira said to me is this : At the moment of the Resurrection of Christ, all his entire human reality (body, spirit and soul) begin to exist outside the space time frame. Of course, he could still interact with the material world, as we see in the apparition scenes in the Gospels, but he (body and soul) is not restrict to this material world no more and suffering and death as no power over him no more (just like everyone of us will experiment one day). I truly believe that at the time of the Resurrection, Jesus material body disappeared to enter a new reality (spiritual). In the Gospels, we can see that, after the event, his apparitions to his closest friends in the material world were done in a way that show clearly what I just said : his body could disappear anytime he wanted and he could pass through the doors or walls.

In fact, it’s precisely the opposite ! It ensure us that he had no religious bias when it comes to Shroud research, which is something we can’t say of many modern Shroud “scientists”. Religious thinking MUST stay out of any credible scientific research, and this is also true (even more maybe) concerning the study of the Shroud of Turin (because it’s so easy to fall into that religious or supernatural trap for any scientist who happen to be at the same time a Christian devotee). And if sometimes Rogers could have sounded like a “preacher” in his writings (I agree), it is most probably due to the fact that he felt that many persons in the Shroud world (researchers) were not doing science as it should be and he wanted to teach them the RIGHT WAY to do science (whether it concern the Shroud or any other material object in the Universe). In the end, I prefer 1000 times to see a Raymond Rogers (no matter what was his personal beliefs versus God and the Resurrection of Christ) doing Shroud researches with integrity, rigor and professionalism than seeing all those religious biased people who pretend doing Shroud science these days. How can you trust these researchers, their hypotheses and their findings when you have a profound sense that these people have a preconceived notion (religious of course) versus the Shroud ? With a scientist like Rogers, even if he could have made mistakes like anyone else, at least, there was no such religious bias and we can easily assume without too much risks that his research was not driven by his personal feeling (or preconceived ideas) because, as a rationalist, he had no will to “use” the Shroud for any purpose whatsoever… Some people in the anti Rogers clique seems to try hard these days to discredit his honesty versus his researches on the Shroud by saying that he desperately wanted to show that the image was formed naturally. But… WHAT ELSE CAN YOU EXPECT OF A REAL SCIENTIST ??? Of course he will try hard to find a natural explanation for the image !!! Of course, since he’s a scientist (and not a Jesus freak) ! And for sure, that don’t make him someone with some obscure agenda to “disprove” the supernatural reality of the Shroud ! This kind of thinking is completely ludicrous..","date":"2012-08-08","mins":"3:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/07/and-yannick-responds-to-giulios-comments/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Yannick Reacts to Special Issue"},{"id":"comment-14654","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here, I want to reply to Daveb’s comment #9 (and I think this comment will calm down also our friend Carlos) : Dave, I think your comment is very interesting. First of all, may I suggest you to read again my recent paper concerning the question of the authenticity of the Shroud. You’ll see that I’ve developed 4 possible scenarios to explain the relic and that one of them (the last one) include the possibility that the image on the Shroud could come, directly or not, from the Resurrection of Christ. And if you pay attention to the footnote related to the description I’ve make of the 4th scenario, you’ll read this : “This 4th scenario might shock some because it is based on a dogma of faith (the Resurrection of Christ) and, by definition, it goes beyond the pure scientific rationality. But, since the Shroud of Turin is considered by Christian tradition as being the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, it seems justified to keep open that possibility, even if, in face of all the known and confirmed data, such a scenario is not necessarily the most probable. For a very detailed analysis of that possibility, see: Raymond N. Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, Barrie Schwortz Editor and Publisher, July 2008. So, I hope now you can admit the fact that it’s not true that I have completely shut the door to the possibility of a miraculous event in the case of the Shroud, even if I don’t considered this avenue as the most probable ! Stating that the image on the Shroud could not have been, in any way, a direct product or a by product of the Resurrection of Christ was not the point I tried to make with my editorial letter. In fact, I agree with you that, on a PERSONAL AND PRIVATE BASIS, it is truly possible for someone to BELIEVE that the image on the Shroud is related to the Resurrection of Christ. I know very well that this is not an idea that the Catholic Church officially promote, but I don’t think we should (or can) FORCE someone to deny that faith if it’s what he believe. Besides, we can teach them properly about the Shroud and his image, but that’s another story… Anyway, the MOST IMPORTANT POINT I wanted to express in my editorial is this : If someone (and it is pretty evident that, sadly, there are many modern sindonologists in that category) start or base his study of the Shroud of Turin on the preconceived notion that the Resurrection SHOULD have something to do with the body image on the cloth and, consequently, avoid, neglect or, even worse, refuse completely to considered properly all the possibilities that exist for a natural occurring image formation, especially in the light of the observations, conclusions and hypotheses reported by Ray Rogers and others (especially concerning the probable chromophore of the image), then this person is guilty of doing a bad science, because it is religiously biased. Period. As I often said here on the blog, religious dogmas or ideas should not have anything to do with any good scientific research. And if such a person go ever further and try to “prove” the Resurrection using the image on the Shroud, then this is called “doing science with a religious agenda in the back of your mind” and it is a complete shame in comparison to any scientific research that is performed in the state of the art, following completely and honestly the scientific method (i.e. Following ALL the data and facts no matter where it leads you and what the conclusion can be, even if it goes against some preconceived notions you could have at the beginning). A “scientist” that would be found guilty of such a “crime” should not be considered “reliable” no more on this particular subject and I’m sure there’s some modern sindonologists (I don’t want to mention any name here) that are part of that group ! It’s interesting you mention the fact that the Catholic Church will NEVER proclaim a miracle before science has done a complete in dept analysis of the reported phenomenon and find out that this phenomenon CANNOT be scientifically explained by the known Laws of nature. I really think that if we apply this notion with honesty (and without any religious feelings) to the image on the image on the Shroud, we have to conclude that it is not possible, in this particular case, to call this a “miracle” (and the Church never claim the image to be miraculous by the way) for the simple and good reason that it is really premature to state that science CANNOT explained this thing with the known Laws of nature. That’s the reality because the Shroud and his image, up until this day, has not been DIRECTLY analyzed enough by science for someone to claim that science has come full circle concerning this image and 1 is still not able to define and understand his nature (the chromophore) and 2 is still not able to describe a natural theory that can account for all the known physical and chemical characteristics of the image. Even if a lot of researches have been made on the relic, we have to understand that direct testing has only been made once (by STURP and some Italians in 1978 and the years following), along with some more researches done after that by other scientists claiming they have worked with authentic samples from the Shroud. In this context, I really don’t think anyone has the right to proclaim that science has made a full and complete examination of the relic so far. The best proof of that can be found in the fact that the STURP team, right after having published his final peer reviewed article concerning the research on the Shroud, was already asking permission to the Cardinal of Turin and the Vatican for a second round of direct testing on the cloth !!!! Because of the fact that science still need further testing on this relic before it can be said that the analysis is complete, no one can proclaim that the image SHOULD have been caused by a miraculous event. Personally, I think science is pretty close to answer the first question concerning the image chromophore and concerning the second question (the one related to the image formation process), it’s evident that this will be the more complex “mystery” to resolve, but if we can understand perfectly the real nature of the chromophore (question #1), then I truly believe science would be in a pretty good position to find the proper answer for the second question, especially if more testing under laboratory conditions can be performed to analyze more deeply some interesting natural image formation processes like the Maillard reaction proposed by Rogers (and there are others natural suggestions also interesting that exist) in the context of a body who suffered a long torture prior to his death by crucifixion and who was enveloped (probably loosely) in a shroud that was probably manufactured with the ancient method of making linen cloths. In fact, this is precisely the SECOND MOST IMPORTANT POINT I wanted to make with this editorial letter ! To me, if science can finally find what is the real nature of the image chromphore (without any serious doubt), then it will be much easier to evaluate correctly all the proposal that have been made over the years concerning the most probable process (or processes) that can explain the image formation on the cloth in the very particular context I just describe. And this should hallowed science to finally have a much clearer idea of the direction where to search in order to find the solution to this enigma. I really think that this should be sufficient to eventually permit the resolution (once and for all) of this “mystery”, thanks to the scientific method. If what I just said could be confirmed in the future, then I don’t think the possibility for the body image to have come from the Resurrection of Christ (and consequently, to be called “miraculous”) will still be there. Remember what Sagan said : Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence. It’s not because the image is not fully understood today that it will always be that way in the future and that we have the right to call for a supernatural event in order to explain it… This TRUTH is very important if we want to stay scientifically sound in our analysis of the Shroud of Turin and his image (or any other material objects in the Universe by the way). Remember that science, in face of something it can’t explain, will ALWAYS add that this is only true for today because, as Barbet said very well in his book : WE CAN’T PRESUME OF THE FUTURE ! So, that why you will always see conclusions like this : In the PRESENT STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, science cannot explain this phenomenon. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME WITH THE SHROUD and, if we want to stay scientifically credible, we should recognized that there is no good reason (not even the tradition that state it is the burial Shroud of Christ) to believe otherwise ! And let’s never forget what Francisco Alconchel Pecino said in his recent paper about the C14 issue : “Probably the controversy arose because, once more, HUMAN INNOCENCE WAS SURPRISED BY THE SUBTELTIES OF MOTHER NATURE.” This great TRUTH should always be kept in mind when it comes to analyzed the Shroud and his image… Unfortunately, this is not always the case (to say the least) ! And concerning the idea that an earthquake could be responsible for the image, front and back, of a human corpse on a linen shroud, I’m sure I’m not the only to find this possibility quite absurd. Anyway, as I said, let’s wait for science to finally find out what is the true nature of the image chromophore and then, we’ll have a much better scientific basis to analyze properly if this hypothesis of the earthquakes can have any chances to explain the image on the Shroud… Is it a deal ??? ; ) But be sure of one thing (I don’t want to presume of anything here. I just emit an hypothesis), if Rogers was correct about the image chromphore (i.e. That it resides ONLY in a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers), then this earthquakes hypothesis (or any other hypothesis involving an energetic radiation) would really be in jeopardy. That’s why the exact nature of the image chromophore is so important to confirm and, in my mind, that should be the MAIN QUESTION that an eventual new series of direct researches on the cloth SHOULD TRY TO ANSWER IN PRIORITY. Because you can be sure of one thing : if the question of the chromophore is not properly answered and stay covered in doubt (as it is today), it will never be possible to prove any hypothesis of image formation ! I hope that my call concerning the resolution of this most important issue will be heard by some competent ears !!! One thing’s for sure : It doesn’t seem to have been heard by M. Fanti ! I say that because in his most recent paper “Open issues regarding the Turin Shroud”, here’s the 3 major issues in his mind : The formation of the image (as expected, it comes in #1 place even if, as I said, it should always come in #2, after the image chromophore), the conservation and his dating. You see ? NOT EVEN A WORD about the most crucial question of it all concerning the Shroud, which is the image chromophore !!!! This is truly incredible and pretty shameful… Let’s hope that other scientists will heard my call much better than M. Fanti, who seem to think (wrongly) that this question of the chromophore was settled with his 2010 paper in which he proclaimed, without any chemical testing to back it up, that the image chromophore was most probably the primary cell wall and not a thin layer of impurity on top of the fibers !!!! As I said in my editorial, it’s not surprising at all that he claimed this, since it is truly possible to colored only the primary cell wall of a linen fiber without affecting his core with a corona discharge (as demonstrated by an experiment done by Rogers himself !!!). Meditate on that for a while and you’ll see that all this doesn’t smell very good, to say the least. And what is also important (and shameful) to note is the fact that this question of the chromophore seem to be (wrongly) settled in the mind of many other sindonologists. I say that because, in Valencia earlier this year, a bunch of them had no difficulty to sign a list of “facts” proposed by M. Rolfe, in which we originally found the hypothesis of the primary cell wall, while the hypothesis of Rogers was completely cast out !!! To me, this is a VERY GOOD CLUE that clearly shows the very bad state of sindonology these days… I’ll say it again : This is really shameful !!! When he see that, Rogers (and others) must turn over in his grave !!! THE FACT IS THIS : THE QUESTION OF THE IMAGE CHROMOPHORE HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY CONFIRMED YET AND SHROUD SCIENCE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT INSTEAD OF ON IMAGE FORMATION !!! It’s only when this question will be properly settled that we could focus our attention on the image formation process… Final note : At least, there’s one good thing that can be found in this paper from Fanti : For the first time (to my knowledge), in page 3 of his paper, he recognize the fallacy of his conclusion of the probabilistic model he once made and that gave a probability of 100% (!) that the Shroud is really the authentic Shroud of Jesus Christ (note : he doesn’t say “Jesus of Nazareth” as it should for a scientist, but “Jesus Christ”, which speak very loud to me). At least, here, M. Fanti was able to recognize that his result had no value whatsoever because they were based on “subjective evaluations”. At least, this recognition is one good point for him !!! P.S. : I am currently writing a follow up paper to my article concerning the authenticity of the Shroud and, in it, I will do an in deep analysis of the second part of the question of the Shroud authenticity, which is the real identity of the man of the Shroud. I hope to be able to finish it this autumn… One thing’s for sure : you will never see me stating that the probability that this is really the Shroud of Jesus (of Nazareth !!!) is 100%, simply because it wouldn’t be an acceptable conclusion, scientifically speaking. On that particular question, we’re dealing with probabilities, not certainties!.","date":"2012-08-09","mins":"8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/07/and-yannick-responds-to-giulios-comments/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Yannick Reacts to Special Issue"}]
