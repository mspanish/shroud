One of them was named “The image of Beirut”. Another one appeared in Constantinople before the first mention of a miraculous image in the Abgar legend… But, to me, the most probable explanation for these very few mentions of a full body image come from the fact that, around the time of the first mention (I think it’s the 10th or 11th Century, there were both a shroud of Christ (probably the actual Shroud of Turin) and the Mandylion that were kept in Constantinople.

Scavone is adressed to me personally. I also want to say that the fact that M. Scavone is a “well respected” historian in the Shroud world doesn’t mean that much to me. I seek the truth, I don’t seek to make friends and I’m not impress by the fact that someone can be well known in the Shroud world… That doesn’t mean this person is unbias. On the other hand, I agree that sometimes, I can use some “angry tone” in my messages, but it is simply because I am who I am : a passionate guy who take this subject seriously (too much ? maybe !) and who seek the truth. M. Scavone, it is incredible how some of your arguments seem to be full of bias. One thing’s for sure : they are based on speculations and extrapolations and cannot be taken as solid facts that can prove Wilson’s hypothesis ! With your answer, I understand more why you (and M. Latendresse and many other “shroudies”) follow Wilson so blindly… This is normal because, in order to be able to be able to make a direct link between the Mandylion (that mean a towel by the way) and a burial Shroud, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO USE A BUNCH OF SPECULATIONS AND EXTRAPOLATIONS. And the best example of that is always the “tetradiplon” thing. M. Scavone, can you be honnest here and tell anyone that the word “sindon” in greek doesn’t mean necessarily a burial shroud ??? The reality is this : it depend on the context !!!! It can mean simply “cloth” in a more general sense or a tunic ! Here’s what Mark Guscin (a linguist) say about that in his book “The Image of Edessa” : “The cloth that Jesus wiped his face with is called both “tetradiplon” and “sindon”, bringing into the story for the first time the idea the IDEA THAT THE IMAGE WAS ON CLOTH.” You can see here that Guscin doesn’t understand the word “sindon” like you do ! For him (and for me), the best way to understand this word, in the context of this particular manuscript, is “cloth”, not “burial shroud”. Can I give you an advice ? Go back to the part of the text where the words “tetradiplon” and “sindon” are used and try for a second to think the author was meaning a burial shroud while using those words ! IT IS COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT !!!!!!!! In fact, it is purely speculative to understand that he was really meaning a burial shroud ! Here’s that critical part of the manuscript : “And Ananias, having gone and given the letter, was carefully looking at Christ, but was unable to fix Him in his mind. And He knew as knowing the heart, and asked to wash Himself; and a cloth [sindon tetradiplon] was given Him; and when He had washed Himself, He wiped His face with it. First of all, this story take place BEFORE Jesus Passion and death, during his ministry, while he was alive and well, without any injuries or blood stains ! And also, the author is specific about the FACT that Jesus ONLY wiped his FACE (not his whole body) with the cloth !!! In this particular context, HOW IN THE WORLD THIS AUTHOR WAS TALKING ABOUT A LONG BURIAL SHROUD OF MORE THAN 4 METERS ?????? THIS IS COMPLETELY LUDICROUS. That’s a perfect “full of bias” interpretation of an ancient text in order to defend “at all cost” Wilson’s hypothesis !!!! I have a question for you on the “sindon tetradiplon” topic that can easily show the inconsistency of your way of seeing things. Here we go : Since when a Jew (especially a Jew from Jesus time) would want to wipe his face with a burial shroud ??? I think the answer is obvious : THAT MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AT ALL !!!!!! Instead, have you ever consider the possibility that the author may simply want to refer to a long linen towel pretty much of the dimension of a beach towel or a long bath towel (maybe some kind of linen cloth that some Jews were wearing) ??? The fact is this : there’s absolutely NOTHING in the text that can tells us the real dimension of the “tetradiplon”, not even the word “sindon”, which, in the context of the text, surely not refer to a burial shroud ! Now, for the other text you mentionned, I guess you talk about the “Narratio de Imagine Edessena” right ? Read that text again !!!! The author (the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII) have put 2 different versions of the story of Abgar in the same manuscript !!!! If he really intend to physically describe the image (like you seem to think), can you explain why he kept the “classical” version where the story take place during Jesus ministry (no blood traces on the cloth is possible here) ? If he really saw the face that is on the Shroud of Turin, it seem completely illogical to act this way ! And if he really saw the face that is on the Shroud of Turin, why he place the action of the second version of the legend of Abgar during the agony in Gethsemane in not during the crucifixion or after the death of Christ ? I ask this important question because for any Christian, the face that is on the Shroud refers directly to those event (the evidence of the crowning of thorns being the best clue for that) and NOT to the agony in Gethsemane !!!! Come on !!! Be honnest with me here ! Look at the Shroud face and tell me you automatically think about the agony of Christ in Gethsemane and not about is crucifixion and death !!! Tell me this and I will add one more “full of bias” note in my mind ! In my mind, if the image that was seen by Constantine VII in 944 was really the face we see on the Shroud, there’s NO DOUBT at all that he would have locate his story after the crowning of thorns, since the blood stains on the forehead and in the hair on the Shroud refers directly to that very particular injury (that is so easy to notice on the Shroud). And on the so called “physical description” supposedly contained in this legendary text, M. Scavone make a pretty bad direct link with the Shroud ! He talked about “the faint moist image on the face of the Shroud man”. Even if the image seen by Constantine was really faint, how in the world can that be taken as some kind of “proof” that it was the SAME image as the one on the Shroud ? Sorry but I’m not as dumb as you can think ! If the Mandylion image was really a copy made from the Shroud (like I think), don’t you think it would have been natural for the artist to make a faint image of the face of Christ ? I think so ! You see, for every speculative argument you bring forward, I can show you easily one speculative argument of mine that goes directly in the opposite direction ! And you think I’m as dumb to believe you when you talk about FACTS or PROOFS ? Sorry but what you bring to me are just speculative arguments, not facts or proofs. In a legendary text like the “Narratio” that is full of theological reference, how can you be so sure that any description present there is a real authentic physical description of a relic (you consider the “faint” description as a fact !) and not just some kind of litterary creation made by the author ? In reality, you can’t ! This so called “physical description” can well be some kind of an image created by the author and used by him possibly because he was reffering to the sweat of agony of Christ. In fact, this “description” could well be very far from the physical reality of the relic ! There’s no way to be sure because of the Have you ever thought that this second version that we found in the manuscript of Constantine VII (just like the sermon of Gregory Referendarius by the way) could have been more a “theological and spiritual way of teaching” than a real “physical description” ? Read again the “Narratio” and note (like I did) all the theological references that is present in this book !!!! If you’re honnest, you’ll see (like I saw) that it is FULL of theological and spiritual references ! And remember that this manuscript is a legendary kind of text and we cannot consider it on the same level than, let’s say some description of relics that exist (dating from the 11th and 12th century) and that came mostly from pilgrims visiting the Pharos chapel in Constantinople. Without any doubt, those are really eyewitness account. And what those account tells us ? That, during those days, in Constantinople, the was a shroud of Christ (often describe with other linen cloths) AND a smaller linen cloth bearing the image of only the face of Christ (some descriptions mention also the Keramion, which was a tile that was bearing the same exact image of the face). You prefer to build your case on a legendary text like the “Narratio”, and make speculations and extrapolations from this text, instead of considering with more value the many descriptions of relics that exists from the 11th and 12th century and that NEVER make one single direct link between the Mandylion and a burial shroud ? This is your liberty but, since you’re a professional historian (unlike me), I hope you will give me the right to question this choice ! And I could go on and on and on with more examples of specualtions and extrapolations but, for the moment, I will stop here. I will leave you with some FACTS and not with some extrapolations : 1 There’s absolutely NO surviving copy of the Mandylion that show the cloth as any kind of a burial cloth. In fact, the cloth is always a small towel (often much more long than high) showing only the face of a living Jesus without any injuries or blood stains. 2 There’s 8 different ancient manuscripts (one of them, written by St John Damascus, a doctor of the Church, had been written well before the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople) that make a clear distinction between a burial shroud of Christ (or burial cloths of Christ in the plural) and the Mandylion (2 of them make also a distinction with the Keramion). Among those texts, the vast majority have been written by eyewitnesses and have not a legendary style, on the contrary to the vast majority of the so called “evidences” bring on by Wilson. Not making a distinction between a legendary text and an eyewitness account is unworthy of any good historic research and/or conclusion. Sad to say but that’s exactly how Wilson and his followers (M. Scavone being one of them) are acting and it’s pretty pathetic to see… And the most important thing to note about those eyewitness accounts is this : For those eyewitnesses, it was EVIDENT that the Mandylion had absolutely nothing to do with any kind of burial cloth or a relic of the Passion of Christ ! They never make any kind of link in that direction when they talk about the Mandylion !!! Here, I want to quote a crucial part of the Synaxarion. This is an official liturgical book that was used by the Byzantine Church (that was pretty much like the Catholic martyrdom). The particular version I’m about to quote dates from the 11th or 12th century, while the Mandylion was in Constantinople since a long time. This was a time when, according to Wilson and M. Scavone, many people from the Byzantine Clergy should have known that the Mandylion was really a burial Shroud of Christ and not just a face cloth. If this context is correct, then can you explain me why we read this in the introduction of the text where it talks about the legend of Abgar : “In life, you wiped your form onto a linen cloth. In death, you were placed in the final linen shroud. A manmade tile bears your form, not made by human hands, my Christ, creator of all.” Here, you don’t have to use much speculations to understand that the book make a very clear distinction between the Mandylion (image made during Christ’s life), the Shroud of Christ and the Keramion (which was a tile that beared the same image of only the face of Christ than we could have seen on the Mandylion). I would like to see how M. Scavone can do some kind of a magic trick here in order to save the hypothesis of Ian Wilson !!! 3 There’s a bunch of well respected researchers and historians that doesn’t agree one second with Wilson’s hypothesis. On this field, I’m not alone to say the least. Here’s a list of researchers that didn’t agree with Wilson’s point of view : Emmanuel Poulle, Antoine Legrand, Pierre Barbet, Paul Vignon, Paul Riant, Alain Desreumaux, André Grabar, César Barta, Joseph Tixeront, Ernst Von Dobschütz, Steven Runciman, H.J.W. Drijvers, Averil Cameron, Paul Hetherington, Gerhard Wolf, Edward A. Wuenschel et Anthony Green Sr. (the father of Maurus Green). So, anyone can easily see that we are very far from having a concensus on this question ! And I want to point out the fact that many of those researchers are (or were) defenders of the Paris hypothesis, just like me. I’m not alone in this case ! And, in fact, outside the pro Shroud clique, I’ve never seen one single historian that really support Wilson’s hypothesis ! And if I’m wrong here, then just show me some names ! 4 Historically, the most probable period of time that the Mandylion came out in Edessa is the second part of the sixth century (and not 544, like it is so often reported). There’s absolutely no real historic record of his arrival in this city (you can forget the Abgar legend if you seek historical truth since it is evident that the Mandylion was a later addition to the legend). In this particular context, the probability that this cloth was a false relic (directly or inderectly based on the Shroud image) is very good. I will conclude this long reply by saying that I understand why M. Scavone is mad at me because of what I said about him and his article, but I don’t care. I would say the same things again and again because I’m convinced that his judgement on this topic is full of bias in favor of Wilson’s ideas. Here’s a personal message to M. Scavone : When you go on the public place and say bad speculative arguments in order to defend Wilson’s ideas, I just hope you are prepared to receive some critics from the crowd !!!! When someone read your article with some critical sense, sorry but this is as obvious as the nose in anyone’s face that your judgement on this topic is completely biased. I didn’t had the feeling that you were seeking truth in this article, but on the contrary, I had the feeling that you just wanted to defend Wilson’s hypothesis at all cost. In comparison, M. Mark Guscin’s book on the same topic is much more prudent than you regarding the possibility that this image of Edessa could really have been the Shroud… I don’t have a book to sell. I don’t do any conference on the Shroud. I don’t have any “prestige”. In other words, on the contrary to the majority of the well known “shroudies”, I have nothing to lose ! I just seek the truth. And the truth is this : There’s absolutely no ancient text that make a CLEAR AND DIRECT LINK between the Mandylion and a burial Shroud of Christ. Period. And, on the contrary, there’s a bunch of ancient texts that make a clear and direct distinction between a shroud of Christ and the Mandylion and all those text NEVER put the Mandylion among the relics of the Passion of Christ !!! Sorry, but this is the reality. Pretend otherwise is to use bias and making very bad history. Here, I would be mad at me if I forget to talk about one more aspect of M. Scavone’s paper. First, let’s remember that the “Narratio” that we talked earlier was written by Constantine VII. Then in 958, 14 years after the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople, the same Constantine wrote a letter to his troops in which he make an exhaustive list of the relics of the Passion of Christ that were already present in Constantinople. In this list, the emperor mentionned the wood of the cross, the titulus of the cross, the lance, the reed, the blood of Christ, the tunic, the sacred linens (probably the other linen cloth associated with the Shroud of Christ that are present in many list of relics from the 11th and 12th century) and finally, Constantine mention “the shroud that bear God”. And what is absolutely incredible is the fact that, in his analysis of this letter, it seems that M. Scavone want us to believe that the emperor did a real reference to the Mandylion! INCREDIBLE !!!! How in the world can someone see any mention of the Mandylion in that list ???? That’s what I mean when I talk about this article being full of bias in favor of Wilson’s hypothesis ! PRETTY PATHETIC ! In fact, if you analyse this list carefully, it’s pretty much the same list than the one written by Robert de Clari, some 250 years later !!! There’s a very good probability that those relics are the same and what is the most important thing to note is this : whether the letter of Constantine or the list of relics compiled by Robert de Clari, in both cases, the authors have not the slightest hint that the Mandylion could be associated with a relic of the Passion and, in the particular case of de Clari, he made a clear distinction between the Shroud of Christ (that was, in 1203 and 1204, in the Blachernes church) and both the Mandylion and the Keramion (that were conserved in the Pharos chapel). Yannick “I’m not a member of the Shroud clique and I’m glad I’m not” Clément : ) P.S. 1 : I don’t have a master degree in history but I can use my brain and my logical sense nevertheless !!! P.S. 2 : Even if Maurus Green could have been blinded by Wilson (because of his friendship with him), what he wrote about Wilson’s hypothesis in 1969 is still true since Wilson had never been able to show us one real solid FACT (I’m not talking about a poor speculative argument like the tetradiplon here) that can make A CLEAR AND DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE MANDYLION AND A BURIAL SHROUD OF CHRIST. Sorry, I’ve looked everywhere (that include your article) and I never found one single proof (in the real sense of what a proof is supposed to be). As I said, on the contrary, I’ve found plenty of ancient texts that makes precisely the opposite, i.e. A clear separation between the Shroud of Christ and the Mandylion (in fact, no ancient text make even one direct link between the Mandylion and a relic of the Passion of Christ). Here’s the conclusion of Green again : “Until Wilson can PROVE his case, it seems PRUDENT to think of the Edessan Image and the Shroud as TWO DISTINCT THINGS, while noting the close connection between them.” Sorry, but since 1969, Wilson HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVE HIS CASE !!! I SAID PROVE HIS CASE, NOT DEFEND HIS CASE. There’s a BIG difference between the two. And until Wilson can really prove his case, the professional way to see the hypothesis of Wilson is to see the Edessan Image and the Shroud as two distinct things, like Green said..","date":"2012-03-25","mins":"7:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/25/a-response-by-dan-scavone-to-a-commenter-in-this-blog/","cat":"history","title":"A Response by Dan Scavone to a Commenter in this Blog"},{"id":"comment-207966","author":"yannick_clément","post":"But Guscin is a defender of the Mandylion hypothesis and, in his writings, he emphasize more than usual the few mentions that can back up his point of view….","date":"2015-08-11","mins":"7:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa"},{"id":"comment-27354","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I made a little mistake in the end.

It’s most certainly an error of those writers (I’m almost sure that all of them have never saw any of these relics) who simply mixed up both relics with their different features… As it is often said concerning the C14 dating of 88, if you got 99% of the data that point into one direction (in this case, it’s all the references and artworks that indicates the Mandylion was showing only the face of the living Christ without any signs of injury or bloodstains) and 1% that point in the opposite direction (in this case, it’s the very few references written by people who didn’t saw the relics of Constantinople that seems to indicates the Mandylion was showing a full body image of Christ), you simply forget this last tiny group of data and consider only the other huge group. That’s how unbiased science is suppose to work. Guscin seems to do exactly the opposite by focussing on this last tiny group of references instead of the numerous data indicating the Mandylion was only showing a face of Christ without any injury or blood and that this particular relic was NEVER considered as being a relic of the Passion, unlike many Passion relics that were all kept in Constantinople at the same time….","date":"2015-08-10","mins":"12:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa"},{"id":"comment-27350","author":"yannick_clément","post":"For a guy like me who know for a fact (a physico chemical fact to say it best and I’m not even talking about the huge historical evidence) that the Shroud and the Mandylion are two seperate objects, I’m glad to realize that the “Mandylion dogma” is only present in the pro Shroud circle (circus would be a better choice of words).

Before that era, there is no ancient reference that is clear enough for any credible historian to conclude that the Shroud was preserved somewhere, during one particular era… Nevertheless, it’s interesting to note that there are many reference to the presence of a Shroud of Christ (or burial cloths in the plural) in Constantinople from 958 A.D.

Rinaldi in my crusade against any form of supernatural madness concerning the Shroud. There are too many good things to quote in this paper but I just want you to noticed this one : “The Holy Shroud tells the story of the Passion and death of Christ.” Sounds familiar to some of you ? This is exactly what I was crying out loud here on this blog for more than a year now !!!! The Shroud is showing a dead Christ, not a risen one !!!! This is an archaeological remains of his Passion and death (and by implication of faith, of God’s Incarnation in our material world) much more than anything else but unfortunatelly, since the failure of STURP to determined what exactly has caused the image and even more since the C14 medieval result and soon after, the publication of Jackson’s wild hypothesis, I have a feeling that things went out of control in the Shroud world and the supernatural freaks became more and more present at that point, which had a disastrous effect on the general credibility of Shroud science in the eyes of the general public, the media and also the scientific community. Now, everytime the Shroud goes on TV or radio, it seems to me that there’s always some bad supernatural links that are made with this piece of cloth, which drives me nuts. When you read the very intelligent and balanced paper of M. Rinaldi, you don’t have this supernatural crazy feeling that we encountered these days each time the Shroud is mentioned publicly… I think this is a very good sign of what’s going wrong in the Shroud world these days. I also greatly appreciate the quote from doctor Barnes who said that since the image on the Shroud comes from a biological interraction between a tortured and crucified body and the cloth (again, this sounds familiar no?), it is almost impossible to reproduced in a lab all the environmental and biological conditions that prevailed at the time of Jesus burial and so, it will most probably be impossible for anyone now or in the future to fully reproduced the body image on a linen cloth with all the same chemical and physical characteristics than we see on the Shroud of Turin. I AGREE TOTALLY. How can someone be lucky enough to reproduced all those conditions while there is no such tortures these days and there’s almost no precise description of the physical conditions that prevailed when Jesus died and was buried ?.","date":"2012-12-05","mins":"4:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/04/an-early-christmas-present-from-john-klotz/","cat":"history","title":"An Early Christmas Present from John Klotz"},{"id":"comment-20285","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Very good question Hugh! I asked myself the same question. I will give you 2 quotes from Rinaldi’s paper and try to comment them: Quote: “…in the case of the Shroud, every thread is visible, and no trace of solid extraneous matter can be detected, even by microscopic examination.” Comment: I really don’t know what M. Rinaldi is talking about here! I, like most of us I guess, was truly convinced that the first microscopic examination of the Shroud occurred in 1973 with a scientific team of Italians and again (and much more deeply) in 1978 with STURP and another scientific team of Italians. So, if someone has more information about that, please let me know! I know that during the 1933 exhibition in Turin, there was a scientific forum held in the city and Shroud experts like Barbet and Vignon where among the participants, but I really don’t think any scientist had the chance back then to examine the Shroud (or even samples from the Shroud) up close and personal with a microscope! And concerning the conclusion of Father Rinaldi that “no trace of solid extraneous matter can be detected”, this is only partially true. In fact, this statement is correct concerning the fact that no extraneous matter composed the body image but it is incorrect concerning the fact that there was numerous tiny extraneous particles of many products that were found by STURP and Riggi di Numana in the samples they collected from the Shroud, like for example, some tiny paint particles, some aragonite dirt, many pollen grains, etc, etc. Quote: “The threads themselves are stained more or less throughout, so that the same figures, fainter in coloring but otherwise identical, appear on the other side.” Comment: This statement is completely false, except maybe for the possible presence of a very faint image (probably very superficial like the main image) of the hair, beard and mustache of the Shroud man on the reverse side of the cloth and even these possible images are still waiting to be confirmed. I really don’t know who gave this information to Father Rinaldi back then but one thing’s for sure: This information was wrong. And I don’t even know how someone back then could have know if there was or not a body image on the reverse side of the fabric since the Holland cloth was firmly in place and I don’t think no one could have access to even a little portion of the reverse side before Riggi di Numana and the STURP team in 1978..","date":"2012-12-12","mins":"11:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/04/an-early-christmas-present-from-john-klotz/","cat":"history","title":"An Early Christmas Present from John Klotz"},{"id":"comment-19923","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What is important to note is that back in the 1930s, the vast majority of the honest scientists and Clergymen who thought the Shroud was genuine NEVER seriously thought for one second that the image on it could have been caused directly by the Resurrection ! It’s only after the STURP investigation and as I said, after the fiasco of the C14 dating, that all this supernatural crazyness non sense about the Shroud really started ! That’s precisely when Shroud science started to lose any credibility whatsoever in the eyes of the international scientific community and that’s a SHAME. Note that the vast majority of the conclusions of the scientists who studied the Shroud before the Second World War where scientifically CONFIRMED later on by STURP and that strongly suggest that their main idea about the image formation (i.e. That it was caused by a natural interraction between the cloth and the crucified corpse) is mosty probably correct, even though it’s almost impossible to described the right process completely since we don’t have crucifixions no more and we don’t know most of the data concerning the environmental and biological conditions that were present in the tomb and in the Shroud. Note that no coloration substances from another dimension has been found by STURP and all their data certainly don’t go against the idea that the image was formed naturally by a real biological and chemical interraction between the cloth and the body.

But even if this idea is supported by some solid facts and observations, it still need to get fully confirmed. As I often said : the more important thing that Shroud scientists need to fully characterize right now is the image chromophore and this won’t come until the linen cloth itself will be fully characterized, which will need another series of direct researches on the Shroud in the future. And as I often said too : once we’ll be sure that the chromophore is a thin layer of impurities and the linen fibers themselves were not affected by the image formation process, then we’ll have a very strong indication that this body image is the product of a natural process that originated most probably from some biological substances released by the corpse.

This idea is totally acceptable from my point of view of believer and it was very pleasing for me to note that M. Rinaldi expressed the same opinion as mine in the very last paragraph of his awesome paper: “Does the theory of contact exclude the supernatural factor? When we think of the unusual process that has caused the images on the Shroud and consider all the circumstances that were necessary for their production, we cannot but admire the PROVIDENCE of God Who was pleased to leave to the Church and to the world the material document of the Passion and Death of Christ.” And both my opinion and the one expressed by Father Rinaldi are very close to the one you just expressed… So, I think we can agree on that. And also, please let’s not forget the potential sign of the dematerialization or spiritualization of Jesus body that God left to us in the undisturbed aspect of all the bloodstains on the cloth… And finally, I think everyone MUST understand that the simple FACT that such a gruesome grave cloth covered with numerous bloodstains (representing all the stigmata of Christ) has been kept and well preserved as to be seen as the MOST IMPORTANT SIGN (not proof!) of Jesus Resurrection… Now Dave, I ask you the question : don’t you think all that is well enough to comfort your own faith as well as mine ?.","date":"2012-12-06","mins":"4:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/04/an-early-christmas-present-from-john-klotz/","cat":"history","title":"An Early Christmas Present from John Klotz"},{"id":"comment-14388","author":"yannick_clément","post":"It’s crucial to understand that Jackson’s hypothesis concerning the fold marks (because it is just that : nothing less than an hypothesis that never received any credible and independent confirmation) is pretty much like everything that touch the Mandylion hypothesis of Ian Wilson, i.e. A proposition that is totally suggestive and speculative. I want to emphasize the “suggestive” aspect of Jackson’s hypothesis since it was noted by Wilson himself in an article he wrote for the Hong Kong conference on the Shroud in 1986 that ONLY ONE fold SUGGESTED by Jackson are truly easy to distinguish while it’s not the case for the other 7 SUGGESTED foldmarks. Not great to back up the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson since, in all logic, every one of these 8 SUGGESTED foldmarks should be visible with the same degree of intensity (because the Shroud would have been folded that way for many CENTURIES). And as I said previously, there is foldmarks scattered everywhere on this cloth and science has not the possibility to date anyone of them. Finally the bottom line is this : Because such an hypothesis rest mainly on a suggestive and speculative argumentation (the proposal of Jackson to explain his incapacity to identify some supposed foldmarks in the frontal image is PURELY SPECULATIVE and don’t even rest on a real historical fact). In this context, I think anyone with one once of judgement would conclude that such an hypothesis WOULD NOT STAND FOR 2 SECONDS IN A COURT ROOM !!! No doubt at all that Jackson’s case would be crush down easily by any good advocate !!! I’m sorry but when an hypothesis is mainly based on speculative and suggestive arguments, it’s simply impossible to consider it as being truly scientific, because science (whether it is hard science like physics and chemistry or other fields like history) hate speculations !!! True science rest only on facts and, when it’s at his best, it rests on facts that were independently confirmed by other experts in the same field. And for this hypothesis proposed by Jackson a long time ago, it’s not the case at all !!! The reality is this : it is just one person’s opinion based principally on speculations and, not the lest, on the incredible power of suggestion !!! And we know very well how such a powerful tool have been able throughout history to distract people from the real solid facts !!! Personally, I will never follow such a path. Concerning the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson, I prefer by far to trust the FACT that there was no physical and chemical differences (even at the microscopic level) that were found between the region of the face and the rest of the cloth. On this subject, I truly recommend you to read the fact #22 that you can find in my recent paper regarding Wilson’s hypothesis.

In this context, HOW IN THE WORLD LIQUID BLOOD OOZING OUT OF MANY INJURIES (LIKE THE SCOURGE INJURIES FOR EXAMPLE) WOULD NOT CAUSE BIG SMUDGES ON A LINEN CLOTH ??? You’ll need a miracle to explain this to me in rational terms because IT IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE to avoid smudges in this condition, especially FOR THE SCOURGE MARKS LOCATED IN THE BACK, where a big pressure would have been present due to the weight of the body ! If Zugibe’s was right, there would be smudges all over the back portion of the Shroud and most probably some in the frontal part too… This is BASIC LOGIC ! Adler PROVED (with chemical AND spectroscopic tests) that the blood on the Shroud did not come from liquid blood but from exudated blood clots, which is VERY DIFFERENT and can explain very well why there is no smudge on the Shroud and on the contrary, why every bloodstains is very well defined ! In his not so catholic desire to constantly contradict Barbet on everything, Zugibe completely forgot this great BASIC FACT that the bloodstains on the cloth didn’t came from liquid blood ! He also forget one important fact about most bloodstains (a fact I even forget to mention yesterday) : The presence of halos of serum around the bloodstains ! NO WAY you would see this if Zugibe’s hypothesis was correct ! The post mortem liquid blood assumed by Zugibe would have stained the Shroud in this form, well before the apparition of the clot retraction process (that happen between 25 and 50 minutes approx. After the oozing of the liquid blood !!!! No way we can think that they would have washed the body, then wait at least 25 to 30 minutes and only then put the corpse inside the Shroud. It’s evident that the washing would have been IMMEDIATELY followed by the deposit of the corpse inside the Shroud. In this context, there would NOT HAVE BEEN ANY SERUM STAINS AROUND THE WOUNDS !!!! This is probably the most important piece of evidence against Zugibe’s hypothesis and anyone seem to close their eyes on this (or it is simply due to ignorance maybe). Question : Have you noticed that Zugibe, in the paper where he describe his hypothesis, NEVER make one mention concerning the presence of serum stains around the wounds and NEVER make any try to explain them ??? And did you noticed also that in this same paper, Zugibe NEVER show the result he would obtain if a great pressure (like the weight of the body) would be put on a cloth pressed on a liquid oozing from a freshly washed wound ??? What would be the result of this ??? It’s EVIDENT that the outcome of this would be a very ugly smudge on the cloth !!!! Even a children would know the answer !!! And if Zugibe’s hypothesis of the washing was correct, this is exactly what you would obtain : SMUDGES on the cloth with NO SERUM STAINS around the bloodstains !!!

Barbet was very clear about that (with real experiments done to back up his claim) that liquid blood have a strong tendency to FOLLOW THE WEAVE OF THE CLOTH. That’s NOT what we see on the Shroud concerning the bloodstains ! In order to produce bloodstains in the shape we see them on the Shroud, you don’t need liquid blood, you need exudates from blood clots. It’s as simple as that. In both cases, the result is VERY different and on the Shroud, the resulting bloodstains are of the form of exudated blood clots. Also, I think Max that you neglect way too much the evidence coming from the halos of serum around the bloodstains. This result is IMPOSSIBLE if the cloth was stained by post mortem blood that would have been still in a liquid state (like Zugibe’s hypothesis).

Sorry but even if I would like to agree with Zugibe, I can’t because his hypothesis is just INCOHERENT with the presence of serum halos around each scourge marks. Sorry but that’s the REALITY. I’m affraid you will have to make a VERY BIG BAD HUGE AWESOME SPECIAL ASSUMPTION in order to explain the presence of these serum halos in the case Zugibe’s hypothesis would be correct… The presence of these halos of serum just make Zugibe’s hypothesis sound false… And also, you MUST understand that Zugibe’s hypothesis is also totally inconsisten with Adler’s conclusion that the bloodstains on the Shroud were formed by a transfer coming from exudates of blood CLOTS (not liquid blood but blood CLOTS). How can a transfer like that coming from blood CLOTS can be coherent in the context where someone would wash a corpse with a result of removing all the blood CLOTS and producing an oozing of post mortem liquid blood ???? Explain this to me RATIONALLY ! Zugibe’s hypothesis is just inconsistent with Adler conclusion that confirmed Barbet’s hypothesis that he made back in the 1930s ! So, it’s one or the other : Zugibe is off track or Adler Barbet are off track… On that particular question, I choose Zugibe to be off track for a long time now.

Here it is again : “It seems completely ludicrous to think that a very important finding like that (a finding by the way that would have been already announced and described publicly if we interpret the sermon of Gregory Referendarius like Wilson, Dubarle and Scavone have done over the years) would have stayed in the dark afterward and never mentioned again (in detail and much more clearly) in other Byzantine texts written after that sermon ( pronounced publicly the very next day after the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople).” In that context, if Wilson’s hypothesis is correct, how in the world this important description of the Mandylion made by Gregory (i.e. That the Mandylion was in fact a much longer cloth showing the stigmata of the Passion), would not have been reported in other subsequent manuscript that talk about the Mandylion and/or the Abgar legend ??? IT JUST DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL, I’M SORRY. To be convinced of the weakness of Wilson’s purely speculative argument that the Byzantine wanted to preserved the Abgar legend and that’s why the real sepulchral nature of the cloth was hidden to the public, you just have to consider the FACT that the sermon of Gregory Referendarius was pronounced in public (probably in front of all the people living in Constantinople) the very next day of the arrival of the relic (a day of great feast without any doubt). Taking that FACT into account, I ask the question : IS THIS REALLY THE SIGN OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO HIDE A PRECIOUS INFORMATION AND HIDE IT TO THE PUBLIC ??? On the particular subject of the sermon of Gregory, I think Wilson, Dubarle, Scavone et al. Should take good note of the opinion of Mark Guscin. For him (who know, as a linguist, ancient Greek very well), Gregory didn’t make at all a precise and direct physical description of the Mandylion in his sermon, but instead, it was more like a symbolic speech around the image of Christ present on the Mandylion. One thing that have been neglect I think concerning the right interpretation to give to that speech is the fact that it was a RELIGIOUS SERMON !!! No doubt that Guscin’s interpretation is very solid when we place it in the right CONTEXT… And concerning this idea that the knowledge of the real nature of the Mandylion would have been kept hidden (by some officials of the city) for all the time the relic was present in Constantinople in order to “save” the Abgar legend for the pilgrims, it’s very important to understand that it is, again, pure speculation on the part of Wilson and it doesn’t relied on any known ancient text or artistic work… There’s absolutely no clue at all that can be find to backed up this idea of Wilson. Because of that, we can easily understand that this idea came out directly of his imagination (because he needed desperately to find a way to explain why the exact nature of the Mandylion would not have been publicly known for all that time). And with a good imagination, anyone can find a way to escape what really comes up in the Byzantine manuscripts concerning the Mandylion and the Shroud, i.e. That these were 2 distinct relic of Jesus (the first being a relic of the living Christ showing only the face and the other being a sepulchral relic of the Passion and death of Christ). Without using any speculation at all (an impossible task for those who wants to defend Wilson’s hypothesis), that’s exactly what comes up when you read the ancient Byzantine sources on the subject. Just one more FACT to consider : In his account concerning the Mandylion and the Keramion (present in the Pharos Chapel while the Shroud was at the Church of Blachernes), Robert de Clari talk about a completely different version of the Abgar legend than the two versions that were written in the Narratio de Imagine Edessena (the apparition of the miraculous image was now located in Constantinople instead of Edessa !!!). It’s highly probable that this version of the legend was what Robert de Clari was told from the local people of Constantinople (at the time, this was probably the popular form of the story of Abgar and the Mandylion). This simple FACT show that the original Abgar legend has not been preserved very well by the leaders of Constantinople during the time the relic was kept in the city and because of that, this fact doesn’t fit well with Wilson’s speculative idea that the leaders of the city would have desperately wanted to preserved the legend in his original form for the pilgrims… This is just a little clue from an ancient text that seem problematic versus Wilson’s idea of a hidden secret to keep the Abgar legend intact..","date":"2012-08-03","mins":"11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/answers-to-many-questions-about-the-fold-marks-on-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"Answers to Many Questions About the Fold Marks on the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-15316","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Note : The first phrase of my last paragraph refers to the scourge marks located in the region of the back.

In Zugibe’s mind, this is this oozing of liquid blood that would have formed the bloodstains we see on the Shroud for these washed areas. Here’s this important quote of Barbet : “Everyone who got some experience in that matter knows that a bloodstain (liquid) done on a cloth doesn’t stay immutable, even more when the cloth is not sized. On a compress, in a surgery room, we see a drop of blood diffuse rapidly. The stain grows larger while it soaks the cloth, but it happen faster in some directions, following the threads of the cloth. For example, if the weave is simple, like it normally is, we see developing around a central zone more or less round, four little lengthening following the weft and warp weaving, drawing a little red cross. This IRREGULAR AND DIRECTED diffusion (note : Barbet has underlined these words) his even more evident when the thread his absorbent. And we already saw that the linen thread of the Shroud, which is coarsely woven, is an excellent absorbing fabric.” This is how an oozing of liquid (post mortem) blood would react with a linen cloth after a vigorous washing of the wounds (Zugibe’s hypothesis). This is the reality. Now it is up to you to still believe that this can “fit” with what we see on the Shroud concerning the blood and serum stains that are well defined with precise borders !!! Still not convinced ? If you check out the article of Zugibe in which he exposed his hypothesis (http://www.shroud.com/zugibe2.htm), the first photo you’ll see is the result of a blood transfer test he made with a paper towel pressed gently on a oozing of blood coming out of a wound that he just have washed vigorously (with the result of removing the blood clot). It’s pretty easy to see that part of the blood has followed the pattern of the paper towel, producing an irregular and directed kind of bloodstain, just like Barbet said ! Effectively, if you look closely, you’ll noticed that there are some little lengthening that followed the irregular pattern of the paper towel, which have the appearance of little rays of blood that went outside the main bloodstain. The result of this blood transfer is irregular and directed and do not give a bloodstain with a well defined border like we can see on the Shroud. This is perfectly normal because, as Barbet said, when liquid blood touch a cloth, the stain grows larger while it soaks the cloth, but it happen faster in some directions, following the threads of the cloth (or in the present case, the pattern of the paper towel). Zugibe’s test clearly shows that this kind of blood transfer is NOT the kind of blood transfer that happened on the Shroud. And don’t forget one important detail in this test made by Zugibe : He simply pressed the towel very gently on the oozing of blood ! THIS IS NOT AT ALL CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESSURE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SHROUD BY THE BACK PORTION OF THE CORPSE ! No doubt that if Zugibe had applied an important pressure on the towel to simulates the weight of the corpse, the result would have been a very ugly smudge !!! This is not at all what we see on the back of the man of the Shroud ! The scourge marks have borders as perfect as the scourge marks on the front. Only a transfer from exudates of blood clots can produce such a result and this kind of very particular blood transfer is only possible with an unwashed body… Or if we think that they would have washed the body and then avoid to put it in the Shroud right after this operation, wait between 25 to 50 minutes in order for the bloodstain to expulse the serum and only then, put the body inside the Shroud !!! This special assumption is so illogical that the only rational way to explain the bloodstains on the Shroud is to think of a transfer from exudates of blood clots. And in this case, all it is needed to obtain a result like we see on the Shroud is just a bit of moisture or humidity inside the Shroud to re humidify the surface of the clots. And when we think that a dead body can emit water vapor, it’s not hard to know what could have produced this moisture or humidity inside the cloth !.","date":"2012-08-21","mins":"1:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/answers-to-many-questions-about-the-fold-marks-on-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"Answers to Many Questions About the Fold Marks on the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-15349","author":"yannick_clément","post":"He didn’t consult Pierre Barbet and Robert Bucklin… The fact is this Max : Adler’s chemical and spectroscopic results are a scientific CONFIRMATION of Barbet’s hypothesis concerning the blood transfer that was caused by exudates of blood clots.

If you could at least be convinced that his results are good, that would be a good start ! If you do, can you please ask yourself this simple question (while thinking especially about the numerous blood marks of scourging we see on the back of the man of the Shroud) : How in the world these bloodstains (surrounded by serum halos) that come from exudates of blood clots can be consistent with Zugibe’s hypothesis of a partial washing of the body that would produce an oozing of LIQUID (post mortem) blood from the wounds ???

For Barbet’s hypothesis to work right, no need to call for some secret disciples or some partial washing of the body or anything that seem to contradict the idea of a burial done in haste without any preparations prior to the execution, as we see it clearly in the Gospel.

Read this again Max : https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/answers to many questions about the fold marks on the shroud/#comment 15193 The most simple answer that can account for these few off body bloodstains is a manual (and very careful) change of configuration of the Shroud between the time these bloodstains were formed on the cloth by direct contact (probably shortly after the time the body was put in the Shroud while the cloth was tightly compressed on many parts of the body like in this case, the back of the right elbow. This would have most probably happened in the central piece of the tomb where they had a place to prepared the dead and also during the short moving of the body to the stone tablet) and the time the image formation process really started (probably after the body was put in his final resting place on a stone tablet inside the tomb and the compression of the Shroud on the body was removed and the cloth was replace very loosely over the body). That change of configuration would account for the few off body bloodstains and it would also acount for the fact we can see some scourge marks in the back of the knees while there is no body image there. That’s the most rational answer. I admit this look pretty much like Gilbert Lavoie hypothesis but with one major difference : He presume that this change of configuration was done miraculously at the moment of the Resurrection (while the body levitate in the air) while me, I assume that this change of configuration happened really fast during the partial burial and was done manually by the participants in the burial. Of course, I also assume that all the blood transfer were done from exudates of blood clots and not from liquid blood coming from a washing of the body !

And because of that, I made the clever argument that if it is so, then it’s very bad for Wilson’s hypothesis since the other 7 foldmarks SHOULD BE visible as clearly as the one point out by Wilson because the Shroud would have been folded in 8 equal parts during MANY CENTURIES… When we take this simple FACT into account and avoid to do any bad speculations like Jackson did with his proposal of a strange technique of folding and unfolding the cloth during Byzantine ceremonies (a proposal which doesn’t rest on any historical evidence at all, but solely on the imagination of Jackson), the only rational conclusion is that there is NOT 8 foldmarks located at equal distance on the Shroud !!! The other foldmarks, if we believe Wilson analyse, are not as clear as the single one he pointed out and, as Jackson states himself, there’s even a lack of foldmarks in the frontal part of the Shroud. I repeat, all these difference in the intensity of the suggested foldmarks are not coherent with the hypothesis of Wilson. If there was 8 foldmarks of equal intensity that we could easily distinguish on the cloth every 1/8 of the total length of the cloth, that would be a complete different story, BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE. Look at the picture Dan post along with this topic. It come from a BBC documentary made by Rolfe and it is a PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A SUGGESTIVE KIND OF DEMONSTRATION !!! All the cords being place where the foldmarks are supposed to be are just there to make us believe that these foldmarks are really present on the cloth !!! I dare anyone here to state with his hand on the bible that he is able to really distinguish these supposed foldmarks that Jackson have imagined !!!

Here’s WHY : 1 Jackson’s supposed foldmarks CANNOT BE DATED AT ALL !!! And in fact, it’s quite easy to question the supposition that all the foldmarks claimed by Jackson can be dated of the same era, simply because they DON’T SHOW THE VERY SAME INTENSITY !!! THESE DISCREPANCIES IN THE INTENSITY OF THE FOLDMARKS IS A FACT even recognized by Wilson in his 1986 paper !!! In all logic, if these foldmarks were done at the same time, we should expect them to be more or less of the same intensity, but IT’S NOT THE CASE. This FACT seem to indicate that some of them were done at different times in history. 2 Jackson’s hypothesis to explain these particular foldmarks is strickly based on speculations !!! His idea that this occurred during the public showing of the Shroud in 1203 1204 is UNIQUELY BASED ON A PERSONAL AND VERY SPECULATIVE IDEA. The fact is this : There’s absolutely NOTHING in ancient written (or even ancient artworks) to even suggest that the public showing of the Shroud was done the way described by Jackson in his hypothesis. In fact, this is mainly a very questionable interpretation (that we can call “extrapolation”) of the way Robert de Clari described the Shroud he saw in the Blachernes church. Effectively, de Clari simply states that, in this particular church, he was able to see (personal translation from French) : “The Sindon in which our Lord was enveloped and that, every Friday, would get straight up, so that we could easily see the image of Our Lord.” This term “get straight up” can mean many things much more simple than the complex way imagined by Jackson to show the relic to the faithful !!! In fact, it could only mean that the totality of just one part of the Sindon was held straight up in the air by some clergymen in order for the faithful to be able to see the complete image of Jesus (or maybe just the frontal image of the body) easily and distinctly. This proposition of mine is surely the most prudent and rational way to understand the laconic description of Robert de Clari, and I’m 100% sure that the vast majority of the medieval and Byzantine scholars would agree with me on this point. With this personal interpretation made by Jackson of an ancient text, we have, again, a perfect example of bad extrapolation, speculation and special assumption that POLLUTE the historical research concerning the Shroud. From this example alone, it’s easy to see that Wilson is not the only one to have a great imagination “à la Dan Brown” when it’s time to try to back up a personal idea versus the Shroud’s obscure years !!! These are 2 crucial aspects of Jackson’s case and, because his case rest mainly on these 2 speculative proposal, it is OBVIOUS that it would be a loser in a court room !!! If you cannot see this, you must be blind my friend. You should know that the justice system hates speculations and extrapolations and prefer by far to rely on confirmed FACTS !!! Because of that, in the case of Jackson’s hypothesis, the judge would have no other choice than to say : NEXT CASE !!! ; ) And concerning your insistance to not see the reality versus the lack of physical and chemical differences between the region of the face on the Shroud and the rest of the cloth, I just want you to read (for the first time probably) the fact #22 that I have described in my recent paper published on the blog concerning all the problematic facts I’ve found versus the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson. Here’s the link to my paper : https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/clc3a9ment questions about the mandylion hypothesis of wilson 2012 06 28.pdf. This fact #22 as nothing to do with speculation and it is based on hard scientific analyses done in particular by Alan Adler near the end of his life. I suggest you also to listen (for free) this presentation of Adler in which he talked briefly about the spectroscopic analysis he did that show that there was no noticeable difference of chemical content on the surface of the Shroud between the region of the face and the rest of the cloth. If you read my fact #22, you’ll note that this spectroscopic finding made by Adler was confirm by CHEMICAL TESTS. Also, I didn’t mention this with my fact #22 but I’m sure about the fact that there’s also no noticeable differences in STURP technical photographs (UV photos, Quad mosaic, etc.). In fact, I’m pretty sure that the only noticeable difference in chemical make up was found near the corners of the cloth, where the clergymen were often holding the relic during public showings !!! And you can bet your house that if there has been any noticeable difference of physical or chemical content (whether it would be the oxidation of the linen, a more important amount of dirt and/or dust, etc.) in the region of the face, this would have been easily found by the 1973, 1978 and 2002 direct investigations made on the cloth, because this region was probably the one that was the most examined during those 3 sessions. But unfortunatelly for Wilson (and for you), nothing came out of these investigations concerning this aspect of the question. And seriously, do you think for one second that Jackson, who wanted so badly to back up his hypothesis concerning the foldmarks, didn’t look carefully to find such discrepancies between the region of the face (and maybe the region of the torso) and the rest of the cloth ??? It’s evident that he looked at this aspect of the question carefully, but came up empty… If that wouldn’t have been the case, do you seriously think that he wouldn’t have said a thing about such an important discovery ??? That’s the best PROOF that there’s no difference at all between the face and the rest of the cloth, except probably for the regions of the corners (not just the C14 corner)… All this is not great for Wilson’s hypothesis. Finally, concerning the Maillard reaction proposed by Rogers, your comment is completely off track Ron. Sorry to say that but it’s true. Read the recent paper published here on the blog by Thibault Heimburger and you’ll see that : 1 There’s NOTHING in the data from STURP that can discard this hypothesis of Rogers. And 2 On the contrary, there’s many FACTS AND OBSERVATIONS present in the STURP papers that can really seem to back up Rogers idea that a Maillard reaction really occurred on the surface of the cloth ! Of course, that doesn’t mean that body image was formed uniquely by this chemical process, but the data from STURP really seem to indicate that a Maillard reaction can account for at least part of the image. To conclude, here’s just one important FACT about the image on the Shroud that really seem to offer a perfect “match” with the Maillard reaction proposed by Rogers : Al Adler reported that the surface of the image fibers appeared to be “CORRODED”. And guess what ? THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CAN BE EXPECT OF A THIN LAYER OF CARBOHYDRATES IMPURITIES AFTER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO A MAILLARD REACTION !!! This is just ONE example among many.

Also, it should be note that the one who proposed this foldmarks hypothesis (Jackson) is the same who proposed that the Shroud was the tablecloth of the last supper, that there really are some images of blood on the cloth (he’s not talking about bloodstains but about images of blood clots!!!) and that the corpse became like some kind of a “body of UV light” at the moment of the resurrection… All these ideas are enough to prove that he got a marvelous imagination ! So, from my perspective, every hypothesis coming from someone like that should be considered suspicious right from the start. On this topic, here’s an example to make you understand why we should at least be cautious when this person emit a new hypothesis : If someone told you today that he just saw a UFO in the sky, maybe you could say to yourself : Who knows ? Maybe that’s really what he saw. But if this same person come to you the very next day and tell you that he just saw a flying angel in the sky, wouldn’t you be a bit suspicious about all the thing he said to you yesterday and today ??? I think so !!! I also think that once someone is bitten by the “I think I see” syndrome, it’s very hard after that for this person to be cured of it… Don’t get me wrong. I respect infinitely the work he accomplished during the time he was just one member of a huge scientific team (STURP). But since that time, it seem to me that he went on alone (with his wife) and that’s precisely when he start to proposed a bunch of highly suggestive and speculative hypothesis regarding different aspects of the Shroud that are mainly (not completely, but in good portions) based on his personal imagination. Not great science in my opinion and for one, I will never put my trust into ideas like that. Of course, this is just my personal point of view.

Here’s what Rogers had to say about that in his book : “No fiber in a pure image area were cemented together by any foreign material, and there were no liquid meniscus marks. The material that resembled blood stains was quite different. These facts seemed to eliminate any image formation hypothesis that was based solely on the flow of a liquid into the cloth. This also suggests that, if a body was involved in image formation, it was dry at the time the color formed.” And this idea is totally consistent with the Gospels who report that Joseph of Arimathea had to go to Pilatus in order to ask the permission to take the body. It’s evident that it took more than 2 minutes to make this kind of demand, which is most probably long enough for the sweat (and most of the blood flows on the skin) to dry completely while the body was still on the cross… And for the evidence concerning the lack of sweat on the body, it is quite confirmed by the experiment results obtained by Samuel Pellicori of STURP that proved that sweat on the cloth would have caused stains very similar in color to the actual body image. So, if there would have been sweat on the body, it is obvious that this biological substance would have taken part in the image formation and would have caused a final image that would have been much more distorted laterally. Effectively, there would have been imprints in each area of the cloth that would have been in direct contact with the body, even if this direct contact would not have last long. Behind the knees is the best example of that because we know for a fact that there was, for a short time, a direct contact there between the body and the cloth (the few scourge marks are the proof of that) while there is no body image at all in this region. If there would have been sweat on the body behind the knees, no doubt that the direct contact that happened there would have been enough to produce the formation of an image in that region. But in reality, it’s not the case on the Shroud… Concerning the FACT that the body wasn’t washed, this come from the conclusion of Adler that confirmed (with chemical and spectroscopic analyses) the hypothesis described by Barbet in the 1930s, i.e. That the vast majority of the bloodstains came from exudated blood clots that were humid enough on their surface to leave a mirror image on the cloth. The simple fact that most of them are surrounded by a halo of serum visible on the UV photos taken by STURP is enough to understand that these stains didn’t came from complete blood that would have been in a liquid state at the moment of the blood transfer (like it would have been the case in Zugibe’s hypothesis). I know that at first sight, this idea of humid blood clots can seem to be in contradiction with the fact that the body was most probably dry at the time he was put in the Shroud, but that’s only in appearance. Barbet had a pretty rational (and medical) solution for this apparent contradiction. While it is a proven fact that a fresh corpse can emit water vapors (and possibly some ammoniac too), once the corpse was put in the Shroud, these vapors were probably able to humidify again the surface of the blood clots on the skin. In the case of most injuries (especially the scourge marks), it is also possible that the blood clots that were present in their vicinity never became completely dried even a long time after death because, as Barbet’s said, it is truly possible that these injuries were infected, producing an oozing of lymph. All this to say that the very particular kind of bloodstains on the Shroud (proven by Adler to have come from exudated blood clots) is well enough to understand that the body was NEVER WASHED before being put in the Shroud. Liquid blood coming from a corpse that would stained a linen cloth like the Shroud (this is exactly what would have happened if Zugibe’s hypothesis was correct) would NEVER produced the same kind of bloodstains (with very well defined borders) that we see, especially for the back part of the body where a big pressure was present ! In this case, there would have been a lot of smudge of blood where the back would have been in direct contact with the cloth. I still have a very hard time to convince myself that, along Barbet, Bucklin, Adler, Lavoie and others, I can make this deduction very easily (even if I’m no medical expert) while at the same time, it appears that Zugibe cannot !!! Incredible… Let’s never forget that proposition of Zugibe for the washing of a corpse covered with dried blood clots always produce a oozing of LIQUID post mortem blood. Sorry but the bloodstains on the Shroud are not the result of liquid blood but come from exudated blood clots, which is a totally different kind of blood transfer that give a very different result ! For example, liquid blood staining a linen cloth will NOT produced a halo of serum around the bloodstains like we see on the Shroud but exudated blood clots that would transfer their image on the cloth, YES !!! It’s too bad Zugibe’s hypothesis received so much press (in America mostly) because even if is idea is truly off track regarding the reality of the Shroud, many persons still believe this, even today… I think people in America would greatly gain to read Pierre Barbet’s book A Doctor at Calvary. And concerning the few bloodstains that we can see off the body image, it’s evident that it proves that there was, at some point, a very close contact between many parts of the body and the Shroud. This is totally correct. BUT… This close contact could well have come when the enshrouded corpse was move away from the central place in the tomb (where the body was first put in the Shroud) and placed in his funeral stone tablet. If my idea is true, this close contact would have been produce, not by linen strips tight around the body, but instead from manual compression during the short moving of the corpse inside the tomb. Then, after the body was resting on the stone tablet, the Shroud could well have been replaced more loosely (while removing most of the crease in the cloth) over the corpse and only after that, the body image formation took place. Note that this final loose configuration would be in total agreement with the study of Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline from STURP and also with Mario Latendresse own study. Also, this change of configuration from a manually compressed configuration to a new loose configuration of the Shroud would explain very well the fact that there are some bloodstains outside the body image (like we see outside the right elbow and outside the right foot). It would also explain very well the fact that there are some blood flows in the hair located each side of the face while in reality, these blood flows were located in the temple and the cheeks (see Gilbert Lavoie and Al Adler experimental result with a replica of the Shroud for more details about that). Finally, it would also explain very well the fact that there are some scourge marks behind the knees, while there is absolutely NO body image in this region. Final note : some can think that since there is no sign in the bloodstains of any separation between the body and the cloth, this hypothesis of mine is surely off track. I would answer this by saying that this would be true if the change of configuration would have come later while the bloodstains on the Shroud would have had enough time to dry. But that’s not the case. In my scenario, the change of configuration (and the separation of some parts of the cloth from the body) would have happened pretty soon after the first deposit of body inside the cloth, leaving not enough time for the bloodstains to dry completely. In this condition, we can expect that a separation of the cloth from the body would not have left any visible signs of separation and would not have broken any fibrils under the bloodstains… One last thing concerning the fact that the burial was done in haste : You seem to forget one important thing Ron ! Effectively, it’s not enough for the participant of the burial on Friday to have finish the job for the beginning of the Sabbath at sundown (approx 7:15 7:20pm as you said), they must have finish it for some time before that in order to be able to get back at their home before sundown ! You have to remember that the tomb was located OUTSIDE the city walls !!! There’s absolutely no doubt that they should have finish their job WELL BEFORE sundown in order to be able to reach their house before that “fatidic” time !!! In this context, most scholars will tell you that there was not any time to lose and, because of that, the burial COULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED ON FRIDAY !!! And remember this crucial fact that I tell the other day : this burial WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL !!! It was something nobody could have expected and during the execution of Jesus, nobody even knew if Pilatus would agree to give back the body to the family, which was a very rare favor for a criminal… So now, I hope you’ll be open minded enough to consider seriously all that I said here, and that you could leave your preconceived ideas on the side for a minute… If you do this, you’ll probably conclude that there are some chances that I can be correct about these things. All these ideas that I’ve exposed here come from a very long reflection of mine.

He said : “The most significant aspect of banding is realizing that the man whose image appears on the shroud may not have looked like we think he does.” I would say this : It is true that the banding effect could have produce an image that is a bit different from what Jesus really looked like at the moment of his death. But it is also most probably true that the image on the Shroud is somewhat different (to what extend I don’t know) from the real aspect of the Resurrected Jesus, simply because the Gospels tell us that even his closest friends had difficulties to recongnized him !!! So, if you think the Risen Christ looked like the image on the Shroud, I’m sorry but I disagree with you ! This image is the one of the dead Christ, and not the image of the Risen one !!!! Again, how much different ? It’s just impossible to respond. But if we believe the testimony of the Gospel writers, we have to agree that the image that is on the Shroud don’t look exactly like the Risen Christ that was seen by the disciples… I think most people forget this interesting aspect of the question regarding the Shroud of Turin.

I say this because the evidence coming from these stains are the most compelling thing in favor of authenticity. Of course, as I said in my previous paper about this piece of evidence (http://www.holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/yannick clment shroud of turin the evidence of the bloodstains.pdf), it is still possible to imagine a scenario in which the Shroud would be the burial cloth of another anonymous crucified man (which would have eventually been wrongly considered as the real burial cloth of Jesus) or a scenario involving what I called “a natural forgery” involving a real crucified body looking like Christ of the Gospels, but frankly, in face of all the known data available (the physical and chemical data being much more important in my mind than anything coming from ancient artistic and litterary sources), it is much easier to consider this cloth just as what it was reported to be, i.e. The authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. Even if I’m a believer in the Resurrected Christ myself, you can be sure of one thing: if the evidences would have convinced me that this cloth is most probably not the authentic shroud of Jesus, I would not be here today writing this message to you… By the way, here’s a news for you and anyone else: in an upcoming paper (I wish I could publish it online before the end of the year or early next year), you’ll see me doing a long analysis of the first scenario I described in my paper about the bloodstains evidence (i.e. The one involving an accidental resemblance with Jesus, which involves the burial cloth of an anonymous person)… While doing this analysis, it didn’t took me too long to realize that such a scenario is highly unlikely in face of all the data we know. And I think the same for the “natural forgery” scenario. That leaves me with the hypothesis of the authentic burial cloth of Jesus and nothing else… Of course, it’s impossible to be absolute about that, but in my mind, I truly think the probability of such a thing must be estimated very high (let’s use the same probability as the C14 labs in 88: at least 95% confidence)..","date":"2014-10-29","mins":"3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/29/barrie-schwortz-dismisses-freemans-claims-it-was-the-science/","cat":"history","title":"Barrie Schwortz Dismisses Freeman’s Claims: It was the Science"},{"id":"comment-7892","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The images on those coins are really close to the Christ Pantocrator icon that appeared a century before them.

But, at the same time, when you take into account those coins, plus the image of Edessa (Mandylion) and the Pantocrator icons (and we can also add some frescos from the Roman catacombs, dating from the 4th century), it make a pretty strong evidence that the Shroud of Turin was already there at that time.

An artist doesn’t need to be confuse as you say in order to create a garment worn by Jesus… And this idea of Wilson that the Shroud was folded in 8 come from an extrapolation of the ambiguous term “tetradiplon” found ONLY in the manuscript “The acts of Thaddaeus”. This is the first ever book to add the Mandylion in the Abgar Legend. Most historians agree that we cannot find no solid historical base in this legend in order to learn something about the real history of the Mandylion. In fact, this cloth really seem to have “appeared” in Edessa during the second half of the 6th century and no official record was produce about this event. It really look like the relic just appeared there… And after the Acts of Thaddaeus, NO other manuscript that tells the story of the Abgar legend use this bizarre term (that seem to have been create for this particular story). If the author knew the cloth was folded in 8, why he didn’t used another term more clear to say that ? It really look like a “litterary” creation on the part of this particular author that probably tells nothing about the real dimensions of the cloth. In fact, in this particular story, Jesus wipe ONLY his face and the author never said one word about the real dimension of the cloth ! HOW CAN SOMEONE THINK THE AUTHOR OF THE TEXT CAN REFER, IN THAT CONTEXT, OF A BURIAL SHROUD THAT IS MORE THAN 4 METERS LONG !!! It need a very big extrapolation in order to do so and really, it’s completely ludicrous… And people buy that crap from Wilson simply because they never investigate the subject deeply ! For instence, who knew what I just said about the FACT that this term “tetradiplon” was never used again after the writting of the Acts of Thaddaeus ? If this term was so important to describe the cloth, don’t you think other writers would have use it ??? On the contrary, the vast majority of those writers (many of which were eye witnesses unlike the author of the Acts of Thaddaeus, which is a purely legendary book) always used terms like a towel in order to show that the cloth had small dimensions… But people don’t want to see that and prefer to believe the extrapolations and speculations of Wilson and Al. It’s very sad to see that. In fact, the more I was searching into the ancient sources, and the more I realised how much bias there was in this theory of Wilson. It’s incredible. I cannot say all I want to say about that because I would need 50 pages. I will just finish with this : If you got an open mind, trust me, this theory of Wilson (which is no more than a weak hypothesis when you submit it to every ancient source we have) is completely OFF TRACK !

If I do, it’s pretty much like mine. What I think is this : The Shroud was probably kept in Jerusalem for a long time, up until maybe the beginning of the 6th century when it could have been taken to Constantinople while the Palestine had to face 2 successive threats : by the Persians (actual Irak) and just after that, by the Arabs (from Saudi Arabia). It is a FACT that 3 major relics of the Passion of Christ were taken to Constantinople in 629, between the 2 threads : The cross, the lance and the sponge. The ancient sources don’t say a word about the Shroud of Christ but we can think (this is just a supposition based on the historical context) that it could well have followed the same road than those 3 relics around the same time… What I think is that the Shroud was silently taken to Constantinople during this time of war threads just to protect it and that it stayed there until the sack of the city by the crusaders in 1204. Why no record exist of a complete body image on the burial Shroud of Christ during all those centuries is THE mystery historian have to face and there’s no satisfying answer for the moment. The most logical hypothesis is that it was almost always kept into a reliquary and almost nobody knew that there was an image on it. But this hypothesis is somewhat contradict by those art depictions (Image of Edessa, Pantocrator, Coins, Frescos in catacombs, etc.) that look a lot like the Shroud… My personal idea is that there was one artist who saw it during the 4th century of before and made a portrait of it. This unknown portrait was then the fundamental base of all the depictions of Christ from the 6th century and on, while the actual Shroud was kept inside his reliquary. This is just my 2 cents… The mystery is huge regarding the fact that there is NO mention of a Shroud of Christ with a body image on it until the testimony of Robert de Clari in 1204 in Constantinople. VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN. At least, I gave you one explanation that can be seen as possible, even if it’s not evident at first sight : How in the World some artists would have make a depiction of Christ using the Shroud as the main base while no ancient writer would say nothing about this very particular image that was resting on an important relic of the Passion of Christ ? This is a real mystery to me, because I really believe the Shroud is authentic !

Just one single evidence of that (among many) is that there is numerous lists of relics (going from 726 or 730 to 1204) that mention both the Shroud of Christ AND the Mandylion together in the same list ! Now, unless I’m a total fool, this is a proof that those 2 relics are not the same ! You can twist it all you want (and Wilson did that a lot in order to wrote a theory like that… A lot of speculations, extrapolations and so on), but the bottomline is this : THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION IN ANCIENT TEXTS THAT A SHROUD OF CHRIST WAS EVER PRESENT IN EDESSA (unlike Jerusalem, Constantinople and Athena) AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION IN ANCIENT TEXTS THAT MAKE A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN THE MANDYLION AND A BURIAL CLOTH. And remember that ALL the artistic depictions of the Mandylion show the image without any blood stains (and some of those depictions were done in the 12th century by artists most probably looking at the Mandylion). I say all this because I’m disgusted to see how many people have bought this Wilson theory in the Shroud World while the vast majority of the historians outside the Shroud World know full well it is off track regarding all the ancien documentary and artistic sources we possess today… I know many people want desperately to believe that the Shroud have a clear and simple ancient history but the reality is this : Beside the testimony of Robert de Clari in 1204 and the artistic depiction we found in the Pray Codex (dating from 1192 to 1195), there is no clear proofs that the Shroud of Turin was really present anywhere. But, as I say, there is at least good evidences (not proofs) that the Shroud was present at least from the 4th century on.

I think what can explain the FACT that there is no report at all in ancient texts about the presence of a body image on the cloth is because this relic was almost constently preserved in his reliquary and was never showed publicly. This is the only logical explanation I can see for the lack of testimonies until 1203 when Robert de Clari report he had seen a Shroud of Christ with a complete body image on it. And I have this to say to you : If you don’t consider a fact a bunch of lists of relics (not just one or two) stating clearly that there was a Shroud AND a Mandylion in Constantinople a fact, I don’t know what to think. And your idea that the Mandylion that was showed in Constantinople was just a copy is contradict by the testimony of John of Damascus who wrote in 726 or 730 an important document in which we found a clear mention of the Mandylion (with a link with the Abgar legend) AND, elsewhere in the SAME document, a clear mention of the Shroud of Christ, along with many other relics of the Passion of Christ that were all found later in lists of relics from Constantinople !!! I remember you that Wilson hypothesis that they made a copy of the Mandylion says that it was only done AFTER the cloth arrived in Constantinople in 944, while some person, supposetely, would had noticed that it was a burial Shroud (a great fact that would have stayed in the shadows and never recorded in a text !!!), then the copy of the Mandylion would have been made in order to preserve the Abgar legend. That’s the speculation of Wilson and his followers. Sorry but this text of Damascus was written 2 centuries prior to the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople !!!! And let me remind you that this guy was no fool ! He his consider one of the doctor of the Church and he’s a Saint. Not the kind of guy from a street corner that can say anything. We can trust what he said. And what he said is this : During his time, he was aware that there was a so called miraculous image in Edessa (linked to the Abgar legend) AND, at the same time, he was aware that the Christians were venerated many relics of the Passion of Christ, among them was a Shroud of Christ along with strips of linen, and that those relics of the Passion had NOTHING to do with the Mandylion ! The only bizarre thing about that his the fact that Damascus don’t seem to be aware of the presence of a full body image on this Shroud of Christ, just like the totality of the ancient writers prior to Robert de Clari… Again, the only logical explanation that can fit with all the ancient sources we have is that this Shroud of Christ was constently preserved in a closed casket and was never showed to the public (maybe because the keepers of the relic were aware of the real nature of the relic and knew that showing an image of Jesus dead with a lot of injuries and blood stains would have been considered sacrilegeous at the time). And the fact that Damascus list of relics is almost the same as many lists of relics from Constantinople (like the list of Robert de Clari and even the list of relics contain in the document made when saint Louis bought 22 relics from the emperor of Constantinople in 1247). This good match up is a good evidence that the Shroud we found in Damascus list is probably the same we found later in Constantinople’s lists of relics and the same that was seen by Robert de Clari in 1203, just prior to the sack of Constantinople. And, when we take the Pray Codex artwork into account, we then have a good probability that the Shroud from Damascus list (writen in 726 or 730) was really the Shroud of Turin ! It is a probability of course, and not a certainty. And the bottomline is this : For Damascus, this Shroud was completely different and completely unrelated with the Mandylion of the Abgar legend !!!!

I think the Shroud inspired (maybe directly, probably not directly) the creation of the Image of Edessa (also known as the Mandylion, an artwork most probably). And then, because this Image of Edessa was considered by the faithful as “an image not made by human hands”, his popularity was growing and growing… And during the iconoclast period (726 to 843), also known as the “quarrel over images”, the Image of Edessa became even more popular amongst those defending the right to venerate the sacred images (like Saint John of Damascus for example who used the Image of Edessa as a “proof” that God permit the veneration of sacred images because his Son even create himself an image on a cloth). So, because people really thought that this Image was a true miraculous image from Christ, I really feel that it got enough prestige to impose a very popular style among all the depictions of Christ made in the Middle East first, and then, among all the depictions of Christ everywhere. I have a feeling that this “consolidation” in the depictions of Christ, that start during the second half of the 6th century (the same time that the Image of Edessa appeared suddenly in that city and the first Pantocrator was created) was mainly caused by the high prestige of the Image of Edessa, that was considered a miraculous image made by Christ himself (a false relic that was inspired, in my opinion, directly or indirectly, by the image of the Shroud of Turin). We also have to take into account the very big popularity of the Pantocrator icons that surely helped the consolidation of the style. For those icons, again, I also think the face of Christ was inspired, directly or indirectly, by the image of the Shroud of Turin. So, I really think that the Shroud is responsible for this “consolidation” of the depictions of Christ from the second half of the 6th century and on, but I have a feeling it was only indirectly, from a sketch made directly from the Shroud or from a very precise oral description of the image of the Shroud made by an eye witness… One thing’s for sure : In order to “impose” a main style that was preserved until this day, it must have taken something really important to do so ! And what I can see that his the most likely answer is the growing prestige of the Image of Edessa, the so called “image not made by human hands”… So, this “consolidation” in the style of the depictions of Christ came from the Shroud image, but only indirectly, via the Image of Edessa and, probably also, via the Christ Pantocrator icons. That’s what my exhaustive research on the subject and my long reflection led me. Now, you’re free to think something else, of course… But, when you consider all the ancient sources, I don’t think my hypothesis is really more foolish than the one of Wilson !!!.","date":"2012-02-04","mins":"12:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/03/ben-wiechs-video-about-the-justinian-coin-from-ad-692/","cat":"history","title":"Ben Wiech’s video about the Justinian coin from AD 692"},{"id":"comment-7899","author":"yannick_clément","post":"THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF AT ALL IN THE ANCIENT TEXTS THAT THE SHROUD EVER SPEND ONE SINGLE DAY IN EDESSA.

But you’re not dumb. The only advice I can give you at the moment is this : Please meditate on that : from 726 or 730 until 1204, there is a bunch (over 10) testimonies (most of which from eye witnesses) that specified that the Shroud of Christ and the Mandylion were 2 separate relics. I’m sorry but THIS IS NO SPECULATION ! And if you could see all the evidence and data that come from all the ancient source and then, you would used the Occam rasor principle to judge the likelihood of the different hypothesis versus the Mandylion, you would be forced (like I was) to conclude that the Mandylion was really just what the vast majority of the ancient writers and artists report it to be : A small cloth that show ONLY the face of Christ and didn’t show any blood stains or injuries. That’s all I can say to you… I’m sorry you’re not more willing to open your mind to this probability because the fact that the Mandylion hypothesis is very improbable don’t mean that the Shroud of Turin don’t have a real history before 1350 !

Period. Again, I don’t make anything up, I don’t make any speculation, I simply made an extensive research in all the known sources reported in many historic books (most of them very recent, like the one by Guscin called “The Image of Edessa”) and just followed the trail made by the FACTS. It led me to conclude this hypothesis of Wilson is off track. Honnestly, if you take all the evidences and observations regarding the Shroud and the Mandylion and you put them all into a scale, 99% of those will fall in the direction that says the Mandylion was just the cloth that was generally reported to be : a small cloth (often called a towel) that show only the face of Christ without any injuries or blood stains and that was never directly linked with a burial cloth. On the contrary, there is absolutely no written source that said the Shroud of Christ was related (directly or indirectly) with the Abgar legend or with the image of Edessa. THOSE ARE SOLID AND CREDIBLE EVIDENCES FROM ANCIENT SOURCES, NOT SPECULATIONS OR EXTRAPOLATIONS LIKE IMAGINING THE WORD “TETRADIPLON” MEAN A BURIAL SHROUD OF OVER 4 METERS LONG !!! Sorry but any cloth can be folded in 8 ! Any cloth. And the writters was not describing the relic in his reliquary when he mention that !!! This term is only found in one single version of the Abgar legend and nowhere else… And it is found IN A LEGENDARY kind of book and NOT in a desciptive kind of book like a list of relic for example. People tend to forget that… There’s absolutely no way to be sure that this author had even seen the relic ! The fact is that in this ambiguous term, nobody can make a link with a burial shroud at all ! The context of the story completely prevent someone honest to do so… The time of the miracle is during Jesus ministry ! How in the world someone could have give him a burial shroud in order that he could wipe his face after he had washed it ???? IT’S LUDICROUS COMPLETELY !!! The author could have in mind a long towel like a beach towel for all we know !!! By the way, try this at home folks : if you take a beach towel or a long bath towel and you folded in 8, what do you get ? Right ! A cloth that has almost precisely the correct dimension of a normal adult face !!! Meditate on that… The link between the term “tetradiplon” and the Shroud of Turin is a great example of the high speculations and extrapolations made by Wilson in order to confort is own little hypothesis… And that has worked pretty fine for him since he sold A BUNCH of different books on this subject.

As I know, Wilson hypothesis and ideas never were submitted to a bunch of his peers (and more than his peers because is more of a journalist than an historian) so that they could say what they think of this… And no matter his hypothesis was disregard by the vast majority of the credible historians outside the Shroud World, people don’t seem to care one bit about that fact and continue to follow him with his weak hypothesis… I don’t understand why it is like that regarding historical hypothesis versus hard science hypothesis like the one of Rogers or the one of Fanti or Di Lazzarro and Al. !!!

If my feeling is correct, then maybe this was imagined by the anonymous author of this legendary story in order to create an aura of mystery around this cloth by using a brand new term to describe it ??? I don’t see why historian would have to automatically buy the idea that the cloth was really once folded many times just because we found this very odd expression in one particular ancient manuscript. Note that this term was never use again in the context of the Abgar legend until the Narratio de Imagine Edessena was written shortly after the arrival of the Image in Constantinople in 944 and this is not surprising since it is a fact that the author (or authors) of the Narratio have used the Acts of Thaddeus as one of their sources to wrote the story of Abgar and the miraculous Image of Edessa.

This is another very good example of pure speculation ! Taking a legendary account like that for a real and pure physical description of the Mandylion is purely speculative… And let’s assume for a second that your idea (that was really push forward by Mark Guscin in recent years by the way) is correct.

I bet 99% of them would answer : the crown of thorns of course !!! If your idea was true, you can bet your house that the writer would have place his scenario during the way of the cross, during the crucifixion or, even more likely, after the death of Christ, simply because the Shroud (no matter if you look just at the face region or at the whole cloth) has an evident “sepulchral” feature attach to it that any average Christian believer can see… So, here’s an advice : Forget the hypothesis you just develop about this version of the Abgar legend, it just don’t pass the Occam razor test… This reference to the agony of Christ in Gethsemane is most probably due to a will of the author to deliever a theological or spiritual message (there is many theological reference in that particular manuscript), much more than to really describe physically the image of Edessa (don’t forget that this book is a legendary kind of book and not an eye witness account like a list of relics)..","date":"2012-02-05","mins":"12:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/04/calling-all-history-buffs-interesting-comments-from-yannick-clment/","cat":"history","title":"Calling all history buffs: Interesting comments from Yannick Clément"},{"id":"comment-17382","author":"yannick_clément","post":"M.

Hard to say, but at first sight, this look plausible because in many copies of the Image of Edessa (like the Holy face of Laon for example), we can clearly distinguish a wooden board on which the cloth seem to be nailed, just like it is said in the Narratio. And if this is an historical fact, then I seriously doubt that this cloth was ever folded during the time it was kept in Edessa and in Constantinople (and maybe even when it was probably kept in France!).

That’s exactly the unique goal I seek by constantly remind pro Shroud people of the weakness of Wilson’s hypothesis !!! I just want to open their eyes to the possibility that, maybe, there could be another more rational and solid explanation for the Shroud’s obscure years (i.e. Before 1357 in Lirey, France). I have a sense that most pro Shroud people who speak English have only learn one possibility about this dark age of the Shroud and that’s Wilson’s hypothesis, which, in itself, is a great shame !!! But I don’t blame them, I blame more the known Shroudies (many researchers are among that group) who have constantly push Wilson’s case in the Shroud world over the years with a complete blind mind and without any critical sense !!! I also have a great sense that most pro Shroud people who believe in Wilson’s hypothesis think (falsely) that if Wilson’s case should be proven wrong, that would mean the Shroud is probably not the genuine Shroud of Jesus !!!! THAT’S WRONG MY FRIENDS !!!! TOTALLY WRONG !!! As I often say : read again the very interesting hypothesis of Paul Vignon !!! You can read a good summary of this in the great paper published in 1969 by Maurus Green (http://www.monlib.org.uk/papers/aj/aj1969green.htm). Vignon, just like me, believed the Shroud was genuine but at the same time, he NEVER thought for 2 seconds that the Mandylion could have been the same relic ! His hypothesis, if it is correct, push the dating of the Shroud to at least the 6th century (and most probably even the 5th). As I said recently, that’s a very good start don’t you think ??? I hope people who read my numerous comments about Wilson’s hypothesis and who have read (or who will read) the paper I published here will start to OPEN THEIR MIND on the possibility that Wilson could be wrong about the Shroud Mandylion connexion (even if it’s truly possible that a real connexion existed indeed) and start a reflection (and why not a research) on the subject to see if there could not be another possible avenue to explain the dead silence that seem to exist in ancient historical sources about a Shroud of Christ that would bears a body image along with bloodstains… That’s what I do personally and I still seek the truth ! But one thing’s for sure : I’m 100% convinced now that this truth is not to be found in Wilson’s hypothesis or any other historical hypothesis he has brought forward over the years (like the very weak but still very good selling idea of a possible connexion with the Knights Templars)….","date":"2012-09-02","mins":"5:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/02/charles-freeman-the-manifold-problems-with-wilsons-hypotheses/","cat":"history","title":"Charles Freeman:  the manifold problems with Wilson’s hypotheses"},{"id":"comment-17383","author":"yannick_clément","post":"By the way, here’s another question for you : Can you give me the exact quote of Leo the Deacon concerning the Image of Edessa ?

Now, it’s up to you to decide if you want to follow the data that are included in the enormous slice of 99% in the direction they point to (i.e. That the Mandylion was NOT the Shroud but a relic of the living Christ showing just his face) or if you prefer to only consider seriously the thin slice of 1% as the real truth while finding imaginative ways (resting mainly on speculations, extrapolations and special assumptions) to explain how and why the giant slice of 99% is not really pointing in the direction it seem to point !!! Here, I want to remind all of you that the Occam’s razor principle (a principle largely accepted in science) can be summarized like this : The hypothesis that includes the smallest number of special assumptions has the highest probability of being closest to the truth. Having said that, I think anyone who would used the Occam’s razor principle here WITH HONESTY WHILE LEAVING OUT HIS BIAS AT THE DOOR would have no other choice than to conclude that the MOST PROBABLE ANSWER should be the one that come from this big slice of 99%, i.e. That the Mandylion was NOT the Shroud but a relic of the living Christ showing just his face. In fact, if we use the Occam’s razor properly to analyze the data coming from both the Shroud and the Mandylion, we have to conclude that these 2 relics are most probably what they’re reported to be, i.e. The authentic burial Shroud of Jesus of Nazareth and a small towel showing just the face of the living Christ (probably painted). Here, it would be great if the fans of Wilson could at least recognize this simple truth : In order to work, Wilson’s hypothesis need a wild bunch a special assumptions linked with speculative and extrapolative arguments. When you know well most of the data coming from historical and artistic sources regarding the Mandylion and the Shroud, this truth is OBVIOUS. And if we recognize the validity of the Occam’s razor principle, we have no other choice than to consider the hypothesis of Wilson as HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC AND UNLIKELY (to say the least) for the simple and good reason that it rest (not uniquely but in good part) on a lot of special assumptions, which is totally contradictory with this great logical principle of analysis… You don’t like the Occam’s razor principle ? No problem ! Why not used what I call “the court room” test ? This is another very simple and very clever way to analyze the validity of a hypothesis. To do that, you just have to take all the parts of one hypothesis and imagine that you are an advocate facing a judge and you have to convince him that this particular hypothesis is good beyond any reasonable doubt. The burden of the proof is on your shoulder. In the case of the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson, remembering the gigantic pie of data I mention earlier with a slice of 99% of data pointing in the opposite direction, do you seriously believe that your case would stand for a long time in front of this judge and against all the questions of the Byzantine scholars opposing party ? If you’re really honest, in front of all the known historical and artistic data relevant to the subject (my big pie), you have no choice than to conclude that Wilson’s case is a loser that, in the present state of our knowledge (I don’t predict future) cannot be convincing enough to someone neutral like a judge in a court room. On the contrary, if you do the same test with the hypothesis stating that the Mandylion was really what it is reported to be, i.e. A small towel showing just the face of the living Christ, I really believe you got a winner case in your hands that can convinced anyone who is neutral beyond any reasonable doubt. So, it’s up to you my friends… Do you really want to act and think like real scholars or do you prefer to act and think like Pro Shroudies that are full of bias (and in doing so : unworthy of the real and authentic scientific spirit) ??? If you choose the second path, be sure that the vast majority of the Byzantine scholars (who know the subject even better than me and who are mostly neutral versus the question of the authenticity of the Shroud) will laugh at you. In fact, by acting like this, you will just contribute to diminish even more the credibility of sindonology in the eyes of the major part of the international scientific community (just like if its credibility was not at an all time low presently !!!). If you really choose this path, I want to say : Bravo ! Keep on ! In a near future, the credibility of sindonology will be completely gone. And for all of you who think Wilson is a genius and the main Prophet of Sindonology, I hope you understand that what I just described (i.e. The all time low level of credibility of today’s Sindonology in the eyes of a very good portion of scientific community) is due in good part to his great “contribution” to the World of the Shroud… Great legacy ! My dream is that one day, History will put his books in the same category than those of Dan Brown and Thomas de Wesselow. Note that what enrage me the most versus Wilson is not him personally (I don’t know him anyway), but the way he carefully choose some isolated “facts”, the tendency he has to take them out of their context, the way he change the natural interpretation of many others facts and the way he “forget” some others, all this in order to comfort his preconceived ideas about the Shroud. FOR CHRIST’S SAKE, AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT’S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO GOOD SCIENCE ?!? I don’t have any doubt that Wilson has contributed that a lot of English speaking person has discovered the Shroud over the years. The problem is not there. The main problem is that he has filled these persons with many biased and incorrect notions about the Shroud. If that’s what you call a great legacy, fine for you !!! But on my part, seeing this makes me sick. I truly think the Shroud deserves better !!! You’re still not convince ? Here’s just one example among a multitude : the term “poker holes” came directly from Wilson and has been adopted by many persons who have read his books and even worse, has been adopted by some Shroud researchers, as incredible as it seems, while science is almost sure now that the formation of the 4 series of little holes has absolutely nothing to do with a hot poker but come most probably from the drop of burning grains of incense or some corrosive liquid on the Shroud while he was folded in four equal parts !!! It’s just one good example of the great imagination of Wilson… Seeing many actual Shroud researchers praising Wilson that much and following his footsteps so closely makes me even sicker because by doing so, they risk to kill completely the few amount of credibility that can still be present in Sindonology today. One last comment : In his recent report about the Valencia Conference in Spain for the BSTS, Mark Guscin wrote this about a paper presented there by Pablo Di Lazzaro: “He showed (Di Lazzaro) how our brain works to FILL IN SPACES and make us “see” things that we WOULD LIKE TO SEE, but which quite simply ARE NOT THERE. In reference to the Shroud this could be applied to the supposed inscriptions, the supposed coins, the supposed flowers and the supposed many other things that people “see” from time to time.” I think M. Guscin should have add to his list the desire of Wilson and his followers to see the Mandylion, a small towel showing only the face of the living Christ, which we can see in a great number of ancient copies that has survived to this day, turn suddenly into a burial Shroud full of bloodstains that show 2 different images (front and back) of a complete body… This process can be called “Seeing things we desperately wants to see even if they are not really there” and it can start to operate not only from the eyes, but directly from the brain. Wilson’s hypothesis is a very good example of that..","date":"2012-09-02","mins":"5:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/02/charles-freeman-the-manifold-problems-with-wilsons-hypotheses/","cat":"history","title":"Charles Freeman:  the manifold problems with Wilson’s hypotheses"},{"id":"comment-40668","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote: “A heretical Christian sect probably created the image in the 1st or 2nd century with methods that have been lost to history.” Question: Why would this hypothesis of yours should be more probable than the idea that it is the real crucified body of Jesus of Nazareth who produced this image?

In other words, the Shroud of Turin is just the opposite of a “Gnostic” relic of Christ because it clearly show the erroneous aspect of their doctrine! So, from this moment on, you can completely forget the idea that a Gnostic could have produced a false burial cloth as gruesome and humanly realistic as the Shroud of Turin!

Effectively, there was still no public Christian sanctuary, no public Christian church or cathedral, no public Christian pilgrimage place, etc. And the Christian religion was not perceived very well by the authorities throughout the Roman empire, whether they be Roman or Jewish. In such a bad context (which was accompanied by sporadic persecutions from time to time), why such a Christian group would have gain in creating such a false relic of Jesus Christ? That makes no sense to me. I have studied this subject intensively and came out to the conclusion that the only possible period of time in which a false relic of the Shroud of Christ like the Shroud of Turin could have been created is between the Edict of Milan of 313 A.D. And the apparition of the first Pantocrator icon, around 500 A.D.

There is not one iota of historical evidence that such an event occurred.” I want to say this to Albert and anyone else: You are right! On a pure scientific base, there is not one single proof that the Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth really occurred. BUT… There are tons of solid historical evidences that all of the closest followers of this prophet of Galilea were completely convinced (so much that some of them gave their life for this belief) that he was really resurrected. Now, it’s up to anyone to believe their claim or not. And in the end, who cares? If you don’t need God in this earthly life, that’s fine. But if you need him, the testimony of these early followers of Jesus can truly give you a great hope to go through life. Last thing: Even if I agree that the Resurrection of Jesus cannot be proven as an historical event, the burial cloths found empty on Easter morning and the tomb itself found empty the same day have to be considered as real historical events since no one (not even the ennemies of the Christians like the Jews or the Romans) during the first few centuries after Jesus’ death ever denied these findings (at least, as we know of from ancient sources). On the contrary, most people who did not believe the claims made by Jesus’ followers ended up thinking that it was them who had stolen and hide the corpse and then claimed he was resurrected. This should be enough a good clue to understand that the empty burial cloths and the empty tomb were not an invention of Jesus followers. A set up made by them? Some can think this, but the bottom line is this: 2000 years ago or so, on Easter morning in Jerusalem, the burial cloths and the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth who had died less than 48 hours earlier were found empty. Now, it’s up to anyone to explain this historical fact the best he can. In my mind, there are two main way to explain this: 1 You believe the claim made by Jesus’ followers. Or 2 You believe the rational explanation of the ennemies of the Christians (i.e. The disciples came at night, they took the corpse and hide it somewhere and then claimed Jesus was resurrected).

Therefore, all parts should have been exposed to the same kinds and amounts of (natural) radiation. Any additional radiation effects found in image areas would indicate excess radiation in that location. Direct comparison between image and non image parts of the Shroud show exactly the same amounts and types of radiation damage in the two types of areas. This suggests that the image was not produced by any mechanism that involved heat, light, or ionizing radiation.” You can find this quote at #63 in my recent paper entitled “Raymond N. Rogers’ observations and conclusions concerning the body image that is visible on the Shroud of Turin”. Here’s the link to it: http://shroudnm.com/docs/2013 01 10 Yannick Clément Reflections on Ray Rogers Shroud Work.pdf And here’s the personal note I add just after this quote in which I linked Rogers’ observation with another important finding made by Adler and where I emphasize the importance of these experts observations in regard of the Mandylion hypothesis (note that, in this comment, I answer to the very weak (because it is non historical) argument often used by Wilson and his partisans concerning the idea that the Mandylion was always kept inside a reliquary and was never exposed): This particular observation of Rogers can be seen as a very good confirmation of a spectral analysis done by Alan Adler in the 1990s on four non image fibers coming from various locations of the frontal part of the Shroud (i.e. The head, chest, knees and feet areas). Adler was clear about the fact that his spectroscopic results showed that there were no evident differences in the chemical content for all of these areas, which indicates, like Rogers said in his paper, that each part of the cloth is really showing the same age and the same degree of natural oxidation. It is very important to note that such a conclusion is in total contradiction with the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson. Effectively, if Wilson’s hypothesis was correct, the region of the face on the Shroud would have been the only one exposed to light, dust, air and natural radiations for many centuries (if not for over 1000 years). In that context, we should expect to see evident signs of an accentuated aging (i.e. More oxidation of the fibers, along with more dust) for the non image fibers located in the vicinity of the face, but the observations of Rogers and Adler (and also those of other STURP members, like Samuel F. Pellicori and Mark S. Evans) proved that this is not the case. Along with Rogers own observations cited here,this homogeneity in Adler’s spectral results concerning a non image fiber coming from the head region of the frontal side of the Shroud and other non image fibers coming from different locations can be seen as a very strong physico chemical proof that Wilson’s hypothesis is surely incorrect and this should lead Shroud’s historians to search elsewhere in order to find a better explanation for the apparent silence of ancient documentary and artistic sources concerning the presence of a Shroud of Christ that was showing all his stigmata and his complete body image before the first attested appearance of the Shroud of Turin in the small town of Lirey, France, ca. 1357. I know that some defenders of Wilson’s hypothesis will pretend that the Mandylion was probably kept almost constantly inside a reliquary and that would explain Rogers and Adler’s conclusions but this kind of rationalisation is totally contradicted by the evident difference that exists in the aging aspect of both sides of the Shroud. Effectively,during their direct examination of the cloth in 1978, the STURP team (including Rogers himself) easily noticed that the back side of the cloth (i.e. The one protected by the Holland backing cloth for some 444 years at the time of the examination) was showing less signs of aging (oxidation) than the frontal side (i.e. The one exposed that showed the body image), even though we know for a fact that, during all that time, the Shroud had been kept almost constantly inside a reliquary, except for some pretty rare public showings. Here’s the first impression of Ray Rogers when he was able to see a portion of the back side of the cloth in 1978: “The back side is whiter than the front.” It’s important to note that such an observation was made very easily with the naked eye and without any need for the use of a microscope. So, in all logic, if Wilson’s hypothesis was correct, we should expect to see the same kind of accentuatedsigns of natural aging (i.e. More oxidation and most probably more dust and dirt also) for the region of the face versus the rest of the cloth than what the STURP team easily noticed in 1978 for the frontal side of the cloth versus the back side. Unfortunatelly for Wilson and the partisans of his hypothesis, Rogers and Adler’s observations and analyses proved that this is absolutely not the case. I know I will never convince any partisans of Wilson (sadly, Dan Porter being one of them), but at least, these persons will have to find a scientifically sound explanation (good luck!!!) for the fact that the face region on the Shroud was never more exposed to light, air, dust and dirt than the rest of the cloth! In the light of Rogers and Adler’s observations, I think it’s fair to say that the burden of proof rest on the shoulders of Wilson and his partisans!.","date":"2013-02-22","mins":"11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/22/david-rolfe-we-need-you/","cat":"history","title":"David Rolfe we need you"},{"id":"comment-25547","author":"yannick_clément","post":"For having exchanging some emails directly with Aldo (a GENTLEMAN !) on that subject, he told me that he thought the holes were caused by a part of the lid of the reliquary, which could have been a very hot mettalic bar that was located under the lid to give it a good support.

Since it’s NOT the case, we must consider the hypothesis of Wilson has being irrelevant. For example, if Wilson was right, Rogers and Adler would have obviously detected a more important degree of oxidation concerning the most superficial linen fibers and the STURP team in general would have obviously detected a more important amount of dust and dirt stuck in between the fibers and the threads in the region of the face versus the rest of the cloth.

Nevertheless, it is truly possible that the painting of Jesus face that was on it was influenced by the image on the Shroud, which would indicates that the Shroud was present in the Middle East (and known from some people Inside the Church) around the 6th or 7th Century and maybe before….","date":"2015-08-04","mins":"9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-207670","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I would like to share with anyone interested by the topic one of the greatest argument that can go against the scenario proposed by Latendresse and it’s the historical context during which the set of relics bought by St Louis, King of France, from Baudouin II (who was a relative of Louis by the way), were brought to the new Sainte Chapelle of Paris. Any good historian will tell you that whenever you have a hypothesis to analyze, the historical context is crucial… At the time these relics were placed inside the Sainte Chapelle (around the middle of the 13th Century), this was a time where everything related to the Passion of Christ was becoming very popular in Europe. In that context, it’s not surprising to understand why the relic of the whole set that was considered as being the most important item by St Louis and all the French faithful was the crown of thorns (much more than the Mandylion, which really seem to have been considered by the French King as just one relic among many other with less popular value than the relics directly related to the Passion, like the crown of thorns for example)! Considering this historical FACT, we can now understand the very big problem associated with the scenario proposed by Latendresse! Effectively, if the Mandylion would really have been the Shroud with the facial region visible for anyone to see, it is EVIDENT that St Louis and all the French faithful would have found that this particular relic was directly related to Jesus’ Passion and, therefore, this discovery would have make a lot of noise and probably even more than the acquisition of the crown of thorns! The fact that this never happened at the time indicate with great certainty that this particular relic was NOT AT ALL related to the Passion of Christ… This is pure logic, considering the historical context, which is something that Latendresse seems to have neglected. Effectively, anyone with a brain that works all right can easily see a direct connection between the facial region of the Shroud and the Passion of Jesus Christ! Even a Christian kid could make the link! Because of this, you can be sure that if the Mandylion that had been bought by Louis was in reality the Shroud folded in 8, anyone who saw the relic (starting with Louis himself and the man he sent to Constantinople to check the authenticity of the set of relics) would have make the link between all the bloodstains present in the facial region of the Shroud and the Passion of Christ and would have considered it as being a relic directly associated with the Passion (maybe by considering it as the authentic Veronica vail or, after an unfolding of the cloth, by considering it as the real burial cloth of Jesus). One way or the other, you can bet your house that such a bloodstained relic of the face of Christ would have been presented with lot of noise by Louis to the French faithful once the relic would have been placed inside the Sainte Chapelle… But because none of this happened and because that was the crown of thorns instead that made this great noise, we are practically certain that the Mandylion that was bought by Louis was NOT AT ALL related to the Passion of Christ and, therefore, could not in any possible and logical way have been the Shroud of Turin folded in 8, while showing only the facial region. Also, because of this, there is a good probability that this Mandylion was looking pretty much like the ancient depiction of the Mandylion of Edessa, i.e. A small cloth showing the face of the living Christ without any signs of injuries or blood. In summary, the scenario proposed by Latendresse do not fit at all with the historical context during which the Mandylion and all the other relics arrived at the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, which was a time (middle of the 13 century) and a place (Europe) where the spirituality of people was greatly focused on the Passion of Christ and everything that was related to it was very popular (like, for example, a relic of the Passion like the crown of thorns or gruesome crucifixes or new icons like the Man of Sorrow). It’s evident that, in such a context, if the Mandylion that has been bought by St Louis had been the Shroud, the arrival of this particular relic in Paris (a relic that would have clearly showed Jesus face with lots of bloodstains) would have made a big noise and probably even more than the crown of thorns. The fact that this is not at all what happened clearly indicates that this particular relic had nothing to do with the Passion of Christ, which is exactly what we can already find in all the lists of relics of Constantinople, where this particular relic was never associated with the Passion. In fact, the one that made a lot of noise was, no surprisingly, the crown of thorns… That’s all people! Meditate on this and maybe you’ll end up understanding how illogical and weak Latendresse hypothesis really is, especially in regard of the historical context during which the set of relics bought by St Louis arrived in the Sainte Chapelle of Paris….","date":"2015-08-07","mins":"7:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-207868","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Quote from Dave: ” If the Paris relic is at all genuine, then it may have been used to keep a helmet style of thorned crown in place.” I agree that this is the most rational explanation for this kind of simple circlet without thorns and, because we know the Shroud man was wearing a helmet of thorns and not a crown like we used to see in religious art, there’s still a possibility that this circlet could be as genuine as the Shroud and could have really been tight up around the Shroud man’s head..","date":"2015-08-10","mins":"8:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-207402","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Seriously, I don’t think Latendresse’s hypothesis will stand in front of the unbiased historians who are experts in this subject..","date":"2015-08-04","mins":"9:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"id":"comment-10966","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I just want to say “Amen” to this message from M. Markwardt. And I want to add something important to one part of his message. He said : “It has been suggested, in lieu of this incredible miracle discovery tale, that the icon was actually found in the wake of the great flood of 525 CE which damaged Edessa’s city walls; however, it is rather significant that such a truly notable event merited no mention whatsoever in the Edessan Chronicle, a Syriac work composed in ca. 540 544 CE, which not only described the great flood but also detailed the most commonplace of Edessan ecclesiastical matters.” Comment from me : There was 2 ancient historians, Procopius of Cesarea and Evagrius Scholasticus, who wrote historical chonicles about Edessa in the 6th century and both wrote about the flood of 525 without saying one word about the so called discovery of the image in a wall of the city. This hypothesis is defend by Ian Wilson and, from historical sources, you can see that it got absolutely no confirmation at all. It’s a good example of a total speculation done by our friend Wilson. I think it’s pretty clear that if both historians doesn’t mention anything about an image in relation to this great flood of 525, that can only mean that there was no discovery of a miraculous image during that time. Period. Another important thing to note is the FACT that Procopius, who wrote his chronicle shorly after the Persian’s attack of Edessa in 544. He talk about this attack and he mentions only the letter of Jesus to Abgar as the only “palladium” (sacred object that has a divine power of protection) allowing the city of Edessa to avoid looting. Procopius didn’t know any miraculous image that could have played a role in the defense of the city, unlike Evagrius who, some 45 years later, wrote also a chronicle and was the first one to talk about this miraculous image that played a major role in the rescue of the city (and he don’t mention when this so called miraculous image appeared in Edessa). But the thing to note here is the fact that Evagrius used mainly the Chronicle of Procopius to talk about the Persian attack. Since he wrote later and used his work to do his job, it’s pretty obvious that his mention of the miraculous role played by the image not made by human hands in the rescue of Edessa was a later addition that has no real historical base. After that, many other later additions like that were done to the Abgar legend with a great peak, as stated by M. Markwardt, in 945 946, with the writting of the manuscript The Narratio de Imagine Edessena under Constantine VII, just after the arrival of the image in Constantinople. All those later additions to the legend (i.e., the miraculous nature of the image who was nothing more than a painted portrait of Jesus at first, the change of location when the image was created from some days before the Passion to the agony in Gethsemane, etc.) must be considered by historians with extreme caution, since they appeared to be devoid of a real credible and solid historical basis… On the contrary, most of these additions seems to have been caused by some theological developments and even political consideration (particularly true for the Narratio written under the control of the emperor Constantine VII)..","date":"2012-04-29","mins":"6:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/history-done-right/","cat":"history","title":"History Done Right."},{"id":"comment-10775","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This is a perfect example of a copy of the Mandylion that was probably done by an artist who was an eye witness of the relic !!!

Vignon never thought for a second that this relic could have been the Shroud folded in 8 like Wilson pretend. For Vignon, there was a close connexion between the 2 relics, but at the same time, they were different relics in his mind !

I never saw a single historian (a real one, not a journalist) that come from OUTSIDE the Shroud world and who his a defender of Wilson’s hypothesis. Not a single one ! I will conclude by saying this : Look closely at this Holy face of Laon that was probably made by an artist who knew very well the real Mandylion. Seriously, do you really think it represent the face we see on the Shroud of Turin ? You really think this artist would have done a copy of the relic and, at the same time, transform some of the most evident properties of the image : He would have taken the image of a dead Christ and turn it into an image of a living Christ. Also, he would have taken the image of a bloody Christ and turn it into an image of an alive and well Christ ! YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT ???

The Pray codex is a good example that show that before the 13th century, it was not “in the air” to represent a bloody Christ. And then, someone can extrapolate and think that this reasoning can be also applied to the copies of the Mandylion. But, at the same time, ancient sources (like the Narratio de Imagine Edessena) is pretty clear about the fact that the Mandylion had been showed publicly at some points during his history. And the “Narratio” informs us also about the precious fact that there were already 2 copies of the Mandylion in Edessa at the time of the deal (in 944) between the byzantine emperor Romanus Lecapenus and the Arab ruler of Edessa that enable the emperor to get the Mandylion and take him back to Constantinople. And, also from the “Narratio”, we learn that those 2 copies were so good that the Byzantines had to make a careful check of the relic they were about the get, in order to be 100% sure that it was the authentic Mandylion. From those information, we can deduce 2 important things : 1 The Mandylion must have looked very much like a painting, since it appear that paint copies of the relic were so similar that it needed a careful check to differentiate them with the authentic relic. 2 During the time the Mandylion was still in Edessa (before 944), there was already copies of the relic that were made and since it’s evident that they were very good copies that look very like the original (see my previous explanation), if Wilson was right, then that would mean the artists who made those copies DID SHOW THE BLOODSTAINS on their copies !!! In this context, you will make me believe that those 2 Edessenian copies were the only 2 in history to be almost exact copies showing the bloodstains (so exact that they could easily have been confused with the original) and then, after the transfer to Constantinople, no artist would have dared to make another exact copy showing the bloodstains like the 2 exact copies in Edessa ? I think a scenario like that is highly unlikely. I don’t see why those exact copies from Edessa would have been very different than the subsequent copies done in Constantinople (like this Holy Face of Laon). To me, the fact that there was already some copies made during the time the relic was still in Edessa strengthen the idea that the relic was really an image of the living Christ showing no bloodstain at all. I really think that if there would have been copies in Edessa showing the bloodstains, there would also have been those kind of exact copies made later on when the Image was in Constantinople. I’m sure you understand my argument !!! And if we analyse the Pray codex, then it is pretty evident that the artist who did the work had seen the Shroud with his own eyes. But he did not show the bloodstains (or maybe just a little bit in one particular place, but that’s not guarantee). Since this artwork was done during the 12th century by an artist who was most probably one of the few to have been able to see the inside part of the Shroud at that time (before the public showing of the Shroud in Constantinople during the years 1203 1204), I think it is enough to understand why he didn’t draw the bloodstains (or just a few). In fact, it wasn’t “in the air” of the time to show a suffering Christ and this artist didn’t dare to show those bloodstains in every details. It is understandable that he acted like that because of the artistic context of the time were there was absolutely no image of a suffering Christ with bloodstains anywhere in Christian art. It took the most probable first ever public showing of the inside part of the Shroud with the images to see things changed in Christian art related to the Passion. I’m pretty sure this particular public showing was the starting point of the changes we saw later on during the 13th century….","date":"2012-04-24","mins":"3:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/23/holy-face-of-laon-continuing-jones-four-proofs-that-the-ad-1260-1390-radiocarbon-date-for-the-shroud-has-to-be-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Holy Face of Laon:  Continuing Jones’  Four Proofs that the AD 1260-1390 Radiocarbon date for the Shroud has to be Wrong!"},{"id":"comment-10821","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I want to emphasize the first deduction that you find in my comment above. Here is again the deduction : 1 The Mandylion must have looked very much like a painting, since it appear that paint copies of the relic were so similar that it needed a careful check to differentiate them with the authentic relic. Starting from this deduction, I want to remember you that the first ancient manuscript that ever introduced the idea of an image of Christ in the Abgar legend is called “The Doctrine of Addaï” (the syriac version date from + or – 400 and the greek version date from the third decade of the 5th century) and that it wasn’t at all a miraculous image then. No… In fact, it was simply a portrait of the living Christ painted by the artist of the king !!! And some other manuscripts that tells the Abgar legend, dating from the 5th century and even from the beginning of the 6th century, have also mentionned a portrait of Christ that was painted by the artist of the king and even 2 of those manuscript report that this portrait was still present in Edessa. I think that all those evidence make a pretty good case to support the idea that the Image of Edessa was most probably a portrait of the living Christ that was painted by an artist (no miraculous image here and no shroud of Christ folded in 8) and that, during the second part of the 6th century, the church of Edessa started to make believe people that this was, in reality, an image not made by human hands. I think this change from a manmade to a miraculous image could have taken many decades to be completed and was propagated by text like The Acts of Thaddeus and others like that. That’s where I stand right now in my research on the subject.

That’s why I consider this public showing to be the very first one in history where the Church dared to show the entire Shroud, including the interior part where we can see the body image. The public showing was done each friday during part of the years 1203 and 1204, until the sack of Constantinople in april 1204. And I estimate that this first public showing had a direct impact on the drastic change we see in Christian art regarding the depictions of the Passion of the Christ, where we saw realistic and bloody depictions suddenly appeared in Europe after the return of the crusaders.

I don’t see any contradiction with these 2 terms. In fact, I think God wants us to use our brain as much as our hearts and I just want to stay grounded in my faith because I saw too many persons being caught by the “illuminati” syndrom !

That’s the key for a better understanding… And when it comes to all the dogmas concerning Mary (especially when it comes to the virginal nativity), what I see is great external influence on this story that we found in Luke and Matthew that tells me that it was probably “made up” in order to comfort the truth that Jesus was truly the Messiah. In other word, a “lie” (I use this term with prudence here) was probably used to comfort an higher truth. That’s how I see it. And note that the most probable manmade Mandylion and other so called miraculous imprints of the face of Jesus that were most probably other false relics made around the 6th century by the Orthodox Church were used in the same exact way ! This “lie” (pretending that they were real miraculous imprint of Christ) served the Church to comfort an higher truth (that Jesus really had 2 natures in himself, a divine and a human nature as well). Don’t forget what was the historical context of the time in Middle East : There was a bunch of heretical groups (like the Monophysits who, by the way, were truly present in Edessa) who did not want to admit the 2 natures of Christ and who were only believing in his divine nature (the Gnostics were another groups who shared similar beliefs).

For me, this has badly contributed to false the perception of many Christians over the years versus the FACT that Jesus of Nazareth (even if he was truly divine in nature) was also TRULY HUMAN in nature (meaning that he shared within himself both natures). For me, the Shroud is a very good piece of evidence to understand this most important belief : Jesus was a real human being with a real human corpse who react like anyone else and WHO DIED LIKE ANYONE ELSE. And because of this, I don’t see any good reason to look elsewhere than in the direction of a natural cause for the body image that would have come from some kind of interaction between his tortured corpse and his linen Shroud. This story about the virginal nativity has been showed by most theologians and bible scholars as being influenced greatly by many ancient legendary tales of ancient people that present also a virginal nativity of the heroic character of the story (that could be considered, in some legend, as being a demi God). I completely agree with this point of view that has been described brightly by Raymond E. Brown and other scholars. In fact, I don’t trust in all the supernatural dogmas associated with Mary, the mother of Christ. I have a great sense that this was all made up to elevate her on the single base that her son was the Messiah. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t doubt that Mary was a very good spiritual person and all this, but this thing that the Catholic Church has done of her (to elevate her almost as the same level than a Greek Goddess) is something that I just can’t stand. And believe me, here in Quebec (and probably also in many more liberal countries in Europe), there are a lot of Catholics who share the same view as me. The base of my faith is the resurrection of Christ and the revelation he made of the true God (i.e. Love and Mercy) by all his actions and sayings and ultimately, by the free gift of his life (not as a sacrificial thing but as the greatest statement ever made that God is Love and Mercy and nothing else). That’s my belief and I’m sure you don’t share it with me. In the end, who cares ??? Anyone’s free to belief what he want, right ???

Markwardt : First, I want to say that your message is interesting but I have to disagree with your hypothesis concerning Procopius. Effectively, in his account of the defense of Edessa in 544, he does mention the fact that the letter of Christ to Abgar (considered as a real palladium for the city) played a miraculous role in the defense of Edessa ! In this context, how in the world would he had choosen to avoid mentionning the presence of a miraculous image of Christ during this event ? It make no sense to me. The fact that he had no problem to mention the letter of Christ to Abgar and even wrote that it played a miraculous role in the defense of the city is the very best proof that if he had known the presence of an image of Christ not made by human hands, he would have mentionned it, along with the letter of Christ. So, from this basic logic, I think it is highly speculative (and even imprudent) to think that there was a miraculous image of Christ present in that city before 550 (when Procopius wrote his manuscript). And for Evagrius, I know that there is a debate right now about the possibility that his mention of a miraculous image was just a later addition made by the Church at the end of the 8th century. I think there’s no way to be sure, whether or not he really wrote that himself, but nevertheless, I’m sure that this information is not accurate at all, simply because of the account of Procopius who just mentionned the letter of Christ withtout talking one second about an image of Christ. If he didn’t mentionned the role of a palludium played by the letter, then, maybe, I would be more open to the possibility that he would not have wanted to mention precious relics of Christ… But the reality is different than this ! You also wrote : “…literary allusions to an “eikon”, or image, of Christ would appear to be evidential of its existence (existence of the Shroud)…” Here, again, I must disagree with you a bit, simply because of some ancient references that clearly state a shroud of Christ (or burial cloths of Christ in the plural). To be convinced, we just have to think of the testimony of Antoninus of Piacenza (often confused with Antoninus Martyr) in 570, the manuscript of Braulio, bishop of Saragossa in the middle of the 7th century, the testimony of Arculf, bishop of Perigeux, in 670, and the manuscript of John Damascus in 726 or 730. All of them clearly talked about some kind of burial cloth and never of any kind of icon or image. I have a great difficulty to believe that some writers would have describe the shroud as simply an “icon” or an “image” without making any kind of link with the Passion of the Christ, the empty tomb, the burial of Chist or the burial aspect of the cloth. So, in thist context, I don’t see any good reason to speculate that much about a reported “icon” or “image” of Christ, even in the case this object is describe as “not made by human hands”. It’s not because an icon or an image of Christ is describe that way that we must think it was the shroud of Turin ! As I say, unless we can found a clear indication that can link an icon or an image like that with the Passion of the Christ, the empty tomb, the burial of Chist or the burial aspect of the cloth, I think it is highly speculative to think those ancient texts were really refeering to the Shroud of Turin. I’m not an historian (even if I’m passionate about history) but nevertheless, I’m intelligent (and prudent) enough to know that it is like walking on a very thin ice to make speculative links like that and, for one, I would never dare to published an hypothesis that would be based on things like that. As I said in another comment, all we are sure, regarding all the ancient sources, is that a shroud of Christ (or burial cloths of Christ in the plural) were report to have been in Jerusalem (or some place in Palestine), Constantinople and Athens, before being showed in France during the middle of the 14th century. That’s all we can state without any doubt ! Sorry but there’s absolutely no clear mention of his presence in Edessa or Antioch. And even worse than that, beside the testimonies of Nicolas Mesarites (implicit) and Robert de Clari (explicit), there’s absolutely no other reliable and clear testimony of a Shroud of Christ with an image on it before the 14th century in France. Beside that, all we’re left with is speculations, extrapolations and special assumptions. As I said, on that fragile base, I would never dare to publish an hypothesis regarding the ancient history of the Shroud, simply because I could not defend it with any kind of success. Wilson think he can do that but, in fact, he can’t. And, sorry, but regarding your own hypothesis, I don’t think you can either. So, I think you can forget me publishing a serious hypothesis regarding the ancient history of the Shroud of Turin, unless there would be some dramatic discovery regarding an ancient source or an ancient artwork. Conclusion : I have some ideas that I think deserves some thoughts about the possible ancient history of the Shroud but since I cannot defend them properly, I don’t think I ever published any hypothesis at all on this subject. But nevertheless, I want to add that it’s not something that will convinced me one bit that the Shroud of Turin is not authentic… It’s just that we cannot write his ancient history properly. That’s all. That doesn’t mean for a second that this relic didn’t exist during those days. I also want to say this : I don’t have a proper hypothesis to explain the dead silence of the ancient sources versus a Shroud of Christ with an image on it, but there’s one thing I’m sure : The hypothesis of Ian Wilson is NOT the answer to the problem. We have to look elsewhere. It seem that you tried to do that (bravo for your effort) but, unfortunatelly, your hypothesis, like the one of Wilson, seem to rely mainly on speculation, extrapolations and special assumptions and, at the same time, seem to have an important lack of clear and solid references to a burial Shroud (or burial cloths) of Christ, that would be needed in order to support properly the history you propose. In that regard, I seriously doubt that an hypothesis like yours will receive much credits from most experts in Byzantine study… That’s what I think. Of course, because Antioch and Edessa were two cities were christian communities rises pretty early (more true for Antioch than Edessa), someone is free to think the Shroud was brought there at one point in his history. But the bottomline is this : It’s absolutely impossible to prove that claim !!! So, where do we go from here ???.","date":"2012-05-02","mins":"8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/hymn-of-the-pearl-description-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Hymn of the Pearl: Description of the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-11003","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I would like to ask a very important question to M. Markwardt about his own hypothesis : You state in your paper that the Shroud was taken to Edessa in 540 from Antioch when that city fall to the Persian army. If this was true, then can you explain to me the fact that we don’t have nothing about this arrival of the relic in Edessa in ancient historical chronicles (like the one of Procopius of Cesarea who wrote his text around 550, just 10 years after that) ??? Procopius, a real historian of his time, talk about a number of things related to Edessa (like the great flood of 525 and the Persian attack of 544) but he never mention the presence or the arrival of any image of Christ in that city !!! How in the world can you explain logically and honestly this total absence of reference to any image of Christ in link with Edessa in the work of Procopius ??? And another question would be : How in the world people of Antioch (and writers) could have mistaken the burial Shroud of Christ with a “sacred icon of Christ” ??? If you’re hypothesis was true, why in the world there’s no ancient document that makes a clear link between this icon present in Antioch and a burial shroud of Jesus ??? I must say that I’m very perplexed about your hypothesis, simply because, undeniably, it rely mainly, like the one of Wilson, on speculations, extrapolations and special assumptions and, more important than that, it seems to be contradict by the absence of clear references to the presence of a shroud of Christ (I’m not talking about an “icon” here, I talk about a shroud) in Antioch and the absence of clear references to the arrival of such a relic of Christ’s Passion in Edessa around 540… There’s absolutely no doubt that, if your hypothesis was correct, there will be clear references to the presence of a burial shroud of Christ (again, I don’t talk about an “icon”, which is something completely different than a shroud), first in Antioch, then in Edessa. The FACT is this : In ancient records, before the arrival of the Shroud in France, we just have some references of the presence of a shroud of Christ (I’m not talking about an “icon” or just an “image” of Christ), considered as the true relic of Jesus taken from the empty tomb, in Jerusalem, Constantinople and Athens. I’ve never seen any other reference to the relic of the Shroud of Christ being present anywhere else during that time, not even in Rome ! Last question : Why you, M. Wilson and others in the Shroud world always seem to think that if an ancient source talk about an image of Christ (nevermind that it was manmade or not made by human hands), that means it talks “secretly” about the Shroud of Turin ! The eye witness testimonies like the one of Nicolas Mesarites and Robert de Clari mention a shroud or burial cloths in the plural. Why that would not have been the same for the people present in Edessa and Antioch when the shroud was there (if your idea is correct) ??? Why those people would have changed the name of the relic to start from “The Burial Shroud of Christ” to “The Christ icon of the kerateion” that you refer in Antioch or to “The Image of Edessa” (if Wilson was right) ??? I just don’t understand why those people would have wanted to make believe that the Shroud of Christ was something else than the Shroud of Christ (to change the nature of the cloth if you want) ! What would they gained to do this ? Do you know another relic of Christ that his real nature was changed like that in ancient time ? I don’t know any ! That just don’t make any sense to me… A burial shroud is a burial shroud and it is never an icon, even if a body image is on it ! That’s 2 things completely different and there’s absolutely no ancient source that make a specific and direct link between the Shroud of Christ and an icon of Christ. For example, Robert de Clari talk about the fact that the Shroud of Constantinople was bearing a body image on it, but he still mention the word “shroud” and never said that this shroud was considered as some kind of a sacred icon of Christ ! The Pantocrator was a sacred icon of Christ, not his Shroud !!!! I think my questions, interrogations and arguments deserve some explanations from M. Markwardt… Thank you in advance !.","date":"2012-04-30","mins":"12:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/hymn-of-the-pearl-description-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Hymn of the Pearl: Description of the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-10866","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Mario, you’re completely wrong sorry. Incredible. It’s not the Act of Thomas (known originally as the Act of Thaddeus) that was written at the beginning of the fifth century, but the Doctrin of Addaï ! Guscin state that this text was written between 609 and 726 (there’s no way actually to be more precise), while the Doctrin was written in syriac around 400 ! And what we found in the Doctrin ? A story about the artist of king Abgar who PAINTED a portrait of the living Christ. This text is the VERY FIRST to add an image of Christ in the legend of Abgar (a clear addition). So, if we start from the first report about an image, we have to believe that this was a PAINTING done by an artist. There was already 2 copies of the Mandylion in Edessa in 944 and the Byzantine had to make a serious check of the relic they were about the get to make sure that the Arabs didn’t fool them with one of the 2 copies.

Markwardt. I agree mostly with you but, for the tetradiplon expression, I think that once someone has put the word in the context of the text, it is OBVIOUS that this cannot be applied to a burial shroud of 4.4 meters ! The context was during Jesus days of preaching, well before the Passion. How in the world someone would give him a burial shroud in order that he could wipe his face after having washed it ? For a jew, a burial shroud was considered totally impur ! How in the world Jesus would have dared to use a burial shroud in public to wipe his face with it ??? Thiking that this expression “sindon tetradiplon” could mean that the Shroud was folded “doubled in 4” is completely off track versus the context of that part of the text (found in the Acts of Thaddeus). And, as I said before, we must understand one important thing : the word “sindon” in greek can mean different thing depending of the literary CONTEXT ! In the case of the Acts of Thaddeus, it is almost 100% sure that this doesn’t mean a shroud at all, but just a cloth. And there’s one more thing I should add about this expression : In the Narratio de Imagine Edessena, that word “tetradiplon” is used again to describe the image of Edessa (it’s normal since the Acts of Thaddeus was one of the main source used for the Narratio). But this time, it was not “sindon” that was used before “tetradiplon” but “pakoç” instead ! And what’s the normal meaning of that greek word ? A rag or a dishtowel ! We’re VERY far from a burial Shroud of 4.4 meters, don’t you think ??? This change from the word “sindon” to the word “pakoç” prove one important thing about the way the ancient writers were doing their job : they were not obsessed with precision like we are today (today it’s like a disease) ! It was natural that a writer from that time would change a word or an expression from one manuscript to another, even if he was refeering to the same event or story. Examples of changes like that are incalculable. And this was also true inside one manuscript ! In the Narratio for example, there’s about 10 different expressions to describe the Image of Edessa ! No kidding. And I want to clarify that there is absolutely no expression that may suggest a burial shroud or an object of that nature… All the expression used really seem to refer to a small cloth and that fits perfectly with the story, since it is clearly state that Christ washed and wiped only his FACE, not his body. The historical fact that ancient writters used often different words or expressions to describe one single object or one single situation mean one important thing : We cannot take anything for granted when we analyse one expression (in this case : Sindon tetradiplon) found in just one manuscript (in this case : the Acts of Thaddeus) and think this expression represent a clear and definitive physical description of an object, especially when this expression come from a legendary kind of text and especially also when there’s parallel texts that used a different expression (in this case : Pakoç tetradiplon) !!! In the analysis of an expression “sindon tetradiplon”, we also have to consider the fact that this expression was not used again in any other manuscript that refer to the same Image of Edessa and the Abgar legend (those manuscript used a vast variety of expressions to describe the cloth but they never use “sindon tetradiplon”). This fact too seem to discard any idea that the Image of Edessa could have been described as something like a burial shroud….","date":"2012-04-29","mins":"8:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/hymn-of-the-pearl-description-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Hymn of the Pearl: Description of the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-10922","author":"yannick_clément","post":"M.

This text was probably written in the 3rd century and served as one of the main source for Eusebius story of the legend of Abgar (written at the beginning of the 4th century). I was fooled by the title, since Thaddeus is another name for Thomas in some texts. Sorry. The act of Thaddeus is one of the first text that talk about a miraculous image but it is clearly a later modification of the story we found in the Doctrine of Addaï. And this Doctrine was itself a later modification of the texts that Eusebius saw in Edessa to write the story of Abgar. But my point is still true since Eusebius didn’t know the existence of any kind of image of Christ whatsoever. That’s a clear indication that there was no reference to an image in the Acts of Thomas. Eusebius was only aware of an exchange of letters between Abgar and Jesus and that’s all. No image. And later, a pilgrim named Egeria who visited Edessa at the end of the 4th century talked only about those letters, a clear confirmation that there was no image of Christ known in Edessa at that time. It’s only some years later (maybe 15 years or so) after the visit of Egeria, that the Doctrine of Addaï was written, first in Syriac and then a bit later in Greek, and in both case, it is clearly stated that the image of Christ was a portrait painted by the artist of Abgar. Since this text is the first to mention an image in the story of Abgar, while there was no such thing in Eusebius and Egeria’s writing, this is a clear indication that the image of Christ (painted portrait made by an artist) was a later addition to the legend of Abgar that wasn’t there at first (and we can be sure then that it wasn’t there in the Acts of Thomas). If there was a clear indication of an image of Christ in the Acts of Thomas in link with Edessa, you can bet that Eusebius and Egeria would have talked about it. I repeat it : the first clear mention of an image related to the story of Abgar is found in the Doctrine of Addaï and it is clearly state that it was a portrait painted by the artist of the king.

In this particular context of high nervousness and the fact that they were surely in a big hurry, don’t you think that the most logical way to see things is to supposed the Friday burial was done in the simplest way possible by dropping the corpse in a Shroud (without losing time to tight the body with strips of linen because they knew they had to anoint the body on Sunday morning), then put this loosely enshrouded corpse on a stone inside the tomb and then roll the rock to close the door of the tomb ? Personally, I don’t see any good and logical reason why they would have done something else that this basic pre burial rite on Friday. My way to see things is based on the Gospel accounts and backed up by many evidences that are present on the Shroud. By the way, to me, the fact that the Shroud can back up so well the Gospel accounts is another very important aspect that comforts his authenticity..","date":"2012-03-14","mins":"3:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"},{"id":"comment-9481","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If you look carefully at the Shroud Ron, you’ll notice pretty easily that the burial was most probably done in haste, just like it is said in the gospels….","date":"2012-03-20","mins":"4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"},{"id":"comment-9491","author":"yannick_clément","post":"If you consider that the body wasn’t washed, it is pretty evident that the burial was done in haste.

The main thing is the fact I don’t believe one second in the so called “spy clues” that could be present in this Gospel… I really don’t think John was writing a document for the CIA ! Of course, there’s often a second level of understanding in a text like that and we cannot take every line in a strick literal way (just like we cannot take every lines of a text like the “Narratio of Imagine Edessena” or the sermon of Gregory Referendarius in a stick literal way !!! The fact is that those texts are full of spiritual teaching and are not “historic books” in the modern sense). Nevertheless, I have a hard time to convince myself that John wanted to let his Christian readers know about the presence of body images on the Shroud of Christ, while using a coded language. In my mind, Dreisbach had a very good imagination… I have a completely different point of view on this topic and I even think that the most logical way to translate the word “Sudarium” used by John in both chapters (chapters 11 and 12) is by using the word “Shroud”. Yes, along with some researchers (but definately not the majority of them, I know), I think that John was talking about the “Shroud” when he wrote “Sudarium”… We have an infinite number of examples in ancient greek texts where words like “sudarium” and “sindon” would mean the same thing. Why not for the Gospel of John ? For a second, just try to change the word “Sudarium” in both chapters by using the word “Shroud” instead. You’ll see that both texts then take a completely different light !!! It’s a very interesting hypothesis that, as I say, don’t come from me, but that I agree with, particularly because of the chapter 11, which takes a much more logical sense when you think that Lazarus came out with a Shroud instead of just a face cloth… Effectively, if John really mean “face cloth” by using the word “Sudarium”, why in the world the dead had to be tied up with linen strips ??? Makes no sense ! Also, I always thought (and this was even reported by some “shroudies”) that the use of a Sudarium was only prescribes when the victim died of a violent death (with blood flowing out of the body) !!! Now, as I know, Lazarus died of a disease, not of a violent death !!! Why using a Sudarium in the case of a “natural” death like that (with, most probably, no blood flowing out of the body) ??? That’s just my personnal interpretation but, as I say, I can back up this point of view with the opinion of some serious researchers… I don’t think we can discard this hypothesis easily..","date":"2012-03-27","mins":"5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/paper-chase-lazarus-jesus-by-kim-dreisbach/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase:  “Lazarus & Jesus . . . “ by Kim Dreisbach"},{"id":"comment-14226","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Read Maurus Green’s article about that.

So, just with this example, you can see that it’s very risky to take these choices of words as it was really a precise physical description of the cloth… It’s the same thing for the choice of words to describe the real Shroud of Christ. In many ancient texts, the writer used the word “sudarium” instead of “sindon” ! In other words, these ancient writers were often using many different terms to describe the same relic (like I said, precision was not important for them) and, based solely on these choices of words, no one can really pretend to get a clear and precise physical description of a relic. In the end, you got to put these words in the context of the legendary text where we found them and, for the Image of Edessa linked to the Abgar legend, no doubt that the vast majority of text refers to only the image of the face of Christ and, on that base, we have to assume that this relic was not a very big cloth. In fact, that’s precisely what “Mandylion (from the arab “Mandyl”) mean !

In that context, no way you can make a direct link between this large cloth and the Shroud of Turin ! Here’s the part of Damascene’s manuscript where we found the word “large cloth” (the translation from the greek manuscript is from Guscin) : “Abgar, kind of the city of Edessa, sent an artist to paint the Lord’s image but could not do so because of the shining brilliance of his face. The Lord therefore placed a large cloth on his divine and life giving face wipe his own imprint onto it.

How in the world a “large outer cloak” can measure 4 meters long my friend ? This is a very bad extrapolation that you did about that… And for the alternative versions of the Abgar legend referring to a complete image of the body of Christ, I only know these manuscript : 1 Codex Vossianus Latinus Q69, dated from the 10th or 11th century and 2 “Historia Ecclesiastica” by Orderic Vital, dated of around 1141. There’s a third one writen by Gervase of Tilbury, dated of around 1210, but the reference of a complete image found in that one is just a copy of the story found in the manuscript of Orderic Vital, so I don’t count this one as really a third reference… 3 notes about these references : 1 On the literary corpus that refer to the Abgar legend, they represent one tiny part in front of a very vast majority of manuscript that talk about a small cloth showing only the face of the living Christ in a context that is always located BEFORE the Passion of Christ. If someone really wants to only keep these 2 references as being true physical descriptions of the Mandylion, he has to throw a great amount of manuscripts to the garbage (those that don’t refer at all to a full length image) and I’m sorry, but acting like that is NOT the good way to do History ! When 99% of the manuscripts talked about a small cloth bearing just the image of the face of the living Christ, I don’t think it’s correct to forget about them and just focus your attention on these 2 references ! 2 These 2 references to the image of a full length body NEVER talk about the presence of injuries or blood, along with the body image and they don’t seem to refer to a double full length image, ventral and dorsal. When you read these references, you really have a sense that the authors refer only to a frontal image. 3 These few references are all found in a legendary kind of text that is most probably using images to teach a theological message linked with the dogma of the Incarnation of Christ. In that context, no one can’t used them as a real precise description of the Mandylion… It’s only when you use bad speculations and extrapolations that you can see a description of the Shroud there.

I just finished the reading of the paper « Response to Jackson » written by William Meacham (you can read it here : http://freepages.religions.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wmeacham/response.htm) and was very happy to read one particular quote from him about the hypothesis of John Jackson concerning the 8 fold marks on the Shroud. I dedicate this quote particularly to Ron, who seem to be a pretty good fan of this very suggestive (in consequence, not very scientific) hypothesis !!! You can find this quote in page 1 of Meacham paper. Note : the context is that of an infamous speech given by Jackson in Turin, where he was defending the 2002 restoration… Here is the quote : “I merely cut out of his speech (note: he talks about) a vague and meaningless bit (even more meaningless after translation into Italian), PLUS SOME WAFFLING ON ABOUT HIS 8 FOLD THEORY THAT HE THINKS CHALLENGES THE C 14 DATING (A TOTALLY LAUGHABLE NOTION).” Note: If you have a good brain, it’s easy to see that Meacham completely disagree with this hypothesis of Jackson concerning the dating of the Shroud and, by extrapolation, the Mandylion’s hypothesis… Coming from one of the Shroud researchers I respect the most in all the Shroud world, that quote was like a bit of fresh air to me ! I said to myself : Now I know why I respect him so much: because he, like me, has no fear to tell what he really think without any political consideration ! I’ve always admired people who tell what they really believe to be the truth and no doubt that William Meacham is one of them. Sadly, there’s not enough people with balls like that in the Shroud world… And the rest of this paper go on like that ! He speaks freely and without any fear and tell us what he think of Jackson’s acting in Turin after the restoration. I’m 100% convinced that he is one of the few who had the guts to react that way (i.e. Publicly, with passion) back then !!! Bravo Meacham ! Keep on speaking loud and true !!! And concerning the paper written by Wilson for the Hong Kong conference on the Shroud in 1986 (you can read it here: http://freepages.religions.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wmeacham/wilson1.pdf), it’s interesting to note what he said, near the end, concerning this 8 folds hypothesis of Jackson. Of course, Wilson defend it, but it’s very interesting nevertheless to note that even a guy like him (who is a king of speculative arguments) had no choice to recognise that, in reality, there is just one of the 8 folds that Jackson claim to see that is really visible on the cloth without any doubt. I’m sorry folks but one evident fold mark present at a distance of nearly 1/8 of the length of the Shroud is far from being a proof (or just even a good clue) that the hypothesis of Wilson concerning the Mandylion is correct (or just to think that the Shroud is really older than the C 14 result of 1988) !!! Again, this is just a very sad example of a hypothesis concerning the Shroud that rest almost uniquely on speculations, extrapolations and special assumptions in order to, evidently, defend a religious agenda. Of course, this is not at all this way that any good science should be done (in hard science fields like chemistry or physics, as well as other fields like history). But sadly, in the Shroud science these days, it seem to almost be the norm !!! I’m sure there’s still some real scientists who work on the Shroud without having a religious agenda hidden in the back of their head, but I’m also sure they form a very thin minority….","date":"2012-07-24","mins":"5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers"},{"id":"comment-13949","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Ron, the simple fact that you didn’t even look at my 22 arguments against Wilson’s hypothesis prove my point of the other day that you should look at yourself in a mirror before accusing me of being close minded ! ; ) Here in Quebec, I’m sure you know how we call the English Canadians (particularly the Ontarians)… Square heads !

But at least, it is based on some textual evidences, even if some of them have been put into doubt. But in the end, this hypothesis seem to be more logical in the context of the 1204 sack of Constantinople. And now, for the Mandylion hypothesis, I would really loved to see the pictural evidence you talk about Ron !!! Don’t you know that there’s NO, I repeat NO artistic copies of the Mandylion that show Christ face has a dead, beaten man, full of blood stains like we see on the Shroud ! A copy like that simply doesn’t exist my friend. As I said, I’ve just completed a long review of many historians articles or books (like Scavone, Poulle in France and Guscin) on the subject and came to the conclusion that this hypothesis look like a castle of cards since there’s so much problems attach to it ! As I say : when you really know every ancient sources relate to this subject, one need a great deal of FAITH to still believe this hypothesis is correct. In fact, during my research, I’ve came up with 11 importan problems relate to it ! ELEVEN ! Not just one or two, ELEVEN ! Of course, in the pro Shroud circle, all we ear is the good side of the medal and we never heard about all those problems relate to this hypothesis… I repeat : it’s like a castle of cards to me because of it’s great fragility. Just an example : in MANY lists of relics written by eye witnesses who visited Constantinople from the end of the 11th century until 1204, we can read, in the same list, a mention of a shroud of Christ AND a mention of the Mandylion ! The only way Wilson and his supporters have been able to deal with this “contradiction” was to make believe that the Mandylion mentionned in those list is a simple copy of the original to perpetuate the Abgar legend and the Shroud mention there is in fact, the authentic Mandylion now unfold ! And what is highly important to note here is the FACT that Wilson and others based this SPECULATIVE idea (that seem to be there only to defend this hypothesis) is NOT BASED at all a reliable documentary source. NOT A SINGLE ONE ! WE GOT HERE ANOTHER PERFECT EXAMPLE OF PURE SPECULATION BRING ON IN ORDER TO DEFEND A WEAK HYPOTHESIS. If we use Occam razor to analyse the presence of those numerous lists of relics, the simplest conclusion we can draw from those lists is that, from the end of the 11th century (at least) until 1204, there was a Shroud of Christ in Constantinople, ALONG with the Mandylion ! In the end, what I’m disgust with is not Ian Wilson personally (he’s free to sell what he wants and I’m free to disagree with his ideas) but it’s more the non critical mind of a lot of people in the Pro Shroud world that REALLY bugs me ! Those people seem to consider this “weak” hypothesis (from my perspective and my researches) as it was a well accepted scientific theory ! As I said, outside the Pro Shroud world, it is FAR from being true ! But nevertheless, everytime I heard an interview about the Shroud or a TV documentary, they always talk about this hypothesis as if it was a well accepted theory that is surely correct… That’s what bugs me a lot ! Many Pro Shroud people wants so much the Shroud to be confirmed as the authentic burial cloth of Christ that they put aside their critical judgement when it comes to those kind of Pro Shroud hypothesis… The same critical judgement they used when it comes to anti Shroud hypothesis and ideas ! It’s sad but it’s true ! I say to those people : please, before thinking an hypothesis is good, read A LOT on the subject. Go to the sources !

Since we’re far from this moment, I don’t have to lose time with any supernatural hypothesis. This is how science should work : try first every possible natural hypothesis. I’m sorry but it is IMPOSSIBLE that a dead body can emit a powerful UV light, a Corona discharge (except for the VERY VERY thin possibility that an earthquake could have caused it) or any form of radiation, unless there was some kind of a miraculous event that would have produced a burst of energy like that. But the problem with this Hollywoodian scenario, is the fact that there’s nothing to support it in the STURP data, or in the gospels accounts, or in the official Catholic theology (I’m a Catholic, so I listen to the teaching of my religion even if I don’t always agree with everything)… So, I’ll just wait for some natural hypothesis to be tested first. And we have to understand that it’s not because one phenomenon is still unknown that it come necessarily from a direct act of God, even if the Shroud is supposed to be the one of Christ ! Now, for the testimony of Robert de Clari, it is possible that he didn’t saw the linen and the tile, but what do you do of the FACT that some 40 years later, saint Louis, the Kind of France bought many relics from Beaudoin II, the latin emperor of Constantinople and, in the official list of relics that were sold, Beaudoin wrote the same thing that de Clari had describe, namely a linen and a tile ! So, it’s wrong to supposed that the reliquaries that de Clari saw was empty (if he didn’t saw the relics themselves) !!!! Do you see the King of France paying big money to buy some empty reliquaries Ron ? Really ? Doesn’t make sense. Sorry. And the thing is that most historian agrees that this duo of relics was in fact the Mandylion and the Keramion from the Abgar legend. And if we used the Occam razor principle, we have to conclude that the probability that those historian are correct rank high in a probabilistic scale. In fact, no other relic from the east have ever been associated with a tile, except the Mandylion (with the Keramion). That’s not a supposition, that’s an historical fact ! The problem with this Mandylion hypothesis is the fact that, to work, you really need to make A LOT of special assumptions with his contrary to the Occam razor principle. So, it’s only when an historian REALLY WANT this hypothesis to be correct that he’ll used and defend all those special assumptions, extrapolations, speculations, etc. It’s a sad acknowledgement I know, but it’s true. And in this context, who do you think will bring this hypothesis forward and defend it (almost blindly, without considering all the numerous contradictions that this hypothesis have to face) ??? THE PRO SHROUD HISTORIANS OF COURSE !!!!!! Poulle seemed to believe the Shroud could be genuine, but as a professional historian, he had to stick to the sources. After a long inquiry of all the ancient sources he could find on the subject, he came to the conclusion that the Mandylion could not have been the Shroud of Turin folded in 8. Of course, this is only his personal conclusion but after I read a lot on the subject and made a little inquiry of mine, I share completely is point of view. The most probable road that the Mandylion took after the sack of Constantinople is the Sainte Chapelle in Paris (came there around 1241 or 1242) and this relic stayed there until the french revolution of 1789 when it was lost (along with the tile). So, if the Mandylion was kept all this time in Paris, then we have to conclude that the Shroud and the Mandylion are 2 separate relics. Period. You know what the bottomline if regarding the ancient history of the Shroud : THERE’S NO DIRECT REFERENCE IN ANCIENT SOURCES OF THE PRESENCE OF A SHROUD OF CHRIST (OR JUST BURIAL LINENS, AS A MATTER OF FACT) IN THE CITY OF EDESSA !!! THIS IS AN HISTORICAL FACT. NO DIRECT REFERENCE AT ALL. THERE’S NOTHING IN ANCIENT SOURCES TO SUPPORT ANY CLAIM THAT THE SHROUD OF CHRIST COULD HAVE BEEN KEPT ONE MINUTE IN EDESSA. Of course, having said that, I have to also say that doesn’t mean that the Shroud of Turin was never kept in this city but THERE’S NO DIRECT REFERENCE IN ANCIENT SOURCE TO SUPPORT THIS POSSIBILITY. If we check all the ancien sources before 1350 (when the “official” history of the Shroud begins in Lirey, France), we can retrace some references to the presence of a Shroud of Christ in Jerusalem, in the Jordan valley in Palestine, in Constantinople and in Athena, but none, I mean absolutely none for the city of Edessa. This is the reality Ron ! I don’t invent anything here. I report an historical fact. That’s all. Now, you do what you want with this information ! Now, regarding my english, you have to forget the mistakes I still make because I’m not 100% bilingual. But I’m sure I speak better english than you can talk french !!! ; ) In Canada, it seem that we (the French) are destinate to always accomodate you (the English). You just have to go to Montreal to understand what I mean. Every person who speak english in Montreal will meet a lot of Quebecers who will force themselves to speak english just to accomodate the newcomer. It’s rare that the english will force himself to speak a little of french instead ! We are a nation that was conquered and we can see it in a situation like that… That was my Canadian editorial of the day ! : ) For the numerous copies of the Mandylion, the FACT is that there’s not a single copy that look like a burial cloth like the Shroud. Not a single one. No copies show some blood stains. No copies show some bruises. Zero. And more than that, there’s not one single reference that we can found in ancient sources that make a DIRECT reference saying that the Mandylion was actually a burial cloth. No reference. Zero. Here, I have to say it again : This is the reality Ron ! I don’t invent anything here. I report an historical fact. That’s all. Now, you do what you want with this information ! Don’t you found this strange that Wilson, Scavone, Dubarle and other defenders of this hypothesis (remember that it is just an hypothesis and not an accepted theory by the majority of the historians) NEVER mention those NUMEROUS DISCREPENCIES when they talk about the Mandylion ???

And nowhere at all, in any ancient document, there is a direct allusion of the Mandylion as a BURIAL cloth. No direct allusion at all that talk about that. There is even no evasive allusion that could be interpret that way. And you can believe me when I say that there was many lists of relics that talk about a cloth with a facial image of Christ AND a burial shroud (often mention along other burial cloths – possibly strips of linen that would have come from the empty tomb along with the Shroud). The most important mention like that (because of it’s clarity) is the testimony of Robert de Clari (a french knight of the 4th crusade that took part in the sacking of the city in 1204). One year before the sack, in 1203, this guy saw the Shroud of Christ (with an image of the whole body on it) that was exposed every friday in the church of Our Lady of Blachernes (he most probably saw the Shroud of Turin) and, in the church of the Virgin of the Pharos (where the majority of Christ relics were normally kept), he saw a linen cloth with a tile (clearly the Mandylion because the tile that he mentionned was often directly related to the Mandylion in many versions of the Abgar legend). This tile was named “the Keramion” (ancient greek term that can mean a vessel or something similar) in the Abgar legend. Also, did you know that, in 1247, saint Louis, the great kind of France, complete a deal with the Latin emperor of Constantinople, Beaudoin II (another frenchman) for the selling of 22 relics (mostly directly related to Christ) ? It’s another very important part of the puzzle ! In the official listing of the relics include in this great deal (the emperor was in need of money in order to keep on his war against the Greek and the Bulgars), there is a direct mention of the 2 relics (the linen cloth with the tile) that Robert de Clari said he had seen in the church of the Virgin of the Pharos in 1203. It’s almost sure that this pair of relics that was bought by saint Louis is the same that de Clari had seen 44 years earlier in Constantinople, and it’s almost sure that this was the Mandylion, along with his tile. As I said, there’s no other relics of Christ that was ever associate with a tile. So, there’s a very great probability that this duo cloth tile was in fact the Mandylion along with the Keramion. If it is so (the probability is very good), then we can be sure that the Shroud was a different relic than the Mandylion because, during the time this duo of relics (Mandylion Keramion) was in the Sainte Chapelle in Paris (from 1247 until 1789), we know for a fact that the Shroud of Turin was kept elsewhere. Unfortunatelly, this duo of relics was lost during the french revolution of 1789 and we will never be 100% sure about the fact that it really was the Mandylion and the Keramion but the chances are VERY GOOD. Again, using Occam razor in this case, it is more likely that this tandem of relics was really the Mandylion and the Keramion and not mere copies of originals. Why we can be so confident about that ? Because of the testimony of Robert de Clari that I told you about, and also, because saint Louis paid a very high price for those relics in 1247. In fact, he even pay them twice ! In 1242, he paid some sort of a rent. And then in 1247, he finalized the deal with the emperor with another payment. Also, before the first deal of 1242, he send some men of confidence to make sure that the relics he was about to bought were authentic. In this historic context, it is VERY unlikely that saint Louis would have accepted to buy a false relic (a copy of the original) for a high amount of money. You can read for yourself many interesting informations about saint Louis and his relics deal with the emperor of Constantinople here : http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n56part5.pdf The author, Barta, like me, believe that this tandem of relics was really the Mandylion and the Keramion and, starting from there, if it’s true, then the Shroud cannot be the same relic as the Mandylion… All that is just a small amount of problems that the hypothesis of Ian Wilson has to face ! And to resolve those particular problems, all Wilson (and his followers) can do, is use speculations, suppositions, extrapolations, not based at all on a real and solid documentary source. Sorry, but the few problems I just mentionned in this comment are based on true and reliable documentary sources… It’s not a simple view of the mind ! It’s not something I just invent ! It’s something that is well written in many ancient document. Meditate on that. Again, I want to state it clearly : it’s not because there’s not a solid ancient history for the Shroud prior to the middle of the 10th century (in my opinion) that the Shroud true age is not 2000 years old. There’s many possible explanation that can be logical to explain why there’s no solid documentary sources for the Shroud before 958. So, don’t feel too upset if I’m right about the idea that the Mandylion hypothesis is probably incorrect. That don’t mean at all that the Shroud is not genuine..","date":"2012-01-01","mins":"11:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/30/paper-chase-dan-scavones-besancon-presentation-at-ohio-2008/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Dan Scavone’s Besancon Presentation at Ohio 2008"},{"id":"comment-6322","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Excellent comment.

For my bias about the UV thing, it’s simple : I follow the laws of nature and I’m fully aware that it’s impossible (in our universe at least) that a dead body can emit a powerful light like that ! ; ) That’s it. If keeping your feet on the ground and be rational can be considered as having a bias, then I have one and I’m proud of it ! That simply prove that I don’t fly high in the sky. Here’s my point of view on this question : I don’t believe it is scientifically “correct” or “fair” to look at supernatural hypothesis for image formation (like Fanti’s Corona Discharge or Di Lazzaro’s UV lasers) while science have not made a complete check up of every possible natural hypothesis (done in every possible configurations and every possible set up that we can imagine regarding a first century burial). Why ? Simply because a supernatural hypothesis is, by definition, not scientific in nature ! And the fact is that science has still a lot of work to do in order to test every possible natural possibilities. Until that will be completely done (we’re not there yet), I just don’t see why we should even consider supernatural possibilities. If the Shroud would be that of Julius Cesar, NOBODY would even think for a second that the body images on it have been produce by some flash of light ! And, by the way, Di Lazzaro and his team were not able to obtain a good result of coloration with a single instantaneous laser shot, did you knew that ? This fact don’t fit very well with the Hollywood scenario of an instant flash of light coming from the body at the moment of resurrection ! : ) Ron you wrote : “Do you see any markings on any of the Pantocrator icons?…case closed.” I don’t see the connexion. If the Mandylion and the Pantocrator are, like I think, copies from the Shroud, that don’t mean one second that the artist (or artists) who produced them wanted to do an exact replica of a dead Christ with a lot of blood stains ! In fact, we can see the opposite in the Pantocrator icon and we can supposed the opposite for the Mandylion (because of the copies we have today) : it really seemed that this artist (or those artists) wanted to produce the image of a LIVING Christ ! And it’s the very same thing for some bearded Christ frescos we can see in some Roman catacombs. That don’t mean the Shroud wasn’t the base for these artworks. Ron, you seem to forget one MAJOR and MOST IMPORTANT fact here : the period of time ! Effectively, before the 13th century, the mainstreem theological ideas didn’t fit well with a depiction of a suffering Christ full of blood and injuries. In fact, almost every crucifix before the 13th century showed a Living and triumphant Christ on the cross (with no blood or really evident injuries) ! Even the depiction of Christ entombment contained in the Pray manuscript (that date from 1192 to 1195) doesn’t show Christ with blood or injuries ! It’s an historical fact that we have to wait until the 13th century before there was a real theological current that emphasized the suffering Christ and his Passion. It was during that time that we saw the apparition of the way of the cross, of the Man of Sorrow icons, of bloody crucifix and things related to this (like the first stigmatized person : Francis of Assisi). And I personally think that this new current that started in Europe and spread out elsewhere in Christendom was initiated by the fact that the many crusaders from the 4th crusade (like Robert de Clari) could saw the actual Shroud of Turin there and probably spread the word that the image was that of a suffering Christ. This is just a personal feeling. But one thing’s for sure : during the 6th century, while the Mandylion and the Pantocrator first appeared in the east, the theological current was not at all in favor of a depiction of a dead and suffering Christ. Today, we would say that it wasn’t “politically correct” during that period of time, not until the beginning of the 13th century, just when the Shroud disappeared from Constantinople. I really think there’s a direct link here… It seem that during these days, the focus was much more on the resurrected Christ of Eastern morning than on the suffering and dying Christ of the Good Friday. So, in an historical context like that, IF the Pantocrator and the Mandylion were made by artists using the Shroud of Turin as a base for their artworks, it is totally understandable that they would have made the depiction of a LIVING CHRIST instead of a dead or suffering Christ. When we deal with historic topics, we always have to put ourselve in the context of the time we study. You also wrote : “I would also disagree with you that some renditions of the Mandylion do not have similar traits to the face seen on the Shroud, this is definately untrue and you have to be near blind not to see them.” I don’t know where you took this idea my friend ! I NEVER wrote that ! In fact, here’s what I wrote in another post for another topic : “I think the Mandylion and the Pantocrator icons were all artistic works based on the real Shroud. I think it’s the most probable possibility to explain all the points of congruence we can see in the Pantocrators icons and also in the Mandylion copies we still have today.” So you can see that the hypothesis I favored the most is that the Mandylion was a copy made directly from the Shroud but with one major difference : the artist was doing a portrait of a Living Christ instead of a dead man (most probably because of the reason I just explain, i.e. Because of the theological context of that time). Quote : “Robert de Clari mentions no such ’tile’ you talk of Yannick, read his statement again.” Here my friend, you are in error ! Here’s what Scavone wrote about de Clari’s description : “Clari also saw elsewhere, in the relic treasury of the Pharos Church of the imperial palace (that treasury in Mesarites’ care two years prior), the two tabulae or cases which supposedly contained the famous Edessa towel (touaile) and the imaged tile (tiule).” By the way, if you want to have a complete look at all the lists of relics we have from Constantinople, you can read the article post online by Scavone but, since his article is full of bias in favor of Wilson’s hypothesis, I don’t recommand to make a big deal of his comments. Here’s the article (I’ve already post it here) : http://www.shroudstory.com/scavone/scavone1.htm He made a complete check up of all the ancient sources that talk about a burial Shroud of Christ (and/or burial linens in plural) and/or a towel we can easily associate with the Mandylion (accompany sometimes by a tile we can easily associate with the Keramion). I’ve made the same full check up than him about all those ancient sources and came up with a totally different conclusion ! And I have to say that my conclusion is pretty much the same as the conclusion drawn by the late Emmanuel Poulle, a very good historian from France, even if I wasn’t aware of his work at the beginning of my reflection on this subject. In fact, when I came across his work, I was really surprise by the closeness of his conclusion on the subject versus mine. Quote : “Don’t worry Yannick, I won’t get upset, but isn’t it a little premature or a little arrogant to say you are right, in your assumption?” I don’t know if I’m arrogant by being confident in my analysis (even if recognize I’m not an historian). All I know is that authentic historians like Poulle in France think like me on this topic, so I have a tendancy to think I’m not so off track. In fact, think about that fact Ron : the only historians that really favored this hypothesis are those that came from inside the Pro Shroud circles like Scavone and Guscin (even if he’s much more prudent than Scavone in his final judgement). Outside the Pro Shroud circles, the vast majority of historians are not at all fanatics or defenders of this hypothesis ! In fact, those historians are largely AGAINST this hypothesis. This simple fact doesn’t tell you something Ron ??? It should… Never underestimate the dangers of bias when it come to this subject. Many people seemed to be so unsure about the fact that the Shroud is authentic (surely because of the C14 dating of 88) that they tend to blindly favored this hypothesis and simply see what they wants to see in ancient sources to make believe that the Shroud have a clear history from the first century all the way until today. The reality is much more complex than this and the probability is high that the “unofficial” history of the Shroud will never be known for sure. But again, that doesn’t mean one bit that the Shroud is not genuine….","date":"2012-01-03","mins":"10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/30/paper-chase-dan-scavones-besancon-presentation-at-ohio-2008/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Dan Scavone’s Besancon Presentation at Ohio 2008"},{"id":"comment-6321","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Personally, I think the most “solid” hypothesis that exist today is the one Scavone prefer, i.e. The one of Othon de la Roche, simply because it has some solid documentary bases, on the contrary of the Templar hypothesis who only used extrapolations, suppositions, speculations, etc. I always tend to prefer the hypothesis that gets the most solid factual base. But, at the same time, I completely disagree with Scavone about the Mandylion hypothesis. He defend the ideas of Ian Wilson almost blindly. The best proof of that can be found here : http://www.shroudstory.com/scavone/scavone1.htm But after I’ve made a deep study of the documentary sources (for an upcoming article I’m currently co writing with a frenchman for his website dedicate to the Shroud), I came up to the conclusion that this hypothesis got so much problems attach to it that the chances for it to be true are VERY LOW, nevermind what most of the “pro authenticity” historians and pro authentiticy people in general think. In fact, you know what I really think ? I think all we can say with some good probability is that the Shroud was probably in Constantinople at least from the end of the 11th century and maybe the 10th century. Before that ? Very good question. In the present state of our historical knowledge, I really believe this question is left wide open and personally, I wouldn’t feel confortable to propose one single hypothesis that could answer it properly. I think nobody can. I fact, for the moment, all we’re left with is extrapolations, suppositions, speculations, etc. In science (whatever the field), when you rely on things like that, you walk in a VERY dangerous territory ! Unfortunatelly, Wilson have used plenty of those extrapolations, suppositions, speculations to build his Mandylion hypothesis and almost everybody in the Shroud world (all pro authenticity) have believe him ! I just remember people that it is NOT the same at all when you walk outside the pro authenticity circle of the Shroud where a bunch of historians have been really critical about this hypothesis… After having said that, I just want to clearly state that it doesn’t mean that the Shroud is not authentic. It mean that his ancient history is all but clear ! In fact, the most prudent thing is to say that it is still unknown… I wrote all this about the Mandylion because I want to make a parallel betweem Wilson hypothesis and the ENEA’s experiments and results.

I think the footnote #23 of my recent paper (the one Andy helped me to translate in English by the way !) could help to understand the particular context of Jesus burial versus the normal Roman procedure that was applied in most parts of the Roman empire at the time. Here it is : “In his article Crucifixion in Antiquity – The anthropological evidence, renowned archaeologist Joe Zias states: “Giving the victim a proper burial following death on the cross, during the Roman period was rare and in most cases simply not permitted in order to continue the humiliation. Thus the victim was in many cases simply thrown on the garbage dump of the city…” (http://www.joezias.com/Crucifixion Antiquity.html). It’s interesting to note that the same conclusion can also be found in the excellent article Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion, written by Matthew W. Maslen and Piers D. Mitchell. On the other hand, we have to understand that the description given by Zias and taken by Maslen and Mitchell concerning the Roman practice in general, and it is truly possible that the procedure could have been different in Palestine at the time of Jesus. In the documentary The Wonder of the Shroud, Fr. Martin Haigh, quoting the book The New Testament and Rabinnic Judaism, written by the distinguished Jewish writer David Daube, states that the normal procedure in Palestine during the first century A.D. Was to throw the body of crucified victims into a common grave and only after a year, the family was hallowed to collect the bones (in order to place them in an ossuary and bury them in a family tomb). We can also a very similar description in the book La Passion de Jésus : De Gethsémani au Sépulcre, written by Jean Maurice Clercq, a French doctor, but with an interesting precision, i.e. That this very particular procedure came from a description that is found in the Talmud, which is a text written after the time of Jesus. Personal note: no matter if the correct procedure at the time of Jesus was the one described by Zias, Maslen and Mitchell or the one described by Daube and Clercq, we must always assume that, under Roman law, it wasn’t a normal procedure to allow a condemned person (Jew or other) to be buried in a clean burial shroud after his execution by crucifixion. That can explain why the Gospels emphasised the fact that Joseph of Arimathea had to ask permission to Pilate to take the corpse of Jesus in order to give him a decent burial. That can also explain the presence of a post mortem wound in the side of the man of the Shroud… Effectively, this type of post mortem injury to the chest was surely done by one of those who were in charge of the crucifixion to make sure the victim was really dead. This kind of post mortem procedure is logical only in the case a “special” permission was given to take the body, in order to give him a decent burial.”.","date":"2012-08-29","mins":"7:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/29/paper-chase-distinctive-features-of-the-shroud-that-have-yet-to-be-explained-and-their-correlation-with-historical-jesus-research/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: distinctive features of the Shroud that have yet to be explained and their correlation with Historical Jesus research."},{"id":"comment-15580","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Concerning the aragonite evidence Dave, I don’t think you should have so much reservations… I don’t see any good reason to doubt the good match that was found between the sample taken on the Shroud and the sample taken inside a tomb in Jerusalem, really..","date":"2012-08-29","mins":"7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/29/paper-chase-distinctive-features-of-the-shroud-that-have-yet-to-be-explained-and-their-correlation-with-historical-jesus-research/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: distinctive features of the Shroud that have yet to be explained and their correlation with Historical Jesus research."},{"id":"comment-15605","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I think the Romans were very good not to offend the population they conquered.

Interesting proposal. Of course, the first and most important question that should be asked versus this particular hypothesis is : Why there doesn’t seem to exist one particular document in France that describe, without any confusion, the presence of a long burial shroud of Christ in the Sainte Chapelle. Effectively, to my knowledge, the only thing that come close to this is the expression “a portion of the Shroud of Christ” or something like this… And the second question (equally important) is : How in the world did Geoffroy de Charny would have been given this very precious relic while it was much more common for the King to only give tiny portions of one particular relic when he wanted to make a gift to a friend or an ally king?.","date":"2013-07-13","mins":"7:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/11/paper-chase-the-shroud-of-turins-missing-years/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: The Shroud of Turin’s Missing Years"},{"id":"comment-3656","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Thanks alot !

So, it is truly possible that all that Saint Louis could have bought from Baudouin II in 1247 was the remaining strips of linen (or some other small linen cloths associated with the Passion of Christ), while the main Shroud was long gone from Constantinople (maybe quietly kept at that moment in Othon de la Roche’s Castle of Ray sur Saône in France)..","date":"2013-07-15","mins":"9:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/11/paper-chase-the-shroud-of-turins-missing-years/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: The Shroud of Turin’s Missing Years"},{"id":"comment-39041","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Sindon is a latin word that can mean many things Matthias.

This is another very good example of how poorly the historical researches concerning the Shroud are often done… Nevertheless, it should be noted that, in both cases, the words used refers to small cloths and both “Spargana” and “Fascia” can be used to describe strips of linen. On the contrary, no matter what’s the correct reference (Scavone or Crispino), in no cases, we can honestly translate one of these words as meaning “a burial shroud” or “a long piece of linen” or something like that.

Also, in the endnotes of Crispino’s paper, she give us a pretty good fact that can be used against the idea that the whole Shroud was once kept in the Sainte Chapelle of Paris! Concerning the reference of the Bishop of Mende who wrote that a “Tars Sindonis” was present in the chapel, Crispino wrote an endnote (#11) saying that “it is not known what happened to this relic after the French Revolution. The reliquary with the label still exists but the receptacle is empty”. So, taking this fact into account, we can conclude that if this relic was present inside the Sainte Chapelle up until the French Revolution of 1789, it is then impossible that this cloth was the Shroud that was exposed in Lirey, France after the middle of the 14th century! This is pure logic! Also, the fact that the reliquary of this “Tars Sidonis” (note: I would really like to know if the label used these same words to describe the relic that was once kept in the reliquary or if a different term was used) is still present today in the Sainte Chapelle is another very strong argument against the idea that this cloth could have been the same Shroud that ended up in Lirey during the 14th century! Effectively, in the case this relic would have been the real Shroud and if the king of France would have given this Shroud to Geoffroy de Charny before his death in 1356, it’s EVIDENT that he would have also given him the reliquary! Seriously, when we take into account all the different terms that were used to described the piece of cloth that was sold by Baudouin II to Saint Louis, kind of France in 1247 (i.e., the lists of relics written by Nicolas of Otranto, the one written by Nicolas Idruntino, the one written by Baudouin II himself and the description of the Bishop of Mende), we must conclude that this cloth was most probably another cloth or cloths (probably small, maybe some strips of linen) associated with the main Shroud of Christ or simply a tiny portion of this main Shroud, which would have been preserved in the Pharos Chapel during the sack of Constantinople of 1204, while the main Shroud (which was exposed instead in the Blachernes Church, if we believe the testimony of Robert de Clari) was probably taken away to the West by the French crusaders (maybe in the hands of Othon de la Roche). Note : Cesar Barta make one comparative analysis between the fabric of the Shroud of Turin and the fabric of one tiny fragment of the cloth that was bought by Saint Louis, which was given to the Cathedral of Toledo by the king and show us that both cloths were different, on the base of their weaving styles, which is another strong argument against the hypothesis of Crispino that the main Shroud was once kept in the Sainte Chapelle of Paris. Note: If someone could give us the exact dimensions of the reliquary that was used to kept the “Tars sindonis” in the Sainte Chapelle of Paris, that would greatly help to confirm my conclusion. Effectively, if this “Tars sindonis” was really small or if it was composed of many small cloths or many strips of linen, then we must assume that the reliquary in question is also quite small… So, if anyone knows the dimension of this reliquary, please let us know! I really think that an expert should go to the Sainte Chapelle and make some researches on the subject. Maybe some interesting information and answers could still be found there, even today….","date":"2013-07-15","mins":"8:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/11/paper-chase-the-shroud-of-turins-missing-years/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: The Shroud of Turin’s Missing Years"},{"id":"comment-38992","author":"yannick_clément","post":"You went in the Sainte Chapelle ?

I just know that “sindonis” can be translate as “shroud” as well as many other generic terms for “cloth” but I don’t know the meaning of “tars”. Would be nice if someone could bring us the correct answer. In the end, I don’t think we can consider this mention from the Bishop of Mende (written in 1296) as a sure proof that there really was a long burial shroud of Christ kept in the Sainte Chapelle of Paris during those years… As I said, “sindonis” can mean a lot of things and if we put this mention in the context of the official list of relics written by Beaudouin II (which mention a “sudarii”, which can mean a portion of the shroud or a small cloth), I think this mention should be understand like this: there was surely a “cloth” associated with the burial of Christ in the Sainte Chapelle but there are not enough évidences to know if this cloth was long or small or if it was just simply a tiny portion of the original shroud (remember that there are 2 missing corners on the Shroud !). But, nevertheless, it would be nice to learn the exact meaning of “tars sindonis”.

So, I really think that the most rational way to understand the list of relics of Nicolas is to think that he was able to see the relics of Christ that have been preserved in the Pharos Chapel during the sack of Constantinople of 1204 and, among them, he saw the linen strips associated with the Shroud. Because of the word chosen (spargana), I really don’t think he saw the Shroud itself… And I think, on the contrary to Scavone’s free speculations, that the most rational place he could have seen these relics is in the Pharos Chapel of Constantinople in 1207 because we know for a fact that he visited that city in that year and we also know for a fact that all the relics he mention (and that he saw with his own eyes) were sold to Saint Louis king of France in 1247 ! And because of the very good concordance between Nicolas’ list of relics and the list of relics written by Beaudouin II which were sold to Saint Louis in 1247, I think there is a very good probability that the “spargana” seen by Nicolas were the same as the “sudarii” that was sold to Saint Louis and I really doubt that this could be the whole shroud… Effectively, these 2 words have much more chances to mean “small cloth (or cloths)” or “strips of linen” than a real long burial cloth.

In all the ancient historical sources that clearly indicate the presence of a shroud, NO ONE talk of the city of Edessa. This is a fact, but this fact seems, for an unknown reason, to be completely forgotten by Wilson and his fan club. This is a FACT that we have some ancient sources (very few) that talk about a the presence of a Shroud of Christ in Jerusalem. This is also a FACT that we have numerous ancient testimonies (like the ones of Nicolas Mesarites and Robert de Clari) that talk about the presence of a Shroud of Christ (or burial cloths in the plural) in Constantinople (ALONG WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE MANDYLION AND THE KERAMION, WHICH WERE 2 COMPLELY DIFFERENT RELICS, NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST). But I repeat it : there’s absolutely no ancient accounts to even suggest that a relic showing the bloody and beaten face of the Jesus of the Passion was kept even one single day in Edessa. THIS IS A FACT. In fact, on the base of ancient sources, the only 2 images of Christ that we can trace in Edessa are the Mandylion and the Keramion, and both were said to be images of only the face of the living Christ… In order to follow properly the scientific method, if we take all those facts into account, one good hypothesis would be to think that the Shroud of Christ (which is not clear if he really was the Shroud of Turin) went directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople, sometime between the beginning of the 8th century and 958. No reason to think Edessa would have been part of the journey of this Shroud of Christ. Absolutely no reason… And if you don’t think like that, it’s just because you don’t want to follow the FACTS where they lead you. By acting like that, someone just prove that he has no respect for the scientific method.

The fact is this : There’s foldmarks scattered everywhere on the cloth ! ; ) So, they can have been formed anywhere, anytime. And I’m sorry but Jackson published this in Shroud Spectrum International in the 80s and Wilson’s first book came out in 1978, before the STURP investigation. So, he was surely well aware of Wilson’s hypothesis at the time. For the blood, this is one of the dumbest thing I’ve ever read ! Like Barrie Schwortz once told me (and he was damn right !) : Bloodstains on a dead body doen’t project themself on a cloth, at a distance ! The bloodstains on the Shroud all came from DIRECT CONTACT between the cloth and the body and those who don’t agree with that are people who don’t understand well the blood transfer phenomenon that occured on the Shroud and that came from exudates of blood clots that were still humid to leave an imprint of themselves on the cloth (causing mirror images of these humid clots that were on the body). I’ve read the paper of Jackson about that and it was based on the fact that there are some bloodstains on the forearms of the man of the Shroud that are almost of the same color than the body image. It’s very thin to then pretend that they are also images of the same nature than the body image !!! If there is different colors (and physical aspects) in the bloodstains on the forearms, it just prove that the blood transfer wasn’t perfectly the same everywhere (the result of the direct transfer on the cloth wasn’t totally homogeneous) and, in fact, this is one more little clue that the Shroud is not the work of an artist ! In fact, that simply prove that there was some blood clots that were more humid on their surface than others at the time of the transfer on the cloth, causing slight differences of tones and physical aspects in the bloodstains of that region… That’s all ! We don’t need to call for some supernatural images of blood on the cloth in order to explain these small differences !!! For the last part of your comment, I just want you to read again carefully the last fact (fact #22) in my paper ! THAT’S SOLID SCIENCE and not speculation or extrapolation ! Adler didn’t found ANY NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCED AT ALL between a non image thread coming from the head region and other non image threads coming from 3 other parts of the cloth. Sorry but we don’t need speculation here to understand that the region of the face of the Shroud could not have been the only one exposed to air, dust and sunlight for centuries, since there’s absolutely no chemical or physical proofs of such an exposition. And even if the cloth would have been kept almost all the time inside a reliquary, it’s impossible that such an ancient reliquary could have been impermeable to the air (which is a natural oxidative element and a very good carrier for dust)… Much more than Jackson’s supposed foldmarks, there would have been some physical and chemical differences (more oxidation, more dirt, more dust, etc., etc.) FOR SURE between the face region and the rest of the cloth if Wilson’s hypothesis was correct. No doubt about that. This is called “a fact” my friend and sorry but that doesn’t leave any place for doubt.

Because of its nature, I think it’s rational to think that the relic was privately kept and hidden for a long time after the resurrection and when it falls into the hand of the Church, only some important members of the Clergy were aware of the real aspect of the inner part of the cloth and did their best to avoid that it would be publicly showed.

And now, guess what ? I’ve already found one more fact like that while reading the interesting book The Rape of the Turin Shroud, by William Meacham !!! Effectively, here’s what Meacham wrote in page 9 of his book : “There are, however, NUMEROUS PROBLEMS with a Shroud/Mandylion link (Cameron 1980), notably the difference in size, SEPARATE MENTION IN RELIC LISTS and the SILENCE of its eventual “revelation” as a burial cloth.” While I mentioned the first two big problems he talk about in this part of his book, I completely neglect the third one, which is an authentic HISTORICAL FACT. Context : if we believe Wilson’s hypothesis, just after the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople in August 944, that’s when some persons would have found that the Mandylion was not just a face cloth, but that it was instead a larger cloth showing at the very least an image of the chest (with the side wound) and the head of Christ (with bloodstains). Be the historical fact is this : After this arrival of the Mandylion (and this so called “discovery”), there is ABSOLUTELY NO WRITEN MENTION ANYWHERE stating clearly and specifically that the Mandylion was in fact a shroud (or a burial cloth) of Jesus Christ directly related with his Passion and death !!! Note : If we believe Wilson’s interpretation of some texts (followed closely by Scavone and Dubarle), this rapid finding would have been done by members of the Royal family (in a private showing of the relic with the future emperor Constantine VII being there) and also by members of the Byzantine Clergy (with Gregory Referendarius and his sermon). In fact, the most important thing to note is the FACT that there is no ancient document written after 944 that made a direct link between the Mandylion (and/or the Abgar legend) and a shroud (or burial cloth) of Christ (or his Passion and death on Good Friday), even if Wilson and others pro Shroud researchers declared that, on the first day of its arrival in Constantinople, there was already some persons who knew that the Mandylion was something else than a face cloth showing a living Christ without bloodstains. If Wilson’s hypothesis is correct, WHY IS THIS SO ??? It seems completely ludicrous to think that a very important finding like that (a finding by the way who would have been already announced publicly if we interpret the sermon of Gregory Referendarius like Wilson, Dubarle and Scavone) would have stayed in the dark afterward and never mentioned again (in detail and much more clearly) in other Byzantine texts written after. If we put ourselves in the historical context of the time, it is 100% SURE that a great finding like that would have been reported in many other manuscripts and liturgical texts by Byzantine writers. But the FACT is that there’s absolutely no clear mention of this so called “discovery” made in 944 in later ancient Byzantine texts, while there is a vast amount of ancient sources written afterward (many lists of relic in particular, most probably written by eye witnesses) that continue to describe the Mandylion has a small cloth bearing only the face of the living Christ (without any reference to his Passion and death or to the presence of injuries and/or bloodstains on the cloth). The literary evidence we can trace from the period between the end of the 10th century and the sack of Constantinople in 1204 make it totally inconceivable that there really was a great finding like that, i.e. A finding that would have give a clear proof that the Mandylion was in fact a burial cloth of Christ directly related to his Passion and death (this idea is based on personal interpretations from Wilson, Scavone, Dubarle, etc., all pro Shroud people, that were not followed by any real Byzantine scholars). In all logic, if Wilson’s hypothesis would be correct, we would have a bunch of ancient manuscripts that would talk about this most important finding in great details, but THAT’S NOT THE CASE AT ALL ! Meditate on that folks !!! From now on, I consider this FACT as the 23rd fact of my list !!! I still don’t know how I could have forget to talk about that before !!! At least, you got it now !!! And I have to say that I’m still convinced that if I keep searching, I will found other facts that will permit to question this very weak hypothesis of Ian Wilson even more. I’m really sorry for those who took this hypothesis for granted, but as I said, it’s not because the hypothesis of Wilson is most probably wrong that it means the Shroud is not the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth… It simply mean that we have to search elsewhere for a better (i.e., more rational) explanation.

No reference is make for the possible presence of blood and/or a body image on this shroud. After that, I have not seen one single reference to a shroud of Christ until 958 in Constantinople and then, there’s many references to a burial cloth of Christ like that (associated with his Passion) until the sack of Constantinople. But what is not easy is the fact that only the testimony of Robert de Clari from 1204 make a clear mention of the presence of a full length body image on it. So, did the shroud mentioned in a letter of the emperor Constantine VII in 958 is the same that is mentioned by Robert de Clari in 1204 ? Again, it’s impossible to tell without making speculations. Personally, in the light of all the existing references we have, I don’t think that it is possible to draw a proper hypothesis for the obscure years of the Shroud. But having said that, I want also to state that I agree totally with Paul Vignon on this topic : all the Pantocrator icons and all the Holy faces images (like the Mandylion and the Keramion) presents too much similarities with the image of the Shroud to be due to hasard. And that lead Vignon to conclude that all these images (note that they’re all image of the LIVING Christ without bloodstains or injuries) come, directly or indirectly, from the image on the Shroud. In other words, all these images of the living Christ are based, directly or not, on the image that we see on the Shroud. And for Vignon, and for me, that was enough to prove that the Shroud was present in the Near East, at least, from the 5th century on. And if we think that the few images of Christ found in Roman catacombs with long hair and beard could also have been based, directly or not, on the image of the Shroud, that mean the Shroud was there during the 4th century. But it’s not because these images of Christ were probably connected with the image of the Shroud that it mean they were on and the same !!! I think there’s enough clues in ancient artistic depictions of Christ (the Mandylion being one of them) to prove that the Shroud was present and known by some artists, from the 5th century on, and maybe from the 4th century on. But these good clues are not enough to produce a real solid hypothesis concerning the Shroud and is whereabouts during all these years… I hope this comment of mine will help you to understand perfectly what I wanted to say the other day !!!.","date":"2012-07-02","mins":"5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13348","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This comment of David Mo is exactly right. There is no DIRECT reference of a Shroud of Christ with a body image on it before 1204 with Robert de Clari. And prior to that (in 1200 or 1201), there is just one INDIRECT reference of a Shroud of Christ with a body image on it and it come from Nicolas Mesarites, the guardian of the relics of Christ that were kept in the Pharos Chapel. He wrote this : “the Burial sindones of Christ: these are of linen. They are of cheap and easy to find material, and defying destruction since they wrapped the uncircumscribed, fragrant‑with‑myrrh, NAKED body after the Passion.” As Baima Bollone once said in the book he wrote in 2000 about the Shroud, when we know the repultion of the Byzantine to represent Christ naked during that period of time, this bizarre mention of the nudity of Christ in a description of his burial cloths must be related to the naked body present on the Shroud of Turin. I agree completely with this point of view. I don’t see any good reason that this Byzantine guy would have talked about the nudity of Christ while talking about his burial garments if the Shroud of Turin was not among them. But the most important thing to note is the fact that these 2 testimonies are the ONLY ones, in all ancient writtings, to make any kind of reference to the presence of a body image on the Shroud of Christ, prior to his public showing in Lirey around 1357. And that fact lead Paul Vignon to conclude this about this Shroud of Constantinople (I think his point of view is very close to the truth) : The Shroud was probably kept folded in a receptacle and that the practice of exhibiting it every Friday, attested by Robert de Clari, begin only after the Byzantine Emperor made his residence in the Palace of Blachernes, which would have been 2 or 3 years before the sack of the city in april 1204 (remember that this Shroud was still probably kept in the Pharos Chapel in 1200 or 1201). Before that possible non recorded transfer of the Shroud to the Blachernes in 1201 or 1202 (or even 1203), it is truly possible that this cloth was never publicly showed or, if it was, only the backside of the cloth (with no body image truly visible) could have been showed… It is truly possible to think that the Orthodox Clergy in charge of protecting the relic was affraid to show the dead, naked, bloody and suffering body of Christ to the faithful and that the mentality (and/or the theological thinking) of the time (around 1200) had changed enough to permit the first public exhibitions of the relic and his image. This is a scenario which is truly possible regarding the period of time… No one can prove it yet, but I think Vignong’s hypothesis is very interesting and truly rational. One little difference from my point of view : Vignon think that the first exhibitions of the relic in the Blachernes Church would have been caused by the change of residence of the Byzantine Emperor, from the Great Palace (where the Pharos Chapel was) to the Blachernes Palace around 1201 or 1202. I think it is truly possible that the first public showing of the Shroud could have been due to the arrival of the crusaders in front of the city in 1203. It is possible to think that the Byzantine authorities (the Emperor, the Clergy, etc.) would have decided to show the inner part of the Shroud (the one with the body image) to the crowds in the Blachernes Church at that moment, in order to ask some Divine protection against this major threat against their city. Effectively, it was common in ancient time to use a relic of Christ as a palladium for the city… The Mandylion was probably used for this task in Edessa in more than one occasion and now, it is possible that it was the turn of the Shroud of Christ to play this important role in 1203 1204. If my idea is right (it is only a speculation here), then that would mean that the palladium role of the Shroud was not effective at all because the city was sacked in 1204 !!! ; ).","date":"2012-07-02","mins":"9:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13344","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I forget to mention that we have 2 or 3 references (that some historians have questioned the credibility) that also talk about the presence of the Shroud of Christ (the same that Robert de Clari had seen in 1203 at the Blachernes Church) in Athens, probably in the hands of Othon de la Roche. After that, nothing until the D’Arcy memorandum of 1389, telling that the Shroud of Turin was put in public display in Lirey, France, around 1357 or so (just after the death of Geoffroy de Charny). So, in retrospective, we can say that we have some testimonies about the presence of a shroud of Christ in Palestine (some mentioned Jerusalem, some talk about another location, like the banks of the Jordan river) between the 6th and the 8th century. Then, after that, we have many mentions of a shroud of Christ in Constantinople between 958 and 1204. Then, we have just a few testimonies (hard to tell if they are credible) that talk about the presence, in Athens, of the Shroud that was kept in Constantinople, in the first few years following the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Then, nothing until the D’Arcy memorandum of 1389, which indicate that the Shroud of Turin was in Lirey, France, at least from 1357 on. That’s all we can learn from ancient sources without making any kind of speculations like Wilson do for the Mandylion. And it’s impossible to tell if the Shroud of Jerusalem was the same than the one that was kept in Constantinople. But, on the contrary, I think there’s very good clues that exist to say that the Shroud that Robert de Clari saw in Constantinople in 1203 was probably the same than the one that was publicly showed in Lirey around 1357… It’s not 100% sure of course, but I think we can say that the chances are pretty good that it is the case..","date":"2012-07-02","mins":"6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13473","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Reply to David (one by one) : You wrote : “1. Mesarites speaks of two different objects. One is the Mandylion and the other the shroud.” Comment from me : I know that very well and that’s exactly what I reported in my article… You wrote: “2. Mesarites is not talking about a picture of a naked body. Only says that the shroud wrapped the naked body. They are two very different things.” Comment from me : When I talked about this topic, I was refeering to Baima Bollone’s opinion and said that I agreed with him. His point of view was very rational on this question : When someone knows how much the Byzantine where not inclined to talk or show Christ’s nudity (I’m not talking about the few icons of his baptism that still hide his nudity in some clever way… These are much more the exception than the rule), so when someone know that HISTORICAL FACT, the fact that Mesarites talk about Christ nudity in relation with his burial cloth is VERY STRANGE and UNCOMMON for the time ! For me, it is a very good clue that the Shroud describe by this guardian of relics is the very same shroud that was seen by Robert de Clari 3 years later in the same city. And when you take these 2 eye witnesses testimonies and all the informations contained in the artworks of the Pray Codex and you put them together to see the whole picture, I don’t think there’s too much doubt that the Shroud of Turin was present in Constantinople between at least the second part of the 12th century until the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Of course, this is not a full proof without any doubt, but if we use the Ockham Razor principle, I really think that the most probable answer concerning these works (Mesarites, de Clari and Pray Codex) is that they refers in some way to the Shroud of Turin and that this relic was then kept in Constantinople. The odds are in favor of that. You wrote : “It is not true that the Byzantines did not show naked Christ. In the Byzantine mosaics of Italy there are naked Christs.” Comment from me : Sorry for not having been enough precise in my statements. In my mind, when I refers to the Byzantine art, I refers to the artworks that were done in the Middle East by Byzantine artists, not to artworks that were done in the West following the Byzantine style. In the Byzantine world of the Middle East, I really don’t think you’ll find much depictions of Christ showing him completely nude (like in the artworks of the Pray Codex) and/or showing with bruises, injuries and/or bloodstains before the 14th century. Again, you can maybe found a few Mid Eastern artworks like that before the 14th century but they will surely represent the exception and not the rule ! You wrote : “the shroud was extended several times…” Comment from me : First of all, the reference you gave us from the article of Flussin is completely irrelevant because it talk about the Mandylion, not the Shroud of Christ ! Also, here’s a message for you : Show me the references please where an ancient text talk about a public showing of a Shroud of Christ with a body image on it ! The first time a Shroud of Christ was clearly said to bears a body image was in the testimony of Robert de Clari of 1204. Before that, there’s just the testimony of Mesarites of 1200 1201 that can be seen as a tacit reference to an image. Before that, nothing ! We have absolutely no clue from ancient historical sources to think that the Shroud of Turin was publicly exhibited prior to 1203 1204 at the time the crusaders came in front of the city. Of course, once the Shroud was exposed in Lirey around 1357, it’s pretty obvious that the relic was often extended completely. But before 1203, we have absolutely no clue of any public exhibition of a Shroud of Christ showing a body image on it. And you also wrote : “an object that remains folded for centuries left clear marks on the fabric…” Comment from me : You don’t agree with me or what ? I’m not sure to understand the critic here. Use your logic please. If you do, you’ll understand that a linen cloth that would only have a part of it exposed to air, dust and sunlight for century while always remaining in the same configuration will surely show some noticeable differences (physical and/or chemical differences) at fibers level (and even at the naked eye ! It’s most probable that we would see more dust and dirt in the exposed region, more oxydation of the fibers too, etc… If the Shroud have no noticeable difference of content like that, it is most probably because the configuration in which the relic was kept did changed often along the years. Just because of the burn holes, we know that the relic was kept in at least 3 or 4 configurations before 1532. From this little clue, we can easily expect that the cloth was kept in some more configurations along the years… And for your comment about my imagination, what can I say ? I made it clear that I didn’t invent anything and that all the 22 facts I gave you come from credible sources (at least I think so). Look, I even gave you a list of these sources at the end of my paper. Of course, it’s truly possible that my interpretation of some of these facts can be different than yours, but I really don’t think I have been a daydreamer in this paper. In fact, I’ve tried to stay honest, rational and prudent. One thing you’ll need to put you in your head : It’s not because there are 2 or 3 known depictions of Christ in some specific way that it means that this was an artistic trend at the time those few artworks were done !!!.","date":"2012-07-04","mins":"8:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13618","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Before 550, all we have is some documents (not a great number) that speaks of a painted PORTRAIT of Christ in Edessa.

From the historical sources we have, this is the most simple explanation (if we don’t use any kind of special assumptions) concerning the Image of Edessa (Mandylion). From all the known sources we have, that’s the most rational conclusion regarding this relic of Christ (who was maybe not even considered as a real Christian relic until the second part of the 6th century)… And concerning the late source (11th century) you quote, you have to remember that, at that time, the Mandylion was truly considered as a miraculous relic of Christ.

Comment from me : This is PURE speculation. Here, Mario falls in the same trap than Wilson, who is a champion of bad speculations. The historical FACT is this : Nowhere in ancient sources there is one direct link between the city of Edessa and the presence of a Shroud of Christ (or some burial garments of Christ) and nowhere in ancient sources there is one direct link between the Mandylion and a cloth related to the Passion of the Christ. In fact, it’s precisely the opposite, because we have many ancient sources that make a clear separation between the Mandylion and the Shroud (or burial cloths) of Christ, and we also have many ancient list of relics associated with the Passion of Christ and, IN ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THEM can we find a direct or even indirect mention of the Mandylion and/or the Abgar legend. This is so clear that, in all logic, this can only mean one thing : That the image on the Mandylion had nothing to do with Jesus Passion, death and emtombment. And note that this conclusion is in total agreement with what was always reported to be concerning the Mandylion, i.e. That it was a small towel showing only the face of the living Christ, without any bruises or bloodstains on it. ALL THIS IS NOT GREAT FOR WILSON’S HYPOTHESIS !!! These are solid historical FACTS. Now, do what you want with them !!! If you want to do science fiction like Wilson in order to comfort your preconceived ideas, it’s your problem, but if you really want to stay “scientifically correct” (meaning that you make sure to go where the FACTS lead you), you should conclude that there is no evidence at all to let us think that the Shroud of Turin ever stay even one single day in Edessa ! That’s the reality and I know that EVERY real Byzantine Historians would agree with me on this point. And for the idea that there was many copies of the Mandylion in Edessa, this is a fact but these copies were of the same dimensions than the original (I.e. A small towel for the face). We know this because, in 944, when the Byzantines wanted to take the original Mandylion, they had to make a close examination of the relic in order to make sure it was not a painted copy. From this single fact alone, we can be sure that the Mandylion and the Edessenian copies of it (there was at least 2 documented copies) were very similar, meaning, most probably, that they were 3 small cloths showing only the face of the living Christ… In conclusion, the fact that there was at least 2 copies of the Mandylion in Edessa at the time the relic was transferred to Constantinople has nothing to do with the idea that the original Mandylion could have been a burial shroud folded to show only the region of the face.

That could simply means that this cloth was mostly kept hidden during these long years and to me, I really think this hypothesis is as good as any others that have been proposed and certainly more rational than the Mandylion hypothesis of Wilson in regard of the very poor number of written reference concerning a Shroud of Christ during that whole era..","date":"2012-10-16","mins":"5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/quote-for-today-diana-fulbright-on-wishful-thinking/","cat":"history","title":"Quote for Today: Diana Fulbright on Wishful Thinking."},{"id":"comment-17741","author":"yannick_clément","post":"No matter which test could be done to know the true age of the cloth, it SHOULD be done because we know now for a fact that the C14 dating of 1988 was not representative of the main body of the Shroud.

It deal with 2 important issues : The authenticity of the Shroud (is it the real shroud of Jesus of Nazareth ?) and the possible proof of the resurrection (did the image offer some proof of the resurrection ?). Taking the first question, I think the answer given by Willam Meacham in his 1983 article “The Authentication of the Turin Shroud : An Issue in Archeological Epistemology” is still valid today… with some caution. You can find this very good paper on the shroud.com website here : http://shroud.com/meacham2.htm In this paper (one of the best I ever read about the Shroud), Meacham state this : “The question of authenticity may be readily divided into two stages : (1) the Shroud as a genuine burial cloth recovered from a grave or removed from a corpse and (2) the Shroud as the gravecloth of Christ.” After that, Meacham wrote this : “Current opinion on the Shroud’s authenticity range generally from “probable” to “proven” for Stage 1 and from “possible” to “probable” for Stage 2.” Meacham show in his article that there’s many similarities between the image on the Shroud and the Gospel accounts and, as an archaeologist, this is enough for him to get to the conclusion that it is the authentic burial shroud of Christ. But, I want to point out the fact that, in the same article, Meacham talk about 3 other possibilities : 1 The Shroud is a fraud made by a forger who tortured someone in the same way than what is reported for Christ in the Gospels, in order to produce a relic of the Passion. In this case, the Shroud would be a human creation of a so called gravecloth of Christ, made to fool people. The body image would have been created with some unknown method. 2 The Shroud is a genuine shroud of an unknown man who died from crucifixion, in the same way than what is reported for Christ in the Gospels. And here, there’s 2 possibilities : A) It is the shroud of a criminal who suffered the same capital punishment than Jesus and, in this case, it would be a purely accidental resemblance with Christ with the presence of an unexpected body image created by some natural process unknown to this day. B) It is the shroud of a martyred man who was tortured like Christ by some enemies of the Christian faith (Muslims maybe ?), who used the Gospels accounts to do their torture. And, in this case, it would be a deliberate resemblance with Christ in the way they tortured him, but without the purpose to create a relic because the body image would have been unexpected and surely created by some natural process unknown to this day. Even with that in mind, Meacham came to the conclusion that “…the present evidence allows a firm archaeological judgement for authenticity.” I know these 3 possibilities don’t stand high in a probabilistic scale, as Meacham demonstrate in his article, but, to stay within the room of science, we cannot completely rule them out. And don’t forget that Meacham wrote this article BEFORE the carbon dating test of 1988. Even if there are great doubts now about the 1260 1390 date range (thanks to Rogers, Adler and others work, Robert de Clari report and the Pray manuscript), I think it’s fair to say that we have to be prudent regarding the true age of the Shroud. We cannot rule out the possibility that the Shroud isn’t from the first century. Even if the medieval date is wrong, there’s still a possibility for the Shroud to have been manufactured AFTER the first century. If this is true, then we have to think that one of the three possibilities that I mentioned before is correct, as incredible as it seem ! To stay scientifically credible, I think we’ll have to wait for another carbon dating (done properly this time) to know if the Shroud is really the authentic burial cloth of Christ or not. So, my personal conclusion is : With all the facts we know now, the possibility that the Shroud is a real shroud of someone who died from crucifixion is almost proven (I would say 99.9 %). And the possibility that the Shroud is the real gravecloth of Jesus Christ is also very high, but, scientifically, we can’t say that it is an absolutely proven fact because of the 3 other possibilities mentioned in the Meacham article and because we don’t know for sure what his true age really is. But, in the end, one thing’s for sure in my mind : after all the facts we know now about the Shroud, the possibility of a pure artistic fake is close to the absolute zero ! That’s it for the first question. We just have to hope for another carbon test !!! Now, for the second question, I think we have to be really prudent. It’s not because science cannot duplicate the Shroud, even today, that the image on it is necessarily due to a miracle event. And it’s not because, today, we’re not completely sure of the exact nature of the image and we still don’t know the image formation mechanism, that science will not find some answers to these questions in the future. Carl Sagan said : “Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.” I totally agree ! On this particular question of the Shroud being a possible proof of the resurrection of Christ, I particularly suggest the reading of the wonderful book written by Ray Rogers “A chemist’s perspective on the Shroud of Turin”. It’s one of the most (if not the most) complete book on the science of the Shroud… You can buy it here (hardcover and PDF version available) : http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/a chemists perspective on the shroud of turin/3278016 In his book, M. Rogers state that the whole body of data that we possess now about the Shroud suggest to him that no miracle is needed to explain the image. I know this is a personal opinion, but we have to keep in mind that it come from one true chemist expert who spend more time to analysed this object than almost anyone in the world. It’s not a claim just made by anybody on a street corner ! As I often say, with the eyes of faith, someone like me CAN see a sign of the resurrection on the Shroud but I will never claim that this is an absolute proof of this event ! And I would add this : Before seeing a sign of the resurrection on the Shroud, one must believe in the resurrection first ! I don’t think the Shroud, as mysterious as it is, ever succeed to convert masses of sceptics and atheists… Also, we have to keep in mind that science today isn’t able to fully authenticate the Shroud (for the reasons I mentioned earlier in this text). So we really need faith to see a sign of the resurrection on it ! Again, Meacham, in his article, gave us the best conclusion on this important topic : “Clearly, the data can be taken no farther than to indicate a separation of body and cloth before the onset of decomposition and the prevalence of rare conditions in the tomb which resulted in the image.” I think this last statement says it all !!! Science cannot go farther than this, at least for the moment… It was true in 1983 when Meacham wrote it. It is true in 2011. And I don’t think I’ll make a big mistake in saying that it will be true for a long time beyond now !!! Conclusion : Does the Shroud show a proof of the resurrection ? I think we have to absolutely say “NO”. Now, does the Shroud show a sign of the resurrection ? With the eyes of faith, we can say a clear “YES” or just a prudent “COULD BE” ! This last answer is mine for the moment….","date":"2011-07-02","mins":"6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/06/29/great-new-article-in-open-salon-the-shroud-of-turin-resurrection-and-joe-kennedy/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Great New Article in Open Salon: The Shroud of Turin, Resurrection and Joe Kennedy"},{"id":"comment-3297","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I think we could talk a long time about that ! I don’t think we can consider Zugibe’s HYPOTHESIS of nailing the wrist a “proven” fact ! And personally, I prefer by far Pierre Barbet’s conclusions on this particular topic (even if nobody can say it’s a proven fact either). In reality, there’s 2 things that bugs me about Zugibe’s HYPOTHESIS : 1 Pierre Barbet did real nailing experiments with fresh amputated limbs and he said in his book (A doctor at Calvary) that, when he nailed the wrist, each time the nail found a way through Destot’s space after being deflected by the small bones from the wrist, no matter where he put the nail on the wrist before nailing it. What that mean is that Destot’s space is a NATURAL path for a nail through the wrist and a nail who pass through this space always came out at the same exact spot that is shown on the Shroud. So, the experiments done by Barbet cannot be rejected. Nobody can claim that this is not a possible way of nailing the wrist ! I don’t pretend that Zugibe way to nail the hands is not compatible with what we see on the Shroud (I’m not a doctor !), but the biggest question we have to ask ourselves is : What is the most easy and logical way to nailed the wrists ? Barbet’s way through the wrist or Zugibe’s way through the bottom of the palm with some angulation to be sure it come out in the wrist area ? Using our logic, I think it’s fair to say that Barbet’s way if the most simple way to nail someone through the wrists. I think it’s the most “natural” way to nail someone through the wrists. It’s hard for me to believe that the Roman soldiers would scratch their head and try to calculate the right angle to drove the nails through the bottom of the palm to make sure he come out in the wrist area… 2 Zugube’s experiments and calculations gave the conclusion that the palms of the hand would hold on if the nail was driven through them. It is surely true if the nail is driven the way he describe with an exit point in the wrist area but I have some doubts about a nail driven through the middle of the palm with an exit point in the middle of the hand (and not the wrist) !!! Barbet too did some experiments about that question and came to the opposite conclusion. Who can we trust ? I think Zugibe forget to consider an important factor in his calculations : the movements a crucified man could make while on the cross ! If someone don’t move at all, then I can think the nails through the palm could hold on. But with someone fighting for his life (and for his breath), we cannot rule out the possibility that this person couldn’t make some movement with his hands (like pulling on his hands). To me, if someone can pull on his hand while he is on the cross, he have some chances to tear up the flesh of his hands. It seems logical to me… I really don’t think Zugibe’s calculations consider this factor. One other important thing to consider : We have to put ourselves in the shoes (sandals would be more accurate !) of a roman soldier. They didn’t want the victim on the cross to have any chance to get out alive, so the most logic way to lock up the hands was surely to pass the nails through the wrists… This is my reflection on the subject. Using the good old logic, we have to think Barbet’s conclusions on this particular point have more chances to be true. That’s what I believe… Again, to make your choice between Barbet and Zugibe, never forget to put yourself in the sandals of a Roman soldier. What is the most easy and natural way to drive a nail in such manner than the exit spot will be in the wrist area ? I really think it is through the wrist using Destot’s space… Thank you for your reply to my long message !!!.","date":"2011-07-02","mins":"10:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/06/29/great-new-article-in-open-salon-the-shroud-of-turin-resurrection-and-joe-kennedy/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Great New Article in Open Salon: The Shroud of Turin, Resurrection and Joe Kennedy"},{"id":"comment-3330","author":"yannick_clément","post":"You said it right.

So, if the Shroud is a forgery, then our forger would have been a very bizarre guy. If his goal was to produce a relic of the passion of Christ, why showing the exit wound elsewhere than across the palm ??? That does ring true to me… And I think we can agree also on the fact that, with Barbet’s or with Zugibe’s method of nailing, the arms were held in position much more firmly than what would happened if the nail was driven across the palm ! And Barbet and Zugibe agreed on the most important thing : The image on the Shroud is the image of a real human body who spend no more than 48 hours there because there’s no sign of putrefaction on the cloth.

Personally, I don’t buy this idea for 2 seconds, sorry. The more scientific knowledge progress versus the Shroud and the more it really seem that the only “mystery” that soon will be left to explain is the mechanism that has produced the image. An image that, at the level of his nature, science understand better and better and that really seem to be completely and naturally related to the ancient method of making linen cloths and the biologic products released by a fresh corpse that was tortured severily just prior to a death by crucifixion. At this point in the history of the Shroud, I think the key element is the confirmation of the chromophore of the image. Once this will be done without any serious doubt, I have a great confidence that science will finally be able to explain this image “naturally”. Of course, if I’m right, that would not mean at all that Jesus didn’t resurrect or that this cloth his not his authentic burial Shroud, but that would only mean that God is so much love that he didn’t want to leave us some kind of “proof” of this great event. The Shroud, for me, is more like the empty tomb (a sign that point toward the Resurrection event) than some kind of physical evidence of this event.

Why ? For the simple and great reason that the body image is IMCOMPLETE !!!! The UV fluorescence photos of STURP have been able to prove that there is missing parts in the image, especially in the region of the feet and also behind the knees in the dorsal image. This simple FACT should be enough to dismiss or at the very least, to seriously doubt that this kind of scenario can be correct regarding the Shroud. Seriously, do you see God makind miraculously an image on a linen cloth that wouldn’t be perfect and complete ??? : ) Even if the Shroud is reported to be the authentic burial shroud of Christ, I think we have to stay very prudent here not to fall in the dangerous trap that I call “The God of the gaps”.

For my part, knowing all the important and confirmed facts there is to know about this relic, you will never see me fallen into that trap regarding the Shroud….","date":"2012-08-10","mins":"10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/10/imagine-the-image-as-part-of-the-resurrection-and-not-the-result-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Imagine the image as part of the resurrection and not the result of the resurrection"},{"id":"comment-14674","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here, I want to reply to Daveb’s comment that he wrote here : https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/and yannick responds to giulios comments/#comment 14599 And I think this comment will calm down also our friend Carlos : Dave, I think your comment is very interesting. First of all, may I suggest you to read again my recent paper concerning the question of the authenticity of the Shroud. You’ll see that I’ve developed 4 possible scenarios to explain the relic and that one of them (the last one) include the possibility that the image on the Shroud could come, directly or not, from the Resurrection of Christ. And if you pay attention to the footnote related to the description I’ve make of the 4th scenario, you’ll read this : “This 4th scenario might shock some because it is based on a dogma of faith (the Resurrection of Christ) and, by definition, it goes beyond the pure scientific rationality. But, since the Shroud of Turin is considered by Christian tradition as being the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, it seems justified to keep open that possibility, even if, in face of all the known and confirmed data, such a scenario is not necessarily the most probable. For a very detailed analysis of that possibility, see: Raymond N. Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, Barrie Schwortz Editor and Publisher, July 2008. So, I hope now you can admit the fact that it’s not true that I have completely shut the door to the possibility of a miraculous event in the case of the Shroud, even if I don’t considered this avenue as the most probable ! Stating that the image on the Shroud could not have been, in any way, a direct product or a by product of the Resurrection of Christ was not the point I tried to make with my editorial letter. In fact, I agree with you that, on a PERSONAL AND PRIVATE BASIS, it is truly possible for someone to BELIEVE that the image on the Shroud is related to the Resurrection of Christ. I know very well that this is not an idea that the Catholic Church officially promote, but I don’t think we should (or can) FORCE someone to deny that faith if it’s what he believe. Besides, we can teach them properly about the Shroud and his image, but that’s another story… Anyway, the MOST IMPORTANT POINT I wanted to express in my editorial is this : If someone (and it is pretty evident that, sadly, there are many modern sindonologists in that category) start or base his study of the Shroud of Turin on the preconceived notion that the Resurrection SHOULD have something to do with the body image on the cloth and, consequently, avoid, neglect or, even worse, refuse completely to considered properly all the possibilities that exist for a natural occurring image formation, especially in the light of the observations, conclusions and hypotheses reported by Ray Rogers and others (especially concerning the probable chromophore of the image), then this person is guilty of doing a bad science, because it is religiously biased. Period. As I often said here on the blog, religious dogmas or ideas should not have anything to do with any good scientific research. And if such a person go ever further and try to “prove” the Resurrection using the image on the Shroud, then this is called “doing science with a religious agenda in the back of your mind” and it is a complete shame in comparison to any scientific research that is performed in the state of the art, following completely and honestly the scientific method (i.e. Following ALL the data and facts no matter where it leads you and what the conclusion can be, even if it goes against some preconceived notions you could have at the beginning). A “scientist” that would be found guilty of such a “crime” should not be considered “reliable” no more on this particular subject and I’m sure there’s some modern sindonologists (I don’t want to mention any name here) that are part of that group ! It’s interesting you mention the fact that the Catholic Church will NEVER proclaim a miracle before science has done a complete in dept analysis of the reported phenomenon and find out that this phenomenon CANNOT be scientifically explained by the known Laws of nature. I really think that if we apply this notion with honesty (and without any religious feelings) to the image on the image on the Shroud, we have to conclude that it is not possible, in this particular case, to call this a “miracle” (and the Church never claim the image to be miraculous by the way) for the simple and good reason that it is really premature to state that science CANNOT explained this thing with the known Laws of nature. That’s the reality because the Shroud and his image, up until this day, has not been DIRECTLY analyzed enough by science for someone to claim that science has come full circle concerning this image and 1 is still not able to define and understand his nature (the chromophore) and 2 is still not able to describe a natural theory that can account for all the known physical and chemical characteristics of the image. Even if a lot of researches have been made on the relic, we have to understand that direct testing has only been made once (by STURP and some Italians in 1978 and the years following), along with some more researches done after that by other scientists claiming they have worked with authentic samples from the Shroud. In this context, I really don’t think anyone has the right to proclaim that science has made a full and complete examination of the relic so far. The best proof of that can be found in the fact that the STURP team, right after having published his final peer reviewed article concerning the research on the Shroud, was already asking permission to the Cardinal of Turin and the Vatican for a second round of direct testing on the cloth !!!! Because of the fact that science still need further testing on this relic before it can be said that the analysis is complete, no one can proclaim that the image SHOULD have been caused by a miraculous event. Personally, I think science is pretty close to answer the first question concerning the image chromophore and concerning the second question (the one related to the image formation process), it’s evident that this will be the more complex “mystery” to resolve, but if we can understand perfectly the real nature of the chromophore (question #1), then I truly believe science would be in a pretty good position to find the proper answer for the second question, especially if more testing under laboratory conditions can be performed to analyze more deeply some interesting natural image formation processes like the Maillard reaction proposed by Rogers (and there are others natural suggestions also interesting that exist) in the context of a body who suffered a long torture prior to his death by crucifixion and who was enveloped (probably loosely) in a shroud that was probably manufactured with the ancient method of making linen cloths. In fact, this is precisely the SECOND MOST IMPORTANT POINT I wanted to make with this editorial letter ! To me, if science can finally find what is the real nature of the image chromphore (without any serious doubt), then it will be much easier to evaluate correctly all the proposal that have been made over the years concerning the most probable process (or processes) that can explain the image formation on the cloth in the very particular context I just describe. And this should hallowed science to finally have a much clearer idea of the direction where to search in order to find the solution to this enigma. I really think that this should be sufficient to eventually permit the resolution (once and for all) of this “mystery”, thanks to the scientific method. If what I just said could be confirmed in the future, then I don’t think the possibility for the body image to have come from the Resurrection of Christ (and consequently, to be called “miraculous”) will still be there. Remember what Sagan said : Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence. It’s not because the image is not fully understood today that it will always be that way in the future and that we have the right to call for a supernatural event in order to explain it… This TRUTH is very important if we want to stay scientifically sound in our analysis of the Shroud of Turin and his image (or any other material objects in the Universe by the way). Remember that science, in face of something it can’t explain, will ALWAYS add that this is only true for today because, as Barbet said very well in his book : WE CAN’T PRESUME OF THE FUTURE ! So, that why you will always see conclusions like this : In the PRESENT STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, science cannot explain this phenomenon. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME WITH THE SHROUD and, if we want to stay scientifically credible, we should recognized that there is no good reason (not even the tradition that state it is the burial Shroud of Christ) to believe otherwise ! And let’s never forget what Francisco Alconchel Pecino said in his recent paper about the C14 issue : “Probably the controversy arose because, once more, HUMAN INNOCENCE WAS SURPRISED BY THE SUBTELTIES OF MOTHER NATURE.” This great TRUTH should always be kept in mind when it comes to analyzed the Shroud and his image… Unfortunately, this is not always the case (to say the least) ! And concerning the idea that an earthquake could be responsible for the image, front and back, of a human corpse on a linen shroud, I’m sure I’m not the only to find this possibility quite absurd. Anyway, as I said, let’s wait for science to finally find out what is the true nature of the image chromophore and then, we’ll have a much better scientific basis to analyze properly if this hypothesis of the earthquakes can have any chances to explain the image on the Shroud… Is it a deal ??? ; ) But be sure of one thing (I don’t want to presume of anything here. I just emit an hypothesis), if Rogers was correct about the image chromphore (i.e. That it resides ONLY in a thin layer of carbohydrates impurities on top of the fibers), then this earthquakes hypothesis (or any other hypothesis involving an energetic radiation) would really be in jeopardy. That’s why the exact nature of the image chromophore is so important to confirm and, in my mind, that should be the MAIN QUESTION that an eventual new series of direct researches on the cloth SHOULD TRY TO ANSWER IN PRIORITY. Because you can be sure of one thing : if the question of the chromophore is not properly answered and stay covered in doubt (as it is today), it will never be possible to prove any hypothesis of image formation ! I hope that my call concerning the resolution of this most important issue will be heard by some competent ears !!! One thing’s for sure : It doesn’t seem to have been heard by M. Fanti ! I say that because in his most recent paper “Open issues regarding the Turin Shroud”, here’s the 3 major issues in his mind : The formation of the image (as expected, it comes in #1 place even if, as I said, it should always come in #2, after the image chromophore), the conservation and his dating. You see ? NOT EVEN A WORD about the most crucial question of it all concerning the Shroud, which is the image chromophore !!!! This is truly incredible and pretty shameful… Let’s hope that other scientists will heard my call much better than M. Fanti, who seem to think (wrongly) that this question of the chromophore was settled with his 2010 paper in which he proclaimed, without any chemical testing to back it up, that the image chromophore was most probably the primary cell wall and not a thin layer of impurity on top of the fibers !!!! As I said in my editorial, it’s not surprising at all that he claimed this, since it is truly possible to colored only the primary cell wall of a linen fiber without affecting his core with a corona discharge (as demonstrated by an experiment done by Rogers himself !!!). Meditate on that for a while and you’ll see that all this doesn’t smell very good, to say the least. And what is also important (and shameful) to note is the fact that this question of the chromophore seem to be (wrongly) settled in the mind of many other sindonologists. I say that because, in Valencia earlier this year, a bunch of them had no difficulty to sign a list of “facts” proposed by M. Rolfe, in which we originally found the hypothesis of the primary cell wall, while the hypothesis of Rogers was completely cast out !!! To me, this is a VERY GOOD CLUE that clearly shows the very bad state of sindonology these days… I’ll say it again : This is really shameful !!! When he see that, Rogers (and others) must turn over in his grave !!! THE FACT IS THIS : THE QUESTION OF THE IMAGE CHROMOPHORE HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY CONFIRMED YET AND SHROUD SCIENCE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT INSTEAD OF ON IMAGE FORMATION !!! It’s only when this question will be properly settled that we could focus our attention on the image formation process… Final note : At least, there’s one good thing that can be found in this paper from Fanti : For the first time (to my knowledge), in page 3 of his paper, he recognize the fallacy of his conclusion of the probabilistic model he once made and that gave a probability of 100% (!) that the Shroud is really the authentic Shroud of Jesus Christ (note : he doesn’t say “Jesus of Nazareth” as it should for a scientist, but “Jesus Christ”, which speak very loud to me). At least, here, M. Fanti was able to recognize that his result had no value whatsoever because they were based on “subjective evaluations”. At least, this recognition is one good point for him !!! P.S. : I am currently writing a follow up paper to my article concerning the authenticity of the Shroud and, in it, I will do an in deep analysis of the second part of the question of the Shroud authenticity, which is the real identity of the man of the Shroud. I hope to be able to finish it this autumn… One thing’s for sure : you will never see me stating that the probability that this is really the Shroud of Jesus (of Nazareth !!!) is 100%, simply because it wouldn’t be an acceptable conclusion, scientifically speaking. On that particular question, we’re dealing with probabilities, not certainties!.","date":"2012-08-09","mins":"3:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/09/off-topic-is-consciousness-fundamental/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Consciousness Fundamental? Is Resurrection Fundamental to the Shroud Image?"},{"id":"comment-14725","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Here’s a message in which I want to react to the critics made by Carlos against me in the headline message. Sorry again for the length of this message. First, I will take some quotes from Carlos and answer them directly. Here’s the first one : Quote from Carlos : “ To the Rogers proposal be scientific, the Maillard reaction would have been interrupted suddenly by the withdrawal or the theft of the corpse of Jesus within 36 48 hours of their stay in the Sepulchre.” My answer : Effectively, that’s what Rogers was assuming with his hypothesis, with the exception of one thing : The assumption of the maximum time before the body had to leave the Shroud is in fact 72 hours instead of 36 48 hours, because many studies have showed that the liquid phase of putrefaction can start between 36 to 72 hours, DEPENDING ON MANY FACTORS. In page 116 of his book, Rogers say : “Vass et al. Also report that putrefaction (structural degradation) starts between 36 and 72 hours after death…” And he add : “Perhaps we can assume that the cloth could not have been in contact with the body for more than about three days.” Quote from Carlos : “Yannick said to admit the resurrection of Jesus, the “dematerialization” of the body of Jesus within 36 48 hours of their stay in the Sepulchre.” My answer : If you look closely at the 2 main conclusion I have written in my paper (in page 9), you’ll note that I talk of a range delay of 36 to 72 hours. I wrote this in order to stay scientifically correct versus the known maximum delay before the start of the liquid phase of putrefaction. And concerning the idea that the corpse could have been “dematerialized” (or “vanished”) at the moment of the Resurrection, I have left the possibility open in my paper, mainly because of the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains, as noted by Barbet, Vignon, Legrand, Baima Bollone, and many others Shroud researchers over the years and also because the Resurrection of Christ cannot be discarded, from a strict historical point of view. Effectively, the Passion and death of Jesus of Nazareth, along with his entombment on Friday night and the discovery of the empty tomb (without ever finding his body) has been recognized by the majority of the credible historians (even secular historians) as historical facts !!! That doesn’t mean, of course, that Jesus is really resurrected (his enemies said that the body was stolen instead), but there’s a “possibility” there that I couldn’t discard for the simple reason that I wanted to let the door open as wide as I honestly could when I was elaborating all the possible scenarios that could explain the Shroud and his image. But I also want to point out the FACT that, in my article, the idea of a “dematerialization” of the body to explain the particular state of the bloodstains on the cloth is only evident in the scenario #4, because it involved a direct or indirect role played by the Resurrection in the formation of the image. If you take another look at the description of the scenario #3, here’s what you’ll find : “The fact that the body left the Shroud before it started to corrupt can be related with his resurrection, but that’s not certain. In other words, a scenario like that doesn’t absolutely need to call for the resurrection in order to explain the bloodstains and the body image we see on the cloth.” So, you can easily see that, for this particular scenario involving a natural phenomenon that caused the body image, I have left the question of the “dematerialization” of the body open, without any implicit recognition. In my mind, because this scenario involved the Shroud of Jesus of Nazareth, a “dematerialization” of his body at the time of the Resurrection is a “possibility” but not a certainty (mainly because the formation of the image would not have been caused by the Resurrection event). Anyway, I don’t see any contradiction with these 2 ideas : a natural formation followed by a possible “dematerialization” of his body at the time of the Resurrection that would have stoped the natural image formation process that was going on. That’s what Barbet thought, that’s what Vignon and Delage thought, that’s what other researchers also thought and that a truly possible scenario in my mind. Here I ask the question : Why would a scenario like that (it is in fact one of the 2 sub scenarios included in the scenario #3) would be impossible to accept, from a theological and even historical point of view ? IF the Resurrection was really an historical event (because of the empty tomb, followed by the testimony of the disciples, I don’t think nobody can really discard completely this possibility), I don’t see why this proposed scenario should be considered as completely unscientific and why you can think I’m confused here. Quote from Carlos : “Yannick says to support the supernatural interruption of the reaction of Maillard (reaction proposed by Rogers).” My answer : This is untrue. First, in my paper, I never mentioned any specific natural image formation process as a possible hypothesis, but I just mentioned the fact that, it it’s right, it would have been most probably a chemical process. Also, as I just showed, in the description of the scenario #3 involving a natural formation of the image, I leave the door open to the possibility of a supernatural interruption of the natural image formation process, but I also left the door open to the possibility that this interruption was not supernatural too. Since I’ve wanted to stay honest in that paper, I just exposed as clearly as possible the 4 possible scenarios that can (in my opinion) explain the Shroud rationally, without explicitly supporting one of these scenarios over the others. In one particular footnote in my paper, you can find this comment that explain well my point of view on this question (extended here) : “As we have seen previously, there are only 4 possible scenarios concerning the Shroud that have any chance to “fit” with these two conclusions. And when we use the Occam’s razor principle, the probability seems to be much higher for some of them (like the scenario #3 for example) than it is for others (like the scenarios #1 and 2). In reality, when we analyse rationally each one of these four proposed scenarios, there’s no doubt that the scenario #3 (especially the one that don’t call for the Resurrection to explain the appearance of the bloodstains) is the one that demand the fewest number of special assumptions in order to work. And I would even say that the second sub scenario #3 that involved a dematerialization of the body that left the bloodstains undisturbed demand a fewer number of special assumptions in order to work in comparison with the scenario #4 (simply because a corpse CAN leave naturally an imprint on a cloth – we have examples of that, like the Jospine Mattress) while there is absolutely no way to know if the Resurrection even produced any form physical or chemical released that could have reacted with the surface of the cloth). Important note : that doesn’t mean this scenario is necessarily the correct one, but nevertheless, since we’re dealing with probabilities and not certainties, we have to admit that it is effectively the most probable scenario that can explain the bloodstains and the body image on the Shroud.” With this footnote, I just wanted to make people realized that we’re dealing with probabilities here and not with certainties and that even if there’s no way to considered one of the 4 proposed scenarios as having 0 % of chances to be true, on the other hand, with the help of the Occam’s razor principle, we can come pretty easily to the conclusion that the scenario #3 (particularly the sub scenario #3 that don’t involved a supernatural interruption of the image formation process), is the one that called for the fewest numbers of “special assumption” and, because of that, it should be considered as the most probable (even if, as I stated very clearly in my note : That doesn’t mean this scenario is necessarily the correct one). I hope you can realize now how false was Carlos statement ! Quote from Carlos : “The hypothesis of a supernatural interruption of the reaction of Maillard is not scientific.” My answer: From a strict scientific point of view, you’re right and it is also true versus the possible scenario #4 (involving a supernatural event for the image formation) you can find in my paper. But here’s what I said in a footnote to justify my decision to leave the door open to the “possibility” of a dematerialization of the body at the moment of the Resurrection : “This 4th scenario (note : I should have said also the sub scenario #3 involving the Resurrection, even if I think it’s evident even if it’s not mentioned here) might shock some because it is based on a dogma of faith (the Resurrection of Christ) and, by definition, it goes beyond the pure scientific rationality. But, since the Shroud of Turin is considered by Christian tradition as being the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, it seems justified to keep open that possibility, even if, in face of all the known and confirmed data, such a scenario is not necessarily the most probable.” For a better understanding, I should have said that it was also due to the FACT that most historians now recognized the historical reality of the empty tomb and of the testimony of the first disciple that were convinced that the Resurrection really happened. Because of that, along with the fact that the Shroud is traditionally considered as the Shroud of Christ, I think it was honest from me to leave the door open to the possibility of a “dematerialization” of the body, not only for the scenario #4, but also for the sub scenario #3 that involved this event that can explain the undisturbed aspect of bloodstains. Quote from Carlos : “Rogers hypothesis is scientific if the Maillard reaction is interrupted by a NATURAL environment.” My answer: Because of all I’ve said before in this long comment, I don’t see any good reason why the sub scenario #3 that involved a natural process of image formation (Maillard reaction or something else) and that involved also the “dematerialization” of the body of Christ at the moment of his Resurrection (without any physical or chemical emission) to explain the particular state of the bloodstains should be completely discarded. I agree that it is not a purely scientific scenario, but in the context of a scenario that involved the authentic Shroud of Christ, why should we close the door completely to this possibility ??? Anyway, we have to remember that it’s just one possible scenario among a list of 4 (in fact, a list of 5 because the scenario #3 included 2 sub scenarios). Quote from Carlos : “the shroud being one object PHYSICIST REAL, all scientific to study the possible effects on the shroud of “chemical” reactions (be Rogers or is Garlaschelli, etc.) or reactions “physical” (or Fanti, Di Lazzaro, Antoacci that was), it will be a good scientist or will be an evil scientist because of the methodology applied, not because of their religious beliefs.” My answer: I’m not so sure about that ! I agree that the methodology is important in every scientific research but let’s not forget also the importance of the integrity of the researcher, liked with the premise of his research ! On that question, I suggest anyone to read the long comment I post yesterday on that same page (comment #20). The problem is not the fact that a scientist is a believer or not (it’s true that both can do good science), but it comes when a scientist, who is also a believer, start or base his research on the Shroud with the preconceived notion that the Resurrection of Christ SHOULD have something to do with the body image on the cloth and, consequently, avoid, neglect or, even worse, refuse completely to considered properly all the possibilities that exist for a natural image formation process (or processes). And, as I also said that if such a person go ever further and try to “prove” the Resurrection using the image on the Shroud, then this is called “doing science with a religious agenda in the back of your mind” and it is a complete shame in comparison to any scientific research that is performed in the state of the art, following completely and honestly the scientific method (i.e. Following ALL the data and facts no matter where it leads you and what the conclusion can be, even if it goes against some preconceived notions you could have at the beginning). To me, these kinds of acts constitute a real problem for the integrity of Shroud science and it’s pretty obvious to me that such acting EXIST in a certain number of modern sindonologists… And if someone think that there’s no “scientists” with a religious bias in the Shroud world, then I’m sorry but he’s the most naïve person I ever see (or the most blind, which is as bad)… Of course, if another scientist bases his research on the preconceived notion that the Shroud SHOULD be a forgery (like our friend Garlashelli did recently), it is also a bad science. The authentic scientific method stipulate that a scientist who wants to do good science MUST follow EVERY confirmed facts and observations in the direction where they go, NO MATTER WHAT COULD BE IS PERSONAL OPINION ON THE SUBJECT !!! Sadly, I’m not sure at all that this path is followed by a majority of modern sindonologists these days… As Rogers states in his books : “IT IS NOT VALID TO ELIMINATE OR SUPPRESS FACTS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIS.” Acting like that proves that you don’t follow correctly the scientific method and, again, it’s obvious to me that many modern Shroud researchers are acting exactly like that in order to support their preconceived notion (involving some supernatural event) concerning the image on the relic. Quote from Carlos : “Every scientist, believer or unbeliever, knows that NO there is no physical or chemical energy that can RESURRECT the dead.” My answer: Maybe that’s true, but if we turn things around, we can also state that there’s nothing at all that can hallowed us to think the Resurrection event could have produced or released any kind of physical or chemical energy ! Nevertheless, we constantly see in Shroud science researchers who based their research on that premise which has absolutely no scientific, historical, scriptural (there’s no Gospel account that reports what happen at the moment of the Resurrection) or even correct theological basis (for example, you’ll never found anything in the Catechism of the Catholic Church that stipulate that there was any form of physical or chemical release from the body at the moment of the Resurrection). Even if someone presume it was the case, the reality is this : Nobody can prove an unknown (the image formation on the Shroud) with another unknown (the purely speculative assumption that the Resurrection event have really produced or released any kind of physical or chemical energy). And we also have to remember that any supernatural hypothesis proposal based on any form of energetic radiation is religiously biased from the beginning for the simple and good reason that SOMEONE NEED FAITH (IN CHRIST OR AT LEAST, IN GOD) IN ORDER TO PROPOSED OR SUPPORT AN HYPOTHESIS LIKE THAT, WHICH IS RELATED IN SOME WAY TO A SUPERNATURAL EVENT CALLED “THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST”. This is an important TRUTH too often forgotten in the marvelous world of the Shroud !!! Have you noticed that there’s absolutely no Buddhist, no Muslim, no Hasidic Jew and no Atheist scientist that ever proposed a supernatural hypothesis concerning the body image formation, while, on the other hand, we found historically some non believers, like Yves Delage in France (beginning of the 20th century) who supported or proposed natural image formation process to explain the body image on the cloth ?!? Meditate on that folks !!!.","date":"2012-08-10","mins":"10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/09/off-topic-is-consciousness-fundamental/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Consciousness Fundamental?

I really think some experts should make experiments to evaluate this very particular aspect of the bloodstains. I think there’s only Vignon who really made experiments concerning the effects of the withdrawal of a body from a linen shroud. In all his experiments, Vignon NEVER was able to obtain the kind of undisturbed blood clots we see on the Shroud… For him, Barbet, Legrand (and I know also Upensky thinks like that) this FACT is a SIGN of the Resurrection. It’s true that it’s a great sign for someone who look at this with the eyes of faith, but i It cannot be taken as a proof. There’s a big difference between the two expressions. In the end, because it is the reported Shroud of Jesus Christ and because the Gospels told us that he resurrect, I think there really are two different options to explain the withdrawal of the corpse from the Shrous and I talk about both options in my scenario #3 (because both options can “fit” with this particular scenario : 1 A natural manual withdrawal of the corpse (with the help of some persons) and 2 A supernatural withdrawal of the corpse (caused by the “dematerialization” or the “vanishing” if you prefer of the corpse from the Shroud).

How can you think that ??? This is completely ludicrous. Let me remind you that Pierre Barbet was a good faithful Catholic and thought that a scenario involving a natural formation of the image AND the Resurrection of Christ was TRULY POSSIBLE and he even saw a SIGN (not a proof) of this event with the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains on the Shroud !!! And he was surely not alone to think like that !!!!! Let’s take this scenario : Imagine the body image was really caused by a Maillard reaction and that, after maybe 36 hours, the body of Jesus resurrected by suddently vanishing from the Shroud WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY FORM OF ENERGY (which is a speculative “Hollywood” style idea that has no basis, not even in official Catholic theology). That would have stopped the released of amines suddently and the chemical reaction could not have continue and that would have had the effect to prevent the cloth to be completely stained by this chemical process. Effectively, if the reaction would have continue for some time, it’s evident that there would have been a saturation of the coloration in many places on the cloth. In a scenario like that, Jesus would have really resurrect and the “active” part of the chemical reaction that produced his body image would have been finish at the same time (with a probable amount of time necessary after that for a full development of the image as we see it today). Question : How can you be so sure that a scenario like that would be impossible ??? I really don’t understand your line of thinking here. As I understand you, the only way the Shroud can be the genuine Shroud of Christ would be to have an image produced by a release of some kind of energetic radiation. Am I right ? Excuse me but there’s other possible scenarios that this one !!!!! In my paper, I didn’t rejected the scenario you defend so vigorously (look again at my scenario #4), so why would you reject the sub scenario #3 involving a natural process of image formation AND the Resurrection of Christ, accompanied by absolutely no release of energy at all ??? How can you be so sure that this is not the closest scenario versus the reality of Jesus Resurrection ??? I recently exchange a few email with Manny Carreira, the Spanish physicist and Jesuit priest. He read my paper and said this : “I am in complete agreement with your ideas. And for anybody who wants to sustain the hypothesis of a medieval forgery, the challenge remains: produce something like it, even with modern technology. This is the way science requires a hypothesis to be worth taking seriously. The only change I would suggest would be to avoid the term “dematerialization”.” Then, he said this : “It is true that other people have used the term “dematerialize” to describe the loss of structure, reducing the body to loose elementary particles or even to their energy equivalents. I might be reacting strongly being a physicist when I want to stick to terms with their proper meaning, but language should be as precise as possible to avoid frequent misinterpretations, especially when using terms in a theological context.” Then, he suggest me to add a footnote to explain what I mean by “dematerialization” of the body at the time of the Resurrection. Here’s what he told me : “Perhaps no single word is adequate to avoid possible misinterpretations. When I write on this subject I feel more comfortable saying that “the entire human reality soul and body begins to exist outside the space time frame where physical activity takes place”, as described by science. This is the way the Catechism of the Catholic Church expresses it (nos. 996 1000 especially). Since the spirit is independent by its very nature from space time constraints, we can say that the body exists in a similar way as the spirit does.” And here’s what I wrote in the footnote that I add in my paper (based mainly on what M. Carreira told me) : “This expression should be understood in the sense of a “vanishing of the body”. And it’s important to note that, on a religious level, words like “dematerialization” or “vanishing” doesn’t mean that the body of Christ would have been “destroyed” in favor of a surviving of his soul only (like the idea we can have of a ghost, for example). Effectively, the Catechism of the Catholic Church (particularly #996–1000) indicates that, at the time of Jesus’ Resurrection, his entire human reality (body, spirit and soul) begin to exist outside the space time frame where physical activity takes place, as described by science.” I sent it to M. Carreira and I got his approval ! He said : “Yes, the footnote makes sure that the idea is not misinterpreted.” All this to say : From a Catholic theological point of view, the fact that Jesus body was not “destroyed” in favor of a surviving of his soul only (like the idea we can have of a ghost, for example), but on the contrary, that his entire human reality (body, spirit and soul) begin to exist outside the space time frame where physical activity takes place, as described by science, don’t mean at all that there was some burst of energy at that moment and that we would see some traces of this on the Shroud of Turin !!! On the contrary, the theological idea defended by the Church and M. Carreira in particular concerning the Resurrection of Christ can not allow anyone to reject the scenario #3 I described in my paper or the scenario you told me concerning the Maillard reaction (accompanied by the Resurrection of Christ) !!! I think you should left the door open concerning my third scenario (especially the sub scenario involving the Resurrection of Christ without any release of energy), as I have left the door open in my paper to the idea of an image directly produced by a supernatural event (i.e. The Resurrection of Christ). And I did that to stay honest, even if on a personal level, I really don’t think this supernatural scenario is the most probable… Meditate on all this and you’ll see that there’s no way, theologically, to reject the possibility of an image produced naturally, even in the case of the Resurrection of Christ..","date":"2012-08-10","mins":"10:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/09/off-topic-is-consciousness-fundamental/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Consciousness Fundamental?

Is Resurrection Fundamental to the Shroud Image?"},{"id":"comment-14841","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I would like to continue my exchange with Daveb because his last comment touches many interesting topics. I will answer each one of the point raised by Dave in the comment #21 that you can find above, in this page. My answer to point #1 : I’m not sure Dave if you realize the crucial importance in determining, without any serious doubt, the real chromophore of the image. The relevance of this question concerns all the proposal of image formation that have been made over the years. Effectively, there’s no doubt in my mind that if science can confirm once and for all what is the real chromophore of the image, it will then be much more easy to evaluate the real pertinence of all these image formation hypotheses that were submit over the years. And because of that, you can be sure that many of them could finally be set aside for good by science. Right now, because the promising hypothesis of the image chromophore proposed by Rogers (and backed up by many findings, facts and observations coming from the Shroud) have been questioned by Fanti and others, while they proposed another hypothesis (namely the primary cell wall of the linen fibers), it is impossible to be 100% sure, scientifically speaking, of what is the real image chromophore. Finding what it is without any more doubt would be a HUGE STEP in the comprehension of the real nature of the image on the Shroud and, as I say, would enabled science to reject many hypothesis that are still “in the air” these days. No doubt that the confirmation of the real image chromophore would seriously restrict the number of potential image formation hypotheses that could have some chances to really explain (totally or partially) the image on the Shroud. At the very least, it would indicate the right scientific direction to follow in order to finally find out what is the most probable image formation process (or processes) that have caused the image on the cloth. And think about it : if there was a scientific confirmation of the hypothesis of Rogers concerning the idea that the image reside ONLY in a thin layer of impurities on top of the fiber that are the most superficial on the cloth, without any detectable effect on the primary cell wall of the fibers, then I’m afraid (for you) that all the hypotheses of image formation that involved any kind of energetic radiation (whether it be UV light, corona discharge, protons, neutrons and even the hypothesis of an electrostatic discharge coming from a seismic activity) would have to be set aside by science or, at the very least, would then be considered as “highly improbable”. Why would it be that way ? I once got this question from no other than Thibault Heimburger and, to answer his question, I talked to him about this important quote from Rogers book : “I studied the chemical kinetics of the impurity materials and conclude that it was IMPROBABLE that the impurities had been scorched by heat or any radiation source : the crystal structure of the flax image fibers was NO MORE DEFECTIVE than non image fibers. It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” I hope you understand now the crucial importance for Shroud science to confirm or not the image chromophore hypothesis of Rogers !!! What Rogers said here is if he’s correct about the chromophore, that would mean that any form of energetic radiation would not only produced a coloration of the impurity layer but ALSO would SURELY produced noticeable defects in the primary cell wall (defects that, if we believe Rogers, are simply NOT THERE on the Shroud). And not only does Rogers said it, he experimentally showed it when he used a linen sample prepared with the same Antic method as reported by Pliny the Elder and submit it to a corona discharge ! You can read the report on this very important experiment in pages 83 to 86 of his book. After the discharge, Rogers noticed easily an oxidation of the hemicelluloses and pectines (those are the less stable elements of the primary cell wall) present under the thin layer of impurities !!! When we consider this experimental result obtained by Rogers and if we assume that he was right about the image chromophore, then it seem obvious that any form of energetic radiation (like the UV light proposed by Jackson, Di Lazzaro or Moran or the corona discharge proposed by Fanti or the protons proposed by Rinaudo or the electrostatic discharge coming from a seismic activity proposed by De Liso), in order to leave a coloration like we see on the Shroud, would not only affect the thin layer of impurities but ALSO the primary cell wall of the linen fiber. This kind of result for the primary cell wall would have been easily noticeable for an expert like Rogers, but it’s NOT what he observed concerning the image fibers on the Shroud, and it is especially true concerning the ghosts of coloration that has left a colorless, lustrous and undamaged linen fiber behind, which is a clear indicator that the primary cell wall was NOT AFFECTED by the body image formation process. All these experimental results, facts and observation concerning the body image really seem to favored greatly the hypothesis of Rogers for the image chromophore. So for me (and also for you as it seem!!!) this hypothesis MUST be considered the most probable we have for the moment. I don’t see any good reason why Shroud science should favored another hypothesis for the moment. That doesn’t mean Rogers hypothesis is surely correct, but in the present state of our knowledge versus the Shroud, this is there’s no doubt in my mind that this is the hypothesis that “fits” the best with all the known data concerning the Shroud… What Shroud science need now is another direct access to the cloth in order to see if Rogers hypothesis could be scientifically confirmed by an extensive chemical, spectroscopic and microscopic examination of colored fibers from the body image area and also of non colored fibers from other places on the cloth that were not affected by the image formation process. And while we wait for this kind of direct access to the cloth, why not trying to reproduced linen samples with the ancient method described by Pliny the Elder (and other possible ancient method that could be historically traced) and analyzed what kind of coating can be detect on the surface of the fibers and see the level of similarity in the physical and chemical nature of these non image fibers versus the data we know about the non image fibers from the Shroud ??? This kind of research COULD help to confirm even more Rogers hypothesis for the image chromophore (for exemple, these samples could be submit to the sticky tape test and see if they produced similar ghosts that were found by Rogers in non image fibers samples) and if it would be the case, that would help us to understand even more the correct physical and chemical nature of the Shroud’s fibers and that would help to understand better what is the most probable method that was used to produced the cloth. And, not the least, that would also give us another clue (one more !) that the Shroud is much older than the C14 results published in 1989. Finally, if these results would really seem to confirm that these samples are very similar in nature in comparison with the Shroud’s fibers, it would also be interesting to use them in order to verify many hypotheses of image formation. I think it is about time that science can do more laboratory experiments like that and, by doing so, push the work of Rogers even further (concerning the image chromophore first, and also concerning his Maillard reaction hypothesis). 2 Again, IF Rogers hypothesis concerning the image chromophore is correct (and presently, this hypothesis really seem to be the best we have), then it seem that all the hypothesis involving an energetic radiation that would be a by product of the Resurrection would have to be considered as “highly improbable” for all the reasons I’ve exposed in point #1 of this comment. Presently, I think it’s very premature (and highly speculative) to point out some particular characteristic of the body image and claim that it is highly improbable that it could be due to a natural process. Why ? For the simple and good reason that science has not fully tested yet (I mean under all possible laboratory conditions you can imagine and not only with some computer software, even if it is an interesting avenue of research too) every possible natural image formation process. Any good science work like this : before even thinking that there is no known natural process that can account for a particular phenomenon (or material object), a full and complete analysis MUST BE PROPERLY DONE (including real experiments done under laboratory conditions) of all the possible options involving some natural process. And presently, it is far from being the case !!! Much more researches need to be done before science can conclude that there is absolutely no known process that can account for the body image on the Shroud. Someone who would state that today would be a liar or a very naive person. I don’t think you’re one of those person Dave, since you clearly state : “Clearly the Vatican authorities are unlikely to proclaim the image as miraculous until all scientific avenues have been explored…” But be sure there’s a lot of persons in that liar (or naive) group who think (wrongly) that science has already come full circle versus this relic and his image !!! The STURP 2 direct investigation that was planed by the team between 1984 and 1988 is a very clear proof of the erroneous thinking of these people. And for what you say about personal interpretation concerning the known data from the Shroud, of course each person is free to believe what they want, but let’s never forget that these kinds of personal interpretation are not a scientific truth ! Before thinking that the image is due to a supernatural event (the Resurrection), I think someone has to be very careful, for the simple reason I just gave you (i.e. It would be highly premature for science presently to conclude that the image on the cloth cannot be explained by the know laws of nature). More researches need to be done !!! 3 Yes I have read (as promise) the paper written by De Liso and it is very far from what can be considered as a confirmation that the image on the Shroud was produced by this kind of electrostatic discharge coming from a seismic activity ! In his conclusion, De Liso wrote that he was able to obtain images with 3 D character and SOME SIMILARITIES with the Turin Shroud, during seismic radon emission, with electrostatic discharge and geomagnetic variations, near IRON MATERIAL, with infra sound emission. First, we have to understand that even if this is interesting, IF Rogers hypothesis concerning the chromophore is correct, that would mean that the coloration result obtain with this process on a linen sample of the same nature than the Shroud would surely affect not only the thin layer of impurities that would be present on top of the fibers, but ALSO the primary cell wall of the linen fiber, which would mean a discrepancy with the real nature of the body image on the Shroud ! Of course, we can be sure about that for the moment, but because of the fact that Rogers hypothesis seem to be the closest to the reality of the image chromophore of the Shroud, we have to be very cautious with such promising claims like the one made by De Liso in his paper, stating something like “I have been able to produced a SIMILAR image than the image on the Shroud” (note that Di Lazzaro made pretty much the same claim concerning his experimental results with UV lasers). In fact, if Rogers hypothesis is correct, these kind of claims (that we can also see in some papers published in the “special edition” of Fanti, by the way) are most probably incorrect versus the reality. Secondly, a human corpse is far more different than any kind of iron objects !!! Have you noticed that all these hypotheses involving some kind of electric discharge almost always rely on images produced with metallic objects ??? About that, let’s never forget what Rogers said wisely in his book : “The lower density of the hair makes it UNLIKELY that large amounts of either HEAT OR RADIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN THE HAIR. This suggests that vapor diffusion was involved in image formation, because any fibrous mat, INCLUDING HAIR, reduces the rate of diffusion of gases. Fiber mats are used for insulation, because they reduce gas diffusion and heat transfer by convection.” This is a great objection from Rogers concerning all these energetic radiation hypotheses for image formation… When someone, while using one of these energetic phenomenon, will be able to reproduced on a linen cloth the image of a wig (made of real human hair) with the same physical and chemical characteristics than the image of the hair we see on the Shroud, then maybe I’ll start to be more open on the question of whether or not an hypothesis like that can really offer a potential solution for the body image on the Shroud… Lastly, I would say that it is not because one phenomenon involving one kind of energetic radiation seem to be able to produce a real 3 D image on linen that we can conclude that this phenomenon is responsible to the image on the Shroud. Let’s never forget that the 3 D aspect of the body image on the Shroud (even if it is one of the most difficult characteristic to reproduce) represent only one particular characteristic of the image among many others and before claiming that one energetic phenomenon can produced a “similar” image on linen, it MUST be shown scientifically and without any doubt that the resulting image possess ALL the known chemical and physical characteristics of the body image on the Shroud and not just some of them, even if it is the 3 D aspect of the image. And as I said, if Rogers is right about the chromophore, then I think it would be extremely difficult for a researcher who propose an hypothesis based on any form of energetic radiation to prove that the resulting image he has produced on linen can really offer a total “match” with ALL the known characteristics of the image on the Shroud (that would include, in the case Rogers hypothesis was correct, a coloration that would rest ONLY in a thin layer of impurities while the primary cell wall of the fiber would not be affected at all by the image formation process). And to conclude this point, here’s one interesting objection that Rogers raised against the corona discharge hypothesis of Fanti and that, I believe, could be also applied directly to this hypothesis involving seismic radon emission, with electrostatic discharge and geomagnetic variations : “In order for the body to charge to a high voltage, it MUST NOT BE GROUNDED. A body insulated from limestone only by a single thickness of moist linen should be at ground potential : no corona could form. In addition, body/cloth contact would bring the two surfaces to the same potential. Even small, light, non conductive pith balls short out on contact when used to demonstrate electrostatics in elementary science classes. Because there is no such thing as a perfect insulator, materials in contact assume the same potential. Without a potential difference, IONIZATION IS IMPOSSIBLE.” Now, I’m not at all expert in the field of electrostatic but Rogers knew these kind of electric discharge VERY WELL. I think we must all take account of this important objection and believe the expert. And here’s one more very important objection that can be raised against the hypothesis of De Liso concerning seismic radon emission, with electrostatic discharge and geomagnetic variations. In the introduction of his paper, De Liso indicate that, in order for him to obtain images on linen with his electrostatic phenomenon, he had to soak the cloth with different solutions (for example, he soak some samples in water and some others in an oily solution made of aloes, myrrh and other products). This soaking of the linen cloth seems to be one major condition that MUST be reached in order for an image to form with his electrostatic discharge. Here, I’m sorry to disappoint you but the data coming from the STURP analysis really seem to show that this wasn’t the case for the Shroud when the image formation process was active. Here’s what Rogers had to say on this particular topic : “No fiber in a pure image area were cemented together by ANY FOREIGN MATERIAL, and there were NO LIQUID MENISCUS MARKS. The material that resembled bloodstains was quite different. These facts seemed to eliminate any image formation hypothesis that was based solely on the flow of a liquid into the cloth. This also suggests that, if a body was involved in the image formation, IT WAS DRY AT THE TIME THE COLOR FORMED.” Meditate on that FACT for a while and add to this the fact that STURP wasn’t able to detect on the cloth any substances that was known to be used in ancient burial rites (like olive oil, aloes, myrrh, etc.) !!! Look, even normal human sweat was not detected at all by STURP on the Shroud !!! The data from STURP really seem to indicate that the cloth AND the body had not been soaked with any known burial products in a liquid form. These data from STURP really suggest that if there ever was aloes and myrrh present in the vicinity or inside the cloth with the corpse, it must have been in solid state (maybe in powder). Here’s a reflection concerning this last quote from Rogers : I would really love to know if De Liso could honestly say that there really is a total absence of cemented fibers in the image area of his samples of linen that bears an image !!! I TRULY DON’T THINK SO !!! And the same reflection can be made from this other quotes from Rogers book : “There is NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE in crystal perfection between image and non image fibers. The image WAS NOT produced by radiation.” Again, I would really love to know if De Liso could honestly say that there really is not significant difference in crystal perfection between image and non image fibers present on his linen samples that bears an image !!! And again, I TRULT DON’T THINK SO !!! You see, before someone can proclaim that he has obtained a “similar” image on linen than the one that is on the Shroud, he SHOULD be able to scientifically PROVE that he has been able to match ALL the known characteristics of the body image that is on the Shroud ! I truly believe it is far from being the case concerning De Liso’s images on linen… And I don’t even mentioned the fact that his linen samples were surely not made with the Antic method of making linen cloth described by Pliny the Elder !!! If Rogers hypothesis concerning the image chromophore is correct, the use of modern linen samples (that surely don’t have the same thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers) would represent a very bad choice, because it would be like comparing apples and oranges ! 4 I promise I will read your paper this week. It’s interesting that we both have the same topic idea for a paper !!! I can’t wait to see your own conclusion and arguments in order to compare them with mine. As I said, you will never see me conclude in a paper like this that it is 100% sure that the Shroud is the genuine Shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. On that particular question of the identity of the man of the Shroud, since we’re dealing with probabilities and not certainties, making the kind of 100% sure claim that was once made by Fanti is simply not scientific at all ! At least, he admit this erroneous conclusion himself in his last paper… That’s a good step in the right direction. The direction being the honest quest for TRUTH regarding the Shroud instead of a subjective quest for someone’s own little truth. Final note for Dave : Our exchanges of the last few days have hallowed me to express in details my personal views concerning many important topics regarding the Shroud. And the most important one can be summarized like this : I think it’s about time that active researchers in Shroud science can put aside for 2 minutes all their different proposal concerning the image formation process in order to focus ONLY on the question of the image chromophore. Before his death, Ray Rogers proposed a VERY INTERESTING hypothesis that took account of every known facts and observations that were made concerning the body image on the Shroud (and that could even account for some observations that are not confirmed yet, like the second superficial image of the hair on the backside of the cloth) and so far, I don’t see any good reason to discard his hypothesis in favor of other possible avenues like the primary cell wall proposed by Fanti et al. I truly believe his hypothesis is the best we have right now. If Shroud science is serious in his quest for truth, his PRIORITY FOR THE MOMENT should not be to find the correct image formation process, but instead to verify scientifically (with laboratory experiments, possibly assisted by specialized software) what Rogers had proposed concerning the image chromophore. For this task, a good expert in chemistry, along with a good expert in ancient textile would surely be helpful. And the best thing about that is the fact that many interesting experiments could be done right now, even if a direct access to the cloth is not permitted by Turin. Outside a direct series of researches on the Shroud, I truly believe that it could be possible to confirm Rogers hypothesis concerning the chromophore (probably not completely but at least, a little bit more) or maybe to refine some aspects of it. It’s only when the real nature of the chromophore will be determined beyond any serious doubt that it will be time to proposed hypotheses for image formation that would be consistent with the known image chromophore, NOT BEFORE ! In my mind, the actual Shroud science act way too much in reverse. This bad tendency should be stopped. First, we have to know if Rogers hypothesis is really correct. Then, it will be much easier to judge any proposal for image formation in the light of the known image chromophore. For the moment, since we’re not even 100% sure of the real chromophore, any proposal of image formation is like a shot in the dark. Here, it’s very interesting to note that every image formation hypothesis that involved any kind of energetic radiation is based on the principle that the chromophore of the image is an oxidation dehydration of the linen fiber itself (affecting probably only the primary cell wall of the fiber) while, in the light of Rogers work, this assumption is FAR FROM BEING PROVEN ! Thanks a lot for this opportunity you gave me to express my opinion about that… I hope that some Shroud scientists will hear my call for more researches concerning the image chromophore, with a great care to verify properly Rogers hypothesis, and that many things I’ve said will be an eye opener for some people who’ll read this. Who knows ? Maybe some of them will be encourage doing more research on these subjects..","date":"2012-08-12","mins":"5:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/09/off-topic-is-consciousness-fundamental/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Consciousness Fundamental?

It’s the same thing for the legend of Veronica ! Do you know that the Veronica legend followed exactly the same path than the Mandylion ??? The first versions of the legend talked about a painted portrait of Jesus (in a few versions, Veronica painted it on a long cloth) made by Veronica herself ! And then, bizarrely, just like the Mandylion, the story changed and the painted portrait became an image not made by human hands !!! So, how can we interpret this ? In my opinion, it just show that it wasn’t uncommon to see a Christian legend change with time (probably caused by some theological teaching purpose from the Church in his fight against heretics and iconoclasts) and that certainly don’t mean that this change was caused by some new “facts” coming to light !!! To me, this same kind of change for the Veronica legend and the Abgar legend is one good clue to understand that these are just Christian tales that have nothing to do with a real miraculous event that could have happened 2000 years ago. On this subject, I truly recommand anyone to read carefully the fact #6 in my paper concerning the numerous “problematic” facts that exists versus Wilson’s hypothesis.

This historical FACT tells me that these changes (in the plural) were not driven at all by some new findings concerning the real nature of theses relics of Jesus but much more because of a change in the teaching methods of the Church (that was caused by a theological war against many heretic groups including the iconoclasts). This historical context of theological debates MUST be understand if we really want to make a proper evaluation of Wilson’s hypothesis. In fact, if there was just the Abgar legend that would have been modified like that, the possibility of a physical discovery concerning the real nature of the image would have been higher, but because this modification to the legend is not at all an isolated case, this possibility must be considered (if we stay honest versus this topic) as improbable. What is important to note is that this evaluation of mine (which is pretty much the same as many scholars outside the pro Shroud world) can be reached without taking account of all the other problematic facts regarding the hypothesis of Wilson ! When we take a global overview of all these other problematic facts, then the possibility that Wilson’s hypothesis can be correct reach the bottom of the barrel (let’s say 0.1% to stay polite). I know most people on this blog have their mind set for a very long time concerning Wilson’s hypothesis of the Mandylion (it’s true that his propaganda has work very well in Shroud circles, especially in the English speaking countries) and because of that, I will never be able to convince you of the weakness of this hypothesis, but you can be sure that I will always be there to make myself heard from you anyway, simply because I’m convinced that my point of view deserve some thoughts ! You can call this the “Don Quichotte” syndrom and I think you’re right ! ; ).","date":"2012-08-24","mins":"5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/23/scholarly-incompetence-or-dishonesty/","cat":"history","title":"Scholarly Incompetence or Dishonesty?"},{"id":"comment-15475","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Plus the fact that the Abgar legend is not the only Christian legend in history to have been modified to include an image of the face of Christ formed miraculously (the Veronica legend had been modified like that : from a painted portrait of Christ to a miraculous image on cloth), there’s also another phenomenon that is not unique to the Abgar legend and that most people don’t know : Around the same time that the Image of Edessa became known as a miraculous image (during the second half of the 6th century), two other supposed miraculous image of Christ appreared elsewhere. Maurus Green mentioned them in his 1969 paper. There was the Image of Camouliana who appeared in Constantinople in 569 and the Image of Memphis in Egypt who appeared in 570 !!! And much later, there was also the apparition of the image of the Veronica in Rome. Again, this historical FACT concerning the existence of MANY image of Christ supposedly miraculous is nothing good for the hypothesis of Wilson. My personal interpretation about that is exactly like the one I described yesterday concerning the fact that there was many Christian legends who were modified at one point to include a miraculous image of Christ, i.e. That this situation (the appearence of many miraculous images) should be related with some theological debate against some heretic groups at the time. These modifications of Christian legends (in the plural), along with the appearence of supposedly miraculous images of Christ (in the plural), should be considered as probable “teaching” (some could say a “propaganda”) tools used by the Orthodox Church to fight heresies and impose his dogmas and theological views about Christ… That doesn’t mean these views were wrong but this kind of probable acting by the Church was truly borderline (to say the least). I really think that’s the best historical interpretation we can do versus the Abgar legend and the Image of Edessa relic. NEVER forget this historical FACT : The inclusion of the story of a miraculously printed image of Christ in this legend and the suddent appearence of the Image of Edessa as a miraculous image of Christ are NOT unique cases in the history of the Orthodox Church during the Byzantine era (especially during the second part of the 6th century) !!! Again, you will never see Wilson focussing on this kind of important historical information ! Nevetheless, this multiplication of similar cases MUST raised a RED FLAG concerning the question of the authenticity of these kinds of legends and relics. For me, their authenticity are very doubtful and should be analyzed with a very critical look… Unfortunatelly, things are not like that in the English speaking pro Shroud world and Wilson can say anything he wants and used all the bad speculations extrapolations special assumptions he wants and he will always find people to listen to him and buy his books ! Incredible. The Dan Brown Syndrom is ALIVE AND WELL ! If you don’t agree with me, just let me know what differenciate Ian Wilson from Dan Brown concerning their style of writing stories mainly based on speculative arguments ?.","date":"2012-08-25","mins":"8:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/23/scholarly-incompetence-or-dishonesty/","cat":"history","title":"Scholarly Incompetence or Dishonesty?"},{"id":"comment-15523","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Dave, you remind me of most German people during the 30s who were completely brainwashed by the Nazi regime and their minister of the propaganda Goebbels ! Over the years, Wilson have been almost as good as Goebbels (and as good as Dan Brown too) to make believe irrational things to the English speaking pro Shroud fanatics and especially because the vast majority of these people don’t know one bit of the Byzantine historical and artistic context, especially the theological war that was going on when the Mandylion became known as a so called miraculous image. And you can laugh at me but it’s true anyway : it’s one of my main goal in life to demolished this bad propaganda that’s going on in the English speaking Shroud world for too many years now and tell the truth to people (even if they don’t want to hear it !!!). As I often say : Enough if ENOUGH and I just can keep quiet about that (because I know Wilson main goal as nothing to do with an authentic quest for truth by he is there mainly to search his own little truth and, along with that, why not making some money by selling books just like Dan Brown do???). You’ll see that in the upcoming paper on the subject that I co wrote with a Frenchman named Sebastien Cataldo (and that will probably come out only next winter). I hope the public will be able to see how much problematic Wilson’s hypothesis really is, especially when we consider the known historical and theological context of the 6th century. And nevermind this upcoming paper, I already said pretty much all I wanted to say about Wilson and his hypothesis in my paper on the subject that was published here on the blog (link: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/clc3a9ment questions about the mandylion hypothesis of wilson 2012 06 28.pdf) and I still wait for someone to rationally exlain all the 22 facts that really appeared problematics concerning Wilson’s hypothesis. In fact, you can consider that there is 23 problematic facts because I found one recently and publish it here on the blog (link: https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions concerning the mandylion hypothesis proposed by ian wilson/#comment 14382). What else can I say ? I think I’ll just let William Meacham tell you his own opinion about that. An opinion that I found very clever (and that is lacking of any pro Shroud bias)… Here’s a quote taken from his very good article The Authentication of the Turin Shroud : “Some of the earliest representations of Christ from the 2d to 4th centuries portray him as youthful, clean shaven, and Greco Roman; others depict a bearded, Semitic face much more akin to that of the Shroud. Beginning in the 6th century, the face of Christ in Byzantine art became highly conventionalized, with a certain resemblance to the Shroud figure. Vignon (1939) noted 20 peculiarities in the Shroud face (e.g., a transverse streak across the forehead, a V shape at the bridge of the nose, a fork in the beard, etc.) that are common in Byzantine iconography. He suggested that the Shroud might have been the source of this artistic tradition. Whanger and Whanger (n.d.), using a system of polarized light to superimpose images, found 46 points of congruence between details of the Shroud face and the face of Christ in a 6th century Mt. Sinai mosaic and 63 points of agreement between the Shroud face and the face of Christ on a 7th century Byzantine coin. In other respects, however, the Shroud image differs markedly from Byzantine art of the early centuries in revealing a dead Christ, covered with wounds and blood, nude, lacking any indication of majesty or divinity. The crucifixes and crucifixion scenes of the 5th to 8th centuries invariably show a nonsuffering, glorified Christ, eyes open, clad in a tunic, with no bleeding or signs of physical agony. Again, the evidence indicates very strongly that the Shroud image does not derive from the art of this or any era, but may be the source of certain features.” As I say, I agree completely with Meacham about that. And I would conclude this comment by saying this : It is 99.9% sure that the Mandylion is NOT the same relic as the Shroud of Turin BUT… It’s pretty evident that the Shroud had a great influence on this so called image not made by human hands. And more than that, it is also evident that the Shroud had a great influence on the Byzantine Pantocrator icons of Christ. And you can be sure also that the creation of these 2 “icons” (Mandylion and Pantocrator) had something to do with the great fight of the Orthodox Church against heresies like the Monophysism (that was Vignon hypothesis by the way) during the 5th and the 6th centuries. At that point, the official Church wanted desperately to sell the dogma of the Incarnation and also the dogma of the 2 natures of Christ to the faithful and what better object than a miraculous image of the living Christ could have been used as a teaching (some could say with some truth: “propaganda”) tool ??? The creation of the myth of a miraculous image of the face of Christ must be related with these theological debates and we can even clearly see this going on even at the time the Mandylion arrived in Constantinople when we know how to read between the lines many manuscripts written during that period (like the sermon of Gregory Referendarius), the 2 versions of the Narratio de Imagine Edessena or shortly before (like the letter of the three patriarchs). Once you understand the critical link that exist between the Mandylion (along with the Abgar legend) and the theological teaching of the Orthodox Church concerning the Incarnation and the 2 natures of Christ and when you understand also that this Mandylion Abgar legend “propaganda tool” was NOT THE ONLY TOOL that was used by the Church at that critical moment in history (a time of great theological fights against many different heresies), it’s very easy to understand that the Mandylion was not at all a real image not made by human hands but it was a pure creation of the Church who was searching a good way to fight these heretics who didn’t wanted to believe in some of his dogmas !!! THAT’S THE HISTORICAL AND THEOLOGICAL REALITY in which the Image of Edessa change from a painted portrait of Christ to a miraculous imprint of him (note : just like the Veronica vail change in the same exact manner some centuries after that). And Dave, when you say “Ian Wilson’s work changed the public perception of the Shroud, beyond all measure. From a mere object of pious devotion, the perception grew that maybe, just perhaps, this could well be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, imprinted with the true face and form of the Redeemer of mankind.”, I don’t agree. I think that it is the STURP scientific investigation that really deserves this honor. And it is mainly true concerning the English speaking countries because the Shroud was already well known in most Christian countries in Europe well before 1978 ! And I believe the reality look more like this : Wilson mainly surf of the wave created by the STURP team !!! That’s what I think. If there was not a scientific investigation by an English speaking team in 1978, do you really think Wilson’s book would have get the same level of popularity ??? Asking the question is finding already the answer, don’t you think ? ; ).","date":"2012-08-27","mins":"8:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/23/scholarly-incompetence-or-dishonesty/","cat":"history","title":"Scholarly Incompetence or Dishonesty?"},{"id":"comment-15577","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Dave, I’m sorry you let the tree hide the forest (as we say in French).

My historical research was great because it let me see the facts BY MYSELF and it didn’t took long for me to realized that the way Wilson always defend his personal hypothesis AGAINST ALL LOGIC (very often, by focussing on only a portion of the available facts while forgetting or modifying the others that are problematic for his hypothesis) was not the way any good scientist (or historian) should proceed. This was enough evidences for me to forge my opinion on that guy and realize that 1 He was not honest (at least, when it come to talk about the Mandylion and the ancient history about the Shroud). And 2 His main goal seem to be much more to seek his own truth about this relic (along with some money and success) than the real objective truth (i.e. The truth that we can traced by following honestly ALL the available FACTS no matter if they lead us to realize that our idea on a topic is most probably wrong).

Most of the time (particularly when it come to the Mandylion hypothesis), you can be sure that my opinion is in total agreement with many other scholars that are qualified in the subject we discuss… In other word, I try hard to avoid throwing freely in the air my personal opinion without any back up with solid data and/or with the opinion of credible experts in the subject. Important note : A lot of time, everything is a question of interpreting the facts and data correctly. Unfortunatelly, because of the very nature of the subject, many people’s opinion is often biased by some preconceived notions or because they already and for a long have their mind set about a particular subject.

Of course, if someone desperately want to trust Wilson AT ALL COST and stay ON THE SURFACE of this subject, that’s his problem. Note : I don’t pretend there is absolutely no link at all between the Shroud and the Mandylion. All I say is that they were 2 separate relics. My personal opinion is the same than Vignon (that can also be found in Meacham’s paper and in Maurus Green paper) : I think the Mandylion’s image was a living portrait of the face of Christ present on the Shroud.

In that part of my paper, you see the correct traduction of Mark Guscin (a true linguist) concerning the liturgical text that you refer (that is called the Synaxarion). You’ll see that this text make a clear distinction concerning the Mandylion, the Keramion and the Shroud of Christ !!! THERE’S ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. For the anonymous writer of this litugical text that was used regularly by the Byzantine Church, there was no doubt that the Mandylion, the Keramion (which was a tile bearing the same facial image than what was on the Mandylion) and the Shroud were THREE DIFFERENT RELICS and that the Mandylion, on the contrary to the Shroud, was an image showing a LIVING CHRIST and therefore, had NOTHING TO DO with a relic of the Passion of the Christ !

In death, you were put placed in the final linen shroud. A manmade tile bears your form, not made by human hands.” THIS IS THE NORMAL VERSION THAT WE FOUND IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SYNAXARION BOOKS. THIS IS THE REALITY. Choosing to put your faith in one little discordant version found in Mount Athos by Guscin instead of trusting the vast majority of other versions of this book in which we can read what I just quote remind me of another great mistake often done by those who have some biased ideas in favor of Wilson’s hypothesis : putting your trust in a very small minority of texts of the Abgar legend who seem to refers to a full size body image instead of just a facial image of Christ. Here again, there are just a handful of alternative versions (I have found two in my research and one have influenced a third one) like that in face of a very big amount of versions of the Abgar legend that clearly states that the Mandylion was a towel that bears an image of only the face of the living Christ. In fact, choosing to believe in one isolated version of the Synaxation and/or choosing to believe in two or three isolated versions of the Abgar legend instead of a vast amount of other versions of these books that state something different (i.e., that the Mandylion was a different cloth than the Shroud, that he had nothing to do with a burial cloth and that he was showing only an image of the face of Christ) is NOT the good way to do a good historical research my friend. It denote an evident bias. In reality, it is exactly the same kind of bias we can see in the anti Shroud clique who choose to put their trust only in one single data (the C14 dating of 1988) while forgetting the vast amount of data that point in the opposite direction (i.e., that the Shroud is probablyan antique cloth) ! THAT’S NOT THE PROPER WAY TO DO ANY KIND OF SCIENCE… This is called “Doing biased science” in my book and the Shroud world don’t need this. In the Shroud world, I think it’s about time we start listening to what the majority of the facts and data concerning the cloth or its history really have to tell us and follow them (no matter where they lead us) instead of just choosing some isolated “facts” that fits better with some preconceived ideas..","date":"2012-09-01","mins":"10:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/23/scholarly-incompetence-or-dishonesty/","cat":"history","title":"Scholarly Incompetence or Dishonesty?"},{"id":"comment-15710","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Carlos, I have read again the quote from the Synaxarion you gave us in the comment #40 (just above) and I wasn’t even sure that you were pointing to an alternative version found by Guscin in Mount Athos in Greece !

In all logic, I think this dead silence must be attributed much more on the truly possible hidding of the image of this bloody, naked and dead Christ by the keepers of the relic because this kind of gruesome representation of Christ didn’t fit at all with the theological teaching of the time (we can see this in the artistic trend of the time concerning the representations of Christ on the cross that always show him in glory, with his eyes wide open and with no injuries or bloodstains. Note that this look pretty much like the copies we have of the Mandylion !) and also because of the natural (and sometimes legal) repulsion that most people from Antiquity and medieval time had concerning this kind of bloody burial cloth.

The appearence of the bloodstains on the Shroud really seems to indicates : 1 that the cloth was separated from the body very soon after the deposit of the corpse inside the Shroud and before the remoistened blood clots were still humid (this is virtually impossible because in such a scenario, there would not have been enough time for any kind of natural image formation process) OR 2 that the cloth was separated from the body in such a way that, even if the blood was dry and was strongly stuck to the fabric, that separation didn’t disturbed the general appearence of the bloodstains on the cloth, which seems to be scientifically impossible to explain in such a condition. Concerning the disturbance of the bloodstains on the Shroud that could have occurred during the long history of the relic, Alan Adler was very clear about the fact that the only signs of disturbance he had detected were microscopic abrasions of the surface of the bloodstains that were mainly due to the numerous foldings and unfoldings of the cloth during the centuries. No other important signs of disturbance was detected in the bloodstains by Adler (like, for example, some wrenching signs or some holes in the bloodstains).

It’s crucial to understand this fact because it is the very best piece of evidence that the cloth was compressed on most part of the corpse at one point during the burial and at least a portion of that compression (especially on the sides of the body, including the sides of the head) MUST have been removed before the end of the burial, cause if this compression would have been kept, there’s no doubt that the body image on the cloth would have been seriously distorted laterally in many places. Also, the fact that where there was a direct contact when the image formation process was active, that’s where the body image is denser on the cloth is another very good piece of evidence that there MUST have been a change of position of the cloth at some point during the burial of the Shroud man (from a tight position to a more natural and loose position over the corpse). And what I wanted people to realize is that this FACT is in total agreement with Lavoie and Adler’s hypothesis concerning the idea that the blood we see in the hair of the Shroud man was in fact on both tempers on the corpse….","date":"2012-12-10","mins":"11:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-20113","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This is a long reply to Hugh comment #15 which may interest some other readers too (like Gabriel): Hugh, you asked for some quotes from Adler’s book concerning the signs of abrasion he detected for the bloodstains. Here they are (with some other complementary quotes) : 1 “The blood areas… shows all the characteristics that would be expected for a clot retraction transfer to a fabric. As confirmed by the probing needle, the fibers are cemented together by the applied chromophore (note: the blood material coming from exudates of humid blood clots) and show capillarity in that they penetrated to the back of the cloth. They can also be seen under the crossing threads of the weave. There is evidence of abrasion of the chromophore from the more exposed surface as would be expected if this were an applied material with mechanical characteristics different from its cloth substrate. There is a variation in the color of the adherent particles from orange yellow to deep red as would be expected for clotted blood.” 2 “…stretching causes cracking and flaking of any adherent materials such as proteinaceous blood derived materials… Low magnification micrographs of the blood image areas of the Shroud already show marked extensive abrasion of this type of damage from past rolling and folding activities.” Note: the expression “extensive” used by Adler can be misleading because it can be taken as a proof that an important part of the bloodstains were abraded by the numerous folding and unfolding of the cloth over the years. Of course, this is not what Adler meant there. His quote has to be understood at microscopic level. After that, Adler said: “Moreover, the sampling tapes demonstrate that these abraded materials have become redistributed over the entire cloth surface, leading to some confusion in assigning specific chemical structures to specific parts of the images.” 3 “All these visual characteristics are also clearly seen in the 3.6 X microphotograph, as well as the fact that the diffuse borders are not as sharp as would be expected if these transfers were of fresh blood and not a clot exudate.” Note: Here, Adler doesn’t talk about the visible well defined aspect of the bloodstains we can see with naked eyes. He’s talking about the microscopic aspect of the blood material that is stuck to the fabric and which can only be observed with a microscope.” 4 “Vignon and Barbet also noted that the blood images were forensically consistent with those of clotted blood and not a freshly flowing wounds in that they appear thickened on the edges. As blood forms a scab it contracts, thickening the edge of the scab and exuding serum onto the surface and edges of the contracting clot. This phenomenon is simply termed clot retraction and they noted that the major blood wounds (note: the side wound for example) even showed to the eye what appeared to be forensically correct serum contraction rings.” 5 “…the conditions and timing of the clotting process have been experimentally investigated to demonstrate that only clotted blood will give the type of clear unsmeared blood images seen on the cloth and therefore these wound marks are really images of CLOT EXUDATES GOTTEN ONTO THE CLOTH BY CONTACT and not whole blood images.” Note that this is not the kind of result we would see on the cloth if the wounds would have been washed and fresh post mortem blood in liquid state would have then stained the cloth, as it was wrongly proposed by Zugibe… 6 “The borders of the blood marks show the diffusive character and color gradient expected for the appearance of serum clot retraction rings.” Again, we must note that this is not the kind of result we would see on the cloth if the wounds would have been washed and fresh post mortem blood in liquid state would have then stained the cloth, as it was wrongly proposed by Zugibe… Jesus corpse was not washed at all before he was placed inside the Shroud and the very particular characteristics of the bloodstains are totally clear about that because they show the well known characteristic of a transfer of exudates of moistened blood clots and not of fresh blood coming out of freshly washed wounds. That means the corpse was still naked and covered with dirt and dried blood clots (as well as some fresh and humid post mortem blood clots coming from the side wound and the feet) at the time he was placed inside the Shroud, which clearly indicates a very hasty burial. This is totally consistent with the Gospel accounts of Jesus burial. 7 “The blood marks that appear to be on the hair without matting it together are seen to be actually on the cheeks where bloodflows from the wounds in the temples would be expected to be found. The apparent discrepancy arises from the fact that the BLOOD MARKS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CLOTH BY DIRECT CONTACT WITH CLOT EXUDATES FROM WOUNDS, while the man’s FACIAL FEATURES HAVE BEEN PROJECTED ONTO THE CLOTH BY A NON CONTACT MECHANISM OF A RADIATIONAL TYPE. Therefore, they are NOT IN STEREOREGISTER. This same evidence of non stereoregister can also be seen by careful examination of some of the scourge marks on the edges of the legs…” Note that this last observation was first reported by Miller and Pellicori of STURP in their paper about the Ultraviolet fluorescence photographs of the Shroud. Also, it’s important to note that this particular quote from Adler is in total contradiction with Mario Latendresse’s conclusion that we can found in his 2005 paper, in which he said that the bloodstains and the body image on the Shroud were imprinted on the Shroud while the it stayed all the time in the same natural draping position over the corpse. Effectively, Adler’s conclusion clearly show that, because they all came from a direct contact with the cloth, the position of the bloodstains on the Shroud is not coherent with the non distorted body image that has been formed by an image formation process that has worked at a short distance from the corpse. This non distortion imply, as Mario cleverly conclude in his paper (this was in fact a simple confirmation of Jackson et al. 3 D study for STURP), that the body image must have been produced while the cloth was loosely draped over the body in a natural position and not tightly wrapped around it, as it is often portrait in TV documentaries about the Shroud or in artworks. However, this also imply that the cloth must have been located much closer to the body at some point during the burial in order to left so many bloodstains in so many different areas of the cloth. That’s where Mario made a big mistake of interpretation… Sorry for him but because they all came from a direct contact with the cloth (this is a scientific FACT), there would NEVER have been as many bloodstains on the Shroud if the cloth would have been loosely draped over the corpse from the beginning and this position of the cloth would never have changed afterward. In other words, a shroud loosely draped over a dead body (i.e. The most probable position for the recording of the non distorted body image) would never has been able to get on it as many bloodstains as we see on the Shroud of Turin. In this context, in all the places where there would not have been a direct contact between the cloth and the corpse, NO bloodstain would have been formed on the cloth. IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT AND THIS IMPLY THAT A CHANGE OF POSITION OF THE CLOTH MUST HAVE OCCURRED AT SOME POINT DURING THE BURIAL OF THE SHROUD MAN. Nevertheless, you must note that, just like Mario, I don’t agree at all with Lavoie’s conclusion that this non stereoregister of the bloodstains and body image must be due to a probable supernatural event that has flattened the Shroud prior to the formation of the body image (note that the same kind of supernatural hypothesis as also been proposed by people like Isabel Piczek). No, in fact I firmly think that a much more rational and simple explanation exist for this particular observation and this imply a manual and/or weight compression of the cloth at some point during the burial of the Shroud man that was soon followed in many places by a removal of this compression that lead to a re positioning of the Shroud in a more natural and loose configuration over the corpse. This change of position of the cloth around the body probably occurred near the end of the burial, just after the enshrouded body was transferred from a central room inside the tomb to his final resting place on a stone bench carved out in one of the wall of the tomb, while the blood clots were still humid (which had the effect of not disturbing the fresh new bloodstains on the cloth). This is by far a the most rational explanation that exist to explain the non stereoregister of the bloodstains and body image that has been detected on the Shroud and there’s absolutely no doubt that it is not as strange as the one proposed by Lavoie, which imply a direct act of God at the time of the Resurrection… To conclude, note also that Adler was a teammate of Lavoie in the study that showed quite clearly that the Shroud must have been in direct contact at some point with the sides of the face and this is what has caused the blood clots that were originally on the tempers of the Shroud man to eventually appears in the long and loose hair on both side of the face in the final image. Note also that Alder, unlike Lavoie, as never claimed that the Shroud must have been completely flattened during the formation of the body image and I truly believe that he never agreed with such a supernatural hypothesis… He never said it publicly (to my knowledge), but it’s probable that is idea was not very different from mine (i.e. That the compression that is responsible for the numerous bloodstains on the cloth must have been changed at some point during the burial of the Shroud man to become more natural and loose over the body). Hugh, you said : “That seems to me remarkably little to be extracted from a ‘whole’ bloodstain.” My answer : This is normal since the sticky tape samples were only able to collect loose material from the surface of the Shroud, including some “debris” coming from the bloodstains, which are in fact some tiny parts of the bloodstains that were removed from the surface of the bloodstains by abrasion each time the cloth was folded and unfolded over the years. So, you can never expect this particular sampling method to remove a whole bloodstain or a major part of it from the surface of the cloth because these bloodstains are well stuck to the fabric and have even soak through the cloth (i.e. The blood material that formed these stains is not only located on the surface of the fabric). And by the way, this is exactly what was expected by STURP because they didn’t want to use harmful methods of sampling that could have change drastically the blood or body image imprints on the cloth. Hugh, you said : “Furthermore, the pale weave of the cloth is plainly visible over every one of the stains. If this is abrasion of the surface, it is far from microscopic, and if not, then where did the blood which originally covered the threads go?” My answer : What you describe is not abrasion of the surface of the bloodstains but the residual blood material that first stained the surface of the fabric but which very soon penetrated the cloth often through the whole thickness of the cloth (in these numerous cases, the blood material is visible also on the reverse side of the Shroud. To conclude this long comment, I just want to share a reflection with all of you. It’s a bit off topic but nevertheless, it’s worth the reading ! Here it is: We often hear or read that the body image on the Shroud of Turin is unique and that should be seen as a proof that it came from a very extraordinary event. I disagree completely with this line of thinking. Here’s what I would say instead: No one has the right to say that the body image on the Shroud is unique and extraordinary for the simple and good reason that we don’t have another example of a well preserved antique burial cloth of a scourged and crucified man that only covered this corpse for less than 72 hours (i.e. Before the arrival of the first liquid of putrefaction). Because of this, we can’t be certain (scientifically speaking) if such a body image is really a unique case in history and if the same environmental, biological and clothing conditions would have been also present in the case of another crucified body, a similar image (along with many bloodstains and scourge marks) would not have been formed on the surface of his grave cloth. In fact, regarding the Shroud, it would be much better to say this : The uniqueness of the Shroud of Turin don’t really come from the body image or bloodstains that are present on the cloth but much more from the simple fact that such a gruesome burial cloth of a real scourged and crucified man, which is covered with bloodstains and scourge marks, has been kept and well preserved for centuries until this day. For me, THAT IS THE TRUE UNIQUENESS OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN. And along with the undisturbed aspect of the bloodstains, this can be seen as the greatest SIGN (not proof!) of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. In sum, the presence of the Shroud with us IS the TRUE SIGN! I don’t think we have to search elsewhere… In sum, if the Shroud of Turin is not the real burial cloth of Jesus Christ, why someone would have dared to conserved such a gruesome cloth? As the mother of Barrie Schwortz once told him very cleverly: “They wouldn’t have kept it for 2000 years if it wouldn’t belong to Jesus!” SHE WAS DAMN RIGHT AND UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY THE REAL MEANING OF THE PRESENCE OF THE SHROUD WITH US TODAY (i.e. That there was at least one of Jesus disciple who was so convinced after Easter morning that he was Resurrected from the dead that he dared keeping such a gruesome burial cloth even if it was against Jewish Law)! As Barrie said in interview: Not bad for an old Jewish mom! Effectively… It’s important to note that, in itself, this doesn’t prove the Resurrection but it’s still very important because it proves that there was at least one person after Easter morning that was truly convinced this event was real! In sum, we can say that the fact that Shroud has been kept and well preserved during 2000 years constitutes a TESTIMONY of the Resurrection of Christ as strong as the Gospels themselves! Now, every person is free to believe this very particular testimony or not and there will NEVER be a scientific proof that will comes from the shroud to force them to believe in it. That’s called “LIBERTY OF CHOICE” (or liberty of conscience if you prefer) and that’s one of the most important principle defended by the God of Jesus Christ who’s called Love. END OF MY PREECH ON THE SHROUD… for today at least! ; ).","date":"2012-12-09","mins":"6:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-19944","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I truly think Mario’s challenge concerning Lavoie’s hypothesis is totally wrong because he didn’t understand correctly the blood transfer that occurred on the Shroud, which mostly came from exudates of humid blood clots. As anyone here knows, Mario, unlike Gilbert Lavoie, is not at all a medical or blood expert, so I think we can excuse his erroneous thinking about that important aspect of the Shroud… In sum, what Mario truly don’t understand is the SCIENTIFIC FACT that ALL THE BLOODSTAINS on the cloth comes from A DIRECT CONTACT ! Look carefully at the Shroud and it’s EVIDENT that the cloth was once tightly compressed with the vast majority of the corpse during the burial and then, this compression was released in many places. In other words, there MUST HAVE BEEN A CLOSE CONTACT with almost every part of the corpse in order to leave so many bloodstains on the cloth that came from exudates of blood clots (which cannot be transferred on a linen cloth otherwise than by a direct contact and in many cases, some kind of pressure on the cloth is even necessary to get the so well defined blood imprints we see on the Shroud). The bloodstains and scourge marks that are located in places of the cloth where there is no body image at all is the most important fact that strongly suggest that there really was a change of position that occurred during the burial, i.e. From a generally tightly compressed position (responsible for the presence of most bloodstains on the cloth) to a more loose position that allowed an image formation without important distortions. In that context where an evident change of position occurred, I think Lavoie’s hypothesis is highly probable. Here we have to understand one important thing : most of the medical expert agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get superficial blood flows like we see on top of the loose long hair on both sides of the face if there is no important pressure applied on the cloth. For example, we can see blood flows like this on the backside of the head because there was an important body weight pressure. But on the sides of the face, it’s impossible for the cloth to have been tightly compressed on the hair when the image formation process was active, because if it would have been that way, the resulting image would have been highly distorted laterally. I think Mario should realized that he was most probably correct in his paper versus the fact that the cloth was loosely draped over the corpse during the image formation process but that he was dead wrong concerning the idea that there was no change of position during the burial… This particular conclusion is totally contradicted by the FACT that there is bloodstains in almost every parts of the Shroud, which means (and this is what Mario don’t understand) that there was once a DIRECT CONTACT in ALL THESE PLACES between the corpse and the Shroud, including where we see some BLOODSTAINS IN PLACES WHERE THERE IS NO BODY IMAGE. And in the end, if the Shroud would have been kept in a close proximity like that with the body when the image formation occurred, great distortions and possibly also some image saturation, would have happened, which is not the case. In sum, here’s my personal conclusion (after a long reflection where I considered all the most important facts regarding the blood on the Shroud) : The conjuncture created by the presence of numerous bloodstains and scourge marks on almost every parts of the body image, the presence of some bloodstains and scourge marks located outside the body image, the presence of some scourge marks under the knees where no body image has been formed on the cloth, the fact that each one of these bloodstains or scourge marks was formed by a direct contact between the body and the cloth and the quasi total absence of distortion and saturation in the body image strongly suggest that at some point during the burial of the Shroud man and certainly before the image formation process really began, the very tight position of the Shroud around the body was changed manually to become more natural (i.e. A looser draping over the body without the use of any fastening). Please note that Lavoie’s hypothesis is truly consistent with this conclusion of mine….","date":"2012-12-06","mins":"6:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-20155","author":"yannick_clément","post":"What is also important to understand versus these quotes from Adler is the fact that the bloodstains on the Shroud are fragile (especially their exposed surface) as we can expect of real bloodstains on a linen cloth and the fact that many tiny particles of blood have been found in almost every sticky tapes collected by STURP is a proof that there has been an important microscopic abrasion of the surface of the bloodstains on the Shroud, which mainly comes from the numerous folding and unfolding of the cloth over the years. It’s also interesting to note that things are completely different concerning the body image and Alder talk also about that in his book. Effectively, he noticed that the coloration that produced the body image is very stable and has not been altered in any way by the vagaries that have affected the cloth over the centuries.

Note that the possible released of ammoniac gases inside the Shroud could have come from two sources : 1 from the pores of the skin and from the nose and mouth (as described by Rogers) and 2 from the urea that would have been left on the skin of the Shroud man after the abundant sweat that covered his dead body would have completely dried. In sum, this truly possible released of ammoniac gases (as well as maybe some other post mortem gases) inside the Shroud soon after the body was placed in it can well be the main reason why so many dried blood clots were eventually able to left a mirror imprint on the Shroud and also why a faint image of the body would have been left on the cloth… I don’t say that a released of ammoniac is the only factor that can explain both the bloodstains and the image on the cloth, but I really believe it was a major factor in both types of imprints….","date":"2012-12-07","mins":"4:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-19998","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Last precision : In the point #2 of the hypothesis I described above, when I talk about the possible release of ammoniac gases and/or other post mortem gases and/or heat and/or water vapor, I want to make sure you understand that I’m talking about gases and/or heat that come from the tortured and crucified body and nothing else… I just wanna make sure you get me right about that..","date":"2012-12-07","mins":"6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-16761","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Dan said : ” I now agree that the much mentioned topless square between the eyebrows that we see on the shroud is probably the result of vertical banding.” Please folks, be serious and honest for once !

Personally, I favored the dating of 521 526 because I have read here (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Christus Ravenna Mosaic.jpg) that this very particular artwork (that could well be the ancestor of the Pantocrator icons in the Byzantine world) is said to have been completed within 526 AD by the so called “Master of Sant’Apollinare”. Of course, it is also possible that the artwork was done after the Byzantine took the city in 540 and the upper date 547 could still be true.

It is a FACT that both historians never said a damn word about the Mandylion in the part of their manuscripts where they described that flood ! If the Mandylion would have been discovered during that catastrophic event, you can be CERTAIN that these 2 highly respected historians would have talked about that. Look, even ca. 550, Procopius of Cesarea was not aware of the presence of any miraculous imprint of Jesus face in Edessa while he was writting about the Persian invasion of 544 !!! On that base, can’t you realized that this concept of an image of Christ not made by human hands only surfaced in Edessa AFTER that time ??? The miraculous imprint of Christ COULD NOT have became publicly known prior to that date of 550 and that’s a fact !

For Rogers, this banding effect on the Shroud is a good sign of the very old age of the Shroud because it seem to come from an ancient technology of making linen cloths that was dropped during the 8th century and that consisted to bleach linen threads by batch before the weaving, which caused slight differences in the quantity of impurities that would be left on top of the linen fibers. And if Rogers was right, this banding effect had a big influenced in the image formation process because tonality of the image seem to be directly proportional to the tonality of the bands. The outcome of this ancient way to bleach the threads was a final cloth showing bands of different tones. For example, the Holland cloth (ancient back up cloth for the Shroud) is a medieval cloth for sure and don’t show this banding effect, most probably because this cloth was bleached only one time at the end of the weaving, once the cloth was final..","date":"2012-09-25","mins":"3:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-17095","author":"yannick_clément","post":"I should have written “Sorry Wilson but your Mandylion not made by human hands only appeared in Edessa during the second half of the 6th century AT BEST and there was already some artworks obviously based directly on the Shroud or indirectly based on a copy of the Shroud’s face WELL BEFORE THAT TIME !!!!

So, here it is again : On the internet, while doing my research for my upcoming paper, I have found that the most probable dating for this first known image of the Christ in Majesty (the one from Ravenna) is 521 547, with a good probability that this was done prior to the death of the Ostrogoth king Theodoric the Great who completed the building of the Basilica of Ravenna in 526, the same year he died. Personally, I favored the dating of 521 526 because I have read here (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Christus Ravenna Mosaic.jpg) that this very particular artwork (that could well be the ancestor of the Pantocrator icons in the Byzantine world) is said to have been completed within 526 AD by the so called “Master of Sant’Apollinare”. Of course, it is also possible that the artwork was done after the Byzantine took the city in 540 and the upper date 547 could still be true. BUT THE THING IS THIS : The Mandylion was NOT discovered in 525 as Wilson wrongly try to make believe ! This is another very good example of the great intellectual dishonesty of this author and it’s truly disgusting. He knows as well as me that both ancient historians Procopius of Cesarea and Evagrius Scholasticus NEVER said that this relic had been discovered during the great flood in Edessa in 525 and so, even if these 2 ancient historians did mention the flood in their work !!! It is a FACT that both historians never said a damn word about the Mandylion in the part of their manuscripts where they described that flood ! If the Mandylion would have been discovered during that catastrophic event, you can be CERTAIN that these 2 highly respected historians would have talked about that. Look, even ca. 550, Procopius of Cesarea was not aware of the presence of any miraculous imprint of Jesus face in Edessa while he was writting about the Persian invasion of 544 !!! On that base, can’t you realized that this concept of an image of Christ not made by human hands only surfaced in Edessa AFTER that time ??? The miraculous imprint of Christ COULD NOT have became publicly known prior to that date of 550 and that’s a fact ! And nevertheless, BEFORE that time, there was already at least one artwork (the one of Ravenna) that was showing a bearded Christ with long hair depiction that was obviously based (directly or not) on the Shroud’s face !!!

Among many other things pointed out by Vignon, in almost every copies of these 2 forms of Byzantine depictions of Christ’s face, we can clearly see the 2 ear lobes which are not covered by the hair !!! And here’s another question for you : Can you see the ears on the Shroud ? ABSOLUTELY NOT !

Procopius talk about the Persian invasion of 544 and did mentioned the letter of Christ to Abgar (which are part of the original version of the Abgar legend) and said that this was this Holy Letter who saved the city from the Persian ! He NEVER talks about a miraculous cloth. Clearly, this relic was simply not there at the time of the invasion. As I said, some scholars thinks that this is a later addition in Evagrius manuscript that was made by the Church to back up the miraculous story of the Mandylion. 4 There is absolutely no ancient writers (and no ancient historians like Evagrius or Procopius) that mention the presence of the Mandylion before 544 and as I said, it’s clear that this relic was NOT in Edessa BEFORE ca. 550. These are the facts. And because of the Vignon’s markings, there’s a very high probability that the Shroud served as a (direct or indirect) source for the creation of the Ravenna mosaic.

Freeman’s clearly indicates (and that’s the most important thing to note) : There’s absolutely no written reference for the presence of the Image in Edessa prior to the Persian failed invasion of 544 and even then, we know for a FACT that this dating that is found in the manuscript of Evagrius is incorrect because of the manuscript of Procopius, who was an authentic historian who described in length this failed invasion of the Persian without ever making any reference to the presence of a miraculous image in the city at the time. Since Procopius have written his manuscript ca. 550, since he did mentioned the letter send by Jesus to king Abgar (which was part of the original version of the Abgar legend), since he never said a damn word about the Image of Edessa (Mandylion) and since he indicates that it was this letter at the time who served as a palladium for the city and was responsible for the victory of the Edessenian people against the Persian army, it is CLEAR that this miraculous image could not have appeared in Edessa before ca. 550. And since we know for a FACT that the Ravenna mosaic was made during the first half of the 6th century, it is sure that it was done BEFORE this Image of Edessa became known. On that solid base, it is easy to understand the extreme weakness of Wilson’s hypothesis ! As I said to Dan yesterday, and you must believe me, after my long inquiry on the subject, if I was convinced that Wilson’s hypothesis had some chances to be correct, be sure that I would be the first to strongly defend it publicly. But the reality is precisely the opposite of that ! In my paper on the subject that I posted in late June on the blog, I described 22 problematic facts concerning Wilson’s hypothesis ! 22 !!! Not 3 or 4 but 22 !!!! And since that time, I already found 3 more problematic facts (the one concerning this Ravenna mosaic being the most recent in the list) !!! So, the count is now 25 !!!! Isn’t that enough for you to realize that Wilson’s hypothesis must be considered highly unlikely at best (and in my mind, I would say “impossible” !) ??? I think any reasonable person without any pro Wilson bias would understand that… To conclude, I want to say this very important comment : In the end, I don’t care too much if Wilson want to sell is crazy ideas to the public. We live in a free world right ? But what enraged me is the FACT that this extremely weak hypothesis has been defended blindly and without any critical sense by a lot of pro Shroud researchers over the years (some of them being real historians !), which gave a smell of propaganda to the whole issue ! Since I seek only the truth regarding any aspect of the Shroud (whatever this truth can be), I simply cannot accept this situation. I’m very sad for all the people who knows not much in history and who have been fooled by Wilson’s ideas, which were bring forward by many pro Shroud people over the years. THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO FIGHT. In the end, the only thing I want is this : to open the eyes of people over this hypothesis that has been often presented in the pro Shroud circles just like an accepted theory, which is VERY far from being the case.

Look at the arms, the head and the forehead! Have you noticed how little bloodstains there are in these areas? Nevertheless, there too, we must presume that, at the time of death, not an inch of the arms was probably free from bloodstains resulting from the blood flows that were coming out of the nail wounds and not much of the entire head and forehead area was free from bloodstains coming from the puncture wounds of the cap of thorns. But nevertheless, there only seem to be some clotted blood flows that were able to leave a mark on the cloth in these areas. In order to explain this (which, at first sight, must be seen as being as strange as the absence of blood flows in the regions where there were scourge hits), I hope no one will pretend that the arms and the head were washed too before the corpse was laid in the Shroud! Because of the presence of clear blood flows in those area that are consistent with the vertical position of crucifixion, it’s evident that the arms and the whole head area where not washed! Because we must find a proper solution for both the absence of many presumed blood flows on the arms, the head and the forehead and also the absence of presumed blood flows in the regions where there have been some scourge hits, I’m affraid the defenders of Zugibe’s hypothesis will have to look elsewhere with me to find the correct answer… I think many people in the Shroud world (beginning with Zugibe himself) have made the error of focussing only on the question regarding the blood transfer coming from the scourging, while leaving aside the question regarding the absence of many presumed blood flows in the arm, the head and the forehead region. Sorry but if someone want to find the solution for one “anomaly” on the Shroud, his solution must also account for the other anomalies of the same kind that are also present on the Shroud… So, any guess folks? Remember that when we take into account all the pertinent data and observations coming from STURP, there is absolutely no good reason to think that the blood transfers that happened in the arm, the head and the forehead regions were any different than the blood transfers in the shape of a dumbbell that happened in the areas where there were some scourge hits. Note : Tomorrow, I will give you my own hypothesis that can possibly account for the absence of many presumed blood flows in the arms, the head and the forehead regions as well as the absence of presumed blood flows in the regions where there have been some scourging.

My hypothesis: The time factor! Effectively, since there is almost no pre mortem blood flows on the Shroud, except for some in the arms, the head and forehead regions, we must assume that those blood flows that were able to leave a precise imprint of themselves on the cloth were the last blood flows to happened before death (maybe no more than one or two hours before death or even less; who knows?). Consequently, we must assume that all the other presumed blood flows in these areas, along with all the presumed blood flows in the regions where there were some scourge hits, were all completely dry for too many hours in order to be able to get humidified again and leave their mark on the cloth. So, even if, later on, there was an income of humidity on top of these dried stains, none of them were able to leave a clear mark on the cloth. They were just too dry! That could explain why, in these areas of the Shroud, there appear to be much less bloodstains than we might think. If I’m right about that, we must then assume that only the blood that have dried for less than some time (a time which still need to be determined) have been able to get re moistened enough on their surface to left a good mirror imprint on the Shroud. Some will surely tells me: and what about all the different bloody wounds that were able to leave their mark on the cloth, especially the scourge wounds in the form of a dumbbell? Don’t you think those should have been dry for a very long time before the death of the Shroud man (nearly as long, in fact, as the presumed blood flows from the scourging)? I would say this: Not necessarily! In his book, doctor Pierre Barbet noted that, in the context of a Roman crucifixion, it is truly possible that most of these scourge wounds got infected, which would have the direct effect of keeping them somewhat humid, with a possible oozing of liquid (probably lymph with maybe some other biological substances from the blood like plasma). So, I really think it’s possible that all the wounds of the Shroud man, including the ancient scourge wounds, could have stayed humid for enough time before they dried; so much that their complete drying possibly happened many hours after the scourging (and not necessarily long before death), which could have allowed all of them to get re moistened once the body was laid inside the Shroud (or maybe before this enshrouding), with the result that we still see today : a lot of precise scourge marks in the shape of a dumbbell, surrounded almost every time by a clear halo of serum, which were all formed with exudates of re humidified blood clots. That’s it for the summary of my hypothesis concerning the bloodstains that we see on the Shroud versus the presumed very bloody appearance of the Shroud man at the moment he died (much more in fact than what we see on the Shroud). Complementary note: I know some of you (including Zugibe who base part of his reflection on this argument) will object this: But how the body image could have been formed in these areas if they were all covered with dried blood clots? Is it not a fact that the bloodstains and the serum stains on the Shroud were enough to prevent the formation of a body image? Is it not a fact that these stains on the cloth acted like a protective shield against the image formation process? I would answer: yes, of course! But ONLY for sure in the case of a bloodstains present on the cloth! There is absolutely no proof that this was also true for a dried bloodstain on the skin or on the hair! Thinking otherwise (like Zugibe did in his paper) is committing a sin of free extrapolation my friends, which have no real solid scientific base… Why? Simply because we don’t know the exact image formation mechanism! Question: What can make you think that this image formation process could have been blocked by the presence of dried blood clots on the skin or on the hair? For example, if the natural hypothesis of John De Salvo or the one proposed by Ray Rogers is correct (or just partially correct) and the image formation process is a direct result of an interaction between the surface of the cloth and some post mortem gases and/or molecular transfer (urea and/or lactic acid for example), then we must assume that this kind of biological release of gas and molecules would not have been restricted to the portion of the skin or the hair free from blood, but would have been also released at the surface of the dried blood clots present on the skin and on the hair… Remember that the surface of these dried blood clots would have been in direct or very close contact with the surface of the cloth, without any “protective shield” between them to prevent the formation of an image on the cloth. And if we assume that most of the post mortem gases and or molecular transfer could have come from some biological products (like urea and/or lactic acid) that were first present in the abundant sweat of the crucified man and that would have been left everywhere on the skin and on the hair (AND ALSO ON DRIED BLOOD CLOTS PRESENT ON THE SKIN) after the drying of this high amount of sweat (after death), then it’s pretty easy to understand that the dried blood clots would not have acted like a “protective shield” in the way the bloodstains on the cloth did during the image formation process. In such a context of a completely natural process of image formation coming mainly from the biological products left on the skin, the hair and the dried blood clots after the drying of the abundant sweat of the crucified man, there would have been no difference whatsoever if these reactive products would have been deposited on the skin or the hair that was free of blood or on the surface of the dried blood clots. The result would have been exactly the same! Note that I’m not sure at all that it would have been the same if the image formation would have come from a burst of high energy or from light coming from the dead body! Effectively, in this case, I’m pretty the dried blood clots present on the skin would have indeed acted like a “protective shield” and prevent the formation of a body image in these areas… But in the case of the natural process I just described that would have mainly come from the products left on the skin, the hair and the dried blood clots by the drying sweat, we have to assume that these products would have been present between these dried clots and the surface of the Shroud without any “screen” in between, and therefore, there would have been absolutely no “protective shield” between them to prevent the formation of what appear today as the skin or the hair of the Shroud man, but that were probably dried blood clots that were stuck to the skin or the hair instead in many places. The result of the image formation process would not have been clear enough to enable us to see the difference… So, whether it was a portion of the skin or the hair that was free from blood or a portion of the skin or the hair that was stuck with dried blood clots, the end result would have been exactly the same, i.e. A dehydration of a tiny layer of impurities on the top surface of the cloth (only in the zones where no bloodstains were able to form on the cloth prior to the beginning of the image formation process). That’s my hypothesis. In my mind, if this hypothesis of mine is correct concerning the blood transfer that occurred on the Shroud, then it could be seen as another indirect confirmation that the image formation process was most probably natural and would have mainly come from some reactive biological products left on the skin, the hair and the dried blood clots after the drying of the abundant sweat of the crucified man… And if I had to summarize my hypothesis in a few words, I would say this: All the pre mortem blood stains we can see on the Shroud (including the blood flows of the arms, head and forehead regions and also the dumbbell shaped scourge marks) come most probably from the blood that was still not completely dry at the moment of death and also from the blood that had dried not very long before death (with a upper limit of time after drying still undetermined). All these bloodstains would have been able to get re moistened (or humidified even more) before or more probably after the corpse had been laid inside the Shroud and this re moistening would have been probably caused by the release of water vapors from the dead body, along with maybe the presence of some moistening agent present in some burial products and, more probably, the presence of a high amount of natural humidity inside the Shroud and inside the tomb. One thing I hope is that you will be honest enough to recognize that my hypothesis is one of the few that can naturally account for all the pre mortem bloodstains on the cloth, as well as for the absence of a lot of presumed bloodstains that should have been present on the skin or the hair of the Shroud man at the moment of his death (especially in the regions of the arms, the head, the forehead and the areas where there were scourge hits)… And for the post mortem bloodstains, it is not hard to believe that most of them were still not completely dry when the body was placed inside the Shroud, so that they were all able to leave a good imprint on the cloth. Ok, that’s it for the moment… Now, it’s up to you to reflect upon this and tell me what you think! Thank you!.","date":"2013-07-17","mins":"8:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"id":"comment-39126","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Thank you.

Here it is: there are some scourge marks very near the post mortem bloodstains that came from the side wounds, and this is true not only in the chest area but also in the lower portion of the back region where there are some blood flows coming from the same side wound on the chest. If you look at positive photo of Durante on the Shroud Scope (sindonology.org) or if you have the new application that show the Shroud in HD, you just have to look at the region of the post mortem blood flows in the lower back region (dorsal view) to see that it’s true. In that region, you will easily noticed some scourge marks that are located very near the border of the post mortem blood flows. On the Shroud Scope, when can do measurements and I have found out that one scourge mark in particular is at less than 2 cm of the margin of a post mortem blood flow! If this is not immediately adjacent, then I don’t know what it can be called! Also, in the vicinity of the blood flows that are located under the side wound in the chest region, there are some scourge marks that also seem to be located very near the border of these post mortem blood flows, even though I have to admit that, because of the water stain present there and also because the scourge marks of the frontal side are generally more superficial (certainly due to the lack of body weight pressure on the cloth there), it is a lot harder to really distinguish them with great certainty. Nevertheless, to my eyes, it really seem to be some scourge marks present in that region that are not far away from the post mortem blood flows under the side wound. For example, one that I can distinguish easily is located at more or less 5 cm from the side wound itself (this scourge wound is located directly over the side wound), which is pretty close and there seem to be some more that are even closer… So, after having seen these few example, I would like to hear the defenders of Zugibe’s hypothesis (like jesterof and Ron) explanation versus the presence of these few scourge marks that are immediately adjacent to a post mortem blood flow on the cloth… Good question: How in the world can we believe that there was a partial washing there that was so meticulously done that it succeed to clean these clotted scourge wounds that are located very close to a post mortem bloodstain (remember that it was against the Jewish Law to wash this post mortem blood)? In other words, how can a partial washing done in haste could have been so precise that it would have caused the same oozing of blood material from the washed scourge wounds everywhere we see markings like that on the cloth, and especially in these region located that are immediately adjacent to some post mortem blood flows? I just cannot imagine the few people who were there for the hasty burial being as meticulous with a sponge as a surgeon with a scalpel!!! Imagine the risk of disturbing the post mortem blood flows if they would have acted like that ! Again, we must remember that it was against Jewish Law to remove any post mortem bloodstain on the body of a dead man, even more when this man was a crucified man. Seriously, you really believe that these people could have been so precise in the case of a partial washing done in haste while the Sabbat was approaching fast while, at the same time, taking a high risk of disturbing the post mortem blood flows that were left on the chest and on the lower back region? Let me laugh… In all logic, if Zugibe was right about the blood transfer of the scourge wounds and if a partial washing wound have been done while making sure that no post mortem bloodstains would be touched, we would surely not see any scourge marks in the vicinity of the post mortem blood flows in the chest area, as well as the lower back region. There would surely be an evident space of many inches (if not a feet or more) that would be free of any scourge mark, because the washing would never have been done in the regions that were close to a post mortem blood flow. So, I think that, along with the finding of evident traces of dirt in the knee area, the fact that there are some scourge marks located very close to some post mortem blood flows on the Shroud is well enough to understand that Zugibe was most probably wrong about the idea of a partial washing that would have caused the formation of all the scourge marks on the Shroud… Final note: In all logic, it’s impossible to believe that the re opening of the scourge wounds when they removed the tunic of the Shroud man just prior to his crucifixion has been an essential parameter for the fact that these wounds were able to stained the cloth, for the simple and good reason that it’s evident that the removing of that kind of tunic would not have cause that kind of re opening everywhere we see some scourge marks, especially in the region of the legs on the frontal and the dorsal part of the body… Again, it’s pretty evident that most of the scourge wounds in that region would not have stuck hard to that kind of long tunic and, consequently, we must assume that the removing of this cloth would not have been enough to re open those wounds. Nevertheless, these particular scourge wounds were able to leave the SAME KIND of good dumbbell shape imprints on the cloth, proving that the re opening theory is most certainly false, in the sense that it is surely not the principal reason that can explain the presence of all the scourge marks on the Shroud. Because all the scourge marks on the cloth are showing the same quality of precision, I still believe my hypothesis (which mainly comes from Barbet’s own hypothesis) is the best to explain their presence almost everywhere on the cloth (particularly for those that are located in the region of the legs and those that are located very near a post mortem blood flow). I can be wrong on this subject of course, but seriously, I really think my hypothesis concerning all the blood transfers to occured on the Shroud (and especially those that concern the scourge wounds) has some pretty good chances to be correct and I really think it would deserve to be tested under proper lab control by some CSI experts..","date":"2013-07-19","mins":"10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"id":"comment-39052","author":"yannick_clément","post":"The simple fact that evident traces of dirt were found in the ankle and in the knees régions is enough to understand that the body was NOT washed and this is totally consistent with an hasty burial, just like it is reported by the Gospels for Jesus.

If this author would really have wanted to physically described the Shroud, his story would have taking place during the Passion of the Christ and Jesus would have wipe all his body with the cloth and the author would have surely specified that the image was complete. It’s not at all what goes on in the Acts of Thaddeus ! The action is located during Jesus ministry while he was alive and well and it is clear that he just washed and wipe his face (and nothing else) with the cloth ! I think if you got 2 cents of intelligence folks, you’ll agree with me that Wilson’s hypothesis versus this bizarre word of tetradiplon is taken completely out of context and cannot in any way be interpreted as a reference to the Shroud of Turin ! This is just ludicrous versus the context of the manuscript where this word is used. Again, why making a bizarre reference to the dimensions of the Shroud while completely avoiding the presence of a complete body image and the reality that it is a burial shroud and not just a normal towel ??? Sorry but there’s no way to answer this question rationally !!! All you can do is making a bunch of wild speculation to, again and again, try to save Wilson’s hypothesis. I just can’t believe my eyes to see how many people DESPERATELY WANTS this hypothesis to be good while it is obvious that it is not and while the fact that Wilson is most probably wrong doesn’t mean at all that the Shroud is not genuine !!! I just don’t understand, except for the fact that most people will never be willing to change their mind once it is made up.

Effectively, WELL AFTER the story of the tetradiplon and the miraculous imprint of the FACE (not the body, just the face) of Jesus on the cloth, in a complete different part of the manuscript of the Acts of Thaddeus where Thaddeus is teaching King Abgar about the Christian doctrine, here’s what Thaddeus said to the king : “And on the third day before dawn He rose, leaving His burial clothes in the tomb.” I’m sorry but this reference to the burial clothes (in the plural) of Jesus in the tomb have NOTHING TO DO with the tetradiplon cloth bearing the image of only the face of the LIVING Christ ! I’m a bit mad against myself for having completely forgotten to add this great FACT in my paper against Wilson. Thank you M. Freeman for having bring this up !!! Of course, Wilson don’t say a damn word about that part of the text because it’s evident that it would destroy any credibility in his hypothesis versus the tetradiplon cloth !!! It’s incredible how this person is doing bad history in order to defend at all cost is hypothesis… THAT’S NOT THE WAY GOOD HISTORICAL RESEARCH IS MADE ! This later reference to the burial clothes (in the plural) plus the fact that the story of the tetradiplon cloth is located during Christ ministry when he was alive and well and only wash his face with the cloth is well enough to understand that the author of the text NEVER intend to link this tetradiplon cloth to the Shroud of Christ ! To conclude, may I suggest to Ron, Max and all the others who defend Wilson’s ideas (or part of his ideas) to read again (or read for the first time) the reflection I wrote yesterday and that you find here: https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon so how is the shroud of turin folded/#comment 16411. I’ll say it again : There’s no rational way to explain why this author would have made an unclear reference to the Shroud by using this term “tetradiplon” while he would have completely avoid to make also a reference to the presence of bloodstaind and of a complete body image (front and back) of Jesus on the cloth and to clearly say that Jesus wiped his face with his burial Shroud !!! Anyone honest about this whole issue must read carefully the entire text of the Acts of Thaddeus and if he do this, no doubt that this person will come with the same conclusion than me and M. Freeman (and any credible Byzantine historian) is defending versus Wilson’s hypothesis of the Mandylion ! This idea that the word tetradiplon has something to do with the Shroud of Turin is the best example of a very wild and bad extrapolation and speculation made by Wilson to defend his idea AT ALL COST and you’ll NEVER see me defending such a craziness (even if I believe the Shroud is genuine) !.","date":"2012-09-18","mins":"1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"id":"comment-16470","author":"yannick_clément","post":"It is Wilson and his followers who take legendary stuff at face value, not me..","date":"2012-09-18","mins":"2:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"id":"comment-16516","author":"yannick_clément","post":"It’s you Matt who miss something here !

Freeman and to drive the nail more deeply into the coffin of Wilson’s hypothesis of the Mandylion, I truly suggest to anyone’s interested by the subject to read the facts 9 through 16 that you can find in my paper about this hypothesis (here’s the link to read this paper of mine : https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/clc3a9ment questions about the mandylion hypothesis of wilson 2012 06 28.pdf). You will see that beside the Acts of Thaddeus, there are numerous ancient texts (some of them written by eye witnesses) that contain a reference to both the Mandylion AND the Shroud of Christ (or the burial cloths of Christ), which clearly indicates that these 2 cloths were considered by these authors as being 2 different relics associated with Christ. These references are truly important in this debate and cannot be explained rationally and without using very wild speculations if the Mandylion was in fact the Shroud folded in 8 equal parts showing only the face of Christ. Believe me, if my long research on the subject would have convinced me that Wilson was right, I would have been very pleased to write a paper defending strongly his point of view but that’s ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. My paper contain 22 very problematic facts regarding Wilson’s hypothesis and since that time, I have found 2 more : 1 The fact that was first mentioned by M. Freeman recently concerning the separate mentions of the Image of Edessa (a.k.a. The Mandylion) and the burial cloths of Christ by the author of the Acts of Thaddeus proving that he never intend to use the term “tetradiplon” to describe a burial cloth used by Jesus to wipe his face. 2 The fact that after the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople (and the so called “discovery” of his burial nature by Gregory Referendarius and possibly by some members of the emperor’s court), there is ABSOLUTELY NO WRITEN MENTION ANYWHERE stating clearly and specifically that the Mandylion was in fact a shroud (or a burial cloth) of Jesus Christ directly related with his Passion and death and we can see that all the Byzantine authors of that era were changing the word “sindon” that we find in some earlier accounts of the Abgar legend to other generic terms meaning a simple (or even a cheap) cloth. So, right now, I have 24 facts to put in Wilson’s face that are all very problematic regarding his hypothesis. Having said that, I just want to leave you with this simple question : WHAT DO YOU NEED NOW TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS IS MOST PROBABLY (I WOULD EVEN DARE TO SAY SURELY) INCORRECT ???

Freeman, i.e. That in the Acts of Thaddeus, in one part of the text, the author talk about the story of the miraculous imprint on only the fact of the living Christ and used the expression “sindon tetradiplon” to define the cloth on which the face was imprinted and in another part of the text, after the disciple Thaddeus had brought the miraculous cloth bearing the face of Christ to king Abgar in Edessa, he said to the kind that Jesus left his burial cloths (in the plural) in the tomb after his resurrection. 1 The simple FACT that Wilson never said a damn word about this last part of the Acts of Thaddeus is a GREAT PROOF of his intellectual dishonesty. Ray Rogers always came back on this great scientific truth : to do a good scientific research (this is true for any kind of research including historical research), you MUST take into account ALL the facts and data that you can find (and not just the data that could be used to comfort your little preconceived idea) in order to follow properly the scientific method. Unfortunately, in the Shroud world, we constantly see researchers breaking this most important rule and in the case of Wilson, the fact that completely avoid to mention the reference to the burial cloths of Christ that can be found in the Acts of Thaddeus is just one great example of how bad he’s making historical research and how intellectual dishonest he really is. Sorry but you simply cannot left on the side important pieces of evidence like the burial cloths in the Acts of Thaddeus when you pretend doing an exhaustive research about the Shroud’s obscure years ! And as I said concerning the intellectual dishonesty, Wilson is not alone in his case ! Just another example of this : In a recent paper about the Sudarium of Oviedo that she present at the recent Panama conference on the Shroud, Janice Bennett conclude by saying this : “X.” Did you noticed that she completely avoid to mention one great piece of evidence concerning the cloth, i.e. That it was radiocarbon dated 2 different times (non authorized test) and the average middle date given by these analyses is 708 A.D. Sorry but if you pretend to wrote a complete paper about the Sudarium (that was the goal of his paper) and you don’t say a damn word about that, it is call intellectually dishonesty or at the very least a total lack of competence. That’s exactly what Shroud science should avoid to gain some credibility in the eyes of the scientific community… 2 The greek expression used by the author of the Acts of Thaddeus to describe the cloth is “sindon tetradiplon” which can mean a cloth double in four (but others translations are possible – see Guscin’s book The Image of Edessa). Now, I never saw the greek expression used to describe the burial cloths in the tomb but because it talks about many cloths, you can bet your house that it’s not “sindon”. I wonder if M. Freeman or someone else could give us the right greek expression that was used. Anyway, because it is certainly not the same expression, you can see this as a very good literary clue which indicates that the author of this ancient text really wanted to make a clear distinction between the miraculous imprint of the face of the living Christ and these burial cloths. Also, the fact that there’s absolutely no mention in the text about the presence of a body imprint on these burial cloths, on the contrary to the sindon tetradiplon cloth mentioned earlier in the text is another good clue to understand that these cloths were DIFFFERENT and that there was no relation between them. Also, the context of the text is quite clear about that : The story of the miraculous imprint is located when Jesus is doing his ministry, while the story of the burial cloths left in the tomb is located after the Ascension of Christ in Edessa, while the disciple talks to king Abgar. All these very good clues found in this text are well enough and clear enough to understand that the Image of Edessa (for this author at least) had NOHING TO DO with any kind of burial cloth ! And again, let me emphasize the fact that the action concerning the miraculous imprint is located during Christ’s lifetime, before his Passion. How in the world could he has washed his face with a burial cloth in this particular context ??? It would have been judge scandalous and gruesome and the fact that Wilson and others used this term “tetradiplon” to comfort his hypothesis is quite simply ludicrous because it is completely taken OUT OF CONTEXT ! I’ll say it again: WHEN WILL YOU REALIZED THAT THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE DO GOOD HISTORICAL (OR ANY OTHER) RESEARCH ??? Now, I’ll let you assimilate all this and meditate over it. But I have to say that it’s sad to see people on this blog being so close at the idea that Wilson’s hypothesis is most probably WRONG ! Don’t you have read my paper about that ? What do you do of all the problematic facts (24 so far) that goes directly against Wilson’s hypothesis ? Even if you think you could find a solution for one, you’ll still stuck with 23 other problematic facts to explain !

Here’s the link again for those of you who have already forget it or didn’t had the chance to read it yet : http://shroudnm.com/docs/2012 07 26 Yannick Clément The evidence of the bloodstains.pdf In this paper, I truly and honestly think I succeed to clearly show that the Shroud is NOT and CANNOT BE “the most ingenious, most unbelievably clever, products of the human mind and hand on record” as Walsh onced said !!!! In this paper, I describe 4 possible scenarios that can still pretend to explain the Shroud. Here’s a brief summary for each one: 1 It is a real burial shroud of someone other than Jesus of Nazareth who suffered the same tortures as he with a forged image done by someone without using any art technique. In this case, a forger “naturally” produced the image while using a real tortured and crucified body. And whether or not the forger knew that he would obtain a body image on the cloth, along with the bloodstains, is not completely clear. In fact, the formation of an image like that could have well been just an accident. 2 It is real burial shroud of someone other than Jesus of Nazareth who suffered the same tortures as he with a naturally occurring image. In this case, the body image on the cloth was produced accidentally by some undetermined natural phenomenon(s). In other words, this is not a forgery but instead, an accidental resemblance with the Jesus of the Gospels, including that this anonymous victim was also crowned with thorns (a very unusual procedure) and didn’t have his legs broken (a standard Roman practice called crurifragium that was done to hasten death). In sum, this scenario can be described like a real burial shroud of an anonymous crucified man, which has bloodstains and a body image on it that shows a great accidental resemblance with the Jesus of the Gospels. 3 – It is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth with a naturally occurring image. In this case, the body image on the cloth was produced by some undetermined natural phenomenon. The fact that the body left the Shroud before it started to corrupt can be related with his resurrection, but that’s not certain. In other words, a scenario like that doesn’t absolutely need to call for the resurrection in order to explain the bloodstains and the body image we see on the cloth. In sum, this scenario can be described like the authentic burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth, which has bloodstains and a body image on it that was produced by some unknown natural phenomena which were probably of chemical nature. 4 It is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus Christ with a supernaturally occurring image. In this case, the body image on the cloth was produced by some undetermined supernatural phenomenon directly linked to his resurrection. In sum, this scenario can be described as the authentic burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth, which has bloodstains and a body image on it that was caused, directly (a miraculous image made by God) or indirectly (a by product), by his resurrection. If we want to stay honest about the Shroud, we MUST consider these 4 scenarios as plausible options that can possibly explain this relic. Sadly, the second scenario of that short list (i.e. The Shroud would be an anonymous victim of a legal Roman crucifixion and the image would have been formed naturally) have not been considered by either Stevenson and Habermas or Walsh, even though at first sight, such a scenario can seems to be truly plausible !!! About that, here’s a quote from Meacham’s 1983 paper concerning the Shroud’s authenticity: ““…a number of commentators, including the STURP team, have suggested that the Shroud could be the gravecloth of a person who suffered injuries in the same manner as Christ. We shall examine here the possibility of such an occurrence without obvious intent to imitate the experience of Christ. This hypothesis thus hinges on the degree to which features now interpreted as “clearly representing Jesus Christ” should be considered unique.” Again, I repeat it : It’s very sad that Stevenson, Habermas or Walsh didn’t included this natural scenario as a possible explanation for the Shroud, because as we can see, this particular hypothesis has been proposed by many scientists interested in the Shroud over the years and at first sight, it’s an interesting option to analyze. And it’s fun we are talking about this topic because right now, I am writing an upcoming paper that will analyze in deep this particular scenario involving an anonymous victim of a legal Roman crucifixion in order to estimate the level of probability of such a natural scenario… The title of this paper is “Concerning the question of the identity of the man of the Shroud: Could this man be an anonymous victim of a Roman crucifixion?” and it should be ready to read before the end of the year if everything goes well. I really think it all the persons interested in the Shroud will like this kind of probabilistic analysis that focus on one single hypothesis that can potentially explain the Shroud. After this article will be completed, I will also make the same kind of probabilistic analysis for the first scenario you can find in my first paper (i.e. The Shroud is the product of a “natural” forgery involving the use of a real crucified body which was showing the same stigmata than Jesus of Nazareth, as reported in the Gospels). I hope to write this during the winter. And when this second probabilistic analysis will be done, I think we will have a better view of the situation concerning the level of probability that the Shroud can really be the one of Jesus of Nazareth.

And each time there would have been a direct contact with the body and the cloth, this would have start a chemical process (a bit like the Volckringer process if you will that could have been initiated by the sweat or other substances on the skin) that would have lead eventually to the formation of a coloration.

To me, that finding speak very loud !!! Honestly, I still have a hard time to understand why a guy like Wilson, who obviously suffer of the Dan Brown syndrome well before Dan Brown, have gain so much (doubtful) credibility in the Shroud World. As I once said on this blog, I think it’s because history is the really not the cup of tea for the majority of the people involved in the Shroud world. And I also think that Wilson was wise enough to get some pushing from other Shroudies, especially from some pro Shroud historians (who have obviously a great bias toward the Shroud authenticity). I don’t see other reason to explain this mess (i.e. The high level of credibility of Wilson in the Shroud world). I have no problem saying that this is a total mess because when you step outside the Shroud world, all the credible experts in Byzantine history look at his ideas and have a big laugh… And this is truly painful for a guy like me who take all that concern the Shroud very seriously and honestly (while only seeking the truth and nothing else). Look, I believe the Shroud is authentic, but at the same time, I’m not ready to buy blindly any proposed theory concerning it (whether it be a theory concerning the obscure history of the cloth or the image formation process) that is, like the one of Wilson, so obviously full of pro Shroud bias… That’s precisely why all the credible historians out there look at Wilson and have a big smile from ear to ear. The end of Freeman’s paper says it all : “I am writing this in the hope that those who read Ian Wilson’s immensely enjoyable essentially fictional account of the history of the Turin Shroud accept it as such, fiction not history.

Simply because Colin DON’T WANT THE BLOOD ON THE SHROUD TO BE GENUINE BLOOD FROM A TORTURED PERSON because he knows that if that’s the case, then his own little hypothesis for image formation would have to be thrown to the garbage!!! What else can that be ? Remember my paper about the evidence of the bloodstains ? Remember the heart of my paper ? The SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN FACT that the blood on the Shroud is real blood from a real tortured corpse is a huge problem for any skeptic who wants to make believe the Shroud’s body image was hand made by some forger, especially when you think that these bloodstains could not have been artificially droped on the cloth but have to come from real direct contacts between humid blood clots and the cloth. In my mind, the fact that the blood on the Shroud and also the image come from a close interraction between a dead and tortured corpse and the surface of the cloth strongly indicate that one forgery scenario can still be consider as a possibility to explain the Shroud, which is to think that a forger would have used a real scourge and crucified corpse in order to produce a false relic of Jesus’ Passion. THERE IS NO OTHER PLAUSIBLE FORGERY SCENARIO THAN THIS ONE. Colin knows it and that’s why he will do anything he can to deny the FACT that there is real blood on the Shroud and that this blood show the characteristics of exudates of humid blood clots that were formed on the skin of someone who endured a long period of torture.

The blood still evolves hydroxyproline on mild heating, and the cellulose crystals are largely undistorted. The image is not a scorch.

And you seem to forgot completely Baima Bollone in your analysis! He was present on site in Turin with the STURP team and came to the very same conclusion than Heller and Adler (which is in fact a scientific confirmation of an hypothesis described by Barbet in the 1930s, who, by the way, also saw the Shroud with his own eyes in Turin before claiming the blood on the Shroud was caused by exudates of blood clots)! Here’s a very good suggestion for you : I think you should read the books published by Barbet and Baima Bollone about the Shroud before making any claim regarding the blood evidence! In fact, most bloodstains on the Shroud are due to a transfer of exudates of humid blood clots to the fabric by direct contacts and all the halos of serum found around most of these bloodstains (and confirmed by the study of the UV fluorescence photos done by Miller and Pellicori) were formed on the fabric during that very same transfer and were caused by a well known medical phenomenon called « clot retraction ». This happen between 20 to 50 minutes after the clotting of the blood began and the serum separate much more clearly from the blood clot when this phenomenon happen in a vertical position (as demonstate by lab experiments done by Doctor Gilbert Lavoie in the 1980s). All these conclusions made by true experts in the field of blood transfer clearly indicates that the bloodstains on the Shroud were caused by a direct contact between the cloth and a corpse who died in a vertical position (we know the body was dead because some bloodstains clearly came from a post mortem bleeding). I’m sorry for you but all this fits perfectly with the body image of a scourged and crucified man we see on the Shroud and there is no good reason to doubt such a strong conclusion, except if you DON’T want to see the truth. The truth is this : the bloodstain evidence concerning the Shroud is probably the most reliable piece of evidence that clearly indicates that this cloth is an authentic burial cloth of a real crucified man. Now, as I said earlier, such a conclusion doesn’t mean this cloth is the genuine burial shroud of Jesus or that he really resurrect from the dead, but at least, it indicates that the Shroud is a genuine burial cloth. And because of this, the only plausible scenario that can involve a forgery is the one in which an unknown forger would have taken a real scourged and crucified corpse and place it inside a real burial shroud for less than 72 hours in order to create a false relic of Jesus’ Passion.

Question for you : How and why do an artistic forger would paint clear serum halos around almost all of these scourge marks ? For Barbet, the clots made with life’s blood were all dried at the time of the enshrouding of the body and became wet on their surface after some time inside the Shroud, while the others that were made of post mortem blood coming from the side wound and the feet wounds were most probably not completely dry when the body was placed inside the Shroud. For the first kind of clots (which includes all the scourge wounds), Barbet thought that the wet environment inside the Shroud (remember that a dead body can emit water vapor and also other post mortem gases like ammonia) was enough to cause a re humidifaction at the surface of these dried clots and allow them to form a mirror image on the cloth. And for the nakedness of the Shroud man, I dare you to find me one single artwork of any period of time before the first apparition of the Shroud in Lirey, France that show the naked buttocks of Jesus like we see on the Shroud! I really don’t think such an artwork exist.

I know that Baima Bollone in Italy pretend he has found traces of aloes and myrrh but I don’t think he ever published his finding anywhere else than his own journal that is published by the Centro in Turin (remember that he’s a member or was a member of the Centro for a long time). Also, I don’t think Baima Bollone’s supposed findings were exactly the same than what is reported here. So, we have to be careful with a news like that. In fact, here we have a good example of contradictory conclusions that can well be explained just like the contradictory conclusions between Mc Crone and Heller Adler about the nature of the blood on the Shroud, i.e. It’s maybe simply caused by some errors in the methodology of one or more researcher. Secondly, I’m always sceptical when I see a researcher doing those kind of extrapolations versus a finding she make and what it is supposed to mean (the interpretation). In this case, if the researcher really found traces of ointments and oils on the Shroud (the “if” is important here), than I’m not sure that really mean automatically that Jesus was really buried with royal honors.

Ray Rogers only supposed his presence from the mild fluorescence of the cloth. In the light of this new information, I think the hypothesis of Stéphane Mottin in France should be considered as much more probable to explain this mild fluorescence, i.e. Because of the confirmed presence of deposits of pectines at the surface of the fibers. Here, it’s important to note 4 things : 1 Dan made a huge mistake in his comment. Saponaria was NOT used to bleach linen ! It was used instead as a detergent for the final cloth, once it was woven. Here’s a quote from Rogers book that leaves no doubt about that : “The final cloth was washed with “struthium”, Saponaria Officinalis, to MAKE IT MORE SUPPLE.” Not to bleach it !!!! 2 This coating of pectine on the fibers fits very well with Rogers hypothesis (even if Rogers bizarrely never spoke about that in his writings) and could well be a major component of the thin layer of impurities that was colored during the image formation process. This finding by Adler was very bizarrely HIGHLY AND BADLY NEGLECTED in Shroud research concerning the chromophore of the image… I really don’t understand why a HUGE FINDING like that always seem to have stayed in the darkness !!! More researches SHOULD be make concerning this finding of Adler… 3 Even if one day, it is proven with 100% certainty that there is no Saponaria on the cloth and that this detergent was never used on the final cloth, that wouldn’t really put the chromophore and the image formation hypotheses of Rogers in great danger, simply because in the mind of Rogers, Saponaria is NOT the principal element that probably composed the thin layer of impurities on the cloth; Starch fractions are. You can find a quote from Rogers stating this in page 17 of the recent paper published by Thibault. Here’s the quote from Rogers : “The evidence indicates that SEVERAL different impurities could have had an effect in image formation, but I suspect that STARCH was the MOST IMPORTANT as a color producing reactant.” And personally, I would dare to say that it is truly possible that along with starch deposits, the other main element composing the coating can well be the pectine supposed by Mottin in 1997 and found by Adler around 1998 ! 4 Also, concerning the chromophore and the image formation hypotheses of Rogers, it’s important to understand that the use of Sapanaria was supposed by him as the principal active agent during the evaporation concentration process that would have concentrate the impurities at the top surface of the cloth (on both sides), rather than being a principal component of the thin layer of impurities. In that context, the washing of the final cloth with another detergent (like heraclion or heraklion soap) would have had pretty much the same result of concentrating all the impurities inside the cloth on the top surface of the cloth (on both sides). Concerning the question of where Rogers got his information about the frequent use of Saponaria in the making of ancient linen, I’m pretty sure he got it from Anna Maria Donadoni, who was a conservator at the Turin Museum of Egyptology. As Dan said, it is highly probable that an expert like her was correct about this information, BUT that doesn’t mean this was the case for the Shroud ! And I should also say that I’m not sure if it was her who told Rogers about Pliny the Elder. In fact, I doubt that it was her. Instead, I think Rogers found this info by himself while doing documentary researches about Saponaria. I remember that Thibault once told me that Rogers have found this in an old Encyclopedia..","date":"2012-08-19","mins":"7:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/19/who-was-wrong-ray-rogers-or-pliny-the-elder/","cat":"history","title":"Who was wrong?

Nevertheless, it’s important to note that it’s not because Pliny never mentioned the use of saponaria for washing ancient cloths that this product was never used at the time ! It’s important to make this difference. Since the use of Saponaria was confirmed to Rogers by an expert in this field (Anna Maria Donadoni, who was a conservator at the Turin Museum of Egyptology), I don’t think there’s good reason to doubt this idea. But the question remind open : Was it really saponaria that was used to wash the Shroud or another detergent ? Until now, nobody can answer this question for sure. It’s also important to note that other reasons could explain the weak fluorescence of the non image areas of the Shroud and that’s where Stéphane Mottin’s hypothesis gets all his strength! Effectively, for him, it is the presence of a deposit of pectine on the top surface of the Shroud that have caused this weak fluorescence and not the use of a particular detergent during the final washing of the cloth. It’s a very interesting hypothesis because 1 Adler has already found the presence of pectines deposits on the Shroud and 2 This kind of deposits could well be a major part of the thin layer of impurities proposed by Rogers. It would be great in a near future if more researches could be done versus this confirmed presence of pectine deposits on the fibers of the Shroud versus the question of the weak fluorescence of the non image areas of the Shroud and also versus the 2 major hypotheses of Rogers concerning the image chromophore and the body image formation. Question for all of you : Would that be possible that Stéphane Mottin (a somewhat obscure Shroud researcher from France) would have found the KEY to unlock the mystery of the Shroud of Turin??? I think this question deserve some serious thoughts.

To me, the verdict from the history of Christian art is clear : The image of Edessa (AKA the Holy Mandylion) had nothing to do with the Passion of the Christ and, starting from there, had nothing to do also with the Shroud of Turin (at least, not directly). And that is totally consistent with the FACT that there is absolutely no ancient list of relics related to the Passion of the Christ that include the Mandylion (and we have many of those lists, starting with the one written by Saint John Damascus at the beginning of the 8th century, along with the one written by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII in 958 and many more in the 11th, 12th and 13th century). The FACT is this : All those lists of the Passion ALWAYS exclude the Mandylion !!! This is a fact. There’s no speculation needed here. All this doesn’t ring a bell in your head ? To me, this can only lead to one conclusion : Wilson’s hypothesis is NOT the answer ! We have to search elsewhere. And you cannot condemn me for having a judgment full of bias, because I’m exactly like you : I believe the Shroud is authentic and the fact that I reject the hypothesis of Wilson is not at all something to comfort my belief since I have, for the moment, no answer to explain the dead silence of ancient sources (documentary and artistic sources alike) about the presence of a shroud of Christ that bears a full body image of Jesus on it !!!

The part of the Synaxarion that Guscin talk about (where we can find the word “sindon” linked with the Mandylion) cannot be understand as “shroud” in the context of the text, simply because the next line say : “In death, you were placed in the final linen shroud.” Since the next line link the word “sindon” and “death”, we know that the author was referring to a burial shroud there. But the first cannot talk also about a burial shroud since the word “sindon” is linked there with the word “in life”. It exactly the same thing than the expression “sindon tetradiplon” that we found in the book “The acts of Thaddeus”. In the particular context of the text (where Jesus is alive and well), the word “sindon” cannot be understand as “burial shroud”. I’ve said it before : In greek, the word “sindon” doesn’t necessarily mean a burial shroud ! It can mean anything from a cloth to a long cloth to a tunic, etc. The context is so important to understand the meaning and in the particular context of the Synaxarion, the word “sindon” applied to the Mandylion cannot be understand as a burial shroud. And Guscin also cite a poetic part of a liturgical book called the Menaion. But when I read that part, I found no clear references to the presence of blood stains on the image of the Mandylion. In fact, this part of the text seem much more to refer to the Eucharist and the Incarnation of Christ. The focus is not at all on the Mandylion, but on the flesh and blood of Christ… What his the most funny part is that I’ve read his book “The Image of Edessa” and he don’t mention the argument anywhere concerning the Synaxarion ! So, I’ve exchange personal emails with him recently about that and here’s what he wrote to me (I think there was some confusion between what he said at the conference in France and what the frenchmen who wrote the article understood) : Dear Yannick, There is some confusion here. The Menaion is a collection of liturgical hymns (usually quite different from one manuscript to another), with no story of the saint or icon or relic in question – just hymns. The Orthodox book of saints with the relevant stories is the Synaxarion. Just about all versions of the Synaxarion say that King Abgar ordered his messenger to paint a picture of Christ’s “whole bodily appearance”. The Menaion manuscripts that I discovered are obviously more poetical (they are hymns). They say that when King Abgar looked on the image on the cloth he realised that Christ had come in body and blood – this COULD be a poetical reference to the image containing body and blood. This is what I say in the book – unfortuntately the MNTV lecture was me trying to speak in French and Pierre then listening to the recording and writing the text, and either I said it wrong in my limited French or he understood it wrong. But the text does not directly state that there was a whole body image, which is why you cannot find this in my book – because I never said it. I hope this answers your question, Best wishes Mark So you see ? I’m not even sure that Guscin really thought that the word “sindon” we found in the Synaxarion can be understand as “burial shroud” ! I think this french article should be re write ! And I would conclude my answer to you by saying this : The few ancient texts that Guscin cites cannot contradict my argumentation about the FACT that there is absolutely no ancient list of relics related to the Passion of the Christ that include the Mandylion. He mention the Synaxarion and the Menaion which are 2 liturgical books of the Byzantine Church, and cannot, by any means, be considered as offical lists of relics related to the Passion of the Christ.

My feeling about all the informations we can take from ancient sources lead me to believe that the Mandylion was first considered as a manmade portrait of Christ (from the beginning of the fifth century) and then, later on, this concept changed (probably during the second half of the 6th century) and people started to think this portrait was miraculous (not made by human hands). What lead to this drastic change ? In the same line of thinking than Paul Vignon, I have the feeling that this could have been caused by some religious fights between the orthodox church and some heretic movements like the Monophysitism philosophy who proclaim that Christ was not really human and that he was only divine in nature. And the fact that this movement was really popular in the region surrounding Edessa is a good clue that this could well be the case. In other words, the fight against Monophysitism could have caused this change of consideration from a manmade portrait of Christ to a miraculous image of Christ, so that the orthodox church can have a good “tool” to fight this heresy by saying : Look ! We have a miraculous portrait of the living Christ that is a proof of his human nature ! You can forget your heretic philosophy, we proved it wrong ! I think that can explain pretty well the development of the Abgar legend regarding the Image of Edessa from a painted portrait at first to a miraculous image of Christ. Of course, that’s just my opinion, but it is based on a long research of all the ancient sources regarding this Image..","date":"2012-04-22","mins":"9:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"id":"comment-10469","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Reply to the last comment of Anoxie : You’re right ! Guscin didn’t found a list of relic related to the Passion of Christ with the words “Mandylion” or “Image of Edessa” in it. And it’s normal because there’s none ! All Guscin found is a minority of legendary, theological and/or poetic text that can be interpreted as if the Mandylion was showing a full length body image of Jesus or if there was blood stains on it. But the thing is : those few divergent texts (very few in fact versus the whole corpus) can be interpreted differently, depending on the historian. Those will always need some speculation or extrapolation in order to be view as evidence for Wilson’s hypothesis. Lists of relics are very different in the sense that their authors had just one goal : to report what he saw ! They are not like those legendary, theological of poetic stuffs that are evidently much harder to interpret. In the case of a list of relic, normally, there’s no need to extrapolate or speculate… When a writer include a shroud of Christ for example, there’s no good argument to think he meant something else than a burial shroud ! You understand ? For the view point of Guscin on the question, I know it since, firstly, I’ve read his book “The Image of Edessa” and also, last year, I ask him more about it in another email. I said that, for him, the hypothesis of Wilson is really attractive but, as he said, like any other hypothesis on the subject, it is far from being proven ! Personally, I would have said : very far, but that’s his opinion and I respect it. I would also say that Mark Guscin is somewhere in between in this debate, in the sense that he love the ideas of Wilson but, at the same time, he’s enough prudent not to proclaim his ideas as undeniable truth ! I respect him very much for that kind of prudence. In fact, it’s pretty much the same kind of prudence we see expressed by Maurus Green in his own article. The only thing found dangerous in their approach is the fact that I really think they have left the door too much wide open for Wilson versus the global portrait of the situation… I think they should have been more critics versus the ideas of Wilson, but that’s only my personal view, after all the research I’ve done and still do. Last comment : Did you notice how many time you used the word “could be” in your comment ? That’s the reality of those who want to defend Wilson’s hypothesis until they die : they will always need those “could be” sentences in order to defend their idea !!! We are here in what I call “the speculative territory” and anybody knows that, with some speculations, anyone can make say anything to any ancient text, especially to the ones who fits into the category of legendary, theological, spiritual and/or poetic texts… When you base an hypothesis on speculations like that, it’s very weak. In fact, it’s pretty much like the Bible ! Anyone can interpret this book as he want ! Some only view a God of Talion in there and others, like me, are able to see the God of Love ! And all this, starting with the same book !!! I repeat it : You don’t have to use any kind of speculations to interpret a list of relics… It’s completely different and should be analyzed while taking care of this important difference. That’s the reason why I give much more importance and credit to a list of relics when I do my research than I do to a legendary or theological related text. Unfortunately, in the historical research for the Shroud, it’s not always the case and you often see all kinds of speculations coming from those kind of texts, some of them being total nonsense….","date":"2012-04-16","mins":"4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"id":"comment-10742","author":"yannick_clément","post":"Ron, have you read all my good arguments against Wilson’s hypothesis ?

I don’t understand why people here don’t take that argument more seriously because it is one of the most difficult to deny ! For me, when I first heard this hypothesis of Wilson, I was already doubting it simply on the base of this single FACT ! And personally, I’m not aware that Wilson has ever brought some solid argument to explain this FACT. I seriously doubt that he will ever be able to do so. Some might argue that, in Constantinople, when the authorities discovered that the Mandylion was a burial shroud of more than 4 meters folded in 8, they decided to make a copy of the Mandylion in order to preserve the Abgar legend for the faithful. And it is that “official” copy of the Mandylion that would have been reproduced over and over again. I’ve heard this argument before and I wonder if that doesn’t come directly from Wilson. Anyway, this seems to me so off track that I can’t believe someone put any faith in an argument like that. Effectively, how in the world the authorities of Constantinople would have done an inexact copy of the Mandylion by removing all the bloodstains ? That idea is ludicrous. If this scenario of an official copy would be true, then it is evident that this copy would have shown all the bloodstains that we easily see on the cloth in the region of the face ! And that very particular feature would have been reproduced by artists. There’s no doubt about that. So, to me, the FACT that all the surviving copies of the Mandylion (some of which have been made during the time the relic was in Constantinople and was probably publicly showed once a year) shows a face of the living Christ without any injuries or bloodstains is well enough to put very seriously the hypothesis of Wilson in jeopardy ! For me, this is in fact well enough to simply reject it. And I’m not even talking about the FACT that the Mandylion (even if it was publicly known since the 6th, maybe the 5th century) had absolutely NO effect on the artistic depictions of anything related to the Passion of the Christ during all the time the relic was in Edessa and Constantinople (that represent a period of time of over 600 years) !!! As I said, it is well known that the first depictions of the Passion that were showing bloodstains or blood flows only appeared during the 13th century in Europe and just during the 14th century in the Byzantine art (best example of this drastic change : the icons of the Man of Sorrows who came to be very popular in Europe during the 13th century). This other FACT (not a speculation) is one more nail into the coffin of Wilson’s hypothesis and I’ve never seen him or anyone else being able to propose a logical explanation for this absence of influence of the Mandylion on any artistic work related to the Passion. It is completely absurd to think that a relic that would have showed, for centuries, the kind of “Passion” face we see on the Shroud (where any faithful could have recognize easily the crown of thorns) would have left absolutely no traces in Christian art, and particularly no traces in Byzantine art !!! When we put the 2 arguments I just describe together, I think it is evident that the hypothesis of Wilson CANNOT give a proper answer to explain the problem of the absence of reference to a shroud of Christ with a body image on it. There’s only one conclusion we can draw from what the history of Christian art have to tell : WE HAVE TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE !!!.","date":"2012-04-23","mins":"10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"id":"comment-10766","author":"yannick_clément","post":"My colleague has read him and it’s full of bias like you can’t believe !!!

By the way, Poulle, just like me, was a defender of the Paris hypothesis that pretend the Mandylion left Constantinople around 1241 (he was probably saved from the looting of Constantinople in 1204, along with all the Christ related relics that were kept inside the Pharos chapel, except for the Shroud who had been relocated in the Blachernes church) in a very big deal involving many relics (by the way, most of them are present in the testimony of Robert de Clari) between the latin emperor of Constantinople Beaudouin II and Saint Louis, king of France. If this is correct, then, the Mandylion was most probably destroyed by the French revolutionnaries around 1792. Very sad because if it was still in Paris (like the crown of thorns), it would be easier to know if this Paris hypothesis is correct or not. But I really think it is.

This, in itself, can be enough to explain why there is no reference of his arrival in Constantinople. At that time (prior to 958, the first date we can trace it in Constantinople with some level of certainty), it’s probable that the clergy didn’t want to make a big noise with this kind of “problematic” relic… To me, this can well be the most important thing that can explain the absence of any reference about his arrival in Constantinople. Remember also that there’s some chances that the relic arrived in that city between 726 and 84, at the heart of the iconoclast period, where any religious item with an image was in great danger. If this is when the relic arrived in Constantinople (who was the capital of the iconoclasts), then you can understand easily why the cloth arrived without fanfare, without any public display and without a big parade !!!

It is absolutely impossible that if this was the Shroud face, that there would not have created some major changes in byzantine art ! But the fact is this : Those changes are non existent. The History of Christian art is clear about that… Also, you never give me one logical explanation for the absence of any noticeable difference in the physical and chemical composition between the face region on the Shroud and the rest of the cloth ! If Wilson was right, the Shroud face alone would have been exposed directly to air and dust for centuries.

In the list made for the deal of Saint Louis, the possible “mandylion” is said to be a “Sacred cloth inserted in a table”. And in many official lists of the relics of the Sainte Chapelle published in 1534 and after, it is said : “A cloth inserted in a table where there’s the face of our lord Jesus Christ”. I think those description are pretty clear that this relic looked very much like the Mandylion. And since almost all the other relics bought by Saint Louis can be found in the testimony of Robert de Clari, I don’t know how can this cloth can be something else that the Mandylion, since de Clari’s description of the Pharos chapel is pretty clear that the Mandylion was kept there, along with the Keramion (the tile bearing the same face of Christ). And this is also true regarding the testimony of Nicolas Mesarites (written firstly in 1200 or 1201 and written again in 1207), the gardian of the relics at the Pharos chapel. His testimony is almost the same as the one from de Clari and in it, we also found a clear confirmation that the Mandylion, along with the Keramion was really kept inside the Pharos chapel. All those lists of relics are pretty consistent. That’s why I don’t have any problem at all to believe that the “sacred cloth” mentionned in the deal of Saint Louis was really the Mandylion. If it was not, then what it was ? A copy of the Mandylion ??? Remember that Saint Louis was probably the most important allied of Beaudouin II, the latin emperor of Constantinople. I really don’t see this latin emperor (who was a frenchman by the way) willing to sell a false Mandylion to the king of France at high price !!! Don’t make any sense to me.

You can read it here : https://shroudofturin.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/please dont forget the evidence of the bloodstains/ In it, I was mentioning that because it is a proven fact now (especially because of the particularities of the blood) that the Shroud was not created with some kind of artistic method, there’s only 3 different possibilities that are left open regarding the image formation on the Shroud. Then, after reading some comments, I realised that, in fact, I should have separate one particular possibility in 2 in order to be clearer. So, I thought it would be a good idea to post them here (you’ll understand why at the end of this comment). Here’s the only 4 possibilities that can explain the Shroud of Turin, considering that the option of an artistic forgery is completely excluded : 1 It is a real burial shroud of someone who suffered the same tortures than Jesus, but who is not Jesus of Nazareth. In fact, it is a forgery produced by a forger (or many forgers) “naturally” (without using any art technique) while using a real human being. And because of the great resemblance of the bloody and body images with what happen to Jesus in the Gospels, we must assume that this forger (or forgers) did it in order to produce a false relic of the Passion of the Christ. We also have to assume that this forger (or forgers) took the dead body out of the shroud before it start to corrupt there, in such a way that this extraction of the body from the shroud never disturbed the bloodstains, never broke the linen fibrils under them and never disturbed the body image. 2 It is a real burial shroud of someone else than Jesus of Nazareth who suffered the same tortures than him and was produced accidentally by some undetermined natural phenomenon(s). In other words, this is not a forgery but instead, an accident of nature. In this scenario, we must assume that a person or a group of persons, for some obscure reason, took the dead body out of the shroud before it start to corrupt there, in such a way that this extraction of the body from the shroud never disturbed the bloodstains, never broke the linen fibrils under them and never disturbed the body image. 3 – It is the real burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth and was produced by some undetermined natural phenomenon(s). The fact that the body left the Shroud before starting to corrupt there can be related or not with the resurrection. In other words, in this scenario, it is not completely clear if the resurrection had something to do with the bloody and body images. Nevertheless, even if this scenario involve a natural creation of the body image of Jesus, the fact that the extraction of his body from the shroud never disturbed the bloodstains, never broke the linen fibrils under them and never disturbed the body image, can be seen as a possible sign of a “dematerialisation” of his body at the moment of the resurrection. To conclude this point, there’s one thing very important to note : If it’s true, a scenario like that, involving some kind of natural phenomenon(s) related to the body image formation, cannot be taken by the sceptics as a proof that Jesus did not resurrect, because in the light of the all the facts we known, a manual extraction of the body out of the shroud seem to be highly improbable. 4 It is the real burial shroud of Jesus Christ and was produced by some undetermined supernatural action directly linked to his resurrection. In this scenario, a “dematerialisation” of his body at the moment of the resurrection could explain the fact that no bloodstains was disturbed, no linen fibrils under them was broken and no body image was disturbed. Now, if we go back to the little clue given by the non symmetrical aspect of the 2 body images on the Shroud (versus, at least, the length of the cloth), I think it is fair to say that this observation (along many others that would be too long to mention here) is a very good clue to say that the option #1 describe above is UNLIKELY. At the very least, let’s say that there’s not much room left open for this option (the only one involving a forger) to be true !!! Again, this deserve some thoughts. SINCE IT’S SURE THAT THE SHROUD IS NOT AN ARTISTIC FORGERY AND IT’S ALMOST SURE THAT THE SHROUD WASN’T MADE BY A FORGER USING A DEAD BODY, that lead us to an important question that is, in fact, THE question concerning the Shroud : IF THE MAN OF THE SHROUD IS NOT JESUS, THEN WHO IS HE ???.","date":"2012-06-05","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/yannicks-nice-surprise-folding-test-on-the-enrie/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie"},{"id":"comment-11939","author":"yannick_clément","post":"This comment sound like someone jealous !

The precision of those lines is not important here. That’s not the point. The point is that the body images are not symmetrical at all. That’s the point ! And I should also say that the most important green line is the one near the center of the cloth because it is this line that show where the original line of folding was and proved, at the same time, that the 2 images are non symmetrical versus the length of the cloth.

So what? The physical evidence of the Shroud as it exists today and the comparisons to the early icons (including the Justinian coins) are sufficient to establish its identity as existing as early as the Fifth Century and being important enough in those times to cause the images of Christ to be changed from a beardless Adonis to the bearded man of the icons.” I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. On the other hand, if I always come back with critics against Wilson’s hypothesis whenever the occasion seem to be right is just because there are too much people in the Shroud world who believe too much blindly in this incorrect hypothesis and I just want set the record straight as much as I can. We have to look elsewhere for a better explanation concerning the obscure years of the Shroud and as you cleverly said : it’s possible (maybe even probable) that this obscure history of the Shroud will never be known, especially if there is no new discoveries related to that in archaeology or in ancient manuscript… And like you also said : In the end, it’s not that important. Another C14 dating done on better samples (at least from 3 differents spots on the main body of the cloth) is what should be done to learn the true age of the cloth. And to reduce the possibility of contaminations, I would take just thread samples on the reverse side of the cloth because it was pretty well protected from contamination since 1534 (at least better protected than the inner part of the cloth)..","date":"2012-09-22","mins":"6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman"}]
