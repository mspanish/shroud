[{"id":"comment-9999","author":"piero_iacazio","post":"Do you know dibenzodioxocin ? Molecular Formula = C14 H10 O2 Average mass = 210.228 Da Dibenzodioxocins are thermally unstable products. Both semi empirical and density functional theory quantum calculations show that both C O bonds, which connect the biphenyl part of the dibenzodioxocin molecule to the phenolic group, can be broken under increasing temperature. So, I think it is possible to search something (advanced analyses) into your linen samples and other attempts to produce a Shroud like material… Do you know the thermal degradation of a phenolic dibenzodioxocin lignin model ? So… Is it possible to apply these chemical knowledges in the field of the studies about the Shroud ? What is your own opinion ? Am I wrong about the idea to search dibenzodioxocin as a sorto of “key molecule”? — — — I believe that AFM and SNOM technique can be useful to solve the Enigma. In any case we have to remember Ash and Nicholls [“Super resolution Aperture Scanning Microscope”, Nature 237, 510 – 512 (30 June 1972)] …because they first demonstrated the concept of Near field scanning optical microscopy … Regards, Piero Iacazio Reference : >…A specific condensed lignin substructure, dibenzodioxocin, was immunolocalized in differentiating cell walls of Norway spruce ( Picea abies (L.)

Why ? We can start from the fact that the Resurrection is a Mystery of Faith and not a simple scientific fact to show ! Are you able to reproduce a Resurrection in the Lab ? In any case the claims by de Wesselow about the Origin of the Christian Faith are not completely original. I refer (for example) to the booklet : “The Shroud Was the Resurrection: The Body Theft, the Shroud in the Tomb, and the Image that Inspired a Myth” by John Loken (Paperback – April 16, 2006) I have read that strange book some year ago … Am I wrong ? How is possible to forget all the past (and present) History (and also the particular image of the Veil of Manoppello)? — — The only interesting and reasonable thing that we can underline is the possibility for new dating attempts, with the advanced systems. In this manner we have the solution for the true epoch of that ancient linen and this is an important step. How is possible to reach that solution ? I know that there are the new 14 C tests (see the work of two Italian teams from National Institute of Optics and from European Laboratory of non linear spectroscopy, Florence. They published a very interesting paper on the high impact factor journal “Physical Review Letters” entitled Molecular Gas Sensing Below Parts Per Trillion: Radiocarbon Dioxide Optical Detection. = They were able to measure 14 C concentrations at a 43 parts per quadrillion level. Wow !!!) but I don’t believe in the (useless) destructions. — — Here I cannot write a too long message, so I want to suggest two ways : 1) the use of the SP Ms (= the new advanced microscopies = AFM, CFM, SNOM, used in order to discover the cellulosic Dp value and then the probable epoch) 2) the use of the new system by Miao and others. There is an article under the address : http://www1.cnsi.ucla.edu/news/item?item id=2045547 “New technique lets scientists peer within nanoparticles, see atomic structure in 3 D”. And this is the inherent text : >March 21, 2012 – UCLA researchers are now able to peer deep within the world’s tiniest structures to create three dimensional images of individual atoms and their positions. Their research, published March 22 in the journal Nature, presents a new method for directly measuring the atomic structure of nanomaterials. >”This is the first experiment where we can directly see local structures in three dimensions at atomic scale resolution — that’s never been done before,” said Miao. — — What is your opinion ? Is the problem about the cellulosic Dp measurement a sort of enquiring work too difficult to perform ? Is it impossible to work (on ancient linen fibrils) without the destructions ? So the question is the following : What is the level of destruction that we can accept for the Holy Shroud or for the Sudarium of Oviedo (or for both the cellulosic reperts) ? — — In any case the 14 C tests are more destructive … So, I want to know what are your perspectives. — — Regards, Piero Iacazio.","date":"2012-03-29","mins":"10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/28/quote-for-today-stephen-e-jones-on-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","title":"Quote for Today: Stephen E.
