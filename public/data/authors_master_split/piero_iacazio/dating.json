But (if we want to do an exact and great job) we have to take into account the mechanical stresses and the fungal attacks on that ancient linen (see also the wrong areas [involved in the Fire of the year 1531] to avoid. These surfaces have to be disregarded from the point of view of the SPM controls.

This is more of a pipe dream than anything. The Shroud was contaminated (from the Fire of 1531, etc.), but in my opinion, your intervention (without the exact explanations) seems to be an excessive claim … Sorry. But, in any case, I think we can try to see what will be the result from the SPM controls on some linen samples taken from the Shroud in the past. This is a work without the useless destructions of the 14 C tests. I believe that using the AFM techniques we can see what is the exact level of contamination in different areas or on linen fibrils (under the adequate non destructive controls), but this is not the main problem to solve. Why the SPM controls were not possible in the year 2002 ? Why the results from the Raman controls of the year 2002 are still unknown ? … and now : What is your reply ? — — We cannot destroy the Shroud with the wrong analytical methods ! In my opinion the SPM controls are the possible solution against the destructive systems. Do you know the different SPM ways to control the lignocellulosic materials ? I believe we have to discuss this argument instead to indicate the wrong analyses. Am I wrong ?.","date":"2012-11-16","mins":"11:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/berry-no-matter-where-he-or-she-considers-themselves-to-be-on-the-scale-of-infallibility/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Berry: No matter where he or she considers themselves to be on the scale of infallibility"},{"id":"comment-19205","author":"piero_iacazio","post":"Dear Andy Weiss, First of all (if I am right): the fire of the year 1998 has not burnt the Holy Shroud ! — — I am a technician dyer and not “a world class chemist” (in order to speak with great authority on this argument). But, if you have read my previous words about the IGC (Inverse Gas Chromatography) in other area of this Blog (try to search), you can understand that we can try to do something also about the (presumed) thymol contamination. Do you understand the meaning of that claim ? Here my explanation : we can try to show what happens using the different percentages of thymol on linen samples prepared for the IGC controls = experiments about the exact level of contamination (now I have not the exact Hansen parameters [= HSP] about the different areas of the ancient linen sheet and the HSP for Thymol, but I believe these data as interesting in order to do the inherent calculations. B.T.W. : Do you know the cohesive energy, the Hansen Theory and the Hildebrandt Theory ? Sorry…). Obviously we cannot use that particular way (= the IGC) on the Holy Shroud !!! So … In order to detect the traces (of thymol) on linen fibrils we can use the adequate SPM controls. For example : the CFM (= Chemical Force Microscopy). What is your opinion ? Is it feasible that non destructive control ? — — In my idea we can compare (in that manner) the linen fibrils taken from the Shroud before (the Thymol treatment) with the other new fibrils. This scientific work requires a good Plan (and, obviously, we cannot work only to detect the level of that presumed thymol contamination ! We have to prepare the adequate set of experiments …). In any case, the thymol contamination is not the main problem in order to know the true epoch for the Shroud. Do you agree with me on that statement ? — — I want to add that, perhaps, we can try to do some calculation about the “Vanillin loss from Lignin” also using the HSP (and the three parameters or contributions are the following : – dispersive – polar – Hydrogen bonding … ). What is your comment on that particular idea ? — — Have you found an exact opinion (apart Ray Rogers) about the temperature, the time and the Vanillin loss ? I remember this question as a troubling argument … — — I am curious about the effect from the Corona Discharge (see : Fanti and the inherent experiments) on Vanillin loss. But this is another particular question (perhaps there are very little areas of the sheet involved)….","date":"2012-11-19","mins":"12:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/berry-no-matter-where-he-or-she-considers-themselves-to-be-on-the-scale-of-infallibility/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Berry: No matter where he or she considers themselves to be on the scale of infallibility"},{"id":"comment-1222","author":"piero_iacazio","post":"I remember that Dr. Ray N. Rogers indicated us the fact that the wood reliquary can take a certain amount of thymol and then this quantity will be released after a certain amount of time. So … the first question seems to be the following : What are the exact quantities involved ? (but, unfortunately, Riggi is dead since months …) and the second question is : The presumed thymol contamination can change the 14 C results ? This question seems to be strange … There is a little amount of C, so there is not the great change, but (in my opinion) this is not the true problem. The problem is the 14 C in itself. We cannot destroy a relic using the 14 C (or another destructive analysis) on that ancient cloth. There are the SPM analyses and then we have to use this new way in order to discover the truth about the true epoch. Do you agree with me about this simple SPM idea ? If you agree on that new way (to observe the material) perhaps we can discuss how to improve the analyses avoiding the destructions. There is a lot of work to do using the SPM analyses, included the question of the detection of thymol contamination on linen fibrils. But, before to start with the controls on linen fibrils coming from the Shroud, we have to try to do some interesting experiments about the contaminations (on linen samples) to improve the knowledges before to waste the time (perhaps) in useless analyses….","date":"2012-11-20","mins":"5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/draft-document-discovered-in-the-paper-skip-at-my-local-recycling-centre-ten-killer-arguments-for-opposing-any-re-run-of-the-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"killer_arguments","title":"Draft document discovered in the paper-skip at my local recycling centre: “Ten killer arguments for opposing any re-run of the radiocarbon dating.”"}]
