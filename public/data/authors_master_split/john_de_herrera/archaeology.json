Joseph and Nicodemus brought abundant spices and wrapped Christ's body in a fine linen cloth. Joseph was a wealthy man, traveled to distant lands, obviously the shroud was the finest he could find – not a local weave. He had prepared the tomb and obviously the \"fine linen' cloth for his own use. The fact that the recent found cloth was a 'simpler two way weave' doesn't prove that the Turin Shroud could not be authentic???? In addition, perhaps the fact that the cloth was so fine/expensive, is the reason it was saved, not discarded after the resurrection???jdh.","date":"2012-05-25","mins":"11:25 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2009/12/burial-shroud-proves-turin-shroud-not.html","title":"\nBurial shroud proves Turin Shroud not from 1st century C.E.
