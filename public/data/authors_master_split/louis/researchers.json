It is not possible to take Genesis literally, also because Mesopotamian myths crept into the text, and it is also not compatible with what we know today. The JEPD theory therefore makes sense and only God knows how much editing was done if the OT, as we know it today, only became “ready” around 500 BC, during the time of Ezra. But was it really ready? Monotheism, as we understand it today, is said to have been defined by the Council of Nicaea. D.N. Freedman’s study about the evolving concept about God in OT times thus becomes very relevant. You are right about the complex question of human consciousness and quantum. There are scholars who believe that the universe is determined, so it follows that we humans with our physical bodies are also determined. That, needless to say, raises the question of the mind body problem. If the body is determined, what about the mind, which is connected to the brain? We are thus lead to more questions, things like free will and so on. Viktor Frankl, who suffered in Auschwitz, wrote that the question of suffering is related to the question of God. That makes Pope Benedict’s advice to Seewald on what to expect an important tip.

When this is not done and a book is published first, the result is confusion. Take the case of the so called Jesus Family Tomb, where claims were made contesting papers published in professional journals by professional archaeologists. Many of the claims were based on wild imagination and were agenda driven and were therefore easily dismissed as sensationalism, meant to fill the coffers of publishing houses and TV channels. The uproar led Ted Koppel to lose no time in face saving and to hit hard to demonstrate that the company he worked for was serious.

What I said in # 3 is that neuroscientists have made reasonable progress but have yet to present hard evidence, so one can image how tough it is even for highly qualified professional scientists like the Portuguese born Professor Antonio Damasio (University of Iowa). What, then, can be said about the links provided? Is this science? No one can present this to serious scientists and not expect to be laughed out of court. There is still a lot to be learnt about the nature of mind, consciousness and the structure of the universe. We know very little about ontological reality and blogs and sites that appear to appeal to the esoteric seem to lead to a world of make believe, a world to make everyone feel nice. Reincarnation is not compatible with a good God, that is why Hinduism has at least some eighty schools of interpretation, with little agreement between them. God can be “He”, “She”, “It”, it can be an endless cycle trying to get out of the karmic ladder, more in keeping with Camus’ Myth of Sisyphus. The contradictions are numerous. It has to be noted that reincarnationists are always talking about karma, about climbing the karmic ladder, but always in the next reincarnation, very rarely in the present one. A clear example? The Indian vice consul arrested in New York was clearly exploiting the servant she brought from India. Why? Because the servant came from a lower caste, the suffering is her karma, that his her problem. The vice consul, apparently from a higher caste, was worried about her material comfort, doing little to get out of the wheel of Karma. Why be surprised about what Freud wrote about human nature? Better, Jesus said, “Where is your treasure there is your heart also.” It happens in Christendom also. Let us take a clear example from there, although the object is a revered figure. Thomas Jefferson was wealthy, with 602 slaves in his backyard and minors working as “trainees” in his nail factory. He had plenty of time to cut the Gospels into pieces, selecting only those passages that were convenient to his lifestyle. With a desktop he would be much more faster, there would be no need for scissors and glue. Cardinal Avery Dulles wrote that he was a “Christian deist”! What sort of apologia was this? There can be no doubt that NHNE’s intentions are very good, but the aims are not relevant to Shroud studies. They can help those whose faith is weak, there are gaps to be filled and these undermine faith. That is because Jesus spoke to us about our lives, he didn’t say anything about the universe that is presented to us. If, as it is said, the universe is indifferent, it can also be stated that Jesus was indifferent to it. You learn that in the Gospels. Jesus demanded absolute faith..","date":"2014-01-12","mins":"7:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/12/barrie-schwortz-tedx-talk-featured-on-nde-site/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Barrie Schwortz’ TEDx Talk Featured on NDE Site"},{"id":"comment-73162","author":"louis","post":"That’s right, Dan, you have correctly pointed out that there is variety both in faith journeys and in what scientists are saying, which is what makes leaping to conclusions incorrect. The battle between Descartes and Spinoza is still raging, neuroscientists have made reasonable progress, they have provided signs but no hard evidence and have left yawning gaps to fill and so we have to be patient. Most of this is spurred by the quest for human survival and no one thinks about other living matter. What about animals, what about plants? It was sufficient food for thought for Albert Schweitzer and I think Dr. Alan Adler had this in mind when he said that “nothing lasts forever”. Did not Pope John II refer to the “mystery of life and death” during one Shroud exposition? Right now, therefore, let us concentrate on images, which is not only something more interesting but also more palpable for us in the field of Shroud studies. We have to determine what is psychic, what is natural, what is unnatural, what is spiritual. Little has been said about the imprints Padre Pio left on handkerchiefs. The phenomenon is mentioned by Prof. Giulio Fanti, who says that around two hundred of these kerchiefs are extant in one of his Shroud books. The link below makes mention of this and has a clear photograph of the imprint on the handkerchief: http://motheofgod.com/threads/the shroud of padre pio.4501/ That the priest Agostino Gemelli, also a physician and psychologist, once President of the Pontifical Academy of Science, was quite hasty in judging him becomes evident when one considers that the monk was canonised.

It was the post Easter appearances in general that were decisive. The problem with de Wesselow is that although his book called attention to the unique image on the TS he did not seem to understand that for the Palestinian Jewish Christians who formed the Jesus movement resurrection meant bodily resurrection and not the Greek philosophical dichotomy of body/soul. He therefore dismisses many of the Gospel accounts as “fantasies.” There is another problem, and that is with J.P. Meier, whose series will end without the Resurrection because he thinks that that is beyond the scope of the historian. It is like judging what is less historical to be beyond the purview of the historian. So he simply says that “Jesus rose in the fullness of his humanity into the full presence of God.” That is fine for him as a Catholic priest, in fact a monsignor, who believes in the Resurrection, and who also says mass and preaches at a parish in New York. Benedict XVI, whose book “Jesus of Nazareth” has also been appreciated by important Protestant scholars, and is a theologian and no historian, puts it more succinctly: “The Resurrection is not above and beyond history. It points beyond history but has left footprints in history.” Shroud studies will have to determine if the relic is ONE of those footprints..","date":"2013-01-03","mins":"5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England"},{"id":"comment-43607","author":"louis","post":"One wonders if it is worthwhile quoting J.D,Crossan, who believes that Jesus’ dead body was eaten by wild dogs and encouraged — you said it! — Jacobovici.

Not that he is not right in calling the attention of the faithful to these problems, it is the concentration on this alone that is the problem and there are other serious topics to be addressed. It is because of reasons like these that the South American (Catholic) clergy is now facing the problem of thousands leaving the fold, many of these founding their own “churches”, one in every corner, with “pastors” who have not gone beyond high school, learning the Bible in six months, stressing “theology of prosperity”, tithes, buying imported cars, living in mansions and what not. This was even noticed by Robert Runcie, the head of the Anglican Church, who spoke his mind when he visited the region years ago. The sense of community should have been stronger, replacing the social club mentality prevalent in the parishes. . There are indeed weak points in John P. Meier’s approach, as Luke Timothy Johnson pointed out. He received two gold medals for excellence in biblical studies while studying in Rome and is admired and quoted by Benedict XVI. Father Fitzmyer is a better scholar in some ways,but Ratzinger never seemed to like the historical critical method adoped by him, Fathers Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy. Their “Jerome Biblical Commentary” is an excellent source for any one who wishes to go deeper into biblical studies. As for Rabbi Boteach, he does have some good things to say, and is trying to make Jesus more relevant to Jews, but it does lead to distortions. That was also the case with Geza Vermes.

Their mistake is to ignore psi and the fact that genuine parapsychological phenomena are spontaneous and can therefore not be tested in a laboratory. They appear as though by accident. But, coming to the topic of the Shroud, their point of view is the result of unfinished work in the realm of Shroud studies. The “greats” in the field published their papers and took it for granted that what they proffered would be unchallenged. They are now silent. Why? Because only chummies/buddies were allowed to publish what they wanted in newsletters or websites and get away with it and not all those who were writing papers were professionals in the field. The result is that Turin has turned down requests for a a new hands on examination of the relic. Scepticism is growing as each day passes by and the Judaeo Christian worldview is becoming unconvincing because of some discoveries in science. The Genesis creation story was borrowed from Mesopotamian mythology, and written between the 7th and 5th centuries BC. Sean Freyne preferred the 5th century. There are two creation accounts because there are two sources: Jahvist and Priestly. Mythology was adapted to suit monotheist ends. This does not mean to say that the Bible is myth.

It would be wrong to confuse this field with Spiritualism, although, unfortunately this appears to have been done in some cases by London’s SPR. C.G. Jung was a co founder of the Society, had dabbled in the occult through the influence of relatives and it was mod during the period. He then gave it up and moved to other areas. See my article “What did Jung see in the Shroud?” on the Collegamento pro Sindone website. Piero has attributed the imprint to something to do with the mattress dye. Does it explain how the partial head image got to the mattress? No, it doesn’t and the same can be said about bilirubin. : https://www.academia.edu/4691379/Can the Jospice Mattress imprint be compared to the Image on the Shroud In First World countries the undertaker is called when a person dies and the work is quick. That is not so in many Third World countries, where the body of a poor man can lie for hours on a mattress on a stretcher waiting for relatives, if any, who can give a decent burial. Sometimes the body lands on the tables of students of medicine. I have seen bodies being offered for black magic rituals. That is the world we live in. Anyway, the point is that no imprints have been seen in these cases. It has also been said in England that it is the work of an artist. I have chosen to ignore this view because the interview article, the link to which is given above, has the scientist saying that it was a Kirlian process. That is closer to the telergy I proposed. Once again, the partial head image — emphasised by good Father Francis O’Leary, with whom I had some contact — is ignored in the case proposing an artist’s image. I can’t say with certainty if all STURP members knew/know about the imprint. Most of them probably did/do because it was Ian Wilson who brought the topic into the debate on the Shroud.

That being so, I am willing to respond to any doubts about the questions asked, the rest will have to wait for peer review. On my part, I can say that I work independently, am not anyone’s spokesman, and there is a lot more to come that will have to wait till 2015. – It has been commented more than once on this blog that only chummies were allowed to publish what they wanted to say — rubbish or not — in Shroud newsletters and other publications. So why complain if Shroud researchers have to post their articles and papers on other websites, beyond the realm of Shroud studies? Curiously, the same researchers who have their papers on Shroud websites and newsletter also post their material on other sites and why is this so? – As for peer review, Dr. Frederick Zugibe had his paper on the Jospice Mattress Imprint posted on a Shroud website without peer review. I was not given a chance, only when my article on the topic was run on an e mail list from Ohio. In my article I dwelt on the partial head image that Dr. Zugibe failed to tackle. Why? It was convenient for him, he was proposing bilirubin. Father Francis 0’Leary had emphasized this head image. – Lastly, I have noted that there there is a cult like devotion to Ray Rogers in some Shroud circles as though what he wrote is gospel truth. That has to be rejected in view of the positivism I detected in his approach. It is not that I am in favour of the “miraculists”, but I do believe that if the Shroud did indeed wrap the body of Jesus then the image is there for a purpose.

And why is that so? Because its stand has always been that it was the risen Christ — and not any relic — that was the difference and provided the courage needed by the first Christians to face lions, be crucified upside down, be flogged in synagogues and so forth. It is not all difficult to understand this if one goes beyond the Shroud to concentrate on biblical studies and theology. The last sentence of the previous comment has something to do with this. Much more cooperation is needed in Shroud studies if the Church is to create a commission that can supervise and select the relevant material and hand it over to the Pontifical Academy of Science for analysis and it is they who will judge what should reach the Pope’s desk. It is clear that Jesus said some things that could be interpreted as “Take it or leave it” and that, and not any relic, is apparently what Christians should concentrate on..","date":"2012-10-16","mins":"5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/12/stephen-e-jones-starting-a-new-series-of-posts/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Stephen E.

But that will not be his fault because he was just a physicist, not a theologian like Rahner or a philosopher like Heidegger. As I wrote more than once here, there is still a lot more in the box and it will not be the Big Bang theory or the Turin Shroud that will stop churches from closing down (nine a day only in the US, it seems). For that matter, it is also the reason why 70% of Israel’s population is secular, roughly thinking along the lines archaeologist Israel Finkelstein thinks. There are two things that have to be considered by those writing on the Shroud: 1) If the image was formed by a natural process, what will it tell us? Do we need it to prove the existence of Jesus or that he was crucified, dead and buried? 2) If it was formed by a supernatural process, a byproduct of the Resurrection, will it answer all our questions? No, it wont. One has to go beyond Shroud studies to see what science is discovering. There are things that neither science or religion can answer now and we have to go beyond slowly. Kelly asks if anyone knows where Ray Rogers stood on evolution. Judging from a paper he co authored, nothing to do with the Shroud, he accepted the evolutionary process, and in this particular paper he sort of wrote about it as an automatic process, without saying anything about where the rationale came from. Such an attitude can unfortunately also be seen in some areas of Shroud studies.

Yes, a cynical atheist generation does crave for a sign of the truly divine and, given some of the discoveries of science, some Christians have felt that their own faith has been undermined and this is particularly true of fundamentalists, with their literal interpretation of Genesis. The well known American Catholic philosopher David Schindler recently launched a book where he talks about how philosophy and theology can intersect and why there is no need to throw faith overboard. Do you know where Heidegger recovered his faith, decades after fighting with the Jesuits, and after his philosophy led him nowhere? He found it in history. He did not stop thinking, with that kind of mind he just couldn’t. He began to enter and bless himself whenever he passed by a church and called a priest to his house to make sure he would be given a Catholic burial.

Some of the world’s best Bible scholars have now started to move in a different direction, something they should have done decades ago. They were prompted by discoveries in science that tell us about missing links between religion and science. The direction they are taking will probably pave the way for a convincing systematic theology. Rome and Turin should make the Shroud available for another hands on examination. Will they do it?

I wouldn’t go by what seminary professors teach because each one pursues one line and that was in fact what worried Benedict XVI, but then there is only one Gregorian University. Some years ago I went for Sunday mass at the London house of a religious order and saw that there would be not one but two priests who would say the mass. They were on leave from their South American mission and on their way to Scotland and Ireland. The one who preached said some strange thing about where God could be found and invited the faithful to comment if they wished. I just kept quiet and was taken to task by the person who was accompanying me for not saying anything. I had to tell him that if I started to comment the discussion would go on till dinner time and I preferred to have coffee with the padres — including one from New Zealand — after mass since it was already winter in England and it was very cold. I discussed religion with the good “sanyasi” Dom Bede Griffiths and we couldn’t reach agreement. I did admire him as a truly spiritual man. On one occasion I was invited for lunch at a Jesuit seminary, preceded by benediction at which Father Jacques Dupuis presided. Thank God he did not preach! Now to Matthew: It is almost uncontested that the evangelist is a Jewish follower of Jesus and that his churches had a Palestinian Jewish origin. He was very close to the Jewish milieu of Jesus. His gospel is directed to Jews, so much so that Jacob Neusner used it to write his own book on Jesus. The gospel is said to resemble the type of sacred story Mircea Eliade called “myth”, which is constitutive for the religious orientation of a people or tribe, with the difference that this “myth” is not a story happening hundreds of years ago. It resembles the basic foundational stories of Israel in the Pentateuch. It is a traditional text in which the traditions about Jesus were transmitted without a radical rupture in the cultural and religious milieu. Above all, in such a milieu, the memory that Jesus was a Jew and that he was sent to Israel — NOT TO THE GENTILES — (Matthew 10.5 6) could be preserved. So, what would Matthew be doing among the goyim, the gentiles?.","date":"2015-06-15","mins":"7:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/14/stephen-jones-on-the-thomas-de-wesselow-presentation/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones on the Thomas De Wesselow Presentation"},{"id":"comment-202237","author":"louis","post":"Daveb has not understood that a distinction has to be made between oral tradition and oral history and relies on Encyclopaedia Britannica to drive a point home.
