You are absolutely right in pointing out that the overall picture of Shroud research will be tarnished. Perhaps this is the result of the lack of ego bashing in the realm of Shroud studies, which has led to little cooperation, and prompted Benedict XVI to say that he was aware about what has gone on, in his statement as read out by Bishop Kevin Vann, of Forth Worth, Texas during the last Shroud conference in Dallas. Why, then, should we be surprised that it is the papal custodian who decides — obviously with the pontiff’s approval — about what is right and what is wrong in what was once correctly described by one prominent Shroudie as a minefield..","date":"2013-04-06","mins":"10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/05/a-committee-far-removed-from-padua/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Committee Far Removed from Padua"},{"id":"comment-29506","author":"louis","post":"Peer review just means that the paper can be taken into consideration, not that what is stated in gospel truth, but, of course, it is always helpful to get a paper published in a good peer reviewed journal.

Some of it was only conveyed privately to his disciples and this is what prompted the great Hindu sage Swami Vivekananda to take him very seriously and start the Vedanta branch of Hinduism, where he is honoured as avatar, incarnation of God. Actually Vivekananda, who was very learned, did not find the impersonal God of Hindu philosophy satisfying, he was looking for something concrete and found it in Jesus. He began to translate the “Imitation of Christ” into Bengali, the language spoken in the Indian state of West Bengal and Bangladesh, but was unable to finish it. He took Jesus so seriously that his only possessions were a staff and a small pot to carry water, that is how he travelled all over India, that is how he arrived to lecture in the US – penniless. He remained single throughout his life like a true brahmachari. It is for reasons like these that scholarly Hindus say that Jesus would have been understood if he had been born in India.

As for the book of Revelation, as you surely know it is highly complex and the interpretations are many, therefore the need to tread carefully. It was controvesial right from the beginning, not having been included in the Peshitta (the Syriac New Testament) initially and became part of the canon only later.

I have been between working on a big academic book on Jesus and something on the Templars, also commenting on shroudstory. While it is not hard to understand how you feel, which is worthy of respect, my views are different. I am reposting here part of what I commented some days ago, but that does not make my faith less than yours! Best. “Everyone wants to know whether it is Jesus — who played the central role in history — who is the man seen on the Shroud. If it really is Jesus, what is the message of the Shroud? If the image was formed in a natural manner, what will it tell us? We know what was done to Jesus. It is in the Gospels. Mahatma Gandhi literally broke into tears the first time he saw a crucifix, when he left London, where he was studying law at the Inner Temple, and went to Rome on holiday and visited the Sistine Chapel. It is doubtful if he knew something about the Shroud. If supernatural agency was involved will it answer all our questions? It doesn’t seem so because science is telling us some things that clash with what is written in the Bible. There are things beyond the purview of the Bible and systematic theologians have not been able to answer questions that have been raised so far. We have to “rethink” what is meant by Monotheism. Is that heresy? No it is’nt. We must remember that Jesus said things that made people who heard him realise that he was presenting himself as someone different from the rest of mankind. He has his own views about God, Moses and Scripture. If the Shroud image was produced by supernatural means it will have to conform to these views. Life in the world is getting to be very uncomfortable, more people are now wondering if God exists and where he can be found.

It is correct to employ both science and religion, but the question that arises is how much can science and religion(in the conventional sense) can tell us? Since there are two approaches in (pro authenticity) science, one “naturalist” the other “miraculist”, this is what we must ask: Naturalist: Why would only Jesus leave his image on the Shroud by natural means if many like him were executed and buried as criminals by the Romans? Not all bodies were left on the cross to be devoured by wild dogs. Was Jesus not entitled to an air conditioned tomb? Miraculist: “Hundreds of thousands in degrees Celsius lasting for a few hundredths of a second”. One wonders if any measurement is indeed possible. Taken from: https://www.academia.edu/8841978/Professor Giulio Fanti discusses the controversies in the realm of Shroud studies where the differences between the “naturalist” and “miraculist” points of view can be read. I now quote John Klotz: “If indeed the Shroud is Christ’s and, if science is deciphering its revelation, what is it telling us?” It is a very important question, one gives that gives rise to another query: How much can science decipher and just how much (conventional) religion can interpret? It is known that the Resurrection has no analogy in human history, in fact it is said to have uniqueness par excellence. I now quote the (Reformed) Protestant theologian Jürgen Moltmann: “The raising of Christ involves not the category of the accidentally new, but the expectational category of the eschatologically new. The eschatologically new event of the resurrection of Christ, however, proves to be a novum ultimum both as against the similarity in ever recurring reality and also against the comparative dissimilarity of new possibilities emerging in history.” We have not got to the Jesus behind the text. Schweitzer abandoned scholarly studies after publishing his monumental work on the Jesus of history and withdrew into a world of mysticism, running a hospital as a medical missionary in Africa, firmly believing that Jesus comes alive when the Gospels are read. Will we get to the Jesus behind the Shroud image?.","date":"2014-12-21","mins":"10:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/21/a-quote-for-this-sunday/","cat":"quotations","title":"A Quote for this Sunday"},{"id":"comment-53154","author":"louis","post":"It does not seem that the Catholic Church is bothered about what non Catholic Christians accept or not and the Anglicans/Episcopalians trace the origin of their Church to Henry VIII/Cranmer, not to Martin Luther. While Anglicans may have some Protestant beliefs they have rituals and doctrines that are very Catholic in style. The Anglican Church is much more interested in meetings with Catholics and Orthodox Christians than with Protestants, precisely because of the apostolic tradition. That is why Westminster Abbey now has many icons and “Virgin Marys”. The Orthodox Churches are also in some way or the other wanting some sort of communion with Rome, holding meetings or even signing agreements, like the one between Pope John II and Mar Dinkha IV of the Assyrian Church of the East, of Iraqi origin. It is obvious that for some people getting rid of old Anglican prejudices against Catholics is difficult and the funny side of the story is that this prejudice is still deeply ingrained in people who are no longer Anglicans or even atheists. One example is RD, the other is Susan Blackmore, who attacked Tony Blair when he (officially) became Catholic.

Then he spent a good amount of time arguing with Professor Giovanni Riggi about the site from where the sample had to be taken in 1988, keeping the other scientists waiting patiently.Professor Chagas did not believe in the authenticity of the relic, and it is unlikely that Professor Gonella did. Later, shortly before he died, the papal custodian Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero gave an interview saying that he was manipulated. Given what I heard from an authority close to the Vatican, there had been a lot of pressure on the Church. It is important to ask,Why all this pressure? Is it to clear the doubts of Christians with weak faith? Or is it to satisfy the desires of anti Christians? If Rome placed that much importance on a relic that is not an article of Faith Pope John Paul II would have requested Umberto II di Savoia to allow him to place the relic on the High Altar at Saint Peter’s and not preserved at the Royal Chapel in Turin.

Personally I think that systematic theology has been unable to provide satisfactory answers and Rome, at least, cannot make any pronouncements because many claims in physics and biology are yet to be verified.

There was intention behind the choice of this term. Benedict XVI is first and foremost a professor and a scholar and was reported to have requested Pope John Paul II to leave as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to look after the Vatican library. His request was turned down because John Paul needed him where he was. The right environment for him was the apartment where he lived as a cardinal, with 20000 books, his two cats and his piano. He did not expect to be the pope and there can be no doubt that the legacy he will leave are the scholarly books he wrote. This being so, he did not know what was going on right under his nose, through no fault of his. Communications between Vatican departments have not been good.

In 1988 the Carmelite Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero is said to have been influenced by his religious order’s scepticism regarding “material supports” and there is some support for that point of view in the photograph where he appeared leaning over the Shroud. As everyone in the realm of Shroud studies knows, that led to disastrous consequences — some say Professor Luigi Gonella was also sceptical — and Ballestrero later admitted that he had been manipulated. Whatever the case, the Volto Santo Church in Italy designed by architect Mario Botta (seen on the topboxdesign website) has the Shroud face at the altar. So perhaps the webmaster may have seen this as some justification for the image he posted. And then it is very different, for example, from Caravaggio’s first version (1601) of the “Supper at Emmaus”, with the post Resurrection clean shaven Christ, the rationale for this in the Gospel of Mark, chapter 12. His own idea about the appearance of Christ appeared in the second version (1606) of Emmaus. People who don’t know about this are puzzled when they only see the first version. Some years ago, while I was looking at the original in London, a group of very young school children appeared and sat on the floor to look at it and learn something about its history. The first question the teacher asked the kids was why Christ was beardless. The common idea of the bearded first century Jew Jesus (very unlike the clean shaven Romans) is kind of stuck in our minds and the webmaster did not have to look around for the best image..","date":"2013-01-20","mins":"11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/19/benedict-xvi-jesus-shows-us-the-face-of-god/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Benedict XVI: Jesus Shows Us the Face of God"},{"id":"comment-103644","author":"louis","post":"Bill Donohue is mixing things up.

It remained a mystery, at least to me, till I read a book about him by the German journalist Andreas Englisch, a lapsed Catholic who returned to the faith like Peter Seewald, former editor of “Der Spiegel”. The late pontiff had the ability to heal and cure but did not want anyone to say anything about it, so the German journalist and writer published his findings around two years ago. Among the cases he cites: An American Jewish millionaire, dying of a malignant brain tumour, wanted to die in Jerusalem but wanted to see Pope John Paul II before that. An arrangement was therefore made through Msgr. Stanislau Dziwisz, then the Pope’s secretary. The dying man was brought on a stretcher to the chapel where the Pope said early morning mass, received Holy Communion(!) and then flew to Jerusalem.

One must also add that he brought the former “Der Spiegel” editor, ex communist and fellow Bavarian Peter Seewald, a really hard nut to crack, back to his Catholic faith after an interview, for which Benedict refused to see any questions in advance! Some of the books published after these meetings can be seen at: http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO H/light of the world.aspx Now, we cannot forget that there are mysteries, and the word “mystery” is often employed in Catholic doctrine, even in prayers. That is honesty. For the fundamentalists everything in the Bible is true, if not nothing is true. If something goes wrong, they lose their faith and become anti Christian, then go ahead and write books against Christianity. There are some former (fundamentalist) pastors in the US who did this. On the other hand, science is also full of mysteries, there is no point in science trying to take the place of philosophy or religion, although many scientists would love to see that happen. Stephen Hawking is a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and that goes to show his greatness, he knows that he may always have to change his mind, he recognises the mysteries in science That is being honest. As the Anglican priest scientist John Polkinghorne has said more than once, science has its limits.

I will go further: Even if the relic is “proved” to be authentic, that it does show something about the Resurrection, it will not answer all questions. There is a lot in physics that is theoretical, so the Bing Bang theory proposed by Father Georges Lemaitre, the “Catholic priest” who Roemer refers to, may have to be changed. One sees Stephen Hawking proposing a theory, then changing his mind, knowing that answers are not easy. His big mistake was to mix science and theology, leading to scientism, so he did not really answer the question he himself had posed, as commented on another thread yesterday.

It was actually me, not Dr. Paolo, who said that the Jackson/Fanti fall through hypothesis was no longer viable. So the blame for the misunderstanding has to be laid on my shoulders. The Italian physicist, guided by Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti it seems, was able to see that there was no double superficiality on the Shroud. That is clear in the interview. Years before this interview a prominent “Shroudie” did give me the same information, however I kept quiet, thinking about a line Ian Wilson wrote in his book “The 2000 year old mystery solved” saying that when Professor Giovanni Riggi separated the relic from the backing cloth he saw some stains that looked like an image in the face area. Now the question that arises is: what exactly do we see there? Are they bloodstains or a bit of the face image? Turin says they are bloodstains. You may remember that I wrote an article entitled “Science and religion meet in Shroud research”, which was an interview with Professor Giulio Fanti on the double superficiality and other points in his research. It is no longer online but I am willing to post it again if that is what you wish.

The milieu in which it arose (Daniel 12:2, for example) left no doubt in interpretation: It could only mean bodily resurrection.

The quest has affected Jews, particularly after the Nazi Holocaust, and Christians and Jews with discoveries in science. It does not affect — so much — people whose belief in God is vague in the sense that they do not believe in Revelation, as Jews and Christians understand it, their belief is more a philosophy of life than a religion. It also does not affect — so much — people who have a religion/philosophy of life where there is no deity. They are more prepared to take things as they come because they expect nothing like believers in monotheistic religions and are therefore sort of indifferent to developments. That is the reason why churches in the Western world are becoming empty as each day passes by, why less Jews attend synagogues in the US, why the new generations are not tied to beliefs held by their forefathers, being more interested in “electronic friendships” and in building careers. In a way, RD made a strong effect when he went around London in that bus proclaiming that God does not exist, wrote a number of books against belief in a Supreme Being and so forth. But RD has had second thoughts, recently refusing to sign a letter criticising UK Prime Minister David Cameron for calling England a Christian nation. He is intelligent, understanding, perhaps, that there is more room for science theology dialogue, that he leaped without looking to a certain extent. Whatever new discoveries science can show us, it is bound to affect all believers, whether they believe in monotheism or not, whether they believe in some deity (however vaguely he is defined) or not, whether they believe in no deity, only in some philosophy. The quest for Jesus in Shroud research is interesting to believers and atheists alike, to see who is right and who is wrong. But as I have stressed more than once, even if it is “proved” that the Man of the Shroud is Jesus, that the relic demonstrates the Resurrection in some way or the other, it will still leave questions answered. The Church could not be more correct in not including the relic as an article of faith, in not thinking of adding …”wrapped in the Turin Shroud” to what is said in the Creed. No one has to believe, like Gould, that life on earth began like a big joke, just like an accident. There is more to it, scientists cannot indulge in scientism, there will have to be more science theology dialogue, to reduce the feeling of emptiness that many may feel if they are not indulging in electronic illusions: https://www.academia.edu/7343768/Viktor Frankl and the Human Search for Meaning.","date":"2014-06-21","mins":"9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/hathos-warning/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Hathos Warning"},{"id":"comment-132072","author":"louis","post":"Sorry, “questions answered” above should read “questions unanswered”..","date":"2014-06-21","mins":"9:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/hathos-warning/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Hathos Warning"},{"id":"comment-20067","author":"louis","post":"It is not the women or the empty tomb but the appearances that are crucial in the Resurrection accounts..","date":"2012-12-08","mins":"8:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/have-we-now-exhausted-this-off-topic/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Have we now exhausted this off-topic?"},{"id":"comment-201017","author":"louis","post":"This reminded me of good Father Francis O’Leary, with whom I had some contact, whose hospices look after poor terminal patients looking for a place to die as peacefully as possible.

Being so, it was inevitable that elements from surrounding cultures crept into the text. Even the great (Protestant) scholar William F. Albright of Johns Hopkins knew about that. The best (Catholic) scholar to consult today is Joseph Blenkinsopp, his essay can found in the “New Jerome Biblical Commentary”, edited by Joseph A. Fitzmyer, Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy. If it depends on Finkelstein (secular Jew), most of it is myth. What can be said with certainty is that we still have a long way to go.

We still do not know enough about the mind body problem. Not everyone sees an all loving Being of light, which goes to show that whatever people “see” are products of their unconscious. We cannot live in a world of make believe, where it feels nice to think that in the end what is left of us is not eaten by worms or consumed by flames. The topic goes much more deeper than that, it involves all living matter, inanimate matter, the universe as a whole. Cosmology is the biggest challenge. 3) There was a tendency to exaggerate in ancient times in the region. It may have been due to an attempt to boost morale after the Babylonian Captivity, but that does not go to say that the authors were lying. 4) It it not true that the Shroud has been “scientifically shown to have been made in the Middle Ages”.

There are two issues to be tackled, so here we go: Pope Francis has indeed spoken about the devil once in a while and there are reports about Pope John Paul II performing exorcisms twice in the Vatican, about which no details are available. The Catechism of the Catholic Church (see no.1637) says that care must be taken to distinguish between demoniacal possession and psychiatric problems. We have the famous case of Anneliese Michel in Germany, who died during exorcisms, and the clergymen involved had problems with the law. It led to a book on the topic of evil, one of whose authors was Cardinal Walter Kasper, then archbishop of Stuttgart Rottenburg. Some years ago I read a full page newspaper report on the topic of the devil and exorcism, where Orthodox Jews, a reform rabbi and a Catholic priest gave their opinions. The orthodox Jews said they performed the exorcism by placing a pigeon’s anus on the navel of the person who was possessed so that the evil entity could leave. They then said that they burnt their fingernails when they were cut. When it came to this part I judged that this belief was derived from the Zoroastrian demonology of ancient Iran, probably during the Babylonian Captivity. (The narrative about the Gerasene demoniac in the Gospel according to Mark ends by saying that the man was sitting in his “right mind” after Jesus cured him. Did the “legion of demons” go into the pigs, or was that the interpretation of the bystanders, influenced by the Graeco Roman pagan mythology that was in vogue in Palestine after the Romans took over?). The reform rabbi dismissed the belief of the Orthodox Jews, saying that it was not a part of his Reform Synagogue’s theology. The most a rabbi could do, he said, was to pray for the person with the problem to find his “I”. That would take us to Heidegger’s “dasein”. The Catholic priest just said that the Church only believed in one divine being, and that was God, he rejected demonology and exorcisms. Ultimately the topic leads us to the “mysterium iniquitatis”, the mystery of evil, which is an ongoing problem, one that has led fundamentalist pastors to abandon their churches. It appears to have been very controversial in the Old Testament period. The great Jewish scholars Ben Zion Wacholder and Shemaryahu Talmon tried to trace where the problem originated: https://www.academia.edu/12734802/Book Review Beyond the Essene Hypothesis The Parting of the Ways between Qumran and Enochic Judaism C. G. Jung dwelt on the problem of evil, studying and discussing it with his closest friend, the American dominican friar Father Victor White, who lived in Oxford. They parted ways because of this, the strong Christian spiritual bond being the only link between them: https://www.academia.edu/7344691/C. G. Jung Father Victor White and privatio boni He was also a “Shroudie” in a way, with a copy of the Turin Shroud face hanging behind a small curtain in his study: https://www.academia.edu/6823292/What did Jung see in the Shroud (Click on http://www.sindone.info on the left) There is also mention of “idolatry” in the report. It does seem that we humans always look for something “palpable” when it comes to the divine. I have seen Muslims incensing photographs of Mecca and Jews kissing the Mezuzah and a photograph on the internet where an orthodox Jew is seen holding a cellphone close to the Wailing Wall so that his friend in Europe who was on the line could recite a prayer. This is also idolatry in a broad sense.

That is the way de Wesselow understands the Gospel. The big problem with some Protestant scholars is that they become sort of one track minded, confusing psychical research with spiritualism, and, worse, refusing to read other subjects, subjects which show that there is something beyond matter, and even about developments in science. This was pointed out in a book by one American Protestant scholar. One day or the other fundamentalists will have to confront what the universe shows us, and only those who believe that “everything is true or nothing is true” in the Bible will become agnostics, atheists or even anti Christian. There are well known cases. The broad minded Christians, with a more mature faith, who have read more, at least some lines about what Karl Popper had to say about science, for instance, will know that there is no need to throw faith overboard. Did not the world’s foremost Jesus researcher Monsignor John P. Meier write that many of the things Jesus said are still riddles, that the parables are riddles? He did not say they were meant to be riddles, but one can be sure that that was precisely Jesus’ intention. The riddles are the key to a deeper faith.

What does Jesus’ resurrection mean in Christianity? As the world renowned New Testament scholar Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer put it, “Even though some biblical interpreters would like to dismiss the idea of a bodily resurrection of Jesus and are skeptical about the empty tomb tradition, we must emphasize that the bodily resurrection of Jesus to glory is a basic part of the New Testament kerygmatic proclamation and a fundamental affirmation of Christian faith.” Pierre Teilhard de Chardin wisely developed his conception of an Omega point independent of the evolving universe. He thought about the Alpha, then went to the Omega. But what sense does the evolving universe, in between the Alpha and the Omega, make? The question of this evolving universe was tackled by Gould, an atheist, and Polkinghorne, an Anglican priest scientist, to give just two examples. The former thought it was a joke, the latter that it will be eventually destroyed. Isabel Piczek’s interpretation of the Shroud image makes sense in the context of an evolving universe, with the body of Jesus released from matter, at least no longer subject to it. I would hesitate to talk about “the possibility of the Resurrection”, but would certainly agree that there are signs that the Shroud “is consistent with it.”.","date":"2014-04-19","mins":"8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/19/its-called-circumstantial-evidence-anybody-have-a-better-idea/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It’s called circumstantial evidence.

While one was a philosopher, the other was a psychologist who had deep knowledge about many subjects. Jung was head and shoulders above Buber when it came to learning. There would be no misunderstanding or suspicion today, for Buber would have understood why Jung was not on the wrong track in his quest. Jung sought help from the American born Dominican Father Victor White, a psychologist and theologian at Blackfriars, Oxford, England, and a convert to Catholicism. He was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church but wanted some integration when it came to psychology and theology and Father White, who became his closest friend, could help him. The differences arose as a result of Jung’s “Answer to Job” and closed the door to the possibility of the priest becoming his successor. White may not have understood that Jung must have read Harnack, just as he read Nietzsche. But, despite the rift, the spiritual bond was still there. It is very likely that it was White who gave Jung a copy of the Shroud face, and he hung it behind a small curtain in his study. Was he hiding it? No, he wasn’t. Everyone knew that, whatever some of his writings on psychology, he was a Christian deep inside. Did he find something fascinating about the Shroud face because of some intuition? Could be.

It was stated that it is possible that there were Greek gospels before AD 70. The problem with many Christians is that they have developed a complex about the dating of the gospels and try to find “hard evidence” of eye witness accounts, other texts and so on. Unfortunately Thiede was one of them and 7 Q5 remains controversial and cannot be construed as hard evidence of a Greek NT text in the possession of the Essenes. As maintained by some scholars, many Essenes may have become Christians years after the crucifixion, in fact reports say that DNA studies of the Nasrani Christian (originally Jewish Christians) community in India have demonstrated a link with the “kohanim’, Cohen, or priests, perhaps leading to some link with the Essenes. The Essenes believed that they, and not the Sadducees, the “saduchim”, were the true priests. As Schweitzer noted, Jesus is “alive” when you read the gospels, the impact is very strong. That is why Jesus is “avatar” in Hinduism, having been recognised as such a divinity by the country’s towering figures like Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi. He is now inextricable in Hinduism and the more daring scholars say he would have been understood if he had been born there. If the search for eye witness texts, fragments is unnecessary for non Christians there, why should it be so important for Christian scholars?.","date":"2013-01-13","mins":"6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-21804","author":"louis","post":"Where is the update here?

Of the two world renowned biblical scholars interviewed by me for a major newspaper some years ago, one rejected his view while the other pointed to the controversy. Thiede did not appreciate the article’s mention of the computer he used to check the compatibility of the letters in the fragment with “hundreds” of ancient Greek texts. What can be said today is this: The controversy is not over. From my point of view Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin’s view that Jesus referred to the Essenes as “Herodians” is roughly correct. They were not obliged to make an oath of loyalty to Herod and their War Manual has some details that show dependence on a Roman military manual. So, if they could use texts coming from the pagan “minim”, Romans, they could also house in their scriptorium texts written by a rival group, the Jewish Christians, not part of “normative” Judaism like them. Someone in Qumran may have not liked the idea and tore the scroll and only a tiny fragment survived. The problem is that the fragment is in Greek. When was it written? Would the Jewish Christians write in Greek, before AD 70,the year the Tenth Roman Legion under the command of Vespasian destroyed Qumran on the way to besiege Jerusalem?

Pinchas Lapide wrote that he cured both physical and mental diseases, while Geza Vermes, who I had occasion to interview, said he was a “healer and exorcist.” Was Jesus an exorcist or did he cure mental disturbances? The WHO has officially stated that the mind and body are one unit, and it is known that 86% of diseases are of psychosomatic origin. How could Jesus only heal the physically sick and leave those with mental disturbances aside? I learnt of one solution during a course in parapsychology, the clue is in the case of the Gerasene demoniac, but that is a topic for a paper. It can only tackle a part of the discussion because we are still left with the problem of evil, in fact yesterday Australian Cardinal George Pell, now at the Vatican, warned people in England who are endeavouring people to bring ex Christians back to the faith that it is a problem they will face. Bultmann,the biblical scholar, had dismissed the miracle stories, influenced as he was by Heidegger, the existentialist. He continued to be a Lutheran, and Heidegger, the ex seminarian who had fought with the Jesuits, returned to Catholicism, not failing to call a priest to his house to make sure he would be given a Catholic burial. It is important to remember the extrabiblical testimony of Josephus about Jesus as a “worker of wondrous deeds”. So how we can clear doubts about whether to refer to the healing and curing as miracles or mysteries? In the synoptics they are called “deeds of might”, John refers to them as “works, deeds” and even “signs”. “Miracle” is derived from the word “miraculum” in the later Latin theological traditionter. Whatever term one might prefer, all have a Christological aspect. The great difficulty in accepting the miracle tradition is a philosophical one. It arose with the so called Enlightenment and the prominent spokesman was Hume, who is quoted in the context till today. It is not the answer we are looking for. How can a modern philosophical interpretation of today’s world be an answer to an historical question? I had been to Fatima years ago.

It looks like Professor Watson has assumed the role of Sherlock Holmes in trying to figure out the origin of the papyrus and his efforts are indeed worthwhile, however it is doubtful if the Gospel of Thomas had more to do with it. He seems to have overlooked another possibility, and that is the “style” adopted was the one used to compose the Gospel of Thomas, but the “inspiration” came from the Valentinian school. Thus, it is not difficult to agree with him that the papyrus could date to the fourth century or it is a modern forgery — the intention being the same. As for the obscurity you mention, yes, that does indeed complicate matters, but that is the gnostic trademark. Yet, the mischief making element also seems strong. As regards the James ossuary, the disagreement mentioned in the previous comment arose because there was no choice but to tell renowned scholars that God gave me good eyesight and even a layman could see that there were two different hands working on the inscription. There were of course other reasons to disagree. Why would Jesus, when nailed to the cross, and sensing that death was approaching,ask a disciple to look after his mother if he had a brother around? Perhaps, today, with the discussion about the papyrus, we can add, And why also if his mother had a daughter in law? As far as I know the IAA did not condemn anyone at the trial but continues to maintain that the inscription was partially forged, in fact Dr.Amos Kloner, who was for a while the Jerusalem District Archaeologist, had written a report for the Israeli authorities telling them that the inscription was not genuine. You are right about Karen King’s “proactive feminist agenda” and that is precisely what makes her attitude suspect, and, also leads her to cunningly ignore the words of Jesus on the “eunuchs” and tell Smithsonian that the fragment cast doubt on “the whole Catholic claim of a celibate priesthood based on Jesus’ celibacy.” When it comes to female ordination, I am sure you know that Pope John Paul II said that the disciples chose were all men, and, needless to say, that does not mean he was against women participating in Church activities, but in other roles.

He also never went beyond any limit, as did some authors whose imagination ran wild. Regarding the IAA, I will not hesitate to defend them, not only due to personal experience, but also because they demonstrated a lot more ethics than the people behind the TV documentaries and the books on the so called “Jesus family tomb” and the “James ossuary”. It is easy to see that they had no dog in the fight, no secret agendas and one must add that the uproar demanded an explanation from real scholarly circles, therefore the second documentary, which was an interview with some top scholars and those who promoted the “Jesus family tomb.” It turned out to be a success because Ted Koppel handled it very well and there was no doubt about who won the debate. One must not forget that, most important of all, to give the sensationalists who promoted the “Jesus family tomb” (Talpiot tomb) credibility also means calling those who wrote the Gospels (read in churches of all Christian denominations) liars who hid the truth, so where does that get us? John P. Meier has on the whole been good, but, as he himself wrote, the “historical Jesus” is not the “real Jesus”, and writing to please Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Agnostics is really not ideal. He should write about what he thinks are correct findings, not to please anyone. As for the shortcomings, they have been demonstrated by Professor Luke Timothy Johnson (USA) and Father Anthony Kelly (Australia). There is absolutely no surety about when the four gospels were written, John only being the more theological among them, and the disciples and primitive Christians came from an oral tradition.

Centuries after the sceptical English philosopher we meet Heidegger and Wittgenstein, with no God in their philosophies, but with the feeling that something is missing well alive and kicking inside them. Heidegger, the son of a sacristan, and an ex Jesuit seminarian, fought with the Jesuits and stopped going to Church. Towards the end of his life he walked a lot in the forests, thinking as usual, and when in the city, he entered the church he was passing by and blessed himself. Shortly before dying he called a Catholic priest to his house and requested a Catholic burial. History had told him that he was right in his faith, he said. What about Wittgenstein? Born 3/4th Jewish and baptised and raised Catholic he had no room for God in what he wrote in his philosophy, however like Heidegger he knew something more was needed. He spent a year at the Klosterneuberg monastery in his native Austria, sometimes in a hut somewhere in the mountains, always thinking about becoming a monk. Just before dying he asked his “Catholic friends” — philosopher Anscombe among them — to pray for him and they therefore called a priest to his bedside and gave him a Catholic burial. The point is this: Hume, Heidegger, Wittgenstein were interpreting the Bible as generally most Christians do today. Although they knew there was the need to “pound the square peg into the round hole” the German and Austrian philosophers were unable to do it and opted for God in the end, whether led by intuition or not. Both fundamentalist and allegorical readings of the Bible are wrong. The time is coming, when depending on our interpretation of Scripture, there will be no need to pound the square peg into the round hole. Jesus said….","date":"2013-06-10","mins":"9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/10/pounding-the-square-peg-into-the-round-hole/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Pounding the square peg into the round hole"},{"id":"comment-36694","author":"louis","post":"The above comment is good and demonstrates that Newton, the scientist, anticipated philosophers Heidegger and Wittgenstein.

That is only part of the story, for Einstein looked to Spinoza for metaphysics and did not also go as far as he needed to go because he was one track minded.

If not, then it is high time that he devotes at least some time to it. May I suggest he read at least a bit of Karl Popper? Neither scientists nor clergymen can jump to conclusions. Cardinal William Henry O’Connell of Boston accused Albert Einstein of atheism, after which Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue in New York tried to defend the scientist and made an even bigger blunder with his interpretation. What did the rabbi do? He sent Einstein a telegram asking him about his belief in God and when told that the deity was “Spinoza’s God” — a deity that even Spinoza could not really define! — the rabbi reached his conclusion. And what was this conclusion? That monotheism could be proved scientifically! Of course, Einstein kept quiet. A personal God and monotheism was never in his mind. Didn’t the rabbi know that in Judaism it is not possible to confuse God and creation? The possibility that consciousness exists everywhere, even in inanimate matter in a way, was hinted at by Nietzsche. Neuroscience has produced remarkable results, that can be called signs, but there is no hard evidence so far. We have the case of neuroscientist James Fallon, who began as a genetic determinist and then changed his mind because of what he discovered in his own brain. Is it biology that tells us the difference between good and evil? There is a lot more research to do. It does not seem that Buddha knew the answer to everything, despite his wisdom, he did leave questions answered. That is why it seemed that those monks who ruled Tibet as a theocracy before China came into the picture were not bothered about emptiness and the nature of the mind. This I learnt while talking to Tibetan refugees who were selling coarse woolen sweaters they made to eat their daily bread outside Tibet. Life was not better for them before China invaded the country, but of course it would be better if Tibetans ruled their own country.

I was in London in October 1988, researching mediaeval history, reading in libraries, taking photographs and so on and one day I came home after a usual tiring day and watched the news on BBC TV. There was a report about the the TS and the Jospice Mattress Imprint, but even then I did not pay that much attention to the Shroud. I missed the press conference at the BM. I agree with what John stated and was glad to see that he covered it in his book. Rev. David Sox behaved like a mischief maker and traitor, Edward Hall came to the scene with his head full of pre conceived ideas.

This is a worldwide phenomenon and the reason lies in the fact that sensationalism sells, so one just has to follow the money line to understand the rationale. But it is not only newspapers that are involved in leaping before looking; books also come into the picture. Take one book on the so called James ossuary, where Ben Witherington proudly announced that the Catholic Church would have to “rethink” the Virgin birth. As soon as another, even bigger, piece of sensationalism — the “Jesus Family Tomb” — came on the scene he distanced himself from what he had said previously by saying that James was buried elsewhere, that is, not in the tomb. It is clear that it is not the media alone that can be guided by prejudice. It is not difficult to find serious scholars who have no dog in the fight.

Pfeiffer recently posted on the HSG website). In my view, if Cardinal Ballestrero, as a Carmelite, was wary about relics, Pope John Paul II, also as philosopher, knew that authenticity would leave many questions unanswered. My suggestion is that the encyclical “Fides et Ratio” should be read first as it is a very important document that merited further study by the late American Cardinal (and renowned theologian) Avery Dulles. If anyone has doubts, allow me to go further and say that more homework should be done. After reading the encyclical see the saintly pontiff’s attitude when visiting Nirmal Hriday, Mother Teresa’s shelter in Calcutta.

When I was in London I once went with a friend who had to exchange an oil jacket he had bought there at the Brent Cross Shopping Centre before flying back to NYC. Uniformed members of the Salvation Army were there trying to collect money for the poor and they were having a hard time. I agree with you when you say that there’s a great world out there and we need to be involved with it. But it should begin in the community, which should never become a social club. It has to go much beyond the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, giving the sign of peace by shaking hands..","date":"2014-10-25","mins":"5:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/24/scientific-truth-is-a-pathway-to-god/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Scientific truth is a pathway to God"},{"id":"comment-165661","author":"louis","post":"David, I had a hardbound copy of Wilde’s complete works many years ago.

Daveb says his father was a butcher, so I could jokingly say that no wonder he is in favour of using animals in laboratory experiments, but I wont! My father was a doctor, his elder brother got an honorary doctorate in medicine from the very European university where he became a doctor years before. A few years before that he was appointed by both Government and Church to examine the incorrupt body of a Catholic saint and submit a report, which was later published by an European Academy of Science. But this has not influenced me in the least because my father did not have much patience with animals and my uncle did not seem to be a big animal lover. My position is based on study and observation and experience, which would drive anyone to understand that all form of suffering should be reduced to the minimum possible because there is a lot more evil in the world than most people imagine. The most dangerous form of evil is that one which acts silently. For those who are unwilling to accept this, one can say, at least to believing Christians, it is mentioned in the most important Christian prayer: The Lord’s Prayer. As for daveb’s second comment, I beg to differ, halal butchers got their theology from (in my view) unnecessary teachings that crept into the Old Testament. How could the God of Israel be different from the pagan gods if he advocated blood sacrifices? The hated Romans also sacrificed animals, the Seleucid ruler Antiochus Epiphanes slaughtered swine in the Jerusalem Temple to show that he was in charge in Palestine and could desecrate the house of worship. The Prophets seem to have understood, for one of them wrote, “I will have mercy and not sacrifice”. I have seen a Jewish politician, an extremely respectable person who has done a lot of good, much more good than his gentile colleagues, demanding an end to “Shehitah” (kosher),and some four months ago I saw a TV news report where two groups of Jews, Orthodox and Reform, were arguing on the streets and the issue was blood sacrifice. The Reform Jew told the journalist present that the chickens the Orthodox were selling for 30 dollars each did not take away anyone’s sins and that the Orthodox were making money out of it. Of course, this view comes from the historical critical reading of the Bible, a form of study which was accepted even by an important Israeli Jewish scholar like Yehezkel Kauffman. So, it seems that appealing to laboratory animals to study the Shroud image formation is more like an act of desperation, nothing more than a demonstration of weak faith. As I commented more than once here, even if it is “proved” that the Man of the Shroud is Jesus it will still not answer many questions..","date":"2014-02-26","mins":"8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"id":"comment-83077","author":"louis","post":"In # 108, daveb unnecessarily brought the halal butchers in NZ into the discussion about using animals in Shroud research.

One said that only one letter could be identified with some certainty, another, an expert in Greek, rejected any identification with the Markan gospel. At present the majority of scholars hold these kind of views. There are also other questions that are raised in this issue: the Essenes in Qumran were extreme separatists, far away from “mainstream” Judaism, and the Christian conception of God was different. Why would they hide Christian documents? Did Jesus refer to the Essenes as “Herodians”, as Yadin believed? Well, they were not obliged to make an oath of loyalty to Herod, and the “War Scroll”, written in Herodian script, shows dependence on a Roman military manual. On the other hand did Jesus refer to the Essenes when he spoke about eunuchs? It is possible, but no one can say with certainty. From my point of view, the primitive Christian community was intent on action, and texts were secondary. They were not distributing material like what the Jehovah’s Witnesses or members of “Jews for Jesus” do today. They were preaching, living in closely knit communities bound by love, sharing possessions.

Max has written about the two he has detected in his archaeocryptology, one on top of the other, and this is a matter for discussion. In the same way, there can be no two tombs, Church of the Holy Sepulchre and (Gordon’s) Garden Tomb. It is one or the other. Dan Bahat, who was for a number of years Jerusalem District Archaeologist wrote a paper in favour of the former: https://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot   Parts I and II One big mistake some people in the realm of Shroud studies make is to show the two tombs that can be seen beneath the church.They were told to add a note saying that the area was “honeycombed” with tombs, to quote Bahat, and prevent readers from thinking that the two tombs they have shown was the exact location where Jesus was buried. My advice seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Joseph of Arimathea made arrangements for Jesus to be buried in an unused tomb to avoid burial in one of the tombs reserved for criminals by the Sanhedrin. Some scholars have now claimed that these tombs had never been used because the Romans did not allow the Jewish court to execute criminals. This is absolute rubbish, the truth has been distorted to pave the way for Jacobovici’s “Jesus family tomb”. Jonathan, the High Priest at the Temple, was murdered by the Sicarii, James, the “brother of the Lord” was thrown from the Temple parapet and then clubbed to death with a fuller’s club, Stephen was stoned to death (in front of the apostle Paul, who was then the Pharisee known as Saul): https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot   Part III Although the Talpiot tomb had not gained support from the top Bibical scholars and archaeologists, both in and out of Israel, the mischief making has continued to now involve Mary Magdalene.

Can you describe an evolutionary process without saying where the rationality came from? Is that scientific objectivity? You are being unfair when you accuse me of putting people on a pedestal. If I put Dr. Di Lazzaro on one, which I didn’t, what did the people at National Geographic do? Do you think they have no staff members who understand about science?

You know you know I am not one to hide my Christian faith but if that is what you call an agenda you lost because this faith does not depend on relics at all. On the other hand, you have demonstrated an anti Catholic agenda, telling Dan he was quasi Catholic and questioning Hugh about his religion till he told you he was a “core Catholic”. Well, this is quite common in England, although it is getting better. If Tony Blair didn’t get himself baptised in a Catholic church before he left office it was only because it would be leave him uneasy, as Prime Minister, to appoint bishops of the Church of England. Remember, there is no church state separation in England. HM Queen Elizabeth needed Benedict XVI to encourage Christians in a country where Anglicanism is falling apart. Catholic and Anglicans always shared chapels in England, and around two weeks ago they began sharing churches. Well, this world we live in is full of biases, if it is not religion, it is race,if it is not race, it is language, if it is not language it has something to do with region and that’s how it is. But, whatever the religion, race, language or region, human nature is the same.That said, if we get down to personal attacks it is the same as hitting below the belly and that is not conducive to a fruitful discussion.

As a scientist, he is entitled to say that, but then he will have to reproduce a life size image. That is what Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro asks of anyone who picks up the gauntlet. As a scientist who has been studying the Shroud for thirty years you must also be aware that there are scientists in the realm of Shroud studies who openly claim that the image was produced by a miracle, what Dr. Di Lazzaro avoided saying. It is obvious that National Geographic accepted the Italian scientist’s research, just as I did, and went even further by dwelling on the amount of energy that would be needed to produce an image like the one we see on the Shroud. You can be sure that is because Dr. Di Lazzaro is direct and honest, and can even be blunt spoken when needed. Unfortunately that has not always been the case whenever I have written about the Shroud, making some Shroudies take me to task for publishing what someone else stated, which they rejected. In this case, the fault has not been mine as I expect to hear the truth, and refuse to be manipulated. If I was deceived then that is something else, what Ian Wilson has referred to as dishonesty in some circles in Shroud studies, while writing as editor of the BSTS newsletter. Unfortunately, many Shroud publications only allowed chummies to publish their articles, even if it was just plain rubbish, making me appeal to other publications. In cases like these I have received support from other Shroudies, particularly those who judged that I was correct. I tend to be careful in what I publish, and have some articles and interviews published after painstaking research preserved in university libraries or in other renowned institutions for reference. Now, if there are some scientists who openly mix science with religion, there are (or have been) others who did the exact opposite, sweeping any reference to the supernatural, even though it is implicit, under the rug. That is something I will never accept and if there are journalists who are not accurate that is their problem and I would not like to placed in the category they are in. My credibility is such that I am sometimes invited to give talks about the existence of God, or religion in general. I have turned down the requests, suggesting books to be read. I am one who believes that if you really look for the truth you will find it. Just how many are looking for this kind of thing is another story, as Schopenhauer and Pascal pointed out centuries ago..","date":"2015-04-25","mins":"6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-197729","author":"louis","post":"Hugh, do you believe that the supernatural is irrational?.","date":"2015-04-27","mins":"7:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-197504","author":"louis","post":"Thanks, Hugh..","date":"2015-04-25","mins":"7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-27252","author":"louis","post":"Another of those apocryphal texts that cannot be taken seriously..","date":"2013-03-13","mins":"10:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/13/the-shroud-connection-shape-shifting-jesus-described-in-ancient-egyptian-text/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud Connection: Shape-Shifting Jesus Described in Ancient Egyptian Text"},{"id":"comment-197929","author":"louis","post":"Given his point of view, Charles’ approach is now more balanced.

However, I think he would not refer to Apocalypse as that would create panic and the Book of Revelation is a document that is still very controversial. As I told Max on another thread today, it was only included in the Peshita (the Syriac New Testament) at a later date. It is not used in Orthodox Church masses, exception made to the Coptic Church. It has been dated to the second century and demonstrates some gnostic influence. I had occasion to discuss this topic briefly with Fr. J.A. Fitzmyer, in the context of the Essenes and their “eschatological army”, with the “sons of light” fighting the “sons of darkness”. He did not place much importance on the document and our discussion even included bits of humour because of present day interpretations. Astrophysicist Adam Frank gave a slightly different touch to the question of conscious life, mass extinctions and the destruction of the universe. The problem is that if God is perfect why will he allow his own creation to be destroyed? There is both moral and physical evil. We are very much a part of the physical world that gave birth to us. It is a topic that also involves Hawking and Darwin. On other occasion, while discussing Jesus and the Essenes with Prof. G. Vermes, I noted that, while he had a wonderful sense of humour, he was pessimistic when it came to what we can exactly derive from the Bible. He was accused of being “obsessed with Jesus” in Israel, but he had his own interpretation, wrote a number of books on him, one of which was reviewed by Dr. Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury. Naturally, as a prelate Dr.Williams wrote also from the point of view of faith. Prof. Vermes seemed to have viewed Jesus as providing us with a sort of existential spiritual legacy. Is that enough for us? What is the meaning of it all? Father Hans Küng raised some important doubts about what tradition has brought us, but he has also not brought forth any convincing systematic theology. He has really missed the mark.

That is what I think those who are reading this thread would like to see. There is no point in talking about Herod, Nero and Caligula. I did not read the book by Claude Tresmontant you cited, only some papers about him that gave me an idea about his approach. He was a very serious and highly qualified metaphysician and theologian, but not a heavyweight in exegesis. As I commented earlier, I prefer the historical critical method, used with other methods if needed, when making a critical study of the Bible. There is no room here for allegory and esoteric interpretations, much less fundamentalism. Biblical studies today have taken a very different direction, the previous quests for Jesus are being questioned and there is even more scepticism. We have to find continuity between Jesus’ teaching and the Gospels in an understanding of human existence. Otherwise biblical studies will be absorbed by Near Eastern studies, the Bible being dismissed as literature of a particular culture during a particular period with no relevance to us today.

Well, the subject matter does lead to what some judge to be esoteric literature and, as you know, interpretations can vary. In yesterday’s comment I was not referring to WCG or its founder, Herbert Armstrong, whom I listened to once. He was a soft spoken and well intentioned man, but I could not agree with much he was saying. The church I was referring to still has its faithful judging that the Book of Revelation refers to Rome. I have had to tell them that, then, it means they got their NT from 666 and also know their date of birth because of him. Max, I have been guided by the discussion I had with J. A. Fitzmyer. It was in connection with Essene beliefs. Although some aspects of the milieu in the first century may have crept into the Book of Revelation that does not make it a first century document. I commented a few days ago that, at the rates things are going, Biblical Studies will become Near Eastern studies and nothing more if we are not careful and do not make distinctions between the various cultures and detect where there could be syncretism: https://www.academia.edu/12813935/Does the Shroud show a Mandaean burial The former Presbyterian minister and now Catholic apologist Scott Hahn has published a book on the Book of Revelation, which is roughly in keeping with why Fr.

You will be laughed out of court if you try to challenge them with your interpretations, which will be dismissed as the result of feverish imagination.

So if it comes to what “Christians believe” perhaps it could be stated in a few words: a) Christians are taught about the pre existence of the Word and the Incarnation, kerygma that is said to have begun shorty after the Resurrection b) That is in harmony with the fact that not only did Jesus present himself as someone other than the rest of contemporary teachers and prophets of old, he also spoke of himself as someone other than the rest of mankind c)The NT data leads us to understand that Jesus was aware that he was related in a unique way to to Yahveh, whom he even addressed as “abba” (something like “‘daddy” in Aramaic). D) There is high Christology in John, but the other gospels do not fail to be implicit about Jesus’ uniqueness e) Therefore Christians must reckon with what C.S.Lewis wrote : Either Jesus was Mad or he was God.

One does not need to be an exegete, amateur or professional, to grasp the fact that there is convergence in the four gospels and it is precisely this that gave impetus to the Jesus movement, so there is no point in reading one gospel or the other in isolation if a complete picture of what exactly happened is to be obtained. The Jesus movement that was to become the Church as we understand it now did not have any written tradition initially, it was probably a strong oral tradition maintained by conviction, healing and curing activity (admitted even by the Talmud).

I can see that you are having fun here too. How nice.

That was it: the troublemakers are back on the scene, one of them sending out a feeler via a third party to check if he could get back. I do not see how this blog can be left for posterity at this rate. Is what is going on here useful for them to read? Perhaps… for those interested in Freud, not in the Turin Shroud. The same sort of procedure is employed by a Shroud website. How? With all the talk about the insistence on peer reviewed papers and warnings against personal attacks, one person, who is not scientist, and who has posted comments here using around half a dozen pseudonymns, had one paper he authored, not peer reviewed, posted on the site, while indulging in character assassination against well known scientists on this blog. It has been stated here that Turin reads what is posted here. Great. But then don’t question why petitions to the Pope are ignored. There is one academic historian, one biochemist who has conducted scientific research, one expert in computer sciences who is at an university who post regularly here. The rest are mostly amateurs who disrupt the blog by aiming their attacks at the professionals. As a journalist and one who has been a Religion Writer for twenty years, I see no reason why pdfs, whether they contain published articles or other papers, cannot be put out for readers interested in serious research to read..","date":"2015-12-11","mins":"7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216232","author":"louis","post":"I will not respond to the man above since he is not an historian and continues to pit one blogger against another and indulgênce in flattery..","date":"2015-12-11","mins":"2:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216289","author":"louis","post":"With so many pro authenticity amateurs writing on the Shroud, saying whatever they want because they are all buddies, this is what you get: http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a40399/jesus real face/.","date":"2015-12-12","mins":"5:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216234","author":"louis","post":"My previous comment on the topic said “academic historian” because he has lectured at Cambridge.

One could add that this is precisely why it does not “snap easily into our belief structures”, it is simply swept under the rug because the “sense of comfort, familiarity, trust” has to prevail. The problem is also precisely what led to the break between C. G. Jung and the American Dominican, Father Victor White, at Blackfriars, Oxford. Jung’s hope that White would be his successor disappeared, but the spiritual bond between them was not broken. Needless to say, both had faith. Kreeft’s writings also lead to the understanding of how faith is important and even Jung was glad when he received spiritual help. He was very fond of Father White, who was his closest friend, but the priest had died from injuries after a motorcycle accident. An English nun helped him. Https://www.academia.edu/7344691/C. G.

Sorry, I think Pam Moon has leaped to conclusions when it comes to the Jospice Mattress.

Did the artist steal a mattress from the Hospital, finish the painting with body fluids and then smuggle it back? No one noticed it? What was the purpose? Did the artist think that Les looked like Clark Cable? Does this goes to say that Father Francis O’Leary was either a fool or a liar?
