While I personally do not find it difficult to accept what you call “accumulation of circumstances”, that surely will not be welcome by anti authenticists. More will be needed to convince them, and it will have to be a lot more convincing than what has sometimes been published on the relic so far: https://www.academia.edu/6568383/Does the Shroud show a Mandaean burial Let me know if you were able to open the file. More recently,it has been argued that the Jospice Mattress Imprint was painted and this, too, will be tackled shortly. Such arguments do not help to authenticate the TS and, in my view at least, they distort the truth, like the hypothesis in the link. The more you clutch at straws, the less will you be able to convince sceptics. Thanks for the link to the video, which I will watch later today and comment on later. Teilhard had foresight, he mingled science with systematic theology because he knew what was to come, more than many other clergymen, but not all questions were answered. Remember that Pope John Paul II said the Shroud takes us to the “mystery of life and death”, but he also criticised what he judged to be Buddhism’s negative soteriology in his book “Crossing the Threshold of Hope”. We cannot sweep the mysterium iniquitatis under the rug, and I am sure you know we are surrounded by it. One can see your efforts to get above it, others don’t even try. When Father Victor White lay dying after a motorcycle accident, Jung could not visit him because he was very old and the doctor’s advice was for him not to travel.

The NYT news item just serves to demonstrate that the geologist is clutching at straws, the money is not his, it came from those who are behind the agendas,who it seems also have funds to squander. The same also can be said about the Swiss millionaire whose identity was not revealed, for obvious reasons, and who was behind the “Jesus’ wife” fragment that Karen King, with her own agenda, was actively promoting. Good for Harvard, they were about to leap by publishing a report, then decided to look before leaping, and gave up the idea. It is now clear that the fragment of the papyrus was manufactured, is fraudulent, as maintained by me on this very blog right from the beginning, though it was defended by another commenter. Professor Wolfgang Krumbein has contradicted himself. In the beginning he said the James ossuary was exposed to sunlight and environmental conditions for centuries. Later, he alleged that robbers had opened a hole in the Talpiot tomb and stolen it, another one clutching at straws. Not even the owner, O.Golan,believes him, because he had already said, years ago,that it came from Silwan. The claims about the patina came from Charles Pellegrino, however he did not publish a scientific paper because he is not an archaeologist and, I think, he does know that it will simply not sell. Patina can be manufactured, and the IAA returned the James ossuary to its owner, also making the statement that the second part of the inscription was a forgery, as I had always maintained, in fact published an article about it three months before the IAA statement. We have to be very careful while reading news items about “findings” in the fields of biblical archaeology and biblical studies.

He says that an earthquake in the fourth century filled the tomb with soil, but how is it that it did not happen to another tomb, just twenty metres away? Not even O.Golan, the owner of the James ossuary, believes his story. He wants at least 300 tombs to be examined. Andrey Feuerverger, who worked on the statistics, was misled by the proponents of the so called Jesus family tomb to interpret the inscription on one ossuary as identifying Mary Magdalene. He admitted that later and wisely wrote in his report that “any tampering with the tombsite and other possibilities for fraud” would have to be “weighed and taken into account.” He abandoned the topic completely after the sensationalism. The University of Chicago professor mentioned in the article (link) above is even wiser, Patina is also not considered to be a reliable indication, it can be manufactured. In an official report written years ago Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem District Archaeologist, wrote that the patina “inside the relatively deep letters is not the same as on the ossuary’s four sides and the decoration lines.” Why? There is more: Shimron ignores a telltale incision, known by the best scholars. About this, Professor Kloner wrote: “each of the letters of the two words “brother of Jesus” are carved less deeply than those on the right side of the inscription.” Note: “brother of Jesus” is “Akhui d’Yeshua” in Aramaic, therefore Kloner says “two words”. The right side says “Yaakov bar Yehosef”, “James son of Joseph” in Aramaic. What does this mean?

After the Order was suppressed Clement made it clear that there could be no group claiming to be successors and the Templar property was given to the Hospitallers.

Maimonides tells us that the white linen belt worn by the Temple priests was taken from a cloth measuring 32 cubits and 32 is the gammatria, from the Greek gamma. Numerology is even used today by some to “decipher hidden secrets” in the Bible, but this is pointless, the interface with science can tell us more. But, to return to the main point, any link made between the textiles found in Masada and Christians — again with the use of “L” — is misleading. The textiles were dated to AD 73, at which point the Zealots were still active. The Sadducees, Pharisees and Judaeo Christians had no connections with this group. To say that the textile with the “L” denotes Christian presence in the region in the first century is like saying that the Gospels are fairy tales, filled with lies. Judaeo Christians and Zealots had nothing to do with each other. If the two groups are mixed then it will mean that Jesus was quasi zealot, the reason why he was nailed to the cross, and I don’t know whether believing Christians will countenance that. Masada has it myths, largely because Josephus was not always accurate. That is why it is no longer considered a symbol of Jewish resistance/nationalism. Many of the human bones buried there were found together with those of pigs. These could be the result of Roman burials with blood (animal) sacrifice. It is possible that there was Christian presence there, but not before Christianity had been recognised by the State, around the fifth to the sixth centuries..","date":"2014-07-23","mins":"7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/22/origin-of-the-gammadia/","cat":"art","title":"Origin of the Gammadia"},{"id":"comment-140134","author":"louis","post":"OK, but this is going off the point, which is to say that there can be no link between a cloth found in Masada in the first century and the Judaeo Christians.

Meier is right in saying that their group began to get under way with the start of the Jewish war it does not mean that the members were inactive.

The thorn image in particular seems to be very clear and I have a complete strand of Ziziphus spina christi taken from the area near Jerusalem.

There are problems with the interpretation: First century Jewish tombs had burial slabs and shelves, so it is possible that the artist intended to show the stone of unction as a burial slab, but what would the stone of unction be doing in a tomb? It is not that famous one preserved in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. We now now that the burial place was “honeycombed with tombs”, to quote Bahat, so how many dead bodies were washed on the “stone of unction”? Jesus was the only one who had his dead body washed on this “stone of unction”? Does the NT say that the body was washed? No, it doesn’t. Did the artist think about this? If the artist intended to show a sarcophagus,then he had little culture, he was mixing Egypt with Israel, mixing Jesus with a pharaoh. Did the artist think about the door of the tomb? The NT says that the door was rolled, not pushed. Was it round? Could be, but only four round entrance stones have been found. Did the artist visit Jerusalem before painting?

But, as you know, the tradition that Jesus left his image on cloth is ancient and what has been done is to connect that tradition with the Shroud, with small gaps here and there. Since the relic is unique, as demonstrated by all the studies conducted so far, many people do think that it was the cloth that wrapped Jesus as he lay in the sepulchre. What is certainly difficult to agree with is Wesselow’s theory that it led to the birth of Christianity. Then, there appear to have been early traditions that were not put down on paper, such as the veneration of the Virgin Mary, which even reached Islam, in fact she is mentioned more times than Jesus in the Koran. The great frustration for Shroud scholars is that much was deliberately destroyed in Edessa, and a lot was stolen or even destroyed when Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade, so it is clear that there is no choice but to rely more on science to see how much more can be learned. Yet, even if the Shroud is proved to be genuine, it would still not answer many existential issues that are constantly raised.From my point of view, and for Christians at least, it appears to be understanding what is meant by “mysterium Christi”..","date":"2012-09-09","mins":"5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"id":"comment-42525","author":"louis","post":"Dr. Rowan Williams is indeed a towering intellect and did a good number of things when he was the Primate of England, however there is one problem when it comes to what he endorses.

The pomegranate predates the Jerusalem Temple by centuries and the inscription is modern. In my view, this is somewhat similar to what was done to the James ossuary, with only the first part of the inscription being authentic. My hunch is that the forger added “brother of Jesus” to “James son of Joseph”, taking it for granted that it would be interpreted as referring to James the Just, first of the twelve Jewish Christian bishops of Jerusalem. He did not know — or ignored the fact — that according to Old Testament usage, also valid in the New Testament period, “Joseph” would be the “brother of “Jesus”.

You must have noticed that there is conflicting data, and the problem becomes worse because of the Church’s refusal to permit examination of the “Veronica” shown to the faithful at St. Peter’s Basilica during Lent and the glass covering the image in Manoppello cannot be removed. What I want to say is that we have to move slowly, not jump to hasty conclusions. More data is needed,both in the case of the TS and the “Veronica”. Did you see what Phil Dayvault found in Turkey?

I hope to be able post it online with an English translation. From my point of view, IW challenges the reweaving hypothesis because he was the first Shroud scholar to examine it closely and did not observe any patch. Of course, the patch is said to have been invisible because of the stitching and, for me at least, it still is one among many hypotheses on how the 1988 carbon dating results may have been skewed. IW also demonstrated support for Dr. Garza Valdés and that was because of the relic’s surface. Today, no scientist would admit that the bacteria would be sufficient to skew the results, the contamination would have to be much more. One must remember that Oxford is willing to open the doors of the laboratory for fresh carbon dating, but then is there any hypothesis that is accepted by each and everyone in the realm of Shroud studies and beyond it? It is for this reason that I think IW is right in saying that it is not necessary to appeal to the laboratory. There are things in this world that are sort of “unseen”, they work behind the scenes, dropping hints, appearing spontaneously, influencing people to change their minds.
