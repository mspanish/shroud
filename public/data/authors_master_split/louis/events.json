The relic is not part of the deposit of faith and the Creed does not say “… and was buried wrapped in the Turin Shroud.” John Paul II left the question to science and it is probable that if nothing has been done so far it is particularly due to the fact that carbon dating is not infallible, as demonstrated with sound argumentation in some Shroud books, papers and articles. Given the situation, one sees no reason to demand a fresh C14 test and destroy another piece of the relic. Even if the Church does agree — with Oxford employing a thorough cleaning process — and no first century date is obtained this will only give rise to more theories, which the laboratory will not accept. There are several theories today about why the carbon dating results can be skewed. After reading the late John Tyrer’s paper, for instance, one wonders if a thorough cleaning process is really possible.

Clarke for twenty five years, about the Talpiot tomb and was referred to Corinthians, chapter 15. Apparently the priest also jokingly told him that it was doubting Thomas who was buried in the tomb. Father Fernando’s expertise lies in Teilhard de Chardin studies, quite different from what Clarke, who believed that life was finite, was pursuing. Pellegrino may have consulted Franciscans in the Holy Land, which Jesuits one can’t say. The opinion of one Jesuit — no Shroud enthusiast — known for impeccable critical credentials appears in the article “Jesus was not buried in Talpiot, Parts I and II” on the HSG website. Pellegrino mentioned Mt DNA and “Jesus ossuary” bio concretions ignoring the report published by Dr. Amos Kloner, who was Jerusalem’s District Archaelogist for many years, that as many as thirty six people were buried in the Talpiot tomb.

One should be open to the truth in both cases and hard evidence should be provided by archaeologists or those claiming to be archaeologists. It is the risen Christ, and not the burial cloth, that led to the birth of Christianity. Therefore there are no details about what happened to the cloth.

In his position he could only be courteous, it was part of public relations, nothing more, and he would do the same if some “Jagadguru” of a Hindu sect had gone to see the Shroud. It is correct that I never Fathers Otterbein and Rinaldi personally, but it doesn’t seem that it makes a big difference. So what is this talk about “sincere dialogue” they would accept? I make it a point to read what is being said, and from what I was given to understand there were to be two other sessions in Hampshire after the “Shroud talk”, one dwelling on Mark Guscin’s work on the Sudarium and the other on “Jesus in India”. Would the good fathers call this “sincere dialogue”? Can you show me any document to substantiate your claim? Did you notice that there was a board at Hampshire saying “The Holy Shroud”. How can it be called the “Holy Shroud” in a convention held by a sect that believes that Jesus survived the crucifixion and went to India? That would make Jesus the biggest liar, trickster or expert magician in history and the relic would have to be preserved not in Turin but in some Museum of magic and there are several of these in the world. My article has been online for a number of years and I presume you have not read it. I received an e mail from an important person investigating the Shroud officially, and whose name I cannot reveal, telling me that it laid the Kashmir tomb theory to rest:. Https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The Quest for Jesus in Shroud research In this article there is mention of a Russian man who believed Jesus had been to India, apparently indulging in make believe because of his private agenda. It is on some of this man’s research that Holger Kersten based his book. I am only mentioning Kersten here because you mentioned him during the Q/A at the end of your talk in Hampshire. Was it necessary to mention him? Wasn’t that a sign of encouragement for the sect that is claiming that Jesus is buried in India? I have to go go further on this point and ask: would you do the same thing when lecturing on the Shroud in the Catholic and Protestant churches in the USA? If it is your interest in promoting “sincere dialogue” there are other Muslim sects about which you may not be aware. One of them believes that Jesus was indeed crucified and died on the cross: http://ismailignosis.com/2013/03/29/the crucifixion in shia ismaili islam/ I am obliged to go further and say that obsession with monotheism can be dangerous. You must be reading the news. Einstein wrote against it, but for different reasons. And what was that? He was a scientist, and was influenced by Spinoza. I prefer to subscribe to Descartes’ view until there is real evidence that can prove he was wrong. I have a very learned Orthodox Jewish friend and we sometimes discuss world events and the Bible over coffee. He once asked me why Christians could not view Jesus as Jews viewed Moses. He believed in Jesus’ sayings as spiritual. He then told me that he believed that the Koran’s view of God was different from what is written about the deity in both Torah and Tanakh. See how it is? Whose monotheism is correct? In today’s sceptical world, churches are becoming empty in Europe, American youngsters are not that religious, 70% of Israelis are secular. It is due to what RD wrote, and also due to world events. Freud became highly sceptical because of the evil he knew that was coming with the Nazi holocaust: https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds incomplete speculation on monotheism and the scepticism is even seen in literature: https://www.academia.edu/12823419/Book Review Jesus and Yahveh the names divine There is a lot to think when there is time..","date":"2015-09-25","mins":"7:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"id":"comment-211260","author":"louis","post":"Http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/25/inenglish/1443171082 956639.html Much as I admire Stephen Hawking, I find it difficult to swallow his scientism.

The definition of what existed prior to the Big Bang proposed by the priest scientist Father Georges Lemaitre is a very difficult point There are scientists who say that there were quantums fluctuating in a vacuum and that is because in science nothing comes from nothing. If there was cosmic chaos, where did it come from? So there is no creatio ex nihilo? Is chaos being converted into order and, if so, why is it taking such a long time? Is it as slow as the evolutionary process? A lot of suffering has gone on, be it due to processes relating to physics or to others relating to biology, that is, in the evolutionary process. And what can be said if both physics and biology are linked more deeply? This is a problem in the Judaeo Christian context, but it is not so in religions that believe in a cyclic process. In Buddhism the ultimate end is nirvana, which is “nothing”. Who can imagine nothingness? What is the meaning of it all? Is it some kind of joke coming from a cosmic magician? Buddha is said to have dodged questions he could not answer posed to him by followers by telling them that they were wasting time with speculation instead of concentrating on how to get out of the karmic ladder. It is a negative soteriology, with no room for a deity. True Buddhism can only be practiced in a monastery and even that can be difficult. We have had Rupert Murdoch accusing the Dalai Lama of being a shrewd politician, walking around wearing Gucci shoes. Is Richard Gere truly a Buddhist? He can only be believed if he gives away his millions. As Jesus said, “Where is your treasure, there is your heart also.” I take comfort in the fact that Christianity is not the religion of the book, it is the religion of the person, and that person is Jesus.

Any good pro authenticity scholar can tackle a sceptical viewpoint openly, as it has been done in the book “The Shroud. Fresh light on the 2000 year old mystery”. As far as I know, the Church has asked scientists to make research on the provenance of the Shroud, but this will take time and you can be sure that there will be advice on which new techniques to choose. However, to be fair again, the previous tests can not be ruled out when the important characteristics they have demonstrated are taken into account. When Jung read Nietzsche, in fact dedicated some time to lecturing on “Zarathustra”, he discovered that the philosopher was very much a Christian — unconsciously. It was not exactly hard to reach this conclusion. Shortly before his death Nietzsche dispatched a letter to the Vatican Secretary of State asking him to look at “the crucified one”, referring to the state of his health. The cynicism did not hide his unconscious and, for some reason or the other, he was given a Lutheran burial. You will wonder why all this is being said,so here is the explanation: Richard Dawkins has been described as a “cultural Christian”, but it is much more than that. He is unconsciously very much an Anglican, so much so that he carries with him all those old (and mostly forgotten) prejudices against the Catholic Church that were once in vogue in the Church of England. He discussed evolution with Archbishop Rowan Rowan Williams, a most noble mind in Christianity today, knowing that the prelate believes in the theory of evolution, although he also believes that man was made in the image of God. Some of Dawkins’ hostility seems to be derived from the fact that the Shroud is in the hands of the Catholic Church, which he hates. (Perhaps he is second only to Cromwell, or third in the line, that is, after Paisley). So there is the problem of a “Catholic” relic in the hands of an institution for which he has only demonstrated hatred. Is he the right person to teach about morality? He is pulling the rug under the people whose faith has sustained them in the face of tremendous difficulties and suffering. Faith among people in such circumstances prompted a “tough hombre” like (US Army) General Creighton Abrams to convert to Catholicism in Vietnam. The other difficulties are that image information does not fall within his area of expertise, which means that he will necessarily have to rely on what other scientists say and have said. If he could only be like Hawking, who also denies the existence of God, but is a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science — and demonstrates no hatred..","date":"2012-10-21","mins":"3:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/on-the-day-of-the-bsts-meeting/","cat":"event","title":"On the Day of the BSTS Meeting"},{"id":"comment-25859","author":"louis","post":"Benedict XVI said “Holy Saturday” because the image shows a dead man and the words “at the same time luminous” could mean in the process of resurrection.

We humans tend to be selfish, we only think about our survival. The rest is a long story that will be dealt with elsewhere, perhaps in a book.

Was the tomb Joseph of Arimathea arranged for him very hot? Were other Jews buried in air conditioned tombs? What about those 800 Pharisees who were crucified by the (Hasmonean) Jewish king Alexander Janaeus in 86 BC? Can we be sure that their bodies were all thrown into pits or buried in trench graves? Rome had not yet dominated Palestine, so bodies were presumably not left to rot on the cross. Surely the richer Pharisees were buried in tombs, wrapped in shrouds.

Anyone who reads the New Testament carefully will notice that the miracles are divided into categories, and so we have healing and curing and nature miracles and so on. Nature miracles — like the feeding of the five thousand — did not have to be instantaneous, only the healing and curing miracles and the last miracle had to be so. In the last miracle Jesus did not wake up and wait for someone to bring him a stretcher. God is not subject to time, we are, or does someone who believes in God also believe that He was created after the big bang? Regarding the book and the paper authored by Professor Fanti, it is the method that is important, the author leaves it to the reader to accept or reject it. The fibres he has in his possession are authentic, that is why Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia wanted them back. If Hugh had read the interview article carefully he would notice that Professor Fanti is still working on the thirteenth century patch hypotheses, no paper has been published, so one must wait. Professor Fanti did not say that he identified all the pollen grains listed by Max Frei Sulzer. The important thing here was to stress, as I did, that Ray Rogers was wrong when he felt that they could not be used in Shroud research. One must remember that Professor Litt never said anything about the state of the grains,he merely questioned the identification of Gundelia tornefortii. Padre Pio is revered in Italy and in many places around the world. Around eight hundred thousand people flocked to see his body when it was exposed and one can be sure that Graham Greene would be in the queue if he were alive. The article mentions what was the English liberal Catholic novelist’s reaction after attending his mass. Greene also carried two “holy pictures” of the priest in his wallet for the rest of his life. Professor Pietro Baraldi is a respected scientist, he teaches Applied Chemistry and Geology at the University of Modena. I knew Hugh would have nothing to say about the Jospice Mattress Imprint, and that is because Professor Fanti’s findings confirm, to a certain extent, my own point of view, written in an article that was published years ago. Hugh prefers to support the view, expressed in England recently, that someone, thinking that Les looked like Clark Gable(?!) painted that imprint. And what was Father Francis O’Leary doing meanwhile? Having a nice English breakfast, complete with coffee, eggs and sausages? No. The good priest, with whom I had some contact, was an intelligent and highly spiritual man. He knew that the imprint was not the work of an artist, in fact no one in the team brought by the BBC, none of the medical practitioners in England, Dr. Philip Calahan and Dr.Frederick Zugibe thought so. The only difference I had with Father O’Leary was that I refused to accept the imprint as a spiritual phenomenon. I would like to see some artist, preferably someone trained in Courtauld, provided with bilirubin or some other body fluid, and asked to paint an imprint exactly like what we see on the Jospice Mattress. It is unlikely that good Pope Francis will bother about testing the TS now. He has more important things to worry about and would not like the faithful to carry copies of the Turin Shroud around and preaching, “Look here, Jesus was resurrected’ or “God exists”. He knows that the primitive Christians did not carry any burial cloth to prove what they were saying, although the Jesus movement was a Resurrection Movement, not an Empty tomb movement. There is only one thing Hugh and I have in common in this topic. Our faith does not depend on the authenticity of the Shroud. ..","date":"2014-10-12","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/12/just-the-facts-maam/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"\"Just the facts, ma’am.\""},{"id":"comment-162150","author":"louis","post":"Here is my response to Hugh. Note that he does not address me directly, he addresses the readers, betraying his intention to impress them. After all, he is the editor of the BSTS newsletter, where, unfortunately, standards began to fall after Ian Wilson ceased to be the editor. Here we go now: I will not address him directly, because he is asking for this sort of exchange, and it is not my intention to impress anyone. He says he did not dwell on Professor Fanti’s DNA findings because he does not know enough about them and that sounds strange. He normally makes some research to contest what other commenters are saying on this blog. He is now invited to do some research and contest Professor Fanti here, on this blog. When Hugh has no arguments he becomes desperate and takes the path of redactio ad absurdum. He rejects the argument that Jesus’ healing and curing miracles were instantaneous. “A true miracle worker”, he writes “could make it happen as quickly or slowly as he wished”. Since the context is Jesus I will stick to it. So I will ask Hugh if he believes that Jesus loved to watch people suffering. Did he, when people asked him to perform a miracle, make them wait, say, for half an hour, sipping a glass of wine meanwhile? We must remember that Jesus, unlike John the Baptist, ate and drank well. Hugh should read the NT carefully,or if he is unwilling to do that, ask his parish priest or some biblical scholar within easy reach what is the criteria of the Catholic Church when it comes to miracles. He also says that the Resurrection did not have to be an instantaneous process. Know why he says that? Because he is afraid that Shroud research will point in that direction and it will be a step forward in favour of authenticity and he is anti authenticity. It will not be something new because it has been dwelt upon before in the USA, and Professor Fanti has gone a bit further, but more is needed, as stressed by me in italics in the interview article. I would like Hugh to answer a,b,c,d,e above.

I am not taking refuge in anything simply because the rationale behind the feeding of the five thousand is clear in previous comments and so is the question of the blind men. Jesus must have taken a few seconds to increase the intensity of the power that was leaving his body in the first case, in the second one I mentioned why it was so in a previous comment. As I said, there is a lot of subtlety involved when it comes to Jesus, be it the riddles that are the parables and so on. I did not study with Benedictines, but mainly with Jesuits from about about eight countries. In school I learnt from German lay brothers who had fought in the reichswehr or luftwaffe, got fed up of war, pondered about the destruction and hatred and decided to join a religious order. In college I played volleyball every evening, from Monday to Sunday, with Jesuit priests and seminarians, learning a lot about theology from them.

They did not buy their Ph.Ds, and more Shroud scientists may contribute with their own research. It seems that Hugh has, also in this instance, not read the interview article carefully. I used the words “beyond doubt”, in fact italicised them, and this has something to do with experiments and the depth of the image. 2) and 3) Here again, Hugh has not read the article carefully. Professor Fanti stated that the fibres, both his and those which were with Ray Rogers, are genuine. I can go further and state that even those with Dr. Leoncio Garza Valdès were genuine, so much so that Cardinal Giovanni wanted them back in Turin, much in the same way that Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia wants Professor Fanti to return the fibres that are with him. Professor Fanti states in the interview that the samples with Rogers were given to him by the archdiocese of Turin. 4) Peer review does not mean that what is stated is gospel truth. It only means that the paper is worthy of consideration. In any case, academicians have no monopoly on truth. 5) No, the Shroud has not yet been reliably dated to the first century. 6) Once again — for God’s sake! — Professor Fanti’s words are being distorted. He did not say that all evolutionists are atheists and neither do I think so. The context of his reply has to be read carefully. Pope John Paul II had said that evolution is more than a theory and even the Vatican referred to Père Pierre Teilhard de Chardin around two years ago, when Benedict XVI was the pontiff. I personally do not believe that the Bible was dropped from heaven in King James English. I have said it once and say it again: fundamentalism is dangerous to faith. Why? Because we see examples of fundamentalists, many pastors included, who think that “Everything is true or nothing is true” when it comes to the Bible. When they realise they are wrong, they leave their respective churches and become anti Christian. Jesus himself was not a fundamentalist when he referred to Scripture! The last line in my article says that to understand Jesus one has to read between the lines. Christians do not have to be scholars like Schnackenburg or Harnack to understand that, it is a question of opening the heart. Jesus uttered one sentence that made such an impact on the Hindus, that it made him inextricable in Hinduism, where he is avatar, God incarnate. Swami Vivekananda, the father of modern Hinduism wrote that “Blessed are the pure in spirit. They shall see God” was enough to understand salvation, doing away with the need for Scripture and prophets. 7) Professor Fanti’s findings have only partially confirmed Max Frei Sulzer’s findings, much more is needed. That will depend on the availability of the rest of the collection, what remains of Frei Sulzer’s tapes and what was vacuumed from the Shroud during the restoration. 9) It betrays the unconscious. Do I have to dwell on Freud here? Hugh says, “True, I did not comment on the Jospice Mattress, the Padre Pio handkerchiefs, or the DNA findings. I don’t know enough about them to say anything worthwhile, so I didn’t. So what?”. Here is what I have to say when it comes to these: a) Jospice Mattress: He defended the view, recently expressed in England,that the imprint was the work of an artist — on this blog itself some months ago. What he was trying to say was that both the imprint and the image on the TS are the works of artists. He had no arguments to present because Professor Fanti’s findings came close to what I have always said: https://www.academia.edu/8740927/Professor Giulio Fanti discusses the controversies in the realm of Shroud studies It is easier to believe in telergy than in ghosts and one does not have to have be like Frederick Myers to understand that. B) Hugh did comment on the Padre Pio handkerchiefs above, although he says he did not. He wrote “wooo”. C) He also did not comment about Professor Fanti’s DNA findings because they go against his argument that the Shroud is fake. Since he couldn’t find answers to a,b, and c, he writes “So what?” He will not admit defeat. Lastly, his last paragraph is pure redactio ad absurdum, and here is the reason: Why would Jesus have to wait for the disciples to bring the fishes and loaves of bread and then, say, with a gesture, fill the bellies of the 5000 hungry mouths without waiting for them to eat? That would be funny wouldn’t it? They waited for him to preach, so they could wait a little more to eat. A “core Catholic” should know the criteria his Church adopts when declaring what is or is not a miracle. There is no reference to the hungry 5000. I will not indulge in spoon feeding. Hugh apparently doubts that God is not subject to time. That is his viewpoint, but then he should subscribe to Hindu belief, which can be contradictory. He also says that the Resurrection did not have to be an instantaneous process. He apparently says that because he is afraid what Professor Fanti and Dr. Di Lazzaro will discover..","date":"2014-10-12","mins":"8:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/12/just-the-facts-maam/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"\"Just the facts, ma’am.\""},{"id":"comment-128887","author":"louis","post":"It is doubful if Geffroy de Charny, who wrote a book on chivalry, and inspired the Order of the Star, would exhibit a fake.

It is not that the book proclaimed gospel truth, but the debate is heated. Here is my review of the book “The Tomb of Jesus and His Family?”: https://www.academia.edu/6932873/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot Parts I II and III The two previous parts of the article were written and posted a long time ago and there is need to put things in a better perspective in another book..","date":"2014-05-02","mins":"9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/02/st-louis-conference-news/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"St. Louis Conference News"},{"id":"comment-110838","author":"louis","post":"Re: Your comment of May 4th, 12.36 AM.

And, as commented previously, the Manoppello veil needs a more close examination, although,of course, as you said, it has no “living eyes”.

The other half can be seen in the introduction and last paragraph in the interview article “Science and religion meet in Shroud research” posted on the Holy Shroud Guild website. Why crucify Professor Giulio Fanti? Ian Wilson reached a somewhat similar conclusion at the end of his 1978 Shroud book and does not appear to have changed his position. All of us are racked by doubts about almost everything under the sun and IW clearly stated the reason why he is a Christian (RC) in the postscript of his book “Jesus: the evidence”. It has nothing to do with the Turin Shroud and corresponds to what all believing Christians, and their respective churches, think. In a nutshell: first Jesus, then the Turin Shroud, not the other way round..","date":"2013-12-15","mins":"10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/14/update-on-the-st-louis-conference-october-9-12-2014/","cat":"event","title":"Update on the St. Louis Conference, October 9-12, 2014"},{"id":"comment-59944","author":"louis","post":"David I agree with you when it comes to evidence and how the 21st century mind works.
