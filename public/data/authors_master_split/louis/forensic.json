I presume that you have read this interview: https://www.academia.edu/8841978/Professor Giulio Fanti discusses the controversies in the realm of Shroud studies where two questions and responses dwell on DNA. Your opinion is important because you are an immunologist with a Ph.D and one response in the interview says that human DNA examinations have been conducted. We do not have complete details, and all I know is that the material was examined in a laboratory. Do we need a peer reviewed paper on this examination, or is more needed?

Like much of what goes on in the realm of Shroud studies this part of the research has also not yet been revealed and one can hope that we will have a peer reviewed paper to read soon. As you rightly pointed out, it must be proved that it is human blood. I personally believe that it is since who worked on this was Dr. Alan Adler, a serious and respected scientist. With your qualifications you are the right person to continue his research and I would be the first one to suggest including you in the team that Turin may form in the near future for another hands on examination of the relic. Unfortunately so many things have come to a standstill in Shroud research. I have had to postpone delving more deeply into the medieval part of Shroud history, having gathered just half of the material needed and waiting for the other half — it is very time consuming when one has to depend on the availability of documents of the period to read and interpret — to fill the gaps in order to present a convincing picture about the impact of the Shroud on notables during the period. One is forced to change direction for the time being, so there should be more news — and views — about the image formation process next month..","date":"2015-01-06","mins":"6:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"},{"id":"comment-181441","author":"louis","post":"The most important thing is that blood was detected on the Shroud..","date":"2015-01-05","mins":"6:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"},{"id":"comment-104529","author":"louis","post":"Perhaps the ancient Copts looked at Jesus through an Egyptian filter: http://www.dreamstime.com/royalty free stock images head bust egyptian man isolated image28240039.","date":"2014-04-27","mins":"7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/27/more-on-how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"More on How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"id":"comment-181695","author":"louis","post":"Nothing to thank me for, Kelly, I mean what I say.
