That is because biblical scholars can, consciously or unconsciously, also be influenced by what discoveries in science can tell us. There is also the problem of interpreting what goes on in the world. Freud’s quest went beyond psychoanalysis and some bits of philosophy to speculation on monotheism. I believe that it was not only his view of human nature but also the rise of Hitler that made him write “Moses and Monotheism”: It was like asking why God had the pharaoh defeated to save the Israelites and did not do the same with the German dictator before the damage was done. Https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds incomplete speculation on monotheism So, are we to to become deists? Cardinal Avery Dulles made a sort of apologia for Abraham Lincoln by calling him a “Christian deist”. However, natural theology is no solution, on the contrary it can be misleading. It led Richard Swinburne to concentrate on the synoptics and ignore the Gospel according to John, which is the deepest, the most complete of the four gospels. If Freud was a son of the so called Enlightenment, so was the ex seminarian Renan, but only to a certain extent: https://www.academia.edu/14727526/How Ernest Renan was a priest in his guts Biblical studies today are slowly changing direction. It is important to understand that Jesus did not really behave as though he agreed with the messianic expectations during his time, he assumed more than one role. It had nothing to do with the somewhat common belief that a messianic king would throw the Romans out of Palestine, much less with the imaginary eschatological army of the Essenes, with the “Sons of Light” fighting the “Sons of Darkness”. It is not possible to diminish his role as the central figure of history objectively, as that would be trampling on ethics. What exactly that role signifies is still a matter of debate and will have to involve a convincing systematic theology.

According to him, Werner Bulst, SJ ( with whom he authored the book “Das Turiner Grabtuch und das Christusbild”) sent photographs of the eye areas of the Shroud to Dr. Ari Kindler of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem and requested him to identify what could be seen. He was of course not told that the photographs were from the Shroud and his reply was that they were images of a Pilate coin. Button like objects do appear on the Tamburelli photograph. Yet, one can understand the objections to the coins over the eyes papers, which points to the need for more studies like the one done by Max..","date":"2012-12-12","mins":"8:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/11/coins-on-eyes-issue-again/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Coins on Eyes Issue Again"},{"id":"comment-20397","author":"louis","post":"Hullo Gabriel, Given what was I was told during the interview it looks like he will..","date":"2012-12-13","mins":"8:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/11/coins-on-eyes-issue-again/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Coins on Eyes Issue Again"},{"id":"comment-20398","author":"louis","post":"Thanks for explaining further, Max.

The link I asked you to see takes you to the historian who found the “Chinon parchment”, dated 1308, a document which demonstrates that the Order was not involved in any heresy. Philippe IV had de Molay sent to the stake before Clement could issue a document in their favour, and the pontiff was doing his best to avoid a schism in France. No one could really claim de Molay as someone who disobeyed the pope, denied Christ secretly, and then produced a shroud with his image. His last gesture before dying, at the stake, was to request to face Notre Dame cathedral. I am not sure about the DNA.

You have raised very good objections about why the image is not a painting and one can add that someone during the medieval period would have to hoover the Shroud to not leave traces of paint after the flakes were no longer there. Unfortunately there are many gaps to be filled in order to discover what happened between 1204 and 1353 — assuming that the Image of Edessa and the Shroud are one and the same object — and sources are not easy to find. I am on the way to closing at least one gap, depending on images that will have to be analysed very carefully, and hopefully should have some news soon. I do think the Knights Templar had a role to play, unlike the late Daniel Raffard de Brienne, French lawyer who was the president of CIELT, and the author of five books on the Shroud.

It is possible to understand that as editor of the BSTS newsletter — also because it would be easy for him because he lives in England — it would be useful for him to hear a talk about the Shroud and also what people there had to say. What I think is not understandable is his distortion of the truth. There was no “ecumenism” there because what was trampled upon was Christian belief and a relic that is considered to be a Christian relic. I do not stand alone in my judgement, I am the only one who is speaking openly. Further, there was also to be a talk where Mark Guscin’s work on the Sudarium of Oviedo would be used to further the sect’s claim that Jesus survived the crucifixion. If Jesus survived the crucifixion and went to India he would be the greatest liar, trickster or expert magician the world has ever known. The relic would not be the “Holy Shroud”, it would have to be sent to one of the places listed in the link below: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of magic museums It was very easy to hold this conference in England, where despite the fact that there is no separation of church and state, HM the Queen, also the head of the Church of England, has no voice and is little more than a rubber stamp. Would such a conference, “ecumenical” according to Hugh, have been held in the US or, say, Serbia of Armenia? Hugh’s statement, which I quote below, makes no sense at all: “Those who have faith in the Resurrection from the Dead and believe that the Shroud is authentic have no fear that further investigation of the Holy Relic will destroy their faith by revealing that Christ was not dead after all, while those who have faith in the Resurrection and believe that the Shroud is medieval know that establishing that firmly will leave the question open for any religion to interpret in its own way.” I would like to see Hugh signing a petition to Pope Francis or addressing another letter to the Chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He knows very well, although he will not admit it — just as he evades addressing the issues in my previous comment — that what he is justifying would mean that both pontiff and archbishop would lose their jobs overnight and would have to return to Argentina, from where they come, to perhaps dance tango in order to forget decades of wasted time..","date":"2015-09-19","mins":"7:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"id":"comment-210745","author":"louis","post":"I leave it to readers to judge about the distinction between good and bad history: https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The Quest for Jesus in Shroud research I have received support from people both in and out of the realm of Shroud studies and that is encouraging.

It must also be remembered that relics are secondary issues for the Catholic Church, the emphasis being on canonisation.

You may have read something about the latter in England where even Hindus have taken part, and where they have never said anything against the creation account in the Bible and monotheism, although it goes against their religious beliefs and their cosmology corresponds to some extent with what science tells us today. On the other hand the “ecumenism” which you say you saw in Hampshire is pure fiction, a figment of your imagination.

Carr, although having his own interpretation, did not contradict what I had proposed. To go a bit further now, telergy can also be invisible, without leaving marks on something material, because the origin lies in the psyche. It is possible that the Gerasene “demoniac” (Gospel according to Mark) possessed this psychic energy and would be considered a paranormal today. His paranormal abilities enabled him to break chains, recognise Jesus’s divinity and the psychic energy (telergy) released by him when he was healed by Jesus was felt by the large herd of pigs who rushed down the steep bank. The Gospel says that the man was left in his “right mind”. The Greek cultural influence in ancient Palestine — Hypnos — personification of sleep, Thanatos, personification of death, and so on — made the people interpret “invisible working”, that is mental problems, as “possession”.

A professional scientist would not do that, because he is confident, not “quietly confident.” He would also take the peer reviewed papers of Drs. Alan Adler and John Heller seriously. This “amateur historian” had one of his articles, written after painstaking research, praised in a letter he received from a Holocaust survivor, president of the country’s Jewish society, and is preserved in the library of one of the world’s best universities for reference. Another one, also on history, was dispatched to the Vatican Secretary of State (without his knowledge) to influence him in a decision that had to be taken by Rome.

And, most important of all, those in the antiquities market, particularly forgers, are known to store different kinds of soil samples.

I was reminded of mass I used to go for at the London house of a religious order, closer than the nearest Catholic parish. One morning two nice, young priests who had just come back from missionary work in South America spoke about their work instead of giving a sermon. One of them said that he had gone to talk about God in that part of the planet and had found Him there. The faithful were invited to comment and no one said anything. After mass one of the persons who had accompanied me asked why I did not comment. My reply was that it was a topic about which there was so much to discuss that the mass would have to be interrupted and there would just be time to have coffee with the padres after that.

I simply think that before executing that argument one has to go through all other possibilities. On the issue of the image making it through the pillow – it is not the image which makes it through the pillow, but vapors. If you never have experienced anything pungent like formalin or ammonia, it will be difficult to explain that vaporized substances can penetrate a lot of covers. I mentioned those two because they are pungent and one can smell them even with a lot of covers over one’s face, but others can penetrate through different layers as well. That’s why I do not see anything unusual with the possibility of vaporized substances slowly penetrating through the pillow to chemically react with the mattress cover. Jesterof The supernatural explanation was the original hypothesis proposed, but not by the Church, however it was apparently not taken seriously. As you know by now, one paper attributed the phenomenon to bilirubin, another one to something to do with physics, but with spiritualist connotations, while my own paper dwelt on paranormal phenomena, based to a certain extent on the experiments made by Ochorowicz.and other studies. It is easy to understand what you are saying, the only problem being that there is no evidence of vaporized substances emanating from the body (including the head) to form the imprint. Given the report about the events leading to the imprint, including psychological processes, the psychophysical explanation is very likely, and that is the reason why paranormal phenomena have to be considered. If you have read enough of Freud you must have noticed that even he did have interest in psi and wrote an essay on the topic and this appears to have been prompted by personal experience. Many of his files are still not unavailable and there is the possibility that he might have realised that Jung was right up to a certain point but hesitated to admit this on account of his having previously told the Swiss psychologist to stop dabbling in the occult! Unfortunately parapsychology is often dismissed as humbug, although it is recognised by the UN, and the fact that genuine parapsychological phenomena are spontaneous, and as a result can not be tested in a laboratory, is taken as ammunition by sceptics to poke fun at those who come with well based propositions.

Even enemies acknowledged the ability of the disciples to heal and cure. In the Catholic Church today, somewhat the same process is used in deciding who is a candidate for sainthood. Any healing and curing made in life are not taken into consideration. There is the famous case of the Jewish millionaire in New York who had two wishes as he lay dying of an incurable brain tumour: meet Pope John Paul II and be buried in Jerusalem. An arrangement was made through the pope’s secretary, Monsignor Stanislaw Dziwisz and one fine morning the dying man was wheeled into the pope’s private chapel on a stretcher. There were also some others attending the mass and the dying Jewish man also received communion like them — from the pope’s hands. He was gently chided by the monsignor after this.

Barrie wisely also distanced himself from the pig experiment, in which he had, not surprisingly, no part, presumably also nipping in the bud calls — by way of comments on this blog — for more blood sacrifices, something that would tarnish the image of those involved in Shroud studies. Re #14 Here are the replies to David’s comments: 1) “I should be interested to learn if any Crusader leader provided a Pope with inventories of the several relics looted from Constantinople. ” The answer is in the comment itself. Naturally no crusader would provide any Pope with inventories because the relics were looted. Further, who said all those who took part in the Fourth Crusade were crusaders? If one refrains from researching by appealing to wikipedia or other search engines, studying what historians wrote in books, even though that means hours before anything can be posted in reply, it becomes clear that mercenaries were involved and they were financed by the Doge of Venice. If de la Roche had the Shroud, it follows, he, too, was one of the looters, but as he is said to have been a devout Catholic the question that arises is Why did he not inform the Pope? He could have written a “confession” and told the pontiff that his intention was to keep the relic in safe hands. Destruction of documents in France? OK. But there should have been some document in Rome, so then comes the readymade answer that it could have been inside the archives looted by Napoleon?! 2) There were no dogmatic statements on my part. On the contrary, it was clearly stated, more than once, that gaps had to be filled. 3) There are absolutely no cryptic remarks in my third paragraph, so any attempt to know in advance what I am obliged to keep quiet about, not least because of ethics, will fail.

What convinces you that the image was produced according to the known laws of nature? Laws of nature are propositions and God does not seem to be bound by things he created for the material universe. The Resurrection, in which you believe, is the prime example. Both natural and supernatural explanations for the image formation are possible and it is good to remember that Rogers was not dogmatic about what he wrote; he did seem, however, to be keen on avoiding metaphysical possibilities at any cost to suit a worldview. So do think about the reaction atheists, agnostics, or just non religious people have had when they saw the Shroud with an open mind.

Guided by the New Testament narratives I do believe that Jesus’ healing and curing miracles were instantaneous. The suggestion is at the end of the interview article cited above. I also know that not everyone accepts the miracle stories in the Gospels. The scepticism began with Bultmann, who walked hand in hand with Heidegger. Their unbelief also led them to a vacuum they could not fill, making Bultmann remain in the Lutheran Church and Heidegger request his parish priest for a Catholic burial. We must remember that the miracle stories were not rejected by Jesus’ enemies, it was in fact the reason why the religious establishment feared and hated him. He was considered to be a threat to the Temple, with its blood sacrifices and exploitation of the poor, and according to Father Raymond Brown, because half of it was a kind of “Central Bank”. That put even the fiercely anti Roman Jewish rebel group sicarii on the list of the enemies of the Sadducees who controlled the Temple. The best Jewish scholars do not deny Jesus’ miracles.

Take, for instance: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/13/is this stone the clue to why jesus was killed.html The best scholars and archaeologists are aware that Jesus was nailed to the cross because he dared to challenge the Sadducees who worked hand in hand with the Romans when it ws convenient to them. When Jesus threatened the existence of the Temple, and consequently the moneybags that the Sadducees had, it was a sign that he had gone beyond the limits in their view. Raymond E. Brown was clear about this point in his classic “The Death of the Messiah”. Actually Jesus was not really tied to any monument, be it Temple or synagogue, as they were not essential to his message, which was purely spiritual. He could therefore preach in the fields, near the sea, on a mount and so on. Jesus did not reveal everything he knew; he spoke in parables which are riddles.

Must I point out that, for the third time, you have not read the interview with sufficient attention? He refers to another scientist when talking about the “current scientific paradigm” and it is evident that his hypothesis about image formation requires a surge of energy currently beyond the scope of physics. Yes, as a scientist he knows the limitations. Of course VUV radiation is pure radiation and that is why I, not him, said “radiation like”. Why? Because I do not believe that radiation had anything to do with the image. Now, it seems that you have not understood why I used that term. If you had also read the introduction carefully, you would notice that reference was made to the Gospel of Mark and the narrative was hooked on to the Shroud’s image formation process. I was talking about a possibility. If the Shroud did indeed wrap the body of Jesus, no amount of scientific study can reach 100% certainty, we humans will be waiting for “current scientfic paradigms” for generations to come. As a note of caution, that is my personal opinion. You will need to understand Jaspers to go further. When it comes to radiation pulses, the response was about what was needed indeed. Ray Rogers was unsuccessful in his experiments and di Lazzaro made some improvements with his method. You must have read that he encountered difficulties initially, so some “calibrations” were needed. It is obvious that he was talking about the know how. A miracle is out of the realm of science.

I personally believe that “current paradigm” means something, but only to a certain extent. Can science answer all our questions? Only someone indulging in scientism would say that. Science can indeed inform philosophy when it comes to some questions, as Dennett seems to have demonstrated, but he is religion friendly and knows a lot about Catholicism. There are questions that science simply cannot answer. It is something that even Stephen Hawking seems to admit. How far can “current paradigm” be stretched? Colin: errr… Di Lazzaro never said that it was radiation. If you read my question it says “radiation like…” and that was prompted because laser was used. From what I can understand, “extreme short pulses” are needed to explain the extreme superficiality of the image on the Shroud. If you can perform an experiment demonstrating such extreme superficiality, not forgetting to take all that is seen on the relic’s image into account, I would love to see it. Di Lazzaro is looking for people who can perform experiments, he never said that his research is the last word on the topic. ———————————– What is coming next, within the next few days, will require the attention of both of you, in the field of science.

As you know, I find it hard to accept Maillard reaction as an explanation and provided the reasons why this is this is so week on the blog. The others also have not been demonstrated. It is clear from the interview that neither Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro or myself believe that radiation was the cause of the image. I said “radiation like” because laser was used and to also contest the Maillard reaction theory. Di Lazzaro’s intentions are clear in the interview, he was just attempting to show how Shroud like colouration was obtained, the energy involved, the speed with which the experiment was conducted and so on. It is also evident that he invites those interested in the scorch hypothesis to experiment with a life size statue, but, remember, the depth of the image will have to be like what is known about the Shroud image. I am not rejecting radiation because of the miraculous corollary. I am rejecting it because we simply do not know how the Shroud image was formed. The painting, scorch, photography theories have failed to convince. If Jesus was indeed wrapped in the Shroud pro authenticity Shroudies will also have a problem in demonstrating what exactly may have happened.

There is no doubt that the Tilma has many mysteries, but whether it was supernaturally produced is difficult to determine at this stage.
