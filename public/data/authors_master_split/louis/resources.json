I salvati de Francesco durante la dittatura” by Nello Scavo (Bologna, EMI) was launched this year in Italy and is expected to be translated into several languages. The title in English would be “Bergoglio’s list” and it is about the more than 100 lives that the then Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires saved during the terrible dictatatorship in Argentina. I received a copy for review today although I didn’t want it, reluctant as I am to write much on politics, but of course a short article will have to be written. This is in fact the second book on Pope Francis I received for review, the other one is by the German journalist and author, Andreas Englisch, who was a Vatican correspondent for around 20 years. The “caudillo” mentality still prevails in much of Latin America and is a leftover of the colonial regimes, Portugal and Spain competing for land and power. There is a good film about the Jesuits who were the first to establish a civilisation in the region. It is “The Mission”, starring Robert de Niro and Jeremy Irons, and won two Oscars.

Fitzmyer SJ Mike Stechschulte (above) mentions incorruption as one of the things that help him maintain his Catholic faith. The issue is being studied by the Church. There is true and false incorruption. False incorruption can be due to bodies that are hermetically sealed but begin to decay the instant the coffins are opened, others because the bodies were dried in the sun after being preserved in fat, also due to things like mummification, embalming, freezing, saponification. There are also bodies that have been buried in sand or dried by the bacteria “Hifa Pombicina Pers”, others affected by lighning, radioactivity etc. Other factors that have to be taken into consideration are those found in lands with deposits of calcium, climate and so on. There are around 500 bodies in varying states of incorruption in Catholic environments. Francis Xavier’s body is in a cardboard like state, still preserved in Goa.

The parapsychologist was a very serious scholar, a Catholic priest who was awarded a gold medal for helping parents who had a child with down syndrome. He asked volunteers to come to the stage, but no one beyond 25 as heart problems could develop during the process. He chose some 7 out of the 25 volunteers after they turned their backs to him. This was done mentally, and the 7 fell on the floor in an instant. This is called regression. In one case he took the unconscious of a 15 year old girl right upto her grandfather in minutes and she could “see” him sitting in the middle of trees and reading a newspaper. He asked her to tell him what he was reading, but she couldn’t, perhaps because a lot of mental force was required and she was very young. He then asked the audience if her parents were around and they were there. Her father confirmed that his father (and her grandfather) was a landowner and liked to read. This example is in keeping with what we learn from the Bible, not reincarnation. People sometimes talk about “past lives”, but they are actually mental images stored in the subconscious/unconscious. There was a very interesting discussion about this topic when Dr. C.T.K. Chari (Madras Christian College, India) challenged Professor Ian Stevenson (University of Virginia, USA), who was writing in favour of reincarnation but was suspected of “stage managing” cases in Sri Lanka..","date":"2015-06-19","mins":"6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/bbc-news-magazine-the-perplexing-image/","cat":"article","title":"BBC News Magazine:  The Perplexing Image"},{"id":"comment-202915","author":"louis","post":"We inherit talents, tendencies, traits and só on from our ancestors..","date":"2015-06-20","mins":"7:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/bbc-news-magazine-the-perplexing-image/","cat":"article","title":"BBC News Magazine:  The Perplexing Image"},{"id":"comment-202917","author":"louis","post":"You’re welcome, Sampath.

It does seem that Paul Badde has the best of intentions, having detected how much faith in Jesus’ resurrection there is today, however it is also hard to believe that Manoppello will change the scenario. There are many doubts when it comes to this image, but that is not so with scripture. It is evident that Badde is somewhat outdated when it comes to biblical studies. He refers to Bultmann, who is a thing of the past. Functions did not determine the forms, as the form critics with their “formesgeschicte” said.They put a great distance between eyewitnesses and gospels (1 Cor, 15:6: five hundred believers, “many of whom are stll alive.”). The gospel writers were composers of oral history and the continuity between Jesus traditions in oral form do resemble the continuity between eyewitnesses and historiographical sources. As Vincent Taylor wrote, if the form critics were right eyewitnesses must have ascended into heaven soon after Jesus’ resurrection. The empty tomb would mean absolutely nothing for faith if there were no appearances. That is why the Jesus movement was a “Resurrection movement”, not an “empty tomb”movement. No “bones of Jesus” were found in Jerusalem, whatever Bultmann may have thought. Https://www.academia.edu/7471287/Book Review The Tomb of Jesus and His Family Exploring Ancient Jewish Tombs Near Jerusalems Walls Bultmann(Lutheran) was influenced by Heidegger(Catholic) and both did not give up their faith. Badde is right when he says that most theologians have long been convinced that the reporting in the gospels cannot generally be considered reliable. He only exaggerated when he said “most” and one can bet that the scepticism he refers to is partly the result of Bultmann’s influence on biblical studies for a century. As Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer wrote, Scripture is the soul of theology. So, theologians will have to reconsider their theology, which will have to be based on what is being said about scripture today, which is not as Bultmann understood it..","date":"2015-07-04","mins":"9:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/04/christian-faith-eroded-to-the-very-core/","cat":"article","title":"Christian Faith Eroded to the Very Core?"},{"id":"comment-204535","author":"louis","post":"There seems to have been so little progress in studying the Manoppello image after my two hour interview with Father Heinrich Pfeiffer more than ten years ago that Paul Badde, despite his good intentions, has been far from convinving.

As daveb pointed out, the legacy of Bultmann is pervasive, but that is because it will take time for the new research to become more known. As for Msgr. J.P. Meier, his mistake was to say that he was writing on the basic details about Jesus that would be acceptable to Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Agnostics. His latest book says that only four parables can be attributed to Jesus, so then what are we left with when scholars in general are unanimous in agreeing that the sayings are more reliable than the narratives? It does seem that scepticism is becoming very pervasive, partly the result of the fact that even the Old Testament narratives have been questioned. We have I.Finkelstein denying the historicity of the story of the Patriarchs, the Exodus and a lot more.

The temple priests were spreading the rumour that the body had been stolen, which must have reached the ears of the disciples, Just an empty tomb was not enough, although there was a clue about what exactly may have happened: what did they see which made them believe?

The Pauline references to Jesus show that it did not take long for Christians to recognise Jesus’ relationship to Yahveh. In Rom 1:3 4 there is a double use of “Son”. The first refers to to Jesus as God’s “Son”, as in Galatians 1:16, 4:6, 1 Cor 15:28, Romans 8:32. Martin Hengel argues ( “The Son of God”, Philadelphia: Fortress) that this belief emerged between AD 30 and 50.

Bart Ehrman came from a fundamentalist evangelical background, so one must presume that he believed that when it came to the Bible, “Everything is true or nothing is true.” There are many cases where fundamentalists become agnostics, atheists and even anti Christian when they realise they are wrong. Ehrman made some interesting points in his studies, but was wrong in considering that almost everything could be questioned. He did not take the oral tradition into consideration and his mistake was his inability to distinguish Bible from Scripture (as understood by all Christian denominations today). I could tell you much more, but suffice it to say that Ehrman does not even figure in a 1000+ page book on Jesus, where there are essays by prominent biblical scholars, which I will be reviewing. There this really no need to read what the atheists say, as most of them, while not believing in Jesus’ divinity, do acknowledge his existence.

We must keep one thing in mind: If it IS Jesus no amount of science will demonstrate what EXACTLY happened. The disciples who were with Jesus when power left his body INVOLUNTARILY to cure the woman with the haemorrhage in a SPLIT SECOND, that is, INSTANTANEOUSLY, did not ask questions. They saw, and believed, because the woman told them what had happened. So, if it IS Jesus we, and among us twenty first century sceptics, are asking questions, or the “question of questions”, that will probably never be answered. The introduction to the interview mentions how the dormant divine power inside the dead JESUS may have been activated by the Father at the INSTANT of the Resurrection. God is not subject to time, we humans are. There is no indication of radiation, but neither are there signs of ingredients involved in a Maillard reaction, impurities, light, normal temperature, high temperature… NG is a first class magazine, many people came to know about the Shroud after reading their first article on the relic.

Unfortunately they cannot be laboratory tested because they are spontaneous. Genuine parapsychological phenomena have to be spontaneous, as Parapsychologists know, and should not be confused with claims made by Spiritualists. One prominent figure who began mixing things was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was Catholic, despite being warned by the Jesuits in England. But that was before the Society for Psychological Research was founded. C.G. Jung witnessed the spiritualist sessions of his relatives, which left him unconvinced. He was a co founder of SPR. Freud warned him about dabbling in these kind of things, misunderstanding the Swiss psychiatrist’s motives. I think that later on, wondering why his former disciple had much interest in paranormal phenomena, he himself began to investigate, in fact began to write about it. He would never admit that C.G.Jung was right, but then what went on his mind is locked up in the archives at the Library of Congress, unavailable for research. One of my professors of Parapsychology had some of his works praised by the Society for Psychical Research and was also a first class magician. He challenged India’s Sai Baba to perform a miracle in his presence, with scientific control. All he had to do was to fill a cavity, but there could be nothing more than a gesture. The challenge was ignored. The spiritualists were also afraid of him because he began to expose a number of frauds. He showed me a number of tiny coffins, or frogs, with his photograp inside them, black magic rituals. They were placed in front of his institute, probably at night, and he stored them in his museum, the frogs inside bottles with formol. He also studied Satanic sects, like the group founded by Anton La Vey, in Los Angeles and won a debate with a satanist, in the presence of journalists, who also witnessed his encounter with Uri Geller, who also lost.

He would have to take another path, but nothing to do with a new dimension of cosmic existence…..","date":"2015-04-14","mins":"7:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/14/interview-with-paolo-di-lazzaro/","cat":"article","title":"Interview with Paolo Di Lazzaro"},{"id":"comment-208435","author":"louis","post":"For “Shroudies” interested in browsing the Vatican collection: http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2015/08/17/vatican launches fundraising app for museum restoration projects/.","date":"2015-08-17","mins":"1:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/13/including-the-truth-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","title":"Including the Truth About the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-194692","author":"louis","post":"This is a good topic for discussion, however it is for the experts.

It is a definition that can be accepted without hesitation by all Christians, whether liberal or conservative, in an increasingly sceptical (Western) world.

You asked me to contact you directly and I did so, and here we go now. Allow me to comment the following: I think you have chosen the wrong title. Why? Because you are playing into the hands of well known scientists who deny any meaning in life, who say that selfishness has always been there and will always be there, we destroy creation and creation destroys us. Unlike Benedict XVI, Pope Francis was never a professor, a theologian or a philosopher, he was always a kindly parish priest, even as archbishop of Buenos Aires, so his intention is to be more practical, to help people live in a better way. Only, he does not understand that when he uses words like “fragile world in which we live” and “if we destroy creation,creation will destroy us” he does not take into consideration that we are also part of creation, there is an element of destruction everywhere, the reason for the fragile world. To go further, when you say “apostles of selfishness”, one must add that they also exist because there are the “faithful of selfishness”. It is like a vicious circle,it is part of the show, it has something to do with the nature of human existence, or should we say existence as a whole? You may find something here: https://www.academia.edu/7343768/Viktor Frankl and the Human Search for Meaning Now, on the other, it is hard to agree with scientists who say that “science has now provided a rock of fact to which believers may cling”. That is an illusion, an appeal to scientism, one must insist that they may explain “how”, but not “why”. Nice also to see you talk about the Resurrection.

To understand him we also need to look at his life, and beyond Safranski. He was also unconsciously a Christian, whatever he said about Christianity, that being the reason why he dispatched a letter to the Vatican’s Secretary of State before his death. He was being cynical in a way, but there can be no doubt that it looked like he wanted Christianity to be true and found it lacking. That was his point of view, but he spared Christ, he had no choice. You mention the Belgian priest scientist Father Georges Lemaitre, who first proposed the Big Bang, which is generally accepted today. Now when we come to the scientific definition of the state before that, we arrive at no conclusion. It is part of the ultimate issues scientists try to tackle, but surely beyond their field.

There are people who will certainly give up their Christian faith if fresh carbon dating, for some reason or the other, gives a result that is not around AD 33. But why should we bother so much about a relic that will never tell us the entire story about existence? Jesus never revealed everything, although he dropped a number of hints in his parables. The key to understanding existence, even provide some responses like the ones Stephen Hawking is seeking, lies there. To decipher the secret is another story. It almost seems that Jesus reserved this gift for a “chosen few”,and only he knows the reason, although we can guess what it is. There are quite a lot of questions demanding answers in this troubled world. If we look to the Bible from a fundamentalist viewpoint, that will get us nowhere. Pope John Paul II pointed out that the book of Genesis is not about science. One should add that even Babylonian mythology crept into the text, and not just in the Pentateuch, we see traces even in the Psalms and Isaiah.

Experts! But actually I don’t refer to a ‘scientific community,’ because I don’t think there is one. I sometimes refer to ‘scientific consensus,’ but even there we must be careful. “Most scientists think…..” is often a very subjective judgement based on ones own research partners and a quick flick through Google. This is where a forum like this is so important. A senior academic and Editor in Chief of a respected journal might well be regarded as an expert, while a middle school science teacher might not. However, if the science teacher can demonstrate the invalidity of the academic’s work, then the tables turn. Real experts, in this context, are essentially compendia of experiences and resources, which they can use to demonstrate the value of their opinion. If they don’t do that, but rely on their authority alone, then their opinion is no more valid than anybody else’s. You’re right that “properly assessed” was rather an imprecise term. “Universally assessed” might have been better. Some will go for the “he’s a famous scientist so he must be right” angle, some for the “he disagrees with me so he must be wrong” angle (both held by several commenters here), and a few who will look more carefully at the data and references. Eventually, I trust, the truth will out. “Properly”, ah yes that was the kicker… Being a famous or a respected scientist carries a certain amount of clout for certain, but if the data sucks, it sucks. Typically one’s competitors will make sure everyone is aware of this and will come bearing elephant guns. A middle school science teacher demonstrating the invalidity of an academic’s work sure, it can happen, but I do think you have to be careful that it’s not just slaps on the back from those in your group there is a significant difference between posting on a blog and putting an idea in the professional arena. Not a put down If the science is sound, the truth as you say will out. A personal question, if you don’t mind me asking what exactly is your own background, were you ever involved in any type of independent research, before becoming a science head (at a preparatory school, I believe)? Start to work on a graduate degree at some point? If so, what area(s) did you work on? Have you ever published in a science journal on your work? This is by no means a call out, I am just interested. Also, what first got you interested in science, as a wee lad, I presume?

That said, one must point point the dangers in accepting any amateurish attempts in biblical studies. What does J.P. Meier mean by “marginal Jew”?

The belief in the virginal conception of Jesus was part of the Christology of the early Church, within New Testament times, to be sure.

I will cite two sources, both Jewish: https://www.academia.edu/12851672/The Historical Jesus The view of Professor Geza Vermes Professor G.Vermes departed from this world telling Jews and Christians that the “real words of Jesus” would pose a challenge to both groups alike. He shunned organised religion and, from what it is possible to gauge, was guided by an existential spiritual legacy that he thought Jesus left for us. Harold Bloom, on the other hand, says that “Jesus did not tell us who he was”. He of course analysed the Bible from the point of literature and this analysis is linked to existence: https://www.academia.edu/12823419/Book Review Jesus and Yahveh the names divine.","date":"2015-06-25","mins":"9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/25/who-is-he/","cat":"article","title":"Who Is He?"},{"id":"comment-38644","author":"louis","post":"Jesterof,further to the above unfortunately I couldn’t find anything now and the files will probably be available in August or September.

It is for this reason that the second interview left some gaps when the topic was incorruption and no further explanation was available. Anyway, there are some details that should help you clear your doubts regarding true and false incorruption: False incorruption: Artificial techiques Embalming Factors such as dry lands, with the climate influencing the state of the body “Larvas” – the body remains intact depending on the conditions in which it is preserved, then turns into powder instantly when exposed to air. This can happen when some coffins are opened. Calcification – organic material can influence the preservation or decomposition of the body Freezing – due to natural conditions, in places like Siberia, the Himalayan region etc. Fat – Fat derived from pork can be used to preserve bodies, some tribes in Africa have used this method Lightning and radioactivity – These can also influence the state of a body, but it seems that it depends on the body Hypha Pombicina Pers – fungus that can preserve the body, at least for a while. Can apply to the bodies of the Capuchin monks in Palermo, Sicily and Malta “Saponification” – ammonia is involved and the external skin becomes hard True incorruption; There are hundreds of bodies of saints that are partially incorrupt, some in a cardboard like state. This is the case of the body of the Basque saint Francis Xavier, preserved in Goa, India, from which it can be deduced that it remained totally incorrupt for a long time. Many of the bodies still have blood in them, or oil/fragrance emanates from them, and these are in a perfect or semi perfect state. Some of the saints cited were Francis de Sales, Bernadette Soubirous (Lourdes), Queen Isabel of Portugal, Philip Neri. The blood of some martyred saints has remained intact,outside the bodies.

Shroud studies have fallen short of the mark and it will be difficult to get Pope Francis, who can be a tough South American hombre, to agree with new testing. He sat in front of the Shroud and meditated and that is a clear message for “Shroudies”. Pope John Paul II was a bit more positive, however he also spoke about the “mystery of life and death”, which could be expected from a pontiff who was also a philosopher and whose doctoral dissertation was on Scheler. One great scientist who understood what John Paul thought was Stephen Jay Gould, who fought against what he called “Darwinian fundamentalists” and went along with Carl Sagan to Rome,where he presented his NOMA. A Jewish born agnostic,he also sung at church choirs. Https://www.academia.edu/14727603/Why Stephen Jay Gould proposed the principle of Non overlapping Magisteria There are many issues to be dealt with and some fine tuning is needed: https://www.academia.edu/5353803/God science and religion today The above post says “Jesus reputed burial tomb(s)” and “whether this unprecedented event actually occurred”. It is evident that just this is sufficient for Rome to ignore the book. Why? Two former Jerusalem District Archaeologists, both of whom are highly respected, have accepted the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as the site of Jesus’ burial, so there are no “tombs”, whatever sensationalists may say. The Israeli authorities are Dr. Amos Kloner and Dr. Dan Bahat, the latter having been invited by the Vatican to lecture at Rome. When things like “whether this unprecedented event actually occurred” are said matters become worse. It will be interpreted as an unconscious lack of faith, as an attempt to “prove” the Resurrection event by hooking it on to a cloth that has yet to be authenticated. The creed does not say “… and was buried wrapped in the Turin Shroud” but it does say “..the third day he rose from the dead”.

Solomon built the Temple but also worshipped Asherah, whose idol was placed inside this very Temple later. Herod re built the Temple and also constructed several Pagan temples to worship other gods. Deep inside he was Idumean. If those on the top broke the rules what could be expected from commoners? From Jesus himself we learn that they also worshipped Baal. Given the mentality prevailing during that period, would the people bother about the weave of burial shrouds?.","date":"2013-04-18","mins":"10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/16/giulio-fanti-responds-to-gian-marco-rinaldis-book-review/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds to Gian Marco Rinaldi’s Book Review"},{"id":"comment-31226","author":"louis","post":"Further to comments #25 and #33, it is obvious that more research is needed and the material found in Akeldama and in the Qumran caves do not help in understanding the TS, the textiles found in the caves being very crude.

After Jesus’ death Joseph of Arimathea went to Pilate to ask for permission to remove the body and the soldiers had to go go to the site of the crucifixion and come back to give a report and this may involved some documentation. You can be sure that the High Priest’s servants, serving as spíes, kept an eye on everything that was going on: any mistake committed by Pilate would provide the HP with justification to demand that he be sent back to Rome. Remember that both parties did not get along with each other due to some of the procurator’s previous actions. Then, any breaking of Sabbath rules by the disciples was what the the HP would also love to see to justify his attitudes on the whole and aim,once again, at those in the Jesus movement. Since this took a lot of time it is perhaps true that, as you said, only four of the five Judaean burial core procedures were performed. My contention is that the body was not washed, much less anointed, for the simple reason that the disciples would have to first wash to then anoint. This anointment had to do with burial, not with the previous anointment, performed when the person was alive, and which was an ancient Israelite ritual..","date":"2013-04-23","mins":"8:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/16/giulio-fanti-responds-to-gian-marco-rinaldis-book-review/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds to Gian Marco Rinaldi’s Book Review"},{"id":"comment-31634","author":"louis","post":"Max, you know that the Gospels do not go into details, and so when Luke says that Pilate and the High Priest “became friends” he didn’t add that it was political horse trading.

Some excerpts from my interview with Professor Heinrich Pfeiffer, SJ on this cloth and the TS have been published, but not on the Internet.

Meanwhile the anti authenticity camp is also active ( see “An authentic first century burial shroud from Jerusalem”,posted April 2 on the Tabor blog). This is an old story, and, again, the TS is dismissed just because of the weave. There are other statements that can also be questioned: For instance, it is said that “entrance to this part of the tomb was completely sealed with plaster”, and, further, archaeologists Spiegelman and Greenblatt have expressed the view that the origins and development of leprosy are largely obscure. “Leprosy in the Jewish Bible may well refer to psoriasis” it is stated. But is that true? Were first century Jews unable to distinguish between psoriasis (non contagious) and leprosy (contagious)? Would there be a colony for people suffering from a non contagious disease? Would a man suffering from a non contagious disease be buried in a tomb that was completely sealed? The fact that Jesus stayed in the house belonging to Simon the leper, in a leper colony, on his way to Jerusalem led Yigael Yadin to the conclusion that this was done on purpose, to defy the Essenes, since small groups belonging to the sect are believed to have lived in Jerusalem according to him, Father Bargil Pixner and Prof. Charlesworth. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson believes that Jesus’ healings were the main reason for his crucifixion.

I say “objective” because it is a misunderstanding to think that many Christians base their faith on a relic like the TS, which is certainly not the case, and therefore the relevance of the link. When one pries into personal beliefs when discussing Shroud science, that is not an objective approach. It seems to be incorrect to link any inauthenticist views to Satanic tendencies, whether as belief or influence, and that is because evil is easy to find. You can see it among people who think they are religious, just as you may fail to find it among atheists. If that was not the case we would not see Pope John Paul II inviting Italian President and atheist Sandro Pertini to accompany him when he went skiing, or Pope Francis asking those with no belief in God to help in creating a better world for all of us. There is a lot more evil than many people imagine, however the Christian faith in the risen Christ pushes that into a secondary place.

Why create life if one has to lose it to find it? There is much more to this than “meets the ear”. Jesus spoke in riddles, he did so deliberately, so that once could understand by reading between the lines. The message lies hidden there. History shows us that churches in general have never understood the true message of Christ, As G.K.Chesterton wrote, “Christianity has not been tried and found wanting.” Has it really been tried and by how many? It leads to an extremely difficult path, as Jesus himself warned.

This applies to both science (physics, in this case) and religion. That is why the Catholic Church makes no pronouncements and some physicists — at least ones like Stephen Hawking,member of the Pontifical academy of Science — admit that theories propounded at present may have to be discarded, either due to mistaken assumptions or new developments. We also have other problems: Freud is no longer the authority he used to be, many of his thoughts are still not available to us, Teilhard neglected to answer some questions and RD has indeed raised some important doubts — whether we like it or not. John had presented me with a query and I answered him but he seems to have not paid sufficient attention to it. If he did, he would see that there is that what I call ” a lot more in the box”. Example? The last sentence in this posting.

I cannot suggest a title because I do not know the contents, but may I suggest you take as much as possible into account? I presume you begin with alpha and finish at omega and this is OK for Christians, but what about the others that Father Anthony Amaladoss (link above) is trying to convince. My feeling is that he is sort of following the track laid by the Belgian Jesuit Father Jacques Dupuis, who was the presiding priest at a Benediction I attended when invited for lunch at a big Jesuit seminary. It is not not diffficult to understand the aim of these two Jesuits — another one, Father Anthony de Melo was even chastised by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for what what they detected as satanic elements! I once played volleyball with his colleague Father Richard Mc Hugh, but his approach was different— but the Christian message is that Jesus is not negotiable. So the meaning of Christ in the cosmic scene, for all people, nations, races and so on would have to be taken into account. The matter can become complicated because Hinduism has around eighty schools of interpretation, God can be He, She, or It, worse, He can be an illusion. That is what he is in Buddhism, where there is no deity, however Buddha is said to have dodged questions he could not answer by telling the people who asked him questions that they were wasting time with speculation instead of concentrating on getting out of the karmic cycle.In my view, he did not answer the question, Who started this karmic cycle? A mechanistic universe raises even more questions.

Why should the possibility of John the Baptizer playing the role of rival messiah have been considered? There were a number of doomsday preachers like him in the Judaean desert, belonging to small, isolated, baptismal sects, and he was the prominent one, having lost his life for attacking Herod. What did he teach that could be compared to Jesus’ teachings? The Mandaeans claim him as one of their prominent members, although their Book of John dates to the seventh century, probably having been written in order to ensure safety during the Arab conquest. There is evidence of Indian (Hindu) and Iranian (Zoroastrian) influence in the beliefs. One Shroud paper even claimed that both Jesus and John were Mandaeans! https://www.academia.edu/6568383/Does the Shroud show a Mandaean burial (click on earlychurch.org) The owner of the James ossuary was known for forging artifacts, sometimes with the help of the Copt Marcos Ghattas, living in Egypt, who did not appear at the trial. Its provenance is unknown and, in my view, it is certain that while one hand wrote “James, son of Joseph”, another one inscribed “brother of Jesus”. The owner was acquitted at the trial and the court, like the Israel Antiquities Authority, did not recognise the entire inscription as genuine: https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot   Part III Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ, taken to Toronto to see the ossuary after he had accepted the Aramaic inscription as correct, also pointed out that the artefact did not necessarily hold the remains of James the Just, Paul’s “the brother of the Lord”, first Jewish Christian bishop of Jerusalem. Professor Amos Kloner, who was Jersusalem District Archaeologist for a number of years, also dismissed the claims. As for Mary Magdalene, the topic rose to prominence because of the so called Jesus Family Tomb (Talpiot). The late Professor François Bovon of Harvard was led into a trap and had his words twisted and Father Fitzmyer also pointed out how the meaning of ancient documents was distorted: https://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot   Parts I and II The Gospel of Judas says exactly the opposite of what the documentary claims..","date":"2015-02-13","mins":"1:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/13/more-information-on-the-book-finding-jesus/","cat":"books","title":"More Information on the Book ‘Finding Jesus’"},{"id":"comment-190964","author":"louis","post":"Nabber: Some of the sects, drawing on long held beliefs, are mentioned here: https://www.academia.edu/6568383/Does the Shroud show a Mandaean burial (Click on earlychurch.org) The main point was to stress the difference between Jesus and John the Baptizer, nothing to do with baptism.

Has understood, you haven’t. If you dig deeply into the research being done by biblical scholars you will realise that early Judaism was much more divided than hitherto believed. Many people and sects not mentioned in the Bible have been found. Have you read the pseudepigrapha? I must stress that you are going off the point. The argument started because the CNN series has as one of its contents the possibility of John the Baptizer as a rival messiah. This is pure rubbish. Obviously it has been included because what sensationalists and secret orders have been claiming has been heard, it is material that raises eyebrows, it draws people to the TV set Money is made with documentaries and books which have sceptics and fundamentalists at the extremes. I am sorry to have to say that whoever is looking for serious research has to look elsewhere, documentaries can be a form of entertainment. The concept of Messiah in Christianity is different from what was expected in early Judaism. I think you know that Jesus assumed more than just a messianic role.

Qumran does not seem to have been a place where the Shroud could have been stored. According to Qumran excavator Father Roland de Vaux, who was also the first editor in chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the settlement/monastery was razed by the “Decima Legio Fretensis”, the Tenth Roman Legion commanded by Vespasian (at that time) on the way to besiege Jerusalem in AD 70. There were no Jewish or Jewish Christian communities in the region after that, the latter group having fled to Pella. Frale’s claim was probably based on the theory that the Shroud was stored in a jar like the ones found in the Qumran caves. I took a photograph of one of these jars many years ago,and there seems to be no reason why such jars were not used in Jerusalem and elsewhere in ancient Palestine. It is of course possible that the Shroud was stored in such a jar, but not necessarily in Qumran. There were Essenes living in Jerusalem, who, in my view, may have traded jars made in Qumran for clothing and footwear, for instance. Some of the material I have cannot be revealed and one person in the field of Shroud studies with whom I shared it also preferred to keep quiet. It is a “hint”, but not an essential link in establishing a link with the knights. If you have read what had been going on in Shroud research around a decade ago and the recent e mail from the highly qualified Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo on possibilities of fresh carbon dating, a stretch of which was posted on this blog about two weeks ago, the picture becomes crystal clear. I hope to work on another lead in the Templar connection shortly, but it will depend on what material will be available for my research. I see you have become an “Elder” of the community, and that is good for you. We always have something important to transmit to the next generation. The awareness you talk about is a consequence of the readings. Sometimes such an awareness arises spontaneously and instantaneously, as if by accident, but that I think is a special gift from God.

There are several reasons why the tomb was handled that way. First, people don’t seem to bother that much about tombs, children were seen playing “football” with skulls from the Talpiot tomb. Amos Kloner was working under pressure, he had to abandon the excavation of the next tomb as the ultra orthodox “haredim” began to throw stones at him. Second, the names are common, which is what Professor Charlesworth realised only later. The pool of names was small during the period, as anyone who reads the NT will deduce. The second wife of Herod the Great was named Mariamne, and God knows how many ossuaries with this name are lying in unexcavated caves. “Mara” is probably a second woman, perhaps a sister of Mariamene, and must have died later because two scribal hands can be seen in the inscription. The Patio tomb also has an ossuary with the name “Mara”. Was she also a “lordess”?! “Mara” can also be masculine and the Syrian Orthodox Church, who originally seemed to have had many members of the Judaeo Christian community — one remnant is the people called “Nasranis” in the south of India — only began calling woman saints “Martha”, not “Mara”, in the fourth century. Their bishops and patriarchs are addressed as “Mar” and “Mor”, and there is no feminine form, they have no women priests..","date":"2014-05-03","mins":"3:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/03/new-fictional-book-blood-doctrine/","cat":"books","title":"New Fictional Book: Blood Doctrine"},{"id":"comment-111358","author":"louis","post":"Hi clublu2201(the rest is missing) This is the second invitation to go to Saint Louis, but unfortunately I can’t go.

Regarding Monsignor John P. Meier, Daveb chose the right scholar and that is the reason why in the article on the HSG website I begin by mentioning him. It must also be added that he is not without opposition, even from Catholic scholars such as Father Anthony Kelly (Australia) and Professor Luke Timothy Johnson (US), not to forget Jewish scholar Rabbi Jacob Neusner (US) who says that there is no difference between the “Jesus of history” and the “Christ of faith.” In his book on Jesus of Nazareth Benedict XVI states that he begins where the German Catholic scholar Rudolf Schnackenburg finished. But most noteworthy is the fact that Schnackenburg felt that Jesus “hovers” in the gospels and one should employ the (often used) term “mysterium Christi” to describe this. If the Pope read more about what Meier wrote, he would find the scholar stating the following about Jesus: “Not only does he speak riddles and parables, but he is making himself the ultimate riddle and parable of God by speaking in this strange, enigmatic way.” So, as anyone can see, even Meier, with all his enormous erudition, bumped into the “mysterium Christi” noticed by Schnackenburg. To go a bit further, another great scholar,Adolf von Harnack, wrote in the last century that “Jesus’ relation to the Father was his secret and no psychology will fathom it.” He was not exaggerating, for even Jung, also with his enormous erudition, tried his best and gave up trying to find a gap between the “humanity” and the “divinity”.

However, there was one drawback, not limited to him and seen in the works of other scholars in the field. They keep an eye on new discoveries in science, which often involves discarding one theory in favour of a new one, and when that cannot be housed in theology they turn to philosophy. The result is process theology and other attempts to explain away differences between science and theology and the question which raises its head, which they themselves ask, is Who and What is God? This is nothing more than a dead end, leaving the faithful dumbfounded and more empty pews in churches. We also have Msgr. John P. Meier, who comes with an imaginary round table with Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Agnostics locked up in a library to thrash out differences. He admits he is writing only what all of them can accept without hesitation, and that is exactly his big mistake. He should write what he, as an historian, feels is acceptable, not to please others. As an extremely erudite Bible scholar, does he not know that Jesus during his earthly life would only admit a Yes or No, one could say “a take it or leave it” approach? Writing to please academics is not correct, it can mislead the faithful. After Meier finishes writing his last two volumes you can bet there will be more tons of books “about Jesus” because he has not filled the blanks, blanks that have to be filled for a complete picture to be obtained. The more daring Biblical scholars, not writing to please anyone, are slowly filling these blanks, and that will eventually clear many doubts, those that Barbour, and now Meier, failed to remove. Till then we will continue to see less baptisms, more empty churches, rising numbers of atheists, agnostics, those sitting over the wall, and former fundamentalists like Gerd Lüdemann and others praying to the universe!.","date":"2014-01-04","mins":"8:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/03/rest-in-peace-ian-barbour/","cat":"books","title":"Rest in Peace Ian Barbour"},{"id":"comment-72442","author":"louis","post":"I invite readers interested in reading the above exchange to judge what is the exact reason why David is not interested in discussion anymore, while continuing to justify his stand in a manner that is not all convincing. Max ( much more qualified to write on the Shroud because of his on site research and the detailed studies he has at his disposal, but who no longer comments on this blog) was right about the blind spots he detected, and here we go: Of course the Resurrection is something beyond human experience, it was an unique event. One must read all the literature that appeared in the region during the period to understand it all. Quote: “In his highly disciplined historic approach, Meier quite properly rejects drawing on the Resurrection as part of the discipline he has chosen.” Reply: There is absolutely no reason to state that J.P. Meier “properly rejects drawing on the Resurrection as part of the discipline he has chosen.” Not even the highly learned monsignor said this! The discipline he has chosen is history and it depended on him to choose whether to include the Resurrection or not in his series. The “quite properly rejects” can only apply to the people who sat at the imaginary round table with him, not to the field of history. Does it have to be repeated over and over again that he was writing to conform to the expectations of these people? As such, he was obliged to omit one part of the history, however that does not justify saying that he “properly rejected” the Resurrection as part of the discipline. Quote: “I have the greatest respect for all of the recent popes, commencing with Leo XIII. I am unaware of having insulted any” Reply See #4, where it is stated, “Certainly there are limits to what the historical method can achieve, and in order to discover the “Jesus of Faith” we must look elsewhere, such as to Benedict’s “Jesus of Nazareth”. However in a rational age, this “Jesus of Faith” must surely need to correspond to the “historical Jesus” rather than some idealised pietistic fantasy” Does one have to consult Freud’s works to comprehend what he meant by Free Association or is there no need for this because the association is evident here? Quote; “Anythng written by me in a printed publication, was only published on a web site consequential to a personal invitation to do so.” Reply: The question of personal invitation does not arise here, it is irrelevant, and again it is going off the point. The problem is explaining how one who claims to be Catholic, wrote a Shroud article for a parish magazine, which was also posted on a Shroud website,admits the fact that he doubts the Resurrection and associates Pope Benedict’s “Jesus of faith” with “pietistic fantasy.” Davor Aslanovski is an Oxford scholar and stated on this very blog that he only exchanges comments with people who identify themselves fully on a blog. He was driven out of this blog unjustly, and apparently not the kind of person to use “I” this and “I” that all the time like a self appointed judge, he said what he had to say bluntly, not bothered about trying to impress or flatter anyone.

He had to get even because a comment posted by me another thread about carbon dating the pollen grains did not defend the position he had assumed. For those who care to wonder what exactly is going on — and I am accused of using strategems! — he left another comment on the Abgar letter thread making a nasty insinuation in response to what I had written. Who, exactly, is looking for a quarrel? One should be careful when underestimating someone else’s intelligence. What also comes to mind is the blind spots and the hypocrisy Max detected. This is therefore not a self chosen quarrel, it is a response to provocations, and if the strategem continues, it will be met with further adequate response, particularly because it is incorrect to hit below the belly, to respond with comments that go off the point and to deny having made comments or adopting attitudes after having announced them with pomp and circumstance on this very thread. There seems to be no room for prima donnas here, and I am sure everyone welcomes team work where constructive criticism can be seen. Pope Benedict XVI did cite J.P. Meier’s works,but he was referring to the volumes that were published till some time ago. It is highly doubtful that he would endorse the monsignor’s reluctance to deal with the Resurrection, because he describes the exact meaning of the event in his own work. But being a very intelligent scholar he surely understands that Meier is writing for those sharing the round table with him, not for the faithful. If those who think they are part of the flock and use “A Marginal Jew” as a yardstick to judge what can or cannot be believed they are on the wrong track. Benedict also did not cite Meier in his talk at Regensburg, he referred to Father Rudolf Schnackenburg. Davor Aslanovski has been studying Byzantine and art history and had every right to express his opinions as a qualified scholar, in fact there are people in this blog who are saying roughly the same things he wrote about.

When it comes to John P. Meier he says that he does not agree that “Meier’s work will be the cause of Christians falling from their faith, quite the reverse.” That was not exactly what was commented by me, for Meier maybe just one who can mislead the faithful. Why do I say that? I do not see how he considers the Resurrection, a less historical event if one reads the New Testament, the central belief of Christianity, to be beyond the scope of his work. Or is it beyond the scope of his work because he has to please the Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Agnostics sitting at the imaginary round table he has convened? “Quite the reverse”? It does not seem so. There is talk about a Fourth Quest now, Meier has not filled all the blanks, and there is a liberal Protestant scholar (and pastor) who wisely says that the quest can be laid to rest. Till when only God knows. Everyone, Strauss, Reimarus, Baur, Schweitzer, Bultmann, Meier has failed. Anyone interested in learning more about this can read the interview article “What do we know about the Bible: An interview with Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ” on the Internet. If the Resurrection is not judged to be at least a less historical event, what was it: a psychic event? If that is accepted then one might as well stop reading Meier, with those countless footnotes, and other scholars writing to please others, unlike Pope Benedict XVI — writing as Joseph Ratzinger — who gave a more convincing explanation to a hardened atheist and communist like Peter Seewald, former editor of “Der Spiegel” and brought him back to the Catholic faith he had lost. So what can be read, if the central belief of Christianity was nothing more than some sort of psychic event, a collective hallucination, an image on a burial shroud and more? Suggestions? Frederick Myers, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (minus Sherlock Holmes), Allan Kardec with his “Gospel according to Spiritualism”… Whether all that is convincing is another story…. Just because the faithful from countries in Asia and Africa fill the pews of a parish in NZ, taking away most of the “vanilla flavour” in the process, does not mean that the Church will continue to be healthy in their native countries. The “wave” has not reached these countries so far. It arrived in Europe a long time ago, and is slowly making its way all along the US. When the faithful in these countries, often struggling to make ends meet, manage to fill their pockets considerably, able to buy books about science and theology that do not really remove the doubts, only adding to the confusion, they will forget about going to church. By then John P. Meier will have finished the last two volumes, with no mention of the Resurrection, pleased to have satisfied the demands of those who shared the round table with him. That perhaps may contribute to the doubting, but richer, faithful to buy less books because the whole story can be found in a few volumes, a nutshell.

I know that Monsignor John P. Meier says mass in a parish church and think he should use his enormous erudition when it comes to biblical studies to tell the whole story as a historian, even if he rejects the Resurrection event as something that should be taken literally. It would be better than writing that it is beyond the scope of his study and thus avoid the possibility of the round table ending as a fiasco. There is another priest, considered to have been the “scholar’s scholar” — both by Catholic and Protestant scholars in the US — before his retirement, more liberal than conservative, a thousand times more qualified than Meier, who also devoted a lot of time to “scholarly pursuits’ and also says mass. He did not hesitate in explaining the Resurrection, central in Christian belief, to believers and non believers alike in his books and understood, like Helmut Koester, the difficulties in grasping the Jesus of history: https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What do we know about the Bible An interview with Joseph A. Fitzmyer SJ I do not believe that Monsignor Meier denies the Resurrection, only that he had to please those sharing the round table with him.Of course, there are others, as Dennett seems to imply in a recent book, who are caught in a pulpit, but he seems to have forgotten that there are also those caught in a pew. Not because of any retirement benefits, but due to the fact that the church can also be a nice place for a social gathering. David provides us with some lines from Meier’s CV, for which reason I will cite something about Father Fitzmyer’s qualifications: — Obtained his Ph D under the guidance of Professor Wiilliam F. Albright, at Johns Hopkins — Worked with Father Roland de Vaux, OP, archaeologist who excavated Qumran and editor in chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls, at the scrollery in Jerusalem in 1956 and was thus one of the first scholars to handle these precious documents — Was on the Pontifical Biblical Commission — Professor of Hebrew and Aramaic at the University of Chicago, for a while — Professor of Biblical Studies at Oxford University, for around two years — Fifteen honorary doctorates — A gold medal (excellence in Biblical Studies) from the British Academy — Translated Hebrew, Aramaic, Coptic, Greek and Latin — Co editor of the Jerome Biblical Commentary, together with Fathers Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy — Author of more than thirty books in the field of Biblical Studies, many of them so important that they appear in the bibliographies of books published by other renowned Biblical scholars — Was the expert consulted to identify the Aramaic inscription on the so called James ossuary — Edited and translated the (Aramaic) Tobit texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls, found in Qumran, cave 4 — Wrote what scholars consider to be the best guides on the Dead Sea Scrolls — Was was the key figure in the Catholic Lutheran dialogue, resulting in the agreement signed in Augsburg, Germany, an important step in Christian unity There are many more qualifications, relating to the SBL,CBQ etc. But those given above should suffice. Last, but not the least, David insinuates that Pope Benedict XVI— whose book on Jesus of Nazareth is consulted even by Protestant scholars — ,the former head of the Church to which he belongs, has been indulging in “pietistic fantasy”. I have never seen anyone chained to a pew in the church, the door is always open for anyone to leave. Why waste time in such a Church? Perhaps that faith which is missing can be found in a round table, where sceptical scholars are unwilling to entertain any talk about the central belief in Christianity..","date":"2014-01-05","mins":"1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/03/rest-in-peace-ian-barbour/","cat":"books","title":"Rest in Peace Ian Barbour"},{"id":"comment-72320","author":"louis","post":"Have you read what you posted in #4 and my reply in #5?

In an increasingly sceptical Western world it may serve as a prop for faith. So far so good, the problem arises when just relics are used to sustain this faith. The parables of Jesus have a lot more to teach Christians and it is exactly in his words that deep faith should lie. The other problem relates to academics, particularly when what they write is taken as gospel truth. They are human, just as the authors of popular books are, and, talking from experience, that is, after interviews, reviews and other material, one can sometimes easily detect prejudices, distortions and even hatred in what they write. Some genuine artefacts have been found in Israel.Two of these are from the Second Temple period: one is an inscription indicating the way to the place of trumpeting and the other is an ossuary probably belonging to Nicanor, the Alexandrian, who built the “beautiful gate” mentioned in the New Testament (Acts) and also in the Talmud: https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot   Part III Some people have questioned the existence of the Jerusalem Temple, both for religious and political reasons, and these artefacts constitute just one reason to show why they are wrong. Another problem is forgeries, used by agenda driven documentary producers and some others. The James ossuary, with its partially forged inscription, is just one of them. In this case we do not need it to prove the existence of Jesus and James the Just, the “brother of the Lord”, the first of the twelve Jewish Christian bishops of Jerusalem.

That’s right, Teilhard got the Church to accept evolution and John Paul II did say it was ” a fact”, Benedict XVI unwilling to accept everything, thus making him assert that “you cannot drag 10.000 generations into the laboratory.” Benedict has foresight since original sin and when exactly God put the soul into the human species will need discussion. You may have misunderstood me because I do not really swallow everything that RD has said, in fact he can be very biased, but there are questions he has raised quite rightly. Which is what brings me to the days in school and college, where the influence of the Jesuits, of different nationalities, was very strong. With the American Jesuits I learnt sports, with the German Jesuit lay brothers, all very tough veterans of WW II, fighting in the Reichswehr and Luftwaffe, fed up with destruction in war, making them become missionaries with a lot of conviction, I learnt discipline. While working as a journalist after college I was invited for lunch one day at a big Jesuit seminary. The lunch was preceded by Benediction, officiated by the famous and controversial Belgian Jesuit Father Jacques Dupuis. At that time it looked like he was mixing things up in his theology, today it is different. The issues he raised have also been tackled by the professor of Goan origin Gavin D’Costa at the University of Bristol, advisor to both Catholic and Anglican Churches in England. What I am trying to say is that in a way the field of Shroud studies is very much like the fields of Biblical Archaeology and Studies, where we can can see extremes.

Chari, who taught at Madras Christian College, India, and investigated cases in Burma and Sri Lanka (see http://www.ctkchari.org). While doing a course in Parapsychology my professor called for volunteers willing to be hypnotized for regression and a fifteen year old girl could see her grandfather reading a newspaper and the background was green. She tried her best to read what he had been reading but did not succeed as she could not support the strain. Her parents happened to be present on that day, the last day of the course, to see their daughter receive her certificate and the father confirmed that he came from a family of landowners, therefore the green background. This experience is more in keeping with what is learnt in modern psychology. In another course the importance of scientific control was stressed and the professor was known to have unmasked people claiming to perform miracles or other feats. Uri Geller could not bend any spoon in his presence and there were around ten journalists, including one from a TV channel, around. It was reported that Geller took the first flight back to Tel Aviv that very day. The professor had also challenged a famous man claiming to perform miracles to do it in his presence, under scientific control. All that had to be done was to fill a cavity, but there could be nothing more than uttering a word or making a gesture. The challenge was not accepted.

Further, he has the nasty habit of threatening to leave the blog from time to time, after which he sees one or two commenters telling him not to do so, which really serves no purpose other than serving to inflate the ego. This when he does not appeal to Dan because of his age, which is nothing more than emotional blackmail. The latest demonstration of his unbecoming behaviour is his comment above, where he says “Louis and his archaeologist acquaintances”. The biblical scholars, archaeologists, paleographers and other than these, theologians, university professors, exegetes, parapsychologists, historians, scientists and more are not my “acquaintances”. My relationship with them is professional because of what I write. ————— Cross culturation has taken place all over the world, in all societies and in all civilisations. That is because no religion is born in a vacuum. I reiterate that the Sadducees were no exception, some Temple priests having even indulged in witchcraft in order to get to reach the post of High Priest. They did not listen to the prophets: “I will have mercy and not sacrifice”. It is for reasons like these that some scholars have now suggested that there should be no “biblical studies”, it should be a part of “Near Eastern studies”. Even the Essenes were not immune to pagan influence, having derived their dualism, although subordinate to monotheism, from Iran. 300 BC to AD 200 was a period of intense pluralism, as both Jewish and Christian scholars have noted: https://www.academia.edu/12734802/Book Review Beyond the Essene Hypothesis The Parting of the Ways between Qumran and Enochic Judaism The Essenes tried to tackle the problem of evil that began dividing Jewish groups in 300 BC and reached what they believed was a solution: “God has has put two spirits, good and bad, in human beings”, but then, as they believed they were the “sons of light” while all other people, including other Jewish groups were the “sons of darkness” they formed an “eschatological army”, again demonstrating the influence of Iranian dualism. In the process they also absorbed details from a Hebrew Herodian army manual, which is turn, was based on a Roman army manual and the Romans were the “kittim” whom the Essenes hated.

Is it justified? Have “Shroudies” now solved the problem of the mysterium Christi, something that not even the world’s best biblical scholars have been able to do? For instance, Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ, considered to be one of the twentieth century’s greatest New Testament scholars, sees a distinction between the pre and post Easter Jesus in the Gospels. On the other hand, Monsignor John P. Meier, the world’s topmost historical Jesus researcher, does not think so: https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What do we know about the Bible An interview with Joseph A. Fitzmyer SJ Jesus was subtle even in his actions sometimes, as Yigael Yadin, the Israeli archaeologist, clearly understood. His views do not necessarily clash with what Fr. Fitzmyer has gleaned from the Dead Sea Scrolls, although Professor Geza Vermes did not take these into account: https://www.academia.edu/12851672/The Historical Jesus The view of Professor Geza Vermes So let us leave Jesus’ self awareness, and what the disciples understood about him. In the pre Easter phase, out of the discussion. Most of the disciples abandoned Jesus when he was arrested. If anyone could put coins over the eyes it would be Nicodemus, who must have had money in his pocket. There are, however, two problems with this hypothesis: 1) There is still no clear evidence that any coin can be seen over an eye. Giorgio was supposed to upload a paper with images to support the coins over the eyes theory 2) Max thinks that coins in tombs justify his position. He does not take into account that the Sadducees were heavily influenced by the Greeks, in fact imitated their lifestyle in some ways. Since “Sheol” was very much in the collective unconscious of all Jewish groups, whether Sadducees, Pharisees or Essenes, nothing rules out the possibilty that coins were used to pay Charon to ferry souls across the river Styx.

Public relations that are barely able to hide the tension lurking behind, a tension that is revealed when it explodes openly — when public relations is not possible. Posting Shroud papers on Academia.edu will not attract academics to the field because if they want to delve deeper they will inevitably be led to Shroud sites and publications, where they will see that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing in some places and get the impression that confusion abounds.They will either lose interest or read what is being said just to keep in touch with what is going on, but unwilling to enter a minefield. To get something published in the “top” sites and publications you have to be a chummy, no matter whether what you have written is a useful contribution or just plain rubbish. I regret having to tell you that you yourself have succumbed to this policy, but can understand it on account of the pressure you must be facing from those behind the scenes who decide who is and is not a chummy and to whom a door should be opened, albeit indirectly. One clear example? There are people who are not exactly prominent Shroud scholars who have received mention in your last paragraph and others who are, that is, who have contributed with useful papers based on important discoveries, have been ignored. Of course, they are no longer chummies and have been unjustly driven out of the Shroud scenario. Curiously, some time ago one prominent Shroud scholar was the object of scorn simply because he was writing papers beyond his field of expertise and although his contributions were noteworthy. At the same time another scholar, who was not at all prominent, began writing absolute nonsense — I received correspondence from prominent Shroud scholars backing my position — and was mentioned 4(four) times. Something must change drastically if academics are to enter the scene and if Shroudies wish to gain the confidence of the authorities, both in Turin and Rome.

My understanding of resurrection is roughly as Jürgen Moltmann understands it and in keeping with his stand against “monarchical” monotheism. We should not think of resurrection like the ancient Egyptians did, to be wrapped like mummies, with or without valuables. According to Moltmann, “not the corpse that we can dissect objectively, but the body with which we identify in life, stands in the life of resurrection hope. There is no meaningful hope for the body we have, but only for the body we are.” It is important to grasp that he understands Jesus’ resurrection to be a physical resurrection, but his theology is built on eschatology, hope found in the resurrected Christ. Buddhism is a negative soteriology, that in fact was the way Buddha understood it. True Buddhism can only be practised in a monastery, where there is no room for material and sexual impulses. I would say that the Jains go even deeper, but will discuss this on another occasion. The problem is that in Buddhism in the end there is Nothing. Who can envision nothingness? We have to undergo countless reincarnations to climb the karmic ladder and rid ourselves of existence. Buddha understood very well what he was saying, but it does not seem that those who call themselves Buddhists and are immersed in the material world do. Physicists say that nothing comes from nothing and nothing goes to nothing. So how do we solve the problem? In my view, the solution lies in the parables of Jesus, which were deliberately meant to be riddles. There is no room for belief in reincarnation here, we have to be truly involved in the quest for God, in truth and in spirit. In Hinduism, in general, where there is reincarnation, a belief that is not essential for the Brahmo Samaj, the aim is to unite oneself with the godhead, which is more in agreement with what Christians hold. There is one saying of Jesus that made an extremely strong impact on Hinduism. It is found in the Sermon of the Mount: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, they shall see God”. For Swami Vivekananda, the founder of Modern Hinduism, just this saying did away with the need for Scripture. As for atheism, that will take us to a long discussion, but I don’t think that there can be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.

There was pressure on Turin in 1988 and there still is today. For the pressure in 1988 see the interview with Father Heinrich Pfeiffer: http://holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/an interview with professor heinrich pfeiffer sj.pdf The pressure today can be seen in your query to Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo. What I mean is that if you, as a “Catholic to the core”, did apply some pressure now, what about the rest in the list? The pontiffs are humans, like the rest of us, and it is hard to believe that their curiosity has not been aroused, although they do not mix up the relic with matters of faith. Good theology has to be based on Scripture, good Shroud theology on what you call “quantification and measurement and evidence.” If not, then it is guesswork and speculation, and that, as you know, living in England,where Prime Minister David Cameron, a practising Anglican who faced attacks last week, will simply not be swallowed..","date":"2014-05-01","mins":"1:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/28/discovery-promoting-shroud-video-on-feature-about-two-new-saints/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Discovery Promoting Shroud Video on Feature About Two New Saints"},{"id":"comment-108085","author":"louis","post":"John, You quoted correctly, it is something similar to what Ian Wilson told me in an interview published in another language in a leading daily some years ago.

I am not defending him, although I can understand his point of view, which is crystal clear in Ian Wilson’s last Shroud book. Who took care of the sampling was Dr. Michael Tite, together with Professors Gonella and Riggi, authorised by Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, a prelate who is said to have been influenced by his Carmelite background, which means is, “there are no material supports for faith.” Gonella and Riggi took a very long time to decide from which site the sample had to be cut, deciding on the dirtiest part of the relic. The rest is known. Yes, the interpretation of the dating should be multidisciplinar, and there are several hypotheses on how it may have been skewed. The Church is willing to conduct a new C14 test, however it appears that the hesitation is due to mistakes made in the past. Now, what happens if the new dating gives a medieval date? Will the clerics feel like returning it to the di Savoia family? It is always better, therefore, to refrain from cutting another piece of the precious relic unnecessarily, more studies and a fresh hands on examination are needed. The papers, including the peer reviewed ones, do not seem to have convinced Turin and Rome. Benedict XVI sent his message to the last Shroud conference held in Dallas, Francis is more bothered about serious issues, the relic is not an article of faith. Perhaps all Christian believers have to act like Carmelites when the need arises, almost all are “brought to the test” at some time or the other in their lives.

The point that was stressed was this:two hands were involved in the inscription.The owner of the ossuary had problems with the government for other reasons, also relating to antiquities. There are two problems here: –Father James Martin is not an authority in biblical studies — Ben Witherington III apparently has an ulterior motive to promote the ossuary. And what is that? He wants to show that Catholics are wrong when it comes to the Virgin birth and he is not a palaeographer. Jesus would not have asked disciple John to look after his mother after he had a brother.

Father Fitzmyer employed the historical critical method in exegesis, together with the other heavweights, Fathers Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy, producing the “Jerome Biblical Commentary”. But what we most need today is a theology that can be grounded both in Scripture and Science: https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What do we know about the Bible An interview with Joseph A.

Will that help people who are sitting over the wall, undecided about whether what the Bible says is true and even about the existence of God? It is difficult to say. Scholars are now ruthlessly adopting the bottom up approach, questioning everything under the sun. Recently a renowned scholar said that no one doubts Jesus’ crucifixion although Golgotha is a myth, while saying that the Exodus was a myth and leaving the door open to the story of Moses that can be interpreted in many ways, all of them leading to Egypt. The big differences arise when it comes to the origin of monotheism. There is no proof of the Exodus, the Josianic conquest, that the kingdom of David and Solomon was as big as described in the Bible. In fact, some scholars have described the two kings as “petty chieftains”. The Temple Solomon built actually used a North Syrian pagan temple as a model. There are very few positive indications in archaeology: https://www.academia.edu/18994343/The key role of Biblical Archaeology in Exegesis An Interview with Professor Israel Finkelstein What happens when it comes to New Testament archaeology? The best scholars, epigraphers and archaeologists I have spoke to rightly dismiss the James ossuary, and although Dr. Dan Bahat, former Jerusalem District Archaeologist, believes that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was the site where Jesus was buried, one or two doubts remain. The Garden tomb, “Gordon’s tomb” — General Gordon was not an archaeologist — does not mean much. Given that the Turin Shroud does not form a part of the Catholic Church’s deposit of faith, believers are ultimately left with Jesus’ post Easter appearances as described in the New Testament. But, what about Scripture as a whole? How did Jesus view Scripture or what parts of it did he judge to be true?

Other biblical scholars, who are also historians, have done this, and it will be the topic of my next review.

Therefore, when you wrote, “it is better that it remains a mystery” in response to what I described as “mysterium iniquitatis”, you agree with me. Let us proceeed step by step: In Islam there is “maktoub”, “it is written” and this is fatalism, which could correspond to some extent with determinism in philosophy and even with Calvin’s predestinatiom. You also say that evil connects with the “Fall of Angels, and the origin of Satan.” We must ask, Who and What is Satan? Is it correct to capitalise “satan” when passages in the Bible do not have an individual in mind? It seems that in these passages it can mean “adversary” and can also be used of human beings. In the Book of Job, Satan is not an evil entity, he has an errand given to him by Yahveh and ultimately the “serpent” of the Book of Genesis becomes “Satan”. There was a change in interpretation as time went by. It must be remembered that Jesus referred to Peter as “satan” and therefore one is inclined to agree with Father Jerome Murphy O’Connor’s contention that the saying ” I saw satan and the angels falling down from heaven” was as a meteor from Qumran that landed in the New Testament. This is possible because some Essenes are said to have joined the Christ movement and I think that they brought the idea of the battle between the “sons of light” and the “sons of darkness” with them. Was Judas an agent of Yahveh or a disciple tempted by Satan? The New Testament leads us to believe that the traitor acted on his own free will, and ultimately the crucifixion was also the will of God.

There is one thing that unites all of them: the belief that Jesus was crucified and buried (dead) in Jerusalem. I am pasting here what was posted on another thread yesterday: 1.August 24, 2015 at 6:16 pm Reply Further to my previous comment, I want to reiterate that no one has been able to disprove the assertions refuting the claim about the burial of Jesus in a location outside Jerusalem made in: https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The Quest for Jesus in Shroud research The claims that Jesus survived the crucifxion is the result of an obsession with monotheism,when people thought that God would not allow any “prophet” to die crucified. We must remember that the New Testament is in many ways a Jewish document, because except for Luke, the authors of the Gospels were Jews. It is for that reason that there is now an “Annotated Jewish New Testament”, a Jewish interpretation and a nice job, not drifting from the Jewish milieu. The Jews never denied the crucifixion. Not long ago the Israeli writer Amoz Oz wrote that guilt was invented in his country 2000 years ago. Lest I be misunderstood, I hasten to say that there can be no accusation of “Christ killers”. The Gospels narratives leave no room for doubts that both Roman and Temple authorities were responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion and death. According the late Pinchas Lapide,who was a respected Jewish scholar and holocaust survivor, the Temple authorities handed Jesus over to the Romans. No Jewish archaeologist or scholar has any doubt that Jesus was crucified and buried in Jerusalem.

Let me take this opportunity to tell you something, where I will not have to mince words since you are a theologian and will grasp what is meant easily. Everyone wants to know whether it is Jesus — who played the central role in history — who is the man seen on the Shroud. If it really is Jesus, what is the message of the Shroud? If the image was formed in a natural manner, what will it tell us? We know what was done to Jesus. It is in the Gospels. Mahatma Gandhi literally broke into tears the first time he saw a crucifix, when he left London, where he was studying law at the Inner Temple, and went to Rome on holiday and visited the Sistine Chapel. It is doubtful if he knew something about the Shroud. If supernatural agency was involved will it answer all our questions? It doesn’t seem so because science is telling us some things that clash with what is written in the Bible. There are things beyond the purview of the Bible and systematic theologians have not been able to answer questions that have been raised so far. We have to “rethink” what is meant by Monotheism. Is that heresy? No it is’nt. We must remember that Jesus said things that made people who heard him realise that he was presenting himself as someone different from the rest of mankind. He has his own views about God, Moses and Scripture. If the Shroud image was produced by supernatural means it will have to conform to these views. Life in the world is getting to be very uncomfortable, more people are now wondering if God exists and where he can be found.

How can you write “Sacred Turin Shroud” if you believe that a hoax is involved, making Jesus the greatest trickster in history? Do you believe that His Holiness will swallow that? Different religions can indeed meet in harmony, and they should do that. But why involve a relic that is still controversial, and which is being interpreted to challenge the belief I mentioned? Is that harmony? No, it isn’t. There are many places where people of different religions can meet in harmony, where there is respect for the differing beliefs. Why do Hindus in India and other places accept Jesus as Avatar, incarnation of God, without ever having heard of the Turin Shroud? They have either read the Gospels or have been guided by the great Hindu sages, many of them saintly men. During my on site research into non Christian sects and religions I have met and spoken to their leaders, whether preachers, priests, witches, wizards, and so on. One of them even told me that he was afraid how God would judge him because he was also worshipping evil entities. I then asked him why he did not stop worshipping them.

I have been a Religion Writer for around twenty years and only comment on science when it involves science theology dialogue because it is not my field. Beyond this, my on site research into very different kinds of sects and religions, sometimes even involving danger, has provided me with considerable experience, enabling me to write what I have to. Why go to Hampshire if one thinks that the Turin Shroud is a forgery? That is understandable if the intention was to meet “Shroudies” personally. A good editor should get as much information as possible before making comments as though he knows the whole story. The “broad observations” are not part of the whole story. No wonder the Pope is ignoring the petitions sent to him..","date":"2015-08-26","mins":"12:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/26/youtube-of-barrie-schwortz-at-ahmadiyya-annual-convention/","cat":"video","title":"YouTube of Barrie Schwortz at Ahmadiyya Annual Convention"},{"id":"comment-209034","author":"louis","post":"Hugh You are not being coherent, so please read what you wrote above. You were defending something about which you did not seem to have a clear picture. Are you sure that this event is unlikely to come to the attention of His Holiness? What is written on this blog is read in both Turin and Rome. Pope Francis is always accompanied by Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, has Archbishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, Chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (with whom you corresponded) to whisper into his ears, has Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia ready when information is needed. Not to speak of those in the Curia who keep an eye on everything and can be tough. So His Holiness would be delighted to read that Jesus was buried in Kashmir? How nice. I am being as polite as I can. I am not being like Stephen Jones, who wants you dismissed as BSTS Newsletter editor. Please be careful what you write there and don’t waste your time signing any petition to Rome if a request is sent to you. The last time a petition was sent to Pope Francis and reported by Dan, with the best of intentions, I told him that it would be ignored. That is exactly what happened and matters are far worse now..","date":"2015-08-26","mins":"1:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/26/youtube-of-barrie-schwortz-at-ahmadiyya-annual-convention/","cat":"video","title":"YouTube of Barrie Schwortz at Ahmadiyya Annual Convention"},{"id":"comment-209055","author":"louis","post":"How do you know what you are saying, David?

So it seems you have not changed direction, only translated a book by Felzmann. Why don’t you offer to translate other Shroud books in German? I am sure many French Shroudies would be interested in reading a translation of “Das Turiner Grabtuch und der Christusbild” by Fathers Pfeiffer and Bulst.
