It only demonstrates absolute ignorance about Jewish customs, particularly during that period, and you can sure that Josephus would have something to say about that and we would know that it was not only James the Just but many others were thrown down from that building’s high walls.

We must remember that the New Testament is in many ways a Jewish document, because except for Luke, the authors of the Gospels were Jews. It is for that reason that there is now an “Annotated Jewish New Testament”, a Jewish interpretation and a nice job, not drifting from the Jewish milieu. The Jews never denied the crucifixion. Not long ago the Israeli writer Amoz Oz wrote that guilty conscience was invented in his country 2000 years ago. Lest I be misunderstood, I hasten to say that there can be no accusation of “Christ killers”. The Gospels narratives leave no room for doubts that both Roman and Temple authorities were responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion and death. According the late Pinchas Lapide,who was a respected Jewish scholar and holocaust survivor, the Temple authorities handed Jesus over to the Romans. No Jewish archaeologist or scholar has any doubt that Jesus was crucified and buried in Jerusalem. It is some unfounded claims that led to the controversy about the place of burial in Jerusalem, but no doubt was expressed about the crucifxion, death and burial in Jerusalem: https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus was not buried in Talpiot   Part III There are claims that some pathologists in Europe have stated that Jesus survived the crucifixion.

It will not convince anyone at the other end that Jesus was buried in Kashmir, despite my article, the link to which is above, on this thread. The centuries that followed Christianity were marked by gnosticism and an obsession with monotheism. We see the results today with non Christian scholars challenging the beliefs of the “Abrahamic faiths”, insisting that new discoveries in science demonstrate that they are wrong. In fact, this began in the eighteenth century, when Sir Francis Younghusband was told by Hindu scholars that the Genesis creation account did not correspond to reality. Freud only concentrated on the Bible’s monotheism in his book “Moses and Monotheism”, and did not take other cultures into account: https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds incomplete speculation on monotheism C.G.Jung went much further, although he was baffled in India when he found that good and evil could exist together with no problems. It is important to remember that in the next few decades there will have to be a science theology dialogue where “what kind of monotheism is there” will have to be discussed. It is wrong to think that racism only existed in some cultures. The Muslim arabs imported black slaves from Zanzibar and the Portuguese are said to have learnt from them. Racism is is there in Israel,in India (with the caste system) and in other cultures and among people of all religions. “The lighter the colour of your skin, the better” is something one sees in all cultures. The British may have been brutal in India at times, but that did not prevent M.Gandhi from being “obsessed” with Christ, to the extent of being accused of being a Christian secretly. He was so influenced by the Sermon on the Mount, that it became the basis of his “Ahimsa” (non violent resistance), that ultimately led to the country’s independence. Christ is generally recognised as avatar, incarnation of God, by the Hindus. They did not mix things up, rejecting Christ because of occasional British brutality. The Jesus in Kashmir story has nothing to do with colonialism, slavery and so on, it is based on religious belief..","date":"2015-08-31","mins":"7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

It is one he himself raised, could not answer, then retreated because it led to metaphysics. Fair enough, it is the right approach, because scientists have to tackle “how”, not “why”.

This blog is not advertising Christianity at all, so much so that sceptics, anti “archmiraculists” like Max, who has made some good contributions, atheists, freethinkers and so on have joined the debate. This would not be possible in those fundamentalist sites and blogs maintained by those who have “Protestant balls”, and regarding these “Protestant balls”, are you Protestant? If not, then it means the approach is like the one adopted by RD, with his anti Catholic diatribe, linked to his old fashioned Anglican unconscious, which, strangely, has not “evolved” for a neo Darwinian like him. It is outmoded in most of today’s Anglican intelligentsia. Remember, Queen Elizabeth II, not the Duke of Norfolk, invited Pope Benedict XVI to visit England. If prejudices are brushed aside and genuine scientific discussion takes place, everyone would welcome it..","date":"2013-10-09","mins":"9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/08/you-guys-are-brutal/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"You guys are brutal"},{"id":"comment-46667","author":"louis","post":"Yes, Max, I know that, and you are needed because of your on site research..","date":"2013-10-09","mins":"12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/08/you-guys-are-brutal/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"You guys are brutal"},{"id":"comment-46847","author":"louis","post":"So pronouncements coming from the British Museum are “ex cathedra”? Have they forgotten about Piltdown Man, Lindow Man and not read scientific literature demonstrating with facts that carbon dating does not have the infallibility imparted to it? Why cut another piece of the Shroud? I have not maligned or slandered any one, only pointed out that there can be errors in science and, as for the “giant conspiracy”, there is indeed a lot more evil in the world than most people imagine. It can work silently, it can be subtle, it permeates every facet of existence. You took the expression “raison d’etre” which I had employed while referring to the BSTS and pasted it to refer to shroudstory and there is no justification for this because they are two very different things. I am not saying that no one has the right to serve as a devil’s advocate in Shroud studies, what was meant is that if the reliable work done in this field is questioned, and only that, then what is the point in having such a society? What will be published in the newsletter? Shroudstory is a very different case, all sorts of views are presented, coming from Catholics, Protestants, Atheists, Agnostics, Freethinkers, those sitting over the wall. When something is said about “special scientific insights that Episcopalians have” it is a personal attack that blogmaster Dan does not deserve, more so because he has been fair in presenting comments from both the pro and anti authenticity camps, and makes it a point to be well informed, not indulging in nitpicking. The blog has improved considerably, eliminating personal attacks, four letter words, offensive comments posted by anonymous commentators and so on..","date":"2013-10-10","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/08/you-guys-are-brutal/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"You guys are brutal"},{"id":"comment-46492","author":"louis","post":"Hullo Colin, long time no hear.

With so much controversy there seems to be no point in cutting a piece of the relic for yet another CD test, not forgetting that there is no guarantee that correct results will be obtained. We will probably have to wait for further developments in science, and as IW wrote years ago, God may have turned down the blinds. If he hadn’t there would be no shroudstory. We humans are finite, there are limits to what we want to arrive at. Stephen Hawking wants to know the mind of God, and decades after Freud we still do not know enough about the mind, and decades after Einstein we still do not know the mind of God. True religion teaches us about the Will of God and that was what Einstein was aiming at when he spoke about God because he knew we will never know the mind of God..","date":"2013-10-09","mins":"10:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/08/you-guys-are-brutal/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"You guys are brutal"},{"id":"comment-46869","author":"louis","post":"There was no attack on Dr. Michael Tite, it was about the role of the BM as coordinator.
