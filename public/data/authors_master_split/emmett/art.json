[{"id":"comment-34900","author":"emmett","post":"I read the on line version of the book then bought a hard copy of the book “Heaven is for Real” by Todd Burpo. It has really touched me. I have a computer copy of the picture “Prince of Peace” that I look at as I say a few prayers. What I am trying to find is a realist picture of Holy Mary” the mother of Jesus. I was hoping to find one by Akiane that has Mary’s full face as that of Jesus in the “Prince Of Peace” is there one available??
