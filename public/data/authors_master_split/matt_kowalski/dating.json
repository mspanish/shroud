[{"id":"comment-192859","author":"matt_kowalski","post":"This debate may be over over precise measurements where no precision exists. The false color photographs are not intended to be interpreted chemically. They are subjective evidence for the non uniformity of the shroud materials, supported by the findings or cotton in the test area. The shape or size of a patch is not at issue. Combined with the historical evidence that dates the shroud to before 1260, and valid concerns about dating ancient textiles (e.g. British museum mummies), the point is that the C14 date is now questionable. More evidence could be found by microscopic study of the sample area, a non destructive test. The coincidence of the 14th century date could just as easily be considered a case of selection bias: the labs got the date they were hoping for, so they ignored the obvious gradient in their results. Any bachelor’s level engineering student could tell us that a gradient means the data is incomplete, and needed information lies outside the test boundaries..","date":"2015-03-08","mins":"9:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"}]
