[{"id":"comment-50247","author":"matt_kowalski","post":"Watching Barrie on EWTN right now. I’ve been meaning to comment on something I learned in engineering school decades ago (Northwestern). When test results give a gradient, such as the C 14 dates of the four sample pieces, any engineer worth his salt would agree the test is incomplete. The C 14 dates smoothly rise with linear location, i.e, C 14 content is a function of vertical location. More tests need to be done beyond the boundary where the sequence ends, or the results are invalid. Because if C 14 is a linear function, the samples are not randomly chosen. (We all know why they were chosen there anyway.).","date":"2013-11-06","mins":"9:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/barrie-on-ewtn-liveand-again-in-repeats/","cat":"event","title":"Barrie on EWTN, Live–and again in repeats"}]
