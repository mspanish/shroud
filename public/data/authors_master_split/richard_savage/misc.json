They change topics constantly. They aren’t willing to actually DISCUSS anything. This shows their blatant dishonesty, in my opinion. You may learn some things by debating them, but it would be a miracle if they learned anything from you – because most of them aren’t interested in knowing the truth. Still, if this is what God wants you to do for now it may be worthwhile. It will certainly sharpen your own debate skills and increase your own understanding of the points involved. Annie, – I am learning a lot, and I do doubt that any of them will change their minds — but then, 1) one of them does seem open minded about the issue; 2) I’m still hoping that I can keep narrowing the focus enough so that we (most of us) can finally agree upon exactly what it is that we disagree about; and, 3) I’ll be able to attract someone to our website where we can reduce their spokesperson to one, and (with a little luck) drum up a somewhat neutral audience. One thing they can’t handle is anything supernatural. And yet the evidence collected so far about the Shroud indicates that something supernatural most likely DID happen in order to imprint the image on the cloth. Maybe you can’t exactly prove it, but they can’t disprove it either. However, they are not content to leave that alone, which is why the Shroud nags at them. And explains why people are able to sell ridiculous books that (attempt) to discredit the Shroud. The Shroud is about Jesus Christ, first of all. If it is really the Shroud of Christ, then the real power in the Shroud is the story of Christ’s Passion. The whole story is THERE, a flannelgraph lesson of what Christ did for us. Yeah. I also expect it to be “supernatural,” but it should give us great pause, whether or not it’s supernatural. An authentic Shroud makes makes Jesus extremely personal. – Any advice will be greatly appreciated, and my email address is rsavage@nycap.rr.com. – Thanks, again. — Rich.","date":"2012-03-27","mins":"8:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/25/a-guest-posting-by-jabba-rich-savage/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by “Jabba” (Rich Savage)"},{"id":"comment-9793","author":"richard_savage","post":"– Thanks, guys.

In regard to doubting Rogers’ honesty (as was suggested in this thread), we have little or no reason to do that. Perhaps he was wrong in his conclusions, but we have no significant reason to doubt his honesty regarding them. It’s clearly possible that he was being dishonest, but the available evidence supports his honesty much more than it undermines his honesty. 2. The scientific processes surrounding the carbon dating were not especially rigorous. 3. Rogers found 3 major differences between the carbon dating (and Raes) samples and the rest of the cloth. 4. In 2005, John L. Brown of the Georgia Institute of Technology confirmed Rogers’ findings. 5. In 2008, a group from the Los Alamos National Naboratories also confirmed Rogers’ findings. 6. Other scientific evidence supports a much earlier date than that concluded by the carbon dating. 7. Historical evidence does also. 8. Carbon dating is not foolproof, and is only part of the evidence. – I’m sure that there are more reasons for doubting the carbon dating results (some of which I probably, vaguely know about).
