He then sprinkled the pollen on the cloth at various points making certain to put a little extra where the crown of thorns was on the head. Not only that, but he dabbed a smattering of limestone near the crucified man’s feet that is only present in Jerusalem. I’VE GOT IT, I’VE GOT IT, I’VE GOT IT!!
