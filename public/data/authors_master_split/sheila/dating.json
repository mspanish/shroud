It’s that they speak louder than we do. We don’t go after them but they’re on a mission to come after us wherever we happen to be. As Frank Turek says, “I don’t have enough faith to be an atheist.” That fellow, Thomas, is confused between scientific evidence which has been continuous since the STRP Team went in, and the writings in the Bible. None of the Scientists’ evidence becomes proof of the Bible. It’s purely scientific–nothing to do with religion. That is until you realize the implication of the Shroud. Scientists do not know how it was imprinted. They do know it was not painted. They do know it portrays a man crucified according to the Roman penchant for torture.
