[{"id":"comment-6933","author":"lee","post":"I had a near death experience also. I was in a car accident at 75 mph. I knew the Lord was with me..”but nothing happened until I said JESUS.” A light came into my car and it was so bright I couldn’t see out of the windshield. I was at total peace. I didn’t here the CD playing and I wasn’t scared. HE spoke to me. He told me ” I allowed you to think you were driving, but I was driving all along. Be yea anxious for nothing.” The car spun out of control across 3 lanes, went up an enbankment and hit a cement block that held up an exit sign causing the windows to blow out and the two front tires to blow. The car stood “90 degrees” up in the air spinning,then landed on the guard rail, sliding about 25 yards on top of it. Then it rolled off and landed on its side. When the car landed, I came back to my body. It was like a video going backwards or something (hard to explain it). Then I heard the cd playing, car running, and people yelling call 911. I climbed out the driver window(which had been blown out) raised my hands in the air and said, “Don’t worry the Lord was with me.” Their jaws dropped. I didn’t have a bump, bruise, or even a headache! I KNOW HE’s REAL! I SAW death looking at me. It was sitting on the hood of my car as a shadow silhouette, waiting for a response of fear, but God had put a partition between us. PRAISE THE LORD!!! Hallelujah!!! He saved me! HIS Love, grace and mercy. LOVE did it for me and will do it for you too. All you have to do is call on HIM, JESUS!!!!.","date":"2012-01-13","mins":"12:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
