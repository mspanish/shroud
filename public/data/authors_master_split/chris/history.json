[{"id":"comment-8800","author":"chris","post":"Yeah, I agree with Dave as well, the preponderance of the evidence points to authenticity. But I also accept that we will never have “proof” because God requires an Act of Faith for most of us. I believe some folks are granted proof for whatever reason (i.e. The Apostles and those who saw the Risen Jesus ascend to Heaven, for them Faith is no longer required because they have seen and know). I also agree with the sentiment that Faith is not compulsory as it is quite clear from the Gospels that God will not abrogate our free will (demonstrated be Jesus instructing His Apostles to walk away from those that would not receive them and the Gospel). It is probably because of God’s respect for free will that He requires an act of Faith from most. Ron’s point about discussion regarding the shroud is spot on. It is a very polarizing subject even among Christians. It challenges folks to the very core of their world view in many ways and people do not like that being touched at all. Most folks, I think, seek validation of their world view and the shroud poses a huge problem for a lot of people comfortable in their outlook, even Christians. This is exactly why you get so much activity on the part of those who hold the shroud is irrelevant or inconsequential. They *need* to believe it’s not real while those of us who have Faith don’t need it at all. If it were definitively shown to be a fake tomorrow it wouldn’t mean a hill of beans to Christianity and it’s tenets. But as long as it is not falsified I believe it bothers some folks to no end because of what it implies..","date":"2012-02-28","mins":"12:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/26/a-rather-silly-blog-with-a-not-sol-silly-shroud-of-turin-lecture/","cat":"history","title":"A Rather Silly Blog with a not so silly Shroud of Turin Lecture"},{"id":"comment-7372","author":"chris","post":"Beautiful redesign!

I have nothing materially to add because I am not read on the matter but I will offer one thought. I thought I read somewhere, and I thought it was in Rogers’ work, that the image on the shroud may not have been immediately visible because it was created through a function of accelerated aging of the carbohydrate coating on the linen. So both the linen and it’s coating started aging but the coating aged faster and produced the image in time. Maybe if it took some time for the image to show up the shroud was merely locked away somewhere and thought of as an old bloody burial sheet. It doesn’t really hold a place of prominence in the Gospels and really is just mentioned in passing when the Resurrection is discovered. I think folks would be most interested in the artifacts of the crucifixion itself. Prior to discovering an image on the shroud maybe it was taboo to show given its association to a dead body. Perhaps if the delayed image theory has any merit to it then it might explain the relation to the sudden change in art. Maybe someone finally opened up and looked at the shroud after a few centuries of being stored away and suddenly discovered the image. Weak I know, but it crossed my mind at one point..","date":"2012-02-04","mins":"8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/04/calling-all-history-buffs-interesting-comments-from-yannick-clment/","cat":"history","title":"Calling all history buffs: Interesting comments from Yannick Clément"},{"id":"comment-16510","author":"chris","post":"As Andy mentioned this is old news.

It is also humble as well and a leap of Faith to say, “I believe in Jesus’ Resurrection and I believe the image left on the shroud is a sign of it”. When we are born the only thing we have is Faith – Faith that our parents will love us and care for us to give us life because we are utterly incapable of doing so for ourselves as infants. It is this same Faith that Jesus has taught us is necessary to come to the Father because in every age there are things that we just cannot know. Perhaps we as humans may never “know” how the image was made on the shroud until the veil is lifted but perhaps, and more importantly, it is a great sign of Love from the Father to strengthen your Faith..","date":"2012-08-10","mins":"8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/10/imagine-the-image-as-part-of-the-resurrection-and-not-the-result-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Imagine the image as part of the resurrection and not the result of the resurrection"},{"id":"comment-28340","author":"chris","post":"Paulette, the narcissist is always right and everyone else is the problem.

Were the positioning too perfect it would be a signal against authenticity. But I think you drew that one green line of the dorsal image too far down. I’m thinking it should be a tad closer to the edge of the cloth (still an asymmetrical orientation). Aren’t the toes visible above that line? Being a smaller image than I’m normally used to looking at you may have included them but I know they are definitely there on the shroud. The toes being present on the dorsal image does make me wonder if the shroud was tied in some way because if Jesus was laying on his back in the tomb, as we suppose, I imagine the cloth would have to have been held up against the soles of his feet somehow in order to get the image. Was there a foot rest in the tomb or was the shroud tied like in the Jackson hypothesis?.","date":"2012-06-04","mins":"11:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/yannicks-nice-surprise-folding-test-on-the-enrie/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie"}]
