He’ll probably need a blood donation as well since he’ll need to include real blood to make a copy. Think of the fame and fortune that will follow now that a real scientist has solved the shroud mystery! As icing on the cake he can find the shroud’s contemporary from the 14th century as well and mock all the other mickey mouse scientists and art historians in the process for not picking up on it sooner.

Rogers proved that beyond a shadow of a doubt. According to all the medical experts that have studied the Shroud, the man enshrouded was without doubt dead. There is absolutely no chance of that person surviving. What’s interesting about the hypothesis that Jesus survived the crucifixion is that it necessarily requires a naturalistic image formation. The problem proponents of this “live body” theory immediately run into is that the image on the shroud does not show the tell tale signs that the man wrapped in it was alive. If he were alive there would be MUCH more image distortion, most especially in the areas of the face because he would be breathing. If a naturalistic image formation process was the cause of the image then you would most definitely see evidence of breathing interfering with that because the exhaust from the man’s lungs would disrupt the mechanism of image formation, especially around the nose and mouth. Plus there’s no image evidence of movement of ANY kind over it’s formation period, which would necessarily be many days. The man would have to remain dead still for the entire period. Also, the blood evidence that remains would negate a live body as the man in the shroud would continue to bleed, especially from the side wound. There’s not enough blood on the shroud to suggest this was even possible, even at rates of flow where the victim was in a coma. And lastly, though not comprehensively, there’s no evidence of smearing of blood from the removal of the body. Had he been alive and got up of His own physical power (or even with the aid of another), even after days, it would be most plausible that there would be massive smearing of blood evidence because the wounds would still be bleeding, especially if the body was moved because it would disturb any clots, especially in the head, wrist, and side wound areas. There’s just no trace of this anywhere on the shroud. Even if anyone intended to fool future generations by carefully removing the shroud I do not think it could be done. But then again, who would intend to do such a thing in the first century. The body wrapped in the shroud was dead..","date":"2012-07-12","mins":"8:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/06/dawkins-challenge-noticed-by-ahmadi-muslim-researchers/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Dawkins Challenge Noticed by Ahmadi Muslim Researchers"},{"id":"comment-8023","author":"chris","post":"It gave me a good chuckle when I read it.

Looking at the Enrie negative in the vertical position I can clearly see the bands on the side of the face run right down into the chest and terminate pretty clearly. I also see them run up past the face (especially visible on the right eye socket) and through the hair up into the cloth where it sort of terminates in a fade. They are not as dark in some places (like the hair) but until we completely understand the image formation mechanism we cannot say for sure why there’s not a uniform variance. But I do see that variance. There is also a band that begins directly above the right eye and travels upward where it seems to terminate in the crown of thorns area. Who knows how large the hanks of linen yarn were? You can’t predict that they will terminate evenly or will produce a certain length of weave. I do think the banding effect is real and that it can be mitigated for to a certain degree. We will probably get better at it as time goes on..","date":"2012-06-08","mins":"12:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"},{"id":"comment-12093","author":"chris","post":"Ron :Chris at one time, I once thought the two areas in question were due too banding until I was made aware of the most likely way in which the Shroud was placed about the face/head area. Here again I cannot stress enough that people view the video I mentioned in my other comment where Jackson demonstrates how most probably the Shroud was bound to the body. R Ron, understood. And I have seen that video too, it’s a great video. There is a lot there that looks like I agree with it, I would even agree with how the head was wrapped. I do think there is a banding effect though as I don’t just see it in the face area but all over the shroud. I think it’s most pronounced in the face area because we as humans tend to focus on that feature and of course, everyone wants to see the face of God clearly. But again this is all just theory and I am open to other interpretations and definitely believe that more research is needed to help further develop answers to these questions. Understanding the image mechanism will probably be what is needed to fully understand. So I accept the possibility of what you and Colin are saying, but as of now I think the banding effect is a more probable explanation.

It might be interesting to conduct further experiments with the nails being driven through the base of the thumb to gather more data on it’s plausibility. I’ll share my thoughts as a layman though for what it’s worth. When I saw the illustrations of the nails through the thumb base I immediately thought it was like hanging a picture. When I drive a nail into a stud in the wall to hang a picture I drive it down at an angle. To me this mitigates issues with the nail coming out of the wall or bending etc. It struck me as reasonable that an executioner practiced in crucifixions may also employ this technique. Is it true that in most crucifixions the victim hung for days before expiring? If that was the common outcome then nailing a victim for the long term might lead an executioner to employ such a technique. As for stigmatas on saints I would not be surprised to find them in areas that the saint perceived to be actual wound sites on Jesus. I don’t think it matters either. If stigmatas are genuine I would find it plausible that God would be working within the person’s perceptions of where the wound sites are. I would think an attribute (exact location) of the wounds is subordinate to the point God was trying to make through displaying them (I suffered at the hands of men, these agonizing wounds until death, to show you how much I love you). It is only through modern science can we more accurately fathom such agony by knowing all the aspects affected. One thing that seems very clear to me is that this subject raises that issue that it would be highly unlikely for a forger to deliberately place the nail marks through the wrist as it would contradict the perception of most of the faithful observers. If the point of a “fake” shroud was to pull in money it would seem to be counter productive wouldn’t it? Doesn’t the controversy within the Church at the time reflect a bit of this? (a 14c Bishop claiming it to be a forgery and to know the forger etc?) Whatever the shroud is it definitely does not fit exactly as folks have presumed it to be over its lifetime.

I think that the sample was too small to really date all that accurately and had a very wide margin of error. I also remember the article stating that the lab involved vigorously denied that this dating ever happened. I vaguely remember reading this blurb and being stunned that anyone would even mention this since the lab denied it. But I always wondered if it was actually true and the lab was just CYA.

Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/textevid.pdf It mentions Rossman’s unauthorized dating of a single thread of the Raes sample in 1982. Half the thread dated to 1200 AD and the other half to 200 AD. It says that Rossman personally confirmed this in a personal conversation with the author. It does not mention margins of error though as far as I can tell. Given the protocol for testing samples during the 1988 official testing one has to wonder what the MOE would be for a single thread. It also doesn’t address any potential contamination of the half which dated to the 2nd century. I could imagine if this were really true why some folks would seriously be knocked over by the 1988 findings. There is also another paper and this one is probably the original paper I read: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf It mentions the above paper and adds that Rossman vigorously denies any such testing took place in 1982 and even states that the equipment was not available at the time. So we have to take the original claim with a grain of salt. CYA means to “Cover Your (A) Derrier”. Meaning Rossman may be trying to avoid a legal situation or other liability created by admitting to an unauthorized CD.
