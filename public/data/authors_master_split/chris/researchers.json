One gets the vague feeling that they may be terrified of the idea of an authentic shroud. It doesn’t matter a hill of beans to Christianity if it’s genuine or a forgery because it proves nothing. I admit though that it’s nice to have should it be genuine which is why people are interested in it and why people study it. This attitude of “you shouldn’t even waste your time doing this because it’s silly” that some skeptics take is frightening. It confirms my notion that they should never be positions of authority, especially in government. Those that present such sentiments presume that they are entitled to determine what others SHOULD be doing. If the shroud is ever properly and officially radiocarbon dated again and if the results bear a first century origin I predict that main argument of skeptics will suddenly shift from “it’s a forgery” to: – “you can’t be certain it’s Jesus’ shroud” – “it’s OBVIOUS that the body was stolen” These are already preloaded arguments you hear from time to time. It’s so sad that some people cannot let others pursue their curiosity in this without getting upset and personal..","date":"2012-01-26","mins":"11:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/25/correcting-joe-nickell/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Correcting Joe Nickell"},{"id":"comment-7137","author":"chris","post":"Interesting read. Reading this does raise a curiousity in my mind of how the hair left any image. I say this because I am of the opinion that it was a natural process that caused the image. I’d have to wonder though if that would also apply to the hair. Wouldn’t it take far longer to start breaking down and give off gases or whatnot? Are gases from the decaying body below the hair somehow affected by the hair causing the image? These are probably all questions that won’t necessarily be resolved until the image causing mechanism is positively identified but they do cross my mind..","date":"2012-01-18","mins":"1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\""},{"id":"comment-7170","author":"chris","post":"I wonder what evidence, if any, would remain on the shroud that it was removed from the body either by: 1. Whomever the shroud was wrapped around 2. By someone else attempting to remove the body within it. Also I guess we will not know exactly how long the shroud draped it’s occupant until we identify the image forming mechanism or is there a way to infer this?.","date":"2012-01-19","mins":"10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/paper-chase-jones-republishes-jacksons-an-unconventional-hypothesis-to-explain-all-image-characteristics-found-on-the-shroud-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Jones republishes Jackson’s, \"An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image\""},{"id":"comment-7178","author":"chris","post":"Thanks for the reply, Yannick, I appreciate it. Just one more question at this time: Couldn’t someone have just removed the body after 24 – 36 hours? Or would this have left some sort of evidence behind? I would think that by that time (which would coincide roughly with the 3rd day after the crucifixion) the blood would be all dried and removing the shroud without disturbing the blood stains would be easy.
