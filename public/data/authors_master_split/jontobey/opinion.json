[{"id":"comment-4268","author":"jontobey","post":"Interesting how people stumble upon your stuff. To be clear, I’m not specifically convinced on how the Shroud came to be, although I have read several books on it, nor was I really alluding to that. However, you could potentially treat a piece of cloth in a way that it could capture an image. (If figure the dynamic range of the shroud is about 1/2 f stop ; )) So by using it as an example I was able to quickly bring an image to mind on an alternative media. It was a metaphorical shortcut. I’m glad you were able to get by that and enjoyed the rest of the blog!
