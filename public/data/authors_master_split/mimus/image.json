What I meant is rather that: (1) it is difficult, or even close to impossible, to get a “nice” 3 D effect using a small 3 D model. The task appears simpler by doubling the size of the 3 D model as there will be more vertical height, therefore more gradation from the scorching; (2) do you have some clear 100x or 200x photographs of the linen fibers of your experiments (hopefully taken with a microscope with possibly different lighting conditions)?; (3) don’t you get a gradual amount of dehydration (and potentially of colors) of the fibers depending on the distance from the model to the cloth? And, by the way, “Anonymous” is clearly Yannick Clement..","date":"2013-11-16","mins":"6:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.
