The most far fetched ideas are given credence (anti matter, neutrons, bilirubin, quantum mumbo jumbo). It’s not science at all. It’s religion with a thin veneer of scientific gobbledy gook. Nuclear scientists and engineers armed with millions of dollars worth of equipment furiously gathering meaningless data when a measuring tape is all that’s needed to show it’s a fake.

Her education is diverse, from the in depth study of religion to pursuing scientific testing of unexplained paranormal phenomena, e.g., the Shroud of Turin, pyramid energies, alternative healing energies, crop circles, and Spontaneous Human Combustion. Benford’s experiences with psychic phenomena are responsible for the redirection of her life into the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. In 1997, she contacted Fr. Joseph Marino, a Benedictine Monk and Catholic Priest at a St. Louis Abbey. Their divinely inspired meeting, and subsequent joining as life partners, served a research liaison that is credited with uncovering vital information leading to the authentication of the Shroud and, quite possibly, proving the existence of the soul. ” It’s all there.

De Wesselow had very strong reasons to label the carbon dating a fiasco.” He had a book to sell. Wesselow was/is an agnostic and his theses was that the “resurrection” was some kind of conjuring trick. The 3 labs dated 4 different samples. The “C14 date” for each of the samples was within a few decades of the ‘actual’ date. Hardly a fiasco. “flat earther”?. No. If future C14 dating, or any other verified and dependable method, shows a 1st, 5th or 6th century date then that will be accepted by the scientifically honest as the most probable date. If dating is authorised in the future (unlikely) I expect the authenticists will be very, very nervous. The shroudosphere will be filled with warnings about the impossibility of carbon testing a resurrection relic. You also said: “The problem is that there is no scientific finding that the Shroud is not the burial cloth of Jesus Christ.”. There is. The C14 testing is solid. The historical evidence ties in precisely with the C14 testing. There is no evidence that the shroud matches burial wrappings of the jews of the time. Jesus probably had short hair. The image proportions are unrealistic (head and arms). The image was vivid when first displayed. There are only 2 aspects of the shroud I find puzzling: 1) Why is it negative? 2) Does it really depict a nail wound in the wrist?

I’m sure there are many cosmologists and physicists who have supernatural beliefs (at least in America) but they keep it separate from their work in science. It’s irrelevant. Shroud “science” is in a different category. It’s akin to creationism. The shroud “scientists” come to the case 100% convinced that a supernatural event happened 2000 years ago – and they are now investigating a relic from that event. My brief readings of their background suggests that if a religio meter was pressed to their foreheads it would quiver at maximum. There is a problem. The one piece of hard science dates it to medieval times at the same time as it appears in the historic record. Never mind. The shroud *scientists” can think up 101 reasons for that being wrong. This is enough for the shroudies. Invisible repairs, thermoplastic coating, carbon monoxide contamination, divine radiation. They can now chatter to themselves about the dating being “debunked”.

When initially set up, it had a radiocarbon subcommittee (composed of Robert Dinegar, Ray Rogers and David Sox), but was not included on the list of authorised tests released on 24 April 1978 by Don Piero Coero Borga of the Centro Internazionale di Sindonologia. A furious David Sox released the list of tests to The Times, which published it on the front page. Coero Borga’s reasoning was that “the Pollen Test has given very positive results with regard to the age and history of the Shroud” and should be extended across a wider area. This is, of course, completely wrong: the pollen can only be used to date the shroud if one assumes that it was in Palestine at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus, a completely circular argument.” The carbon dating is hard evidence. The laboratories were the best in the world. They dated 3 other pieces of cloth as well. These samples had known dates derived from historical and archeological evidence.
