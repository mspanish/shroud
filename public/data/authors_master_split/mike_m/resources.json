Also, Apparently, the paint fell off and we saw the buttocks, yeah right. Is this why some people see the teeth and hand bones? Did the painted skin fall off to expose the skeleton that was painted first? I remember posting earlier the picture of fayoim portraits with paint falling off, Charles response was”what would be left after all the paint has fallen off? Well I can tell you for sure when the paint falls off a positive image you are not left with a negative image, you are not left with anything at all since the background is painted just like the body, both will fall off and you won’t be left with any form.

He has taken the holiness standard to a whole new level (e.g. Committing adultery starts with the heart and eye without physically doing it) ” Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them” What holiness is he talking about?

As Hugh mentioned the frontal knees image (in negative) is the clearest indication that the body image is not affected or smudged by the water stain. It’s very speculative to try to make a scientific conclusion (i.e. The image is removed by water) based on an artistic expression (i.e. Lier Shroud). The importance of Jesus feet has no bearing on why the feet should be visible or not. The frontal feet image is missing because of how the body was wrapped in the shroud. As with any wrapping job, we start with the lower side of the wrapped object and make sure we have enough material, the top side then only gets what’s left of the cloth..","date":"2014-05-17","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/17/paper-chase-the-effects-of-douse-water/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase:  The Effects of Douse Water"},{"id":"comment-121094","author":"mike_m","post":"Mario, why would a water stain obscure?

Even if its not a situation that happened in the gospels but isn’t that what art is supposed to do. The artist is giving us a part of himself too, more like a visual sermon!
