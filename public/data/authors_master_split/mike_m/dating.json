If not you would’ve surely been through different physicians and specialist to find out a solution for your ailment. Any you would’ve discovered that they differ a lot. Even with physical examination, lab tests and X rays. Symptoms overlap for different pathologies and I have seen people get 3 4 different diagnosis from very smart people for a single problem. Barbet and Zugibe don’t have the Luxury of X rays and lab tests., not even physical examination. They work from a photograph, so to claim that if two specialist, working from a photograph, differ on a conclusion prove them unworthy is not fair to either of them. Buckiln said about the injuries depicted on the shroud are ” beyond dispute”, Zugibe said he ” has no doubt at all” and Barbet said its “absurd”. Hugh disagrees, nothing personal but I am going with the experts. 2 back to square 1 where you really like to stay for nothing pro authenticity but enjoys jumping off for any thing anti. The scourge marks, even though they don’t fluoresce, are still very subtle and not visible in normal light. I was wrong to think they were serum, but hey, the argument still stands. Who would paint something invisible except in UV fluorescence photography? Finding the reverse of an assumption doesn’t affect the argument sometimes. Just like when you thought bleached linen lightens with sunlight and it turned out to be the opposite, you admitted you were wrong but then stayed with the same conclusion didn’t you? The same applies here. 3 even when they differ on the details, they agree that this is a real human being that was scourged, crucified and dead. How many dead people have you seen? They have seen much more and they are experts in this field, you are not. 4 what they agreed on is beyond our scope of practice. When someone dies they call the coroner they don’t call Hugh, nothing personal. 5 crucifixions in Mexico.. Hugh, you know better than this. These people are crucified north of 20 times in their life, and counting. This doesn’t compare to what happened to Jesus. This is where I find you jump from square 1 to 10 one way ticket. 6 scourging produce much more blood, when was the scourging done? How many times were the wounds bandaged (with clothes) and reopened how do we assume that we know how much blood would be there? 7 “bloodflow down the arms looks as if it is realistic but probably isn’t” we have talked about Garlaschelli’s paper in detail before, I am not going to repeat it here.

Keep going on in circles until everyone else is bored by endless posts repeating the same garbage until everyone else gives up and stops responding since it’s obvious no one is listening on the other side. And then believe that since everyone else stopped responding he must be right. I think someone has made a spectacle of his stubbornness on this blog and in the process has undermined his own credibility and the case of the shroud’s authenticity too, it’s really sad..","date":"2014-03-16","mins":"3:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/the-computer-hacker-hypothesis-is-short-on-factual-material/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Computer Hacker Hypothesis is Short on Factual Material"},{"id":"comment-125478","author":"mike_m","post":"Paulette, you are right and I warned of this when it first came out. To him I believe it’s a chess game he has to win at all cost. It’s also “his” theory so there is a “me ” factor here. Unfortunately he is stomping the shroud in the process. Last post he took a jab at the reweave hypothesis using the Quad mosaic photos, even though this was not essential to Benford/Marino’s hypothesis,(almost like someone who doesn’t believe in the shroud, he ignored the empiric chemical evidence sited by rogers & others) which was very sad to see from someone like Stephen. And If you disagree, you are not a “true christian” and you have been warned of “hell”. However, In the process, he is acting in a most unchristian way judging & defaming people who can’t even defend themselves since they have long passed away. Very disappointing..","date":"2014-05-29","mins":"8:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/29/the-challenge-for-stephen-now/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Challenge for Stephen Now"},{"id":"comment-74167","author":"mike_m","post":"“Those references came more than xxx years after the events, during a time in which the market of Holy relics was booming!”, isn’t this the same argument used against the shroud?
