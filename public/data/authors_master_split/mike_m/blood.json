But I don’t see how they would’ve left it on Jesus head after wrapping the shroud. It was a symbol of mockery, shame and pain. I personally vote for 4, since its consistent with the totality of the image ( lack of side image anywhere else even when contact blood stains are evident and foreshortening observed on one of the arms and legs).","date":"2014-03-06","mins":"12:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"id":"comment-85462","author":"mike_m","post":"Matthias, I understand your point but I think even if difficult they would’ve done it.

Hugh, I don’t get the elevated arm thing. I thought the nail went through the hands while Jesus was on the ground ( horizontal plain).

The skin is covered with blood capillaries and we see this bleeding with any unfortunate knife accident in the kitchen ( without severing a main vein or artery).

It is not also about the “i” vs “y” both are English letter trying to translate one Arabic letter “ي”. You clearly missed my point back then, and you missed it now again. My question again is this Where does the ” m” stand in reference to the “i” or “y”? It is not a typo, the typo would be choosing “k” or “q” but not where the letters stand with relation to each other. “Black” earth being the Arabic root of chemistry has nothing to do with “standing up” being the Arabic root for resurrection. They are two different words, and you are trying to make a connection that doesn’t exist. But then again, why am I doing this trying to argue my original language with someone who doesn’t speak it and doesn’t listen. Let’s just agree to disagree, and I hope one day you will try to confirm your assumptions with someone who actually speaks the language.

So finally I get it, it was only your OPINION, based on the Fukin Chinese dialect (Dan, I am not swearing, I am using his own words : )) meaning “gold plant Juice” which somehow ties in perfectly with”black earth” from Egypt? Since all these words sound similar they must be related. No mention whatsoever to the root of resurrection “Al Qiyamah” in Arabic (because there is no where on hell It ties in with alchemy) so, Max to establish the relationship goes all the way to china in alchemy but doesn’t touch the root of “resurrection” to which he claims a relation.

Two words are not related because they share three letters. If you believe it then “bloom” plays with “blame”. You have given absolutely no reference to the relationship between the “resurrection” and “alchemy” beside your wild assumption that this must be the case since both Arabic words share 3 letters.
