If the test was done according to a good protocol and performed according to the scientific method, proper controls, proper documentation, peer review, then why not.

I agree with Dan and Thibault. It was very well organized and the speakers were mostly on time. I think the only thing I didn’t like was the lack of Q&A. I think allowing for a 10 15 minutes discussion after each presentation would be very positive. I understand the volume of papers presented wouldn’t allow for that but I think the presentations could’ve been bundled together by subject (e.g. History of the shroud/Mandylion) then followed by a Q&A that covered those presentation. There was some repetition to the extent that some speakers just had to jump over a lot of slides knowing this has been discussed many times before. I didn’t like the presentations that were simply read by someone else, I immediately lose interest in those. My favourite ones were by Russ Breault, he is a very engaging speaker. Also Ray Schneider, A. Silverman, K. Kearse, E. Marinelli, Flavia Manservigi, Dan Scavone, Bob Siefker, J. Markwardt and Offcourse last but not least, Barrie’s shortest talk ever. The discussion forum should’ve been in the beginning of the day because I was very tired by then and didn’t get a chance to contribute. Other wise I was proud to be part of the professional bunsh of shroud enthusiasts who actually were willing to travel to see for themselves the papers rather than trash them from overseas..","date":"2014-10-15","mins":"6:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Thanks All Around"},{"id":"comment-125704","author":"mike_m","post":"Conference website: “After June 1st, the fee will increase to $150”.","date":"2014-05-30","mins":"8:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/30/today-june-30th-is-the-last-day/","cat":"event","title":"Today, May 30th, is the last day . . .
