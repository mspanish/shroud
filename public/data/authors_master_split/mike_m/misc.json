My speculation was based on the recent changes in the Middle East and the rise of renegade ultra extreme Islamic ideology around Jerusalem with their public televised beheadings and so forth. I don’t believe we can tell for sure what John was talking about or calculate the end of the world, like some people do. As Daveb said, it is not for us to know the times appointed by the father. I believe the function of prophecy is to increase the faith when things actully get fulfilled (e.g. The reformation of the nation of Israel after being scattered in front of our own eyes, or our grandparents eyes to be precise) but not to try to claim knowledge of the future or how things will turn out to be. I do like the saying from Akber, some of my best friends are Muslims and I have great respect for them. The more the Christian influence on them the better and more moderate they become.

The question of the shroud being authentic or not is a scientific question not a faith question. As long as we get this right, everyone will be happy. They are 2 different issues. I don’t believe in the shroud because I am a christian. And I don’t believe in Jesus because I believe in the shroud. This is why I can understand the position of the Catholic Church (and my Coptic Orthodox Church, as per my priest) in this matter. The question of the authenticity has no bearing in our faith in Jesus. I understand that the shroud can get people who don’t believe in Jesus to think about believing in Jesus. But ultimately they have to lay down their life to Jesus, praying for the Shroud will not save them. This is why there are Christians who don’t believe the shroud to be authentic, and there are Jews/agnostic/atheists who believe the shroud belongs to the historic Jesus. The importance of the shroud to me though is that it gives me the chance in the 21st century to “behold the man”, to see how much Jesus suffered for me. It is also very dear to my heart that Jesus would leave such an imprint, His true likeness, His Photograph if you will, etched on a piece of linen for us to connect with Him.

I have no doubt it was produced by the body ( not from an external source like an earthquake ) it is photochemical or thermochemical in nature because it is very superficial almost produced in a flash speed (as shown by ENEA’s experiments). It was not produced by fluids coming from the body because it would’ve never produced this resolution of an image. It was not produced by vapours because it is very superficial, and again resolution would be a problem. I don’t exclude a natural phenomena but I think it’s highly unlikely. So when left with a supernatural event I think the only thing that a new team of scientists can do is to continue what STRP did. I.e. New carbon dating of the multiple pieces that were clipped off from several locations in 2002. Re examine the pollen grains from the dust that was vacuumed in 2002, re examine the chemical composition of the shroud vs the side strip vs the C14 region. Reexamine the blood stains, is it really high in bilirubin, is it really there before the image. It would be to validate STRP work, the things that STRP scientists would’ve done if they took a second chance to examine the shroud, what did they miss and what could’ve been done better.

That doesn’t mean this person is emitting some form of radiation! Yannick, I have to disagree with that description. I think it’s even more ridiculous than the earthquake hypothesis. Some verses in the bible can be difficult to interpret (wheather figurative or literal, e.g “a day” in genesis 1) and their exist a lot of debate over those. Other verses are clearly metaphorical or symbolic in nature (e.g. “The lord is my shepherd”) while others are clearly literal (“Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.”) as you can see in the way those verses were written you can tell that it was a literal description of events. The transfiguration event is clearly literal. You see the disciples were “terrified” and they “fell on their faces” even Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah” When I was a teenager I always got stuck on this verse. I would say its in the bible, it must mean something. I totally missed the rest of the verse “For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified”(Mark 9:6) this is not how you write a Metaphore, this is how you write an eyewitness account. Peter basically was saying gibberish and its written in the bible because… This is what happened. This is not because they saw Jesus face showing love to the Father.

The number of people who believe in something has absolutely no impact on my judgement. The question of the shroud’s authenticity to me is a scientific question. I don’t believe in the shroud because I am a christian and I don’t believe in Jesus because I believe in the shroud. To me it’s a scientific question and I believe the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of an authentic burial shroud of the historic Jesus. Like the agnostic scientist Yves Delage declared “If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, an Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection” I don’t believe that 9/11 was an inside job because: 1 there is absolutely no evidence it is an inside job, only speculations. 2 there is a lot of evidence that its not. Confession tapes by the leader and team members of the operation. Training courses for flying but not landing or taking off, testimonies from people who interacted with the perpetrators. Money transfers, video tapes, documents recovered from Afghanistan and Pakistan etc. 3 it makes sense to be a terrorist operation. Islamic extremists are among the most evil people you will ever run to in this life. Absolutely no regard to life.

They get the energy from the word of God.

You rush to the ICU and there he was, standing next to his bed, now do you remember what the man who opened the door looked like or who else was in the room or what was written on the sign outside the door. And if you do remember all these things will your wife who came rushing with you remember the same details. What you see in the Gospels is just that, but they do concur on the basic foundations (the Gospel): 1 Jesus was dead and buried. 2 3days later the stone was not blocking access to the tomb anymore. 3–the tomb was empty. 4 Jesus was alive. 5 there was men/angels in/near the tomb. Mark’s Gospel is always fast paced..not much attention to details, full of actions and miracles. That’s how he wrote, doesnt mean those details didn’t happen. On the contrast, John always had a thing for details, remember he was the only direct eyewitness to those events. Jesus multiplied five BARLEY loaves (John 6:9) Distance rowed….TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY STADIA,” John 6:19) the ODOUR FILLED the house (John 12:3). The weight of spices brought to Jesus’ tomb as about a HUNDRED pounds (John 19:39). SIX stone jars….filled TO THE BRIM (John 2:9). The number of fish caught ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE….etc. Remember also John wrote much later than the Synoptics, probably motivated by the information he had and felt he has more than what people were circulating to tell.. So that’s why it looks at the Gospels from a totally different angle, complementary rather than contradictory..","date":"2014-02-18","mins":"8:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"id":"comment-83239","author":"mike_m","post":"Hi Max, Arabic is my mother tongue and I have to disagree with that one.

And I probably missed a Y after the i. The right word for resurrection is Al Qi Yamah (القيامة). But that proves my point even more. The i Y is before the m (م)and when pronounced its very obvious, where Qimyyah (or more likely pronounce Al Kemiyah)( الكيمياء), the heavy i Y or double Y as you wrote it is after the m(م). I lived in Egypt till I was 27 years old. Believe me, I don’t need to brush up on my Arabic.

I thought it would end there, but you went deeper and that’s when I had to invoke the difference between K (ك) and Q (ق) in Arabic. I think the Etymology of Alchemy is based, as you mentioned, the Arabic word (الکیمیاء) Kimya meaning chemistry, without the need to merg it with (القيامة) arabic for resurrection (from the root of standing up) which I find to be very different in pronunciation.
