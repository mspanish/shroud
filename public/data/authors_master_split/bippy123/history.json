I've come to expect these things from u as completely normal behavior Best wishes to you also ;)For the record , I'm just a peasant who believes in the authenticity of the shroud .Bippy.","date":"2015-02-24","mins":"7:21 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2015/02/locations-of-shroud-turin-shroud.html","title":"\nLocations of the Shroud: Lirey c.1355 - Chamb√©ry 1471: Turin Shroud Encyclopedia \n"},{"author":"bippy123","post":"Stephen don't forget the sturp physicist John Jackson performed a raking test on the shroud and found the folding creases that match a tetradipion.
