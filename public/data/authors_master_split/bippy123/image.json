[{"id":"comment-21257","author":"bippy123","post":"Ok , I have heard some explanations of why there are no side images (because as some claim that spices could have interfered with image formation ) but that just doesn’t jive with me because of the anatomically perfect image that comes forth, and please don’t tell me that who put the spices on the body could have done it in such a perfect way for the image to come out as it did. Remember that they simply didn’t have the time to line up the spices so perfectly in order for the image to have come out with absolutely no side image whatsoever. That turkey don’t jive. As for the image coming from some natural method ( Mail lard reaction amongst others) this is also completely blown away when you consider the smaller secondary image found when they took off the back stitching ). Think about this folks, didn’t Professor Jackson predict this second image in his cloth collapse theory. In my opinion these 2 natural explanations seem to be an opinion of some folks trying desperately to explain the the image formation in a naturalistically way , but as one naturalistic theory comes tumbling down, why not focus more on the unnatural theories. Science is supposed to be the pursuit of truth, not just the pursuit of methodologically natural truth..","date":"2012-12-28","mins":"12:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-21296","author":"bippy123","post":"There are also a few other problems with the theory that the spices blocked a natural image formation on the sides of the shroud. There are even more problems then I previously suspected, as Stephen jones has brilliantly noted on his blog. The more I research into this the more unplausable this theory becomes. Http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john p jackson unconventional.html?m=1 A second problem concerns the directional relationship between points on the body to their corresponding image location on the Shroud. For example, a point on the side of the nose might conceivably be mapped perpendicular to the local body surface, or the local cloth surface where point is imaged, or vertically upwards from the nose point onto the Shroud. After careful study, I have concluded that body points are imaged essentially in the vertical upwards direction for the entire frontal image. This conclusion is further reinforced by noting that there are no side images about the frontal image and particularly in the space between the frontal and dorsal heads. If the image formation mechanism discolored the Shroud according to a principle that projected perpendicular to either the body or cloth surfaces, image shading should have occurred along the sides of the body and at the top of the head. On the other hand, a vertical mapping logically precludes shading in these regions where, in fact, no shading is observed. We cannot, however, argue that the cloth was held away from the sides of the body as an attempt to explain the lack of side images, or that intervening material, such as burial spices, blocked image formation. Lavoie has shown that the blood feature off the elbow in Figure 1 could only have occurred by direct contact of the cloth with the side of the arm. Thus, the Shroud must have been in intimate contact with the body at that location and, yet, no image discolorations were formed there. A similar argument follows from a consideration of the space between the frontal and dorsal heads. Geometrically, the Shroud must have been in intimate contact with the top of the head, as we have shown by enfolding a human body in a cloth model of the Shroud. Again, no image discolorations can be seen there. A hypothetical chin band may explain part of the void, but it is likely not to have covered the entire head and at the same time tuck neatly under the jaw..","date":"2012-12-28","mins":"8:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"}]
