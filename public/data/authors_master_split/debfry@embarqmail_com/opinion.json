[{"id":"comment-28444","author":"debfry@embarqmail_com","post":"Dear Mary Sims, Don’t become obsessed with the birthmark. That is all that it is. And a blood type is just a blood type. Jesus had no children. His bloodtype was Divine DNA given to Him in His mother’s womb by the Holy Spirit. It is something we accept in faith as Christians. Jesus death and resurrection hinges on the fact of Jesus, the Son of God shedding His blood. His blood, being of God, was for the remission of sins(Wiping out our sins completely).Adam had given his dominion over the earth to the devil in the Garden. That is when sin and death entered the world.It was never supposed to be this way. The only way to save us was for God to become a man, take on OUR flesh, and shed HIS PERFECT blood. And He did. He was the only One Who was Holy and the Son of God. When we make Him our Savior (recognizing the act of God’s love of saving us), then we become Righteous to God through Jesus Christ. You never have to worry about being “good enough” because only Jesus was able top live a perfect sinless life, and become our Lamb on the Cross.You don’t need professional help from the world. You just need Jesus, the Lover of your soul. God bless you Mary!
