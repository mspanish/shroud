NOT superimposed. Unless someone actually jiggerred the pixels even I can make out most of the letters. In the you tube presentation the incription has been moved from a vertical position on the right hand side of the shroud face and superimposed accross the face. In the original position it would be close to foot long and two or three inches wide. A: You Tube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd Gn EGC Jua A B: Large facial representation with all the inscriptions superimposed. Http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/big pic shroud turin claim.html 3) The coin evidence is a conundrum. The larger full body enhancements clearly show a ‘bug eyed’ look on the right eye [left side of the shroud]. I used the coin close up enhancement, copied it to my own software, and bingo. Unless someone has jiggerred the pixels, I can easily see the outline of a coin. More importantly, I can CLEARLY identify the coin as a Pontius Pilate Lepton. The Pontius Pilot Lepton from 30 AD [LIZ} or 31 AD [LIH] is a distintive coin. It includes a Lituus that looks like a shepherds crook with a surounding inscription TIBEPIOY KAICAPOC. My enlargement clearly shows the outline of a coin and the Lituus sticks out like a sore thumb. It is in the horizontal position with the Lituus starting at the right side of the image, running horizontally then curving up and clockwise and turning in on itself. Just like all the Leptons I have studied that are for sale on the internet. But here it gets interesting. Whanger claims to observe KAICAPOC includes a misspelling where the K is misspelled as a C. My enlargement clearly shows a distinctive C at about the 8:00 position, with the Lituus horizontal. However, ALL the Leptons I have studied have KAICAPOC starting at near the very top of the Litus and rotating clockwise to near the bottom of the Lituus. Accordingly, I believe Whanger’s ‘C’ is nothing more then a badly executed O or even P in TIBEPIO, given its appearance on the LEFT side of the Lituus. Now it gets even stranger. I have identified an actual Lepton where KAICAPOC is CLEARLY spelled with a C at the beginning. But THAT C is located way to the left of the Lepton. If the Lituus is placed horizontally, as in the shroud, the C in CAIPOC is at the 12:00 possition. Not 8:00. This is where I would EXPECT to find the beginning of the word KAICAPOC, whether with C or K. STILL. If the image was not jiggerred, I clearly found a lepton coin on the right eye with a very distinctive Lituus on it..","date":"2010-04-11","mins":"1:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/01/20/really-more-evidence-that-verifies-shroud-of-turin-is-real/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Really?
