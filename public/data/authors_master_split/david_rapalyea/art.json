[{"id":"comment-8780","author":"david_rapalyea","post":"I’m Convinced I researched The Shroud of Turin up one side and down the other. Even bought a Pontius Pilate Lepton dated [CE 30] on the antiquities market to see if such a coin could have been used to close the eyes of the man on the shroud as some suggest. IMHO it is WAY to small. In addition, I became aware of an apparently surreptitious C14 test that caused a bit of a stir. The institute in question had their lawyers write up a letter explaining the individual in question was not a C 14 specialist, and the institution never owned the mass spectrometer mentioned. So I researched the institution and the model of the mass spectrometer. I am convinced the C 14 test was done, as the individual confirms, but he will not discuss it. The institution has long standing experience with mass spectrometers, and even donated one from about 1968 to a local museum or some such. The model listed was available on the market at about the time in question, and had at least one update. Lawyer talk. Perhaps. If they didn’t own it, perhaps it was leased. Perhaps the model had received the update and was no longer referred to by its original designation. So when I read Heaven Is Real I decided to see if Kiane’s Jesus resembled the image on the Shroud. Bingo.","date":"2012-02-27","mins":"4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
