[{"id":"comment-6205","author":"norm_kadets","post":"It is safe to say, that there is & never will be an artifact that has caused so much debate ! It is indeed a one of a kind. The schroud of Turin is as far as I am concerned the real thing. To me there is more in favor vs. Not in favor as far as being athentic ! If such an artifact can cause such a debate, and stand out so much as far as being such a one of a kind item that it than leans towards being the ovious and that is IT IS REAL !!!! Maybe someday, some how dna could be taken from the schroud and compared with other items that are said to contain some blood of our Lord. Again, YOU have look at it as it is , a one of a kind nothing else like it !!!! Front, and the back— of a man— who was whipped, crowned with a crown of thorns, Nailed to a cross, stabbed into his rib !!! The nail holes— where they should be , especially as far as the wrist vs. The through the hand debate. The image shows, just how much agnoy was felt and just how much blood letting was experienced ! There is no other supposed relic that shows so much detail of how our LORD suffered !!! I wonder if when the final days do come if in fact, in a phyisical sense the shroud will react and or be come some how be a phyisical sign that Christ is now about to come !!! A beacon so to speak !.","date":"2011-12-27","mins":"10:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/10/02/was-jesus-left-handed-as-evidenced-by-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Was Jesus Left-Handed as evidenced by the Shroud of Turin?"}]
