[{"id":"comment-133","author":"ray_schneider","post":"We are certainly still in need of information to answer Brad Gore’s question. What we know is that the samples taken in 1988 dated to 14th century. We also know that the samples had a position dependent age gradient which may be due to random differences in the calibration of the AMS laboratories or may be due to some property of the sample that caused a position based variation in the amount of C14 present. We don’t know which. Finally we know that the sample contained anomalous cotton which is not commonly present in the shroud as a whole and so indicates that there is something clearly unrepresentative about the sample site. Some suggestions have been that the site was the site of a 15th century sample which was taken and the area invisibly rewoven using French invisible reweaving technology. This suggestion has been criticized, but not eliminated from consideration. Samples of threads from the sample are give a positive test for vanillin while shroud fibers in general do not, again indicating that the sample area is anomalous. So while there is not particular reason to doubt the 14th century AMS result (although there are statistical problems) there is quite strong reason to doubt that the sample was truly representative of the shroud as a whole. There is also quite a lot of other data which calls into question the 14th century result. However much of that data is historical in character and somewhat fragmentary. The Pray codex, the report of Robert de Clari from the 4th crusade and other historical data suggests the shroud is much older than the carbon date. So until a more statistically satisfactory, multi site test is conducted the date we currently have seems to have been generated on a non representative sample.
