From my Degruy ancestors chateau in the Orient Forest (locus of le Ray (Lirey) Shroud of Turin Chapel) was the intelligence behind Chartres and Notre Dame Cathedrals and the most admired man of his time. The Grand Orient Lodge of the Freemasons originated in the neighboring from de Gruy Chateau which is fitting because the Knights Templars originated in this Orient Forest. This neighboring Chateau Vendeuvre sur Barth was owned by the Duke of Luxembourg in exile and general Montmorency (close friend of our ancestor count Michael de Gruy(ere) and his cousin King Francois I) / our De Gruy Chateau Magny Fouchard was very old and because the Count of Gruy(ere)’s mother was a Vergy (shroud owners from de Ray) I believe this explains their presence in the Orient Forest. (Their original Castle / Chateau is in Switzerland at Gruyere’s and they were the first Knights over the walls of Jerusalem in the first crusade explaining their friendship with Othon de La Roche de Ray importer of the Shroud to de Ray Castle at Ray sur Saone in Burgundy…Hugh de Payens head of the Knights Templars (Gruy were Templars) lived west of Troyes (Orient Forest) and was also friends of the Count de Gruy(ere) / it is important that general de Gaulle retired near Clairvaux Monastery and the de Gruy Chateau as he was very devoted to the Merovingian kings (Dagobert) and considered restoring France to that heritage ( he flew the Templar Flag of Lorraine and a 50 ft high cross of Lorraine was erected near his house after he died / Fulcanelli was the owner of “the Bookshop of the Marvelous ” in Paris where all the Alchemists met plus my De Gruy ancestor who studied medicine in Paris and whose Foucher wife related him to Victor Hugo’s Foucher wife and we know Hugo saved Notre Dame Cathedral from destruction w/ his “Hunchback” books popularity ….
