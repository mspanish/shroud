Episcopalian no one shall no the hour or day of Christ’s Return. I believe you might of taken the “The End of World” article wrong. No, we our not like Harold Camping and his teachings. Maybe I should of written the Title “The Return of Christ”. We do believe that Christ’s Return is near and that He his about to change the world for the greater. As of now prophecies and Trumpet our being full filled right front of our eyes. One of main Prophecies that has occurred was the return of Israel in May of 1948. We are living in the Generation which shall see the Coming of Jesus Christ. So I hope we have cleared the “The End of the World” Blog. Thanks Episcopalian, Keep on Posting Shroud of Turin News.","date":"2011-08-22","mins":"8:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/21/the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-end-of-the-world/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Shroud of Turin and The End Of The World"}]
