[{"author":"creationistic","post":"Hi Stephen,How do you weigh passages in The Bible with all of this science and carbon dating?It is my understanding from various passages in The Bible that the shroud is unlikely to be the burial shroud of Jesus, especially in looking at Jhn 20:7.\"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\"There are other issues as well that would lead me to believe that this is not the burial shroud of Jesus.I confess that I am neither a theologian nor an expert and it is clear that you have done much research into this area but I see some things that appear to be contrary to the belief that the shroud is in fact His.Thanks!.","date":"2007-11-23","mins":"2:31 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2007/11/tsot-bibliography.html","title":"\nTSoT: Bibliography \"A\"\n"}]
