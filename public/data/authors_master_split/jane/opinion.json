[{"id":"comment-42498","author":"jane","post":"I am A neg, my husband is B pos. Our child is AB neg. This is because my blood type is either AO neg/neg or AA neg/neg. His blood type could be BB pos/neg or BO pos/neg. That’s how you get a child with AB neg blood. You get one factor from EACH parent. AB is NOT passed down from one parent. If you believe in such things, the only time AB was passed from mother to child was when Jesus was born, since we’re assuming God the Father neglected to contribute a blood type. Any totally human child of Jesus or Mary (with Joseph) would have either A or B passed down from Jesus or Mary and A, B or O contributed from the other parent. Blood type would not confirm a genetic link to Jesus or Mary. You would need mitochondrial DNA for that..","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"11:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"}]
