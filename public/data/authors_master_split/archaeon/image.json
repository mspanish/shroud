I can see how the draping over the body with bags of spices can possibly lead to lack of side images. However the dorsal and ventral part of the head is one continuous sheet. If there was something that was blocking the image formation, there would be a space between the dorsal and ventral image. If there was some sort of vertical mapping image formation, I would still think there would be a space between the dorsal and ventral images. The sides are free of this restriction..","date":"2013-07-11","mins":"9:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/07/topic-of-the-day-7-vertical-mapping-of-a-human-form/","cat":"topic_for_today","title":"Topic of the Day (#7): Vertical Mapping of a Human Form"}]
