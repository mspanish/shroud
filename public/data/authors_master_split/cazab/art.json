[{"id":"comment-18100","author":"cazab","post":"According to Timothy E. Gregory, the first coin with the broken nose was made between 692 695. A strange coincidence is that Justinian was mutilated by having is nose cut off in 695, and called “Rhinotmetos” (the slit nosed). A wild guess would be that this coin was not made between 692 695 but just after, however on the reverse of the coin Justinian’s nose is not broken. Unfortunately Gregory mentions and shows the other coin from the second part of the reign but does not explain clearly the reasons of this change in iconography.
