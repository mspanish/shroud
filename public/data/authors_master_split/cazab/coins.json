Ok, we obtain a global score of 0.4. But when you read Fanti, Maggiolo, 2004, I see no unexpected differences between the correlations of the fs and the bs. (table 1, p.499). 6 anatomic details (on 8) have a score higher than 0.6 ( for Ghiberti 2002), 5 on 8 for Enrie and Cordiglia, with a score up to 0.91!
