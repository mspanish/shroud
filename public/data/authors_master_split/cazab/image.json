[{"id":"comment-11461","author":"cazab","post":"Crichton is dead wrong: consensus is not “a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled.” Consensus in science is needed because it tells us where the evidence leads for experts in the field. For example in history the consensus in scholarship is that Jesus really existed and was not a mythical figure. But a tiny minority of minors scholars disagree. Scholars do not say “our consensus is the ultimate truth” but just this where all the data and our line of reasoning lead. In science, the consensus in scholarship is that quantum particles do exist. But some major scientists and philosophers of science (van Fraassen for example) disagree. There is a debate the matter is not already settled. But maybe Crichton just confuses “consensus” and “paradigm”..","date":"2012-05-20","mins":"4:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/19/a-parenthetical-change-in-the-valencia-consensus/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Parenthetical Change in the Valencia Consensus"},{"id":"comment-32866","author":"cazab","post":"Unfortunately for Lee Krystek, Jacques di Costanzo has changed his mind: he is now convinced that the Turin Shroud is not a work of art….","date":"2013-05-04","mins":"6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/04/a-mysterious-work-of-art/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A mysterious work of art?"},{"id":"comment-4662","author":"cazab","post":"Thanks.

Abstract : “The Shroud of Turin is a well studied linen cloth bearing the image of a naked man that has been beaten, scourged, and crucified. A lesser known, smaller cloth exists, the Sudarium of Oviedo, which contains bloodstains corresponding to the head wounds, both front and back, found on the Shroud. The Sudarium bears no facial imprint and has been proposed to represent the face cloth (napkin) mentioned in the gospel of John (20:6–7). Here, the markings on the Shroud of Turin and the Sudarium of Oviedo are reviewed, and the possible relationship between the two cloths and their impact on faith is discussed.” http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14746700.2013.750962.","date":"2013-02-03","mins":"7:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/03/be-sure-to-read-the-comment-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Be sure to read the comment by Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-3128","author":"cazab","post":"And I hope that at least one researcher is going to mention Fazio’s last article , accepted for publication in Radiocarbon Effects and Defects in Solid (April 2011) : “Stochastic distribution of the fibrils that yielded the Shroud of Turin body image” Abstract : The fibrils that yielded the Shroud body image show a stochastic distribution on the Linen of Turin. In fact, the probability of a fibril yellowing is a function of the energy, while this is not the case for the optical density value. This means that the above image is a latent image. We suggest thermal radiation or low temperature chemical processes as possible natural energy sources to explain, by stochastic effects, the Shroud body image formation. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the phenomenon, we are not able to extract the energy source.

I have downloaded the article, and for sure it’s a must read : clearly written and informative. But there is one thing that puzzles me.
