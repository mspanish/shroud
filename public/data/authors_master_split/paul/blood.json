[{"id":"comment-15493","author":"paul","post":"Off topic maybe .the mechanics of a crucifixation. Relying on a statics class from a long time ago here are some thoughts on the forces in play on the body of crucified man.To put maximum pain on the body the arms need to be nailed straight out with no slack at all and where the nails have no give towards the end of the hand. This will become apparent. I am sure the Romans were aware of this since they were experts in pain. Assume the body weighs 160 lbs a fbd (free body diagram) of the forces on the nail in the wrist at an angle 15 degrees of the crossbeam and the arm when the body slouches would be 80 lbs straight down and a force pulling by the arm of 309 lbs which equals 80 lbs divided by the sine of 15 degrees or .2588. So each arm is feeling a pull of 309 lbs, also assuming a 72 inch arm span each arm would be stretched 1.22 inches which equals 1minus the cosine of15 degrees times 36 inches assuming no stretch in the shoulders but all in the arms. Note as the body slouches more, the force pulling on the arms decreases but the stretching has to increase. This may explain why some people have commented that the arms seem too long; for normal arms are not long enough to cover the genitals which I seemed to have read somewhere.","date":"2012-08-26","mins":"9:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/standing-ovations-all-around/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Standing Ovations AllÂ Around"}]
