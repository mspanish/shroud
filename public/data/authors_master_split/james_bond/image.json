The two most common explanations of the Shroud are: 1) It is a forgery made between 1260 to 1390 AD, based on the C14 dating, probably made in northern France, and 2) It is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus from about 33 AD. Note that several of the above items are inconsistent with the Shroud being a forgery from the Middle Ages. A forger would not have known to: Place invisible serum rings around the blood exudate of the scourge marks. Add pollen to the Shroud that is unique to the Jerusalem area. Add pollen around the head that is from a plant with long thorns. Put a microscopic amount of dirt in abrasions on the nose and one knee. Put bilirubin into the blood. Locate the nails in the wrists or fold the thumbs under, contrary to paintings from the Middle Ages. Put microscopic chips of limestone from Jerusalem into dirt near the feet. Use a stitch unique to the first century to sew the three inch wide side strip to the main shroud. Create a negative image with 3 D information content in the image. Create an image based on a change in the covalent bonding of the carbon atoms in the cellulose molecules..","date":"2017-10-30","mins":"2:01 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/pro-authenticity-shroud-investigators-should-have-considered-the-body-image-as-a-simulated-sweat-imprint-before-rushing-to-their-pseudoscience-resurrectional-incandescence-etc/","cat":"bas_relief_face","title":"Pro-authenticity Shroud investigators should have considered the body image as a SIMULATED sweat imprint – before rushing to their pseudoscience (‘resurrectional incandescence’ etc)."},{"id":"comment-10181","author":"james_bond","post":"Okay, well model a Shroud indistinguishable from the real one since you’ve all this six year experience with flour and sweat and your little models..","date":"2017-10-30","mins":"1:30 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/pro-authenticity-shroud-investigators-should-have-considered-the-body-image-as-a-simulated-sweat-imprint-before-rushing-to-their-pseudoscience-resurrectional-incandescence-etc/","cat":"bas_relief_face","title":"Pro-authenticity Shroud investigators should have considered the body image as a SIMULATED sweat imprint – before rushing to their pseudoscience (‘resurrectional incandescence’ etc)."},{"id":"comment-10172","author":"james_bond","post":"Again I say: Make a shroud just like the ST and I’ll be a believer.
