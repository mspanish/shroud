One would need to assume that the potential exists for a categorical answer, which is questionable*. Let’s assume it did. I’d be like you in reverse. I’d bet a trip to Turin on authenticity, that’s for sure, I feel more confident than a very nice meal out. But I’m not confident enough to bet my car or house on it! *What would define “categorical”? It would certainly be harder to support the authenticist position if a further c 14 test (with exemplary methodology and execution) came up with a date circa 1300 1400 AD. But would that be categorical? Possibly, although not necessarily. If that occurred, I’d probably come to the view that on the balance of probability the Shroud is a medieval creation..","date":"2014-12-01","mins":"2:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/29/a-guest-posting-by-joe-marino-if-another-c-14-test-is-ever-done/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Guest Posting by Joe Marino:  If another C-14 test is ever done . . ."},{"id":"comment-174049","author":"thomas","post":"Excellent Thibault, please call the Pope!.","date":"2014-12-01","mins":"2:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/29/a-guest-posting-by-joe-marino-if-another-c-14-test-is-ever-done/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Guest Posting by Joe Marino:  If another C-14 test is ever done . . ."},{"id":"comment-174044","author":"thomas","post":"“I understood what you said,that is why the supranormal phenomena was mentioned.

Firstly what was the medium of creation, that then left the shady remains we have now? Evidence suggests paint isn’t an option. Secondly, why the display of buttocks? I’m sorry, but that remains a massive problem for your theory. There is very little chance that an item for public devotion would have showed the buttocks, rather than the usual modesty protecting loin cloth.
