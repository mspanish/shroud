The incredible difficulty that skeptics and non skeptics alike have today in explaining a “fake it and flog it” theory really does seem problematic. Not necessarily fatal, but close to. I still maintain there are a lot of other difficulties too. I maintain the lack of loin cloth is still an issue if this was an artistic creation. Yes I know I know there is the odd nude Christ in the 1300s / 1400s. But it’s pretty rare statistically. And as far as I can recall where it does occur it’s in pretty discrete artistic circumstances (as opposed to a possible creation with full and frequent public viewing in mind) To what extent, too, would a medieval faker go to the sort of ultra realistic lengths we see on the Shroud? No loin cloth? Blood trickles / smudges OFF the soles of the feet? Side wound that is neither a tidy little slit or an incredibly runny stream down the abdomen (these were the two artistic conventions of the time) Trickles of blood across the lower back that have absolutely no historic artistic precedent… It’s the cumulative difficulty of all these different factors, amongst others, that means the medieval faker theory seems to me problematic.","date":"2015-07-14","mins":"11:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"id":"comment-205540","author":"thomas","post":"If we are to consider the Shroud as an ingenious medieval creation, then we should also consider the historical context, which may explain its creation (but also does not dismiss the notion that the Shroud was authentic and “brought out of the cupboard”). That is, France was a shambles in the mid 14th century. It was poor, heavily diseased, and defeated. Display of the Shroud might have served 2 purposes – lifting spirits, and earning money. It’s display may well have been cynically opportunistic, too ie. The masses are suffering big time, they need hope, what better hope than seeing Christ’s real burial shroud (with image and blood wounds to boot), and by the way we’ll get a few coins from every visitor. Then, if it was a mid 14th century creation, within that historical context would its faint image “make sense”? As Hugh states, a stronger image would have given more hope in a hellish time. Yet, a faint image with wounds could allow the masses to better empathise with Christ’s sufferings.Remember the Black Death had been rampant killing millions in France alone.Also, note the German art of the time showed Christ heavily wounded, so there was historic parallel. As Colin says, the Shroud could be seen competitively in this way ” OK you’ve got the veil, but he we’ve got the full burial shroud, with both frontal and dorsal images of Christs, AND with blood wounds” But as I say above, there’s nothing to dispel the idea that an authentic Shroud was opportunistically taken out of the cupboard.

(refer my posting above) That is certainly conventional doctrine. But if we put that aside, and permit the possibility of the existence of God, then I can’t see any logical problem with the notion that God may not be all powerful. I agree that there is nothing stopping the notion of God not being all good. In my opinion though, I think it more likely that God is not all powerful but IS all good. Just a belief, but also based on personal experience where I’ve experienced what I think is divine grace. I do believe in a ‘force’ (for want of a better word!) that permeates this world – God – that is the source of beauty, peace and goodness. Maybe this notion of God allows for a God that aspires towards the realisation of all these qualities and more but doesn’t always achieve it (ie. Not all powerful). I don’t believe in a God who only answers some prayers. I do believe in prayer though! – but not in the sense of ‘ask for and be granted/not granted’! more of a meditative sense of prayer. This notion is not far removed from that put forward by some Theologians who view God as the ‘Ground of Being’ rather than as an objective interventionalist being. I sympathise with the philosophical problems of a God who is all powerful, and am not particularly sympathetic to the standard apologist responses. But as noted above there are definite alternatives, beyond only atheism.

This image will naturally vary depending on the muscularity of the individual. In me, the slope of the trapezius is not as steep or as “bulky” as my brother, who is anatomically similar but works out at the gym a lot. To my eye, the image on the shroud is of a man who is not excessively muscular, but has generally quite well developed muscles. Whether such muscle development is consistent with the notions we have of Jesus???? If he did a reasonable amount of physical labour, then maybe its consistent. “the shape of them from the front does not match their shape from behind” A: This is explained by the tenting that occurred on the frontal image but did not occur on the dorsal image. Also, the trapezius muscle is basically flush with the back, but not with the front of the body. As your images show, there is not symmetry in the trapezius image between left and right sides. On the side where the top of the trapezius image is set slightly “lower”, there appears to be a correspondingly lower setting of the arm and hand on the same side on the frontal image. Maybe coincidence. Maybe not. I favour the view that it is not coincidence. A further comment :I’ve just noticed on Shroud scope the lack of scourge marks just below the neck on the dorsal image.

I’m yet to hear any convincing skeptical theories, however. Colin B has done some interesting experiments but has not (at least yet) come up with a bulletproof theory. I’ve done a lot of thinking over the last couple of years of alternate theories. About 2 3 years ago I thought of a genius alchemist working with substances and bas relief / statue. I also thought of the Shroud also being linked somehow to a flagellant in the mid 1300s eg. Maybe the shroud was used to temporarily cover a dead flagellant. But that still raises the question of how the image may have been formed, if it did cover a dead body (whether medieval or from the time of Christ). I’m far from convinced as to the Maillard theory. There’s plenty I don’t know and am happy to admit it. But I am very confident the image was created by an imprint. I don’t subscribe at all to any notion that the image was painted, such as advanced by Charles Freeman.Because the qualities of the image are certainly related to body / cloth distance. I don’t cling religiously to faith in The Shroud – it helps support my faith, but I’m very confident my faith would not fall apart if the Shroud was convincingly shown to be a medieval creation. As it stands, I think at present the collective evidence across disciplines notwithstanding the carbon dating – points to a date significantly earlier than the 1300s. I could still be convinced by a medieval imprint theory, but I’m waiting… In the meantime – and yes it’s unscientific – I believe the image was created by the miracle of the resurrection (and this explains the late carbon dating date). I don’t advance any radioactive theories etc. The resurrection being a miracle defies scientific understanding, so logically if the Shroud image was created by the resurrection then the image making process defies human explanation.
