But from what I know they are usually in a symmetrical or at least artistic pattern, not the assymetrical / non artistic patterns seen on the HPM. And they are usually a lot larger than the tiny holes we see on the HPM. De Wesselow who is an EXPERT in things art historical supports these views (which I would note I have personally held for years).Please explain your objections to this. – Please explain why, if the object is a tomb lid, that there are two red lines which look very much like depictions of blood. Note these are next to the central cross filled area of the object which I interpret as symbolising the body image on the shroud (which if true would have blood to just one side of it, and L shaped holes just to the other side of it, like the Shroud.) I don’t know of any precedence for a blood covered tomb lid. – If the cloth on top of the object is the Shroud, then it is very small. The artist is not that gifted, but I’m sure if it was the Shroud he would have made it look closer to full body shroud size. Rather it appears to be the size of a face covering cloth, in which case as per John’s Gospel account we would also expect to see the Shroud. And in fact we do here, because it is the object you think is the tomb lid. And the notion that the cloth is the head cloth is also suggested by the floating image of Christ’s head nearby.

A) “May naked Jesus on the HPM be be derived from TS? Yes.” No. A figure derived from a supposedly genuine image of Jesus must look a bit like him. Specifically, it must have a full beard and a moustache. If it doesn’t have those fundamental identifying characteristics, it cannot be considered the same man, regardless of the pose or the nudity. No. An artistic representation is always that – a representation. Especially in terms of an “artist” with the obvious limitations of the HPM artist, there will be limits on his ability to represent the shroud. Also it is not at all obvious that the Shroud Man’s beard is full and long. TO me, it is not really a big full bushy beard. Remember too that we have the benefit of digital enhancement, and photo negative, which they obviously didn’t have in the 1100s. B) “May 4 fingers, without thumbs on both hands of Jesus on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.” No. Byzantine pictures often show people with no thumbs, but it was not until I studied David Mo’s selection that I realised how many. A third or so of his images show Jesus, and often others, with no thumbs. If the Pray manuscript may derive from the Shroud, then so may all the other Byzantine people with no thumbs, which is absurd. This is a good challenge. But I don’t think you can so categorically say “No.” C) “May cropped Jesus legs on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.” No. For a start we don’t even know if the image is cropped, and for a second the fact that both shroud and feet are cropped does not demonstrate any kind of connection between the Shroud and the Pray image. I consider this very far fetched indeed. I agree this isn’t the most convincing attribute. But again I don’t think it can necessarily be dismissed. I guess the artist may simply have run out of room and not planned the image properly D) “May zigzag patern on HPM represent herringbone weave on TS? Yes.” No. I’ve explained why not, and do not need to go into it further. Again, your categorical dismissal is unjustified. E) “May two red smudges on the rectangle on HPM represent blood belt on TS? Yes.” No. The blood belt on the shroud shows interlacing lines, the Pray lines are alongside each other. It is inconceivable that an artist would represent interlacing lines with parallel ones. I disagree with OK that these represent the blood belt. But I DO think they represent blood on the shroud, either in a generic sense, or possibly with reference to the streaks on each of the two arms. Absolutely no compelling alternative explanation has been put forward. “I don’t know” is not compelling. F) “May the four L shaped circles on the HPM represent poker holes on TS? Yes.” No. They are not on the Shroud but the Tomb. Again, unjustified dismissal. No convincing evidence has been presented arguing what these non decorative circles could otherwise be. I must say, the extreme views on both sides of this debate are rather frustrating..","date":"2014-06-26","mins":"8:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-133028","author":"thomas","post":"Ok then let’s imagine.

Pre 1500s burns the poker holes are conspicuous, indeed the most obvious feature on the shroud. The blood strikes a chord particularly the two prominent streaks on the arms.

I believe skeptics are looking at the Shroud and the HPM with 21st century lenses. They need to change to 12th century lenses. Firstly, picture what the shroud might have been like in the 1100s, if indeed it did exist then. It didn’t have the burn marks. It quite possibly had the poker holes. It quite possibly had the blood. I’ve seen the shroud with my naked eyes. It is far less defined than what we see in photographs. In fact I would call the image somewhat ephemeral, appearing more or less defined depending on the distance from the object. Keep all these things in mind when you form your 12th century image of the Shroud: faint ephemeral image, conspicuous poker holes, no burn marks, conspicuous blood marks. Does the HPM image then start to make more sense? An indisputable FACT is that the “3 Marys” image on the HPM contains PLENTY of symbolism. This is demonstrated at the very least by features such as the head next to Mary’s right arm, and the floating character. This symbolic approach differs from the literal artistry of other images in the HPM. It’s as if the artist is saying: “The resurrection and its representation must be mysterious”. In this light, I see no problem in seeing a cryptic allusion to the shroud in the object we’ve all been debating: faint image represented by central crosses, framed on one side by two wavey red lines representing the blood, and the “L shaped” poker holes on the other side. If the artist was a senior cleric who visited Constantinople, then it’s no leap of faith to think that he might have seen the Shroud, and might then have been deeply impressed by it. It’s not then a big leap to think he might have alluded to it in his picture.

I also don’t agree with Dave B’s comments on it’s so called wavy edges – I think the artist has tried to portray a straight edge but has got it slightly wonky. I’ve never been convinced that the pattern represents herringbone weave. I had previously been of the view it might more generically signify weave. I’ve changed my mind.

The 16th / 17th century depictions had the sole purpose of portraying the Shroud, often for expositions. The HPM artist was portraying the empty tomb scene. Consistent with the biblical narrative he needed to show the left behind shroud. He didn’t need or want to show the fully laid out Shroud with all its detail. Of course, if he had recently seen the Shroud in Constantinople, and seen its very prominent blood stains and “poker holes” (pre 1500s fire) – he might have had reason to at least reference those, especially if they held some symbolic significance. Refer this link below. Note how the poker holes seem to hold less significance as time moved on.

Some of these are seldom discussed: 1. Just look at the top image. I really think it is so representative of the image of Christ that we see on the Shroud. Naked, positioning of limbs etc. 2. Red mark above the eye? Really just a coincidental mark? 3. Shapely, almost feminine thighs? Another coincidental similarity? 4. High chest 5. Along with the asymmetrical 4 circles / holes, skeptics need to explain the two red streaks on the lower image. I think it is totally insufficient to just ascribe these as some sort of random decorative features. Neither make sense from that perspective. 6. Skeptics claim continuity with artistic tradition but there are several departures from artistic tradition (as mentioned above). A very curious departure is the ‘floating head’ next to the sleeve of one of the women, seemingly connected back to the shroud via a floating letter / symbol. I really don’t know what this symbolises – I can hazard some guesses. At the very least, it shows a lot of symbolism in the mind of the artist – this artist is not one who simply wishes to convey literal depictions. This is very important when considering potential meaning behind the PM. Points 1 4 can be argued as co incidences. I accept that. Points 5 and 6, in my opinion, cannot be so easily dismissed.
