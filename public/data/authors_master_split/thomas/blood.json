Without exception, as far as I am aware, 14th century depictions of Christ showed the wound on his RIGHT side. Of course, a wound on the right hand side of a real body (or a statue), would create a contact image that shows it on the left hand side of the body on the cloth. Which makes me think your theory is wrong, and that the Shroud is either authentic, OR it was created to fake Christ’s imprinted burial shroud via a contact printing mechanism. The nakedness remains a massive problem for the ‘fake’ theory, and for your theory, too..","date":"2015-11-01","mins":"1:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/30/bob-rucker-a-burst-of-radiation-did-three-things/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Bob Rucker:  A Burst of Radiation Did Three Things"},{"id":"comment-200406","author":"thomas","post":"Thought for the day.

Sorry that’s gobbly gook Hugh. Miracle not necessary for belief in the resurrection? True, I guess, if you believe in the resurrection in a metaphorical sense. But I think the NT is pretty strong testament to the resurrection being much more than metaphorical (although it obviously encompasses meaning). Sampath is right – if you believe in the resurrection as a literal event then it is perfectly conceivable that the Shroud image would have been created by that event.

Just seem too good to be true. Too neat. Something often not contemplated by anyone – because in the world of Shroud debate it usually seems to be a black or white, pro authenticity versus anti authenticity conversation – is that the body image and perhaps some of the blood stains might be authentic, but some of the blood stains were later added. I see no fundamental problems with the theory of this idea…. It goes like this: – Shroud is authentic. Image is authentic plus perhaps some of the blood stains – At some point in the Shroud’s history, extra blood is added to align with the developing artistic tradition of the crucified and wounded Christ.","date":"2015-10-12","mins":"1:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/11/was-jesus-body-washed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Was Jesus’ Body Washed?"},{"id":"comment-212344","author":"thomas","post":"I agree Sampath. The “burial” was not a burial. It was a very temporary and hasty deposition prior to the proper burial rites that were planned for the Sunday. So if the body wasn’t washed, that’s problematic for the pro authenticity argument for things like the scourge marks which rely on the body washing…unless…if Christ was on the cross for several hours following the scourging, could not the blood across the back have dried but then some sort of slightly raised welts then left imprints on the Shroud as Christ was carried in the Shroud to the tomb?.","date":"2015-10-12","mins":"4:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/11/was-jesus-body-washed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Was Jesus’ Body Washed?"},{"id":"comment-187363","author":"thomas","post":"Exactly. I’ve always felt some of the ‘blood’ marks look far too ‘tidy’…especially on the arms, head.
