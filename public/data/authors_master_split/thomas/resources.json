It’s an interesting question in itself as to why different artists did or did not represent certain features on the Shroud. Only a couple show the “blood belt”. Most don’t. Why? Who knows. Maybe because this was not seen to hold spiritual significance, like the “classic” Jesus wounds. Some show the “poker holes”, others do not. Interestingly, earlier (pre fire) depictions seem more likely to represent the poker holes. Quite possibly this is due to the fact that they would have been a most conspicuous feature prior to the fire.

Far more likely that the loin cloth was just added in to the artistic impressions of the Shroud. I think its also a huge assumption to say that because the artistic impressions show the image boldy that this means that the real Shroud image was much bolder. It may have been bolder, but “that much” bolder? Far more likely, again ,that the images are that bold because the artists wanted to clearly demonstate the image.

You argue in the article that the artistic representations from the late 1500s – bold and clear as they are – suggest the Shroud image was much bolder at that time in the 1500s, and has since faded. My point was that the Lier image – made in the early 1500s – is clearly suggestive of an artist trying to represent the faint image that we still see today. Do you disagree? If so why? I think its pretty clear that the Lier image is trying to represent the faint Shroud image, with its various accents. Therefore the much bolder images of latter dates are not bold because the Shroud image was once much bolder and clearer. Rather, they simply indicate a lack of skill or interest on behalf of the artists in trying to represent the faint image. Ie.

The 1516 depiction is by a skilled artist who has as well as anyone depicted the subtle light and shade of the Shroud including the non imaged areas eg. Behind knees. 1568 is less skilled but not bad. He’s shown the head – notice it’s not faded away – more prominent ly than the body just like the Shroud but not as subtly. Maybe because of lack of skill maybe for effect.","date":"2014-11-10","mins":"2:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/09/dear-charles-freeman-re-the-famous-arnolfini-portrait-by-van-eyck/","cat":"article","title":"Dear Charles Freeman, re the Famous Arnolfini Portrait by Van Eyck"},{"id":"comment-170312","author":"thomas","post":"“Clearly impressed”….even today we can see the image, even if it is faint.

Similarly, many of the blood stains on the shroud display NO artistic styling – eg. Side wound, wounds on feet, small of the back etc. One could argue that SOME of the blood wounds do – eg.
