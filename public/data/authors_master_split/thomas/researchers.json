Otherwise you are like a lost sheep.” I don’t agree, I think it is quite obvious that the Gospels are a mix of fact and fable, or literal description and figurative / metaphorical text. There is a lot of research to back that up, and it would seem that generally speaking it is Christians of a fundamentalist nature who would believe every miracle story in the Gospels is literally true. There are some who quite convincingly argue that the Virgin Birth is myth. I’m agnostic on the Virgin Birth. I think it could be myth, or literally true – or both. Because I believe in the resurrection, as a supernatural event, I believe it is logically consistent to consider that another miracle at the START of Christ’s life COULD have occurred. I think it’s a logical fallacy when Christians who believe in the resurrection (unless they believe it in some ‘metaphorical’ sense) say they cannot believe in the Virgin Birth because of its supernatural nature. Having said that the Virgin Birth stories have a lot of mythic qualities. But that doesn’t mean the whole story is myth – maybe it really did occur but was embellished within a mythic framework. I think the resurrection stories are similar, especially Matthew’s account which seems to be embellished with legendary elements..","date":"2015-11-11","mins":"4:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"The Process of Resurrection"},{"id":"comment-94103","author":"thomas","post":"This is nonsense.","date":"2014-03-28","mins":"2:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/27/mark-antonacci-on-local-st-louis-television/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Mark Antonacci on local St. Louis Television"},{"id":"comment-206999","author":"thomas","post":"David Mo – the question is not necessarily whether or not medieval artists depicted Jesus with crossed hands and thumbs hidden. Of course, some did, But from my recollection it was always logical from the point of view of perspective. If the Shroud was painted, given it was a frontal perspective, one would tend to think thumbs would be shown, although that cannot be certain. Of course, a painting is not likely at all. However, if – as is far more likely to be the case – the Shroud image was created off a relief or sculpture, then it could make sense that the thumbs were not imaged as on the top hand the thumb would sit away from contact with the cloth..","date":"2015-07-31","mins":"3:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-103739","author":"thomas","post":"I was about to suggest the same.
